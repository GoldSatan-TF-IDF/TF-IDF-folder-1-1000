justinian harry turtledove justinian is that you brother elpidios no wait dont speak i know its you for i recognize your step i may have had my eyes burned out but my ears see for me now and as the saying goes a robe is revealed in advance by its border so in the same way the stride reveals the man you should fix the strap on your left sandal its loose and flaps when you walk have you got the book with you ah there it goes down on the table turn to the first leaf i pray you justinian is gone from men these past twenty years as long as ive been blind but not all his deeds were wicked and many of those that might be reckoned so were on such a scale that they deserve to live in the memories of men too i knew he had been working on the tale of his life for years writing every now and then as he found a few minutes leisure when the end came there at damatrys he put it into my hands i got caught soon enough afterwards of course and blinded i remember how red the irons glowed when they brought them to my eyes i remember the smell like the baked white of an egg they were merciful in their way helias could have struck off my head he thought about it lord knows instead he had me brought here and his men let me keep the book read now brother elpidios read if one day you write the chronicle of days gone by of which youve talked so much let what justinian did and said have its place there and if not thats as god wills the tale is worth the hearing either way by god and the virgin i swear it whats that yes of course you may ask me questions by your voice youre young and even if you had my years theres much here you didnt see much here you couldnt know so ask and if every now and then you find me interrupting unasked i pray you forgive me for old men will talk and blind men too when i speak back and forth with someone for that time its as if i see his face in my mind i dont know how close the face i see matches the face that is but for me it must do so read now brother elpidios read book a i am justinian emperor of the romans oh they stole the throne from me once they mutilated me they shipped me off into exile they thought fools they were done with me but i came back and they have paid how they have paid and they will go on paying too so long as one of them is left alive the empire is mine and i shall keep it i was born to rule i could not have been more than four years old when my father the fourth constantine and the fourth generation of the dynasty of herakleios to rule the roman empire sat me on his knee and said do you know son why we named you justinian no papa i answered up till that moment i had never imagined my name had been given for a reason it was just what people called me i will tell you then he said you could hardly see his lips move when he talked so luxuriant were his beard and mustachios they say his father constans was hairier yet i do not know god never granted that i see my grandfather rebels on the western island of sicily murdered him the year before i was born my father resumed do you know who the first justinian was i shook my head i had never heard of anyone but me with the name now i was jealous for i thought i had it all to myself he was an emperor too my father told me he was a great conqueror and a great lawgiver if you can be like him when the time comes for you to take the throne you will make the family proud that is why we gave you the name to give you a mark to aim at if i said i knew then what he meant i would be lying but i already knew there had been a great many emperors of the romans so i asked when did this other justinian live my father muttered under his breath and counted on his fingers at last he said the first justinian died fortyfive years before your greatgreatgrandfather won the throne for our line from phokas the monster the usurper good people will remember me instead i said for he has been dead a very very long time i tell this without embarrassment as i said i had but four years then my fathers mouth opened so wide i could see not just his lips but his teeth and tongue and the back of his throat as well he laughed loud enough to make two servants come running in to find out what had happened he waved them away when they had gone he said that is not such a long time son not as we romans reckon it the first emperor augustus was six hundred years dead when herakleios beat phokas more than six hundred fifty years now the number was too big to mean anything to me i had learned to count to twenty using my fingers and the toes that peeked out of my sandals under the hem of my tunic to help me along i did not know what it meant to be a roman to live with the memories of all those years cloaked around me the next spring the arabs came to constantinople when i was a boy i knew old men who said that when they were young no one at the queen of cities paid the arabs any mind or had even heard of them how the roman empire wishes that were true today herakleios my greatgreatgrandfather beat back the persians after years of desperate war and restored to jerusalem the piece of the true cross the magians and fire worshipers had carried away when they conquered the holy city god rested on the seventh day herakles i suppose rested after his twelve labors herakleioss labors were greater by far than those of the pagan greek but did god who had himself rested allow my forefather any rest he did not forth from the desert from the abomination of the desolation the arabs swarmed like locusts they had always been there i suppose tent dwellers nomads lizardeating savages but in herakleioss time the heresy preached by their false prophet mouamet made them all brothers and sent them out aconquering and herakleios who had celebrated the return of the holy and lifegiving wood to jerusalem now had to take it up once more and bring it to constantinople for the roman empire was weak after decades of war with persia and had not the strength to withstand the onslaught of new invaders palestine and its holy city were lost and syria and egypt with alexandria beside it and if we romans were weak the persians were weaker still and had fallen into civil strife after their war against us failed the arabs conquered them one and all and they have remained under the rule of the followers of the false prophet until the present they would have done better to leave us alone the great herakleioss son herakleios constantine my greatgrandfather ruled but a few months he suffered from a sickness of the lungs poor soul may god have judged him kindly when he died he left behind a young son my grandfather constans but the great herakleioss second wife martina sought to raise her son heraklonas the halfbrother of herakleios constantine to the throne in constanss place she and heraklonas got what usurpers deserve her tongue was cut out his nose was cut off and they were sent into exile on rhodes they stole my throne they cut off my nose they exiled me they treated me as if i fifth in the line of the great herakleios had no proper claim to the throne how i treated them i shall tell in due course to return to my grandfather in his reign we romans fought back against the arabs in every way we could we sent out a fleet to reclaim alexandria by egypt from them though it remained in roman hands only a year before the deniers of christ took it back and it has stayed in their possession ever since from egypt the arabs swept west toward carthage and the lands surrounding it lands the romans had regained from the vandals during the reign of the justinian for whom i was named that was one of the reasons constans went to sicily where he met his death he used the island as a base from which to assail the arabs in their movement against carthage and while my grandfather lived carthage stayed in roman hands how it was lost again will be told in its own place even before this time the arabs curse them had done a thing the persians never did in all their centuries of war against us romans they took to the sea endangering the roman empire in that new fashion like all the line of herakleios constans my grandfather was a man who believed in going straight at the foe he assembled the roman fleet and met that of the arabs off the coast of lykia the southwestern region of anatolia before the two fleets joined battle my grandfather dreamt he was in thessalonike he told this to a man who knew how to interpret dreams asking what it meant and the mans face grew long and he said i wish you had not dreamt this dream as i have said i never met constans but i can imagine the fearsome glare he must have given the fellow why he would have growled the man who could interpret dreams had courage for he answered with what he saw your being in thessalonike signifies give victory to someone else for that is the meaning of the words you would do far better emperor not to engage the enemy tomorrow my grandfather went out and fought the sea battle anyhow he christ and all the saints brother elpidios thats herakleios and those who sprang from him right there in a sentence they werent always right but they were always sure so justinian could see that in his grandfather could he too bad he never could see it in himself go on go on i pray you i did say id break in from time to time go on fought the sea battle and was defeated indeed he was almost killed the arabs boarded the imperial flagship one brave soul there stripped the robe from his back and pretended to be him while another helped him get across a narrow stretch of sea stained red with roman blood to a dromon not under such fierce attack both those heroes died but constans came back safe to constantinople the arabs might have moved against the queen of cities then but they fell into civil strife in the fourth year of my fathers reign though the deniers of christ readied a great expedition and in the spring of his fifth year they came we romans had not been idle my father learning of the arabs preparations ordered our shipwrights to work straight through the winter building and refurbishing the vessels upon which along with the great walls of constantinople our safety depended on learning the foes fleet had set out from kilikia where it had wintered and was bound for the imperial city he and his brothers the two junior emperors herakleios and tiberius my uncles in other words decided to hearten the workmen and sailors at the proklianesian harbor and they took me with them when i think back on it i am astonished by how much i remember of the day the sights the sounds most of all the smells of freshcut wood and rope and pitch perhaps i should not be surprised till then i had spent most of my time with my mother the empress anastasia and with the women of the palace now i was decked out in miniature robes of deep crimson for i was a prince myself and borne along in a sedan chair right behind those my father and my uncles rode i kept peeking out through the curtains to see as much of the city as i could the proklianesian harbor lies on the southern side of constantinople just east of the harbor of theodosios the largest of the citys anchorages it is not a harbor for merchantmen or fishing boats war galleys lie there i had never seen dromons before they were long and lean some with one bank of oars some with two the bronze rams they carried at the bow were green and pitted from the sea some had gray or purplered patches of barnacles growing on them the dromons carried wooden towers amidships from which archers could shoot down at the decks of enemy vessels each had sockets for masts before and behind the tower but the masts were not in place now i had never seen or heard such men as those who worked on the dromons and would presently sail them either the sun had burnt them near as black as ethiopians are said to be and sun and wind and spray carved harsh lines in their faces some of them wore wool or linen tunics that did not reach their knees others just a cloth wrapped around their loins commonly with a sheathed knife on the right side when they saw me they smiled and pointed and called to me i remember how white their teeth were against beards and dark faces i also remember how much trouble i had understanding their greek compared to what i heard in the palaces it was clipped and quick hardly seeming the same language at all my father and uncles had no trouble with it in fact when they talked with the sailors they dropped into it themselves i had never heard them speak like that before now of course i too talk like an educated man among clerics and accountants and like a sailor among sailors a party of workmen came up the docks past me my father and my uncles some of them were carrying bronze tubes not seagreen like the dromons rams but bright and shiny the color of a freshly minted fortyfollis coin others bore contraptions of hide and wood after a moment i recognized them as bellows oversized cousins to the ones the cooks in the kitchens used to make their fires burn hotter i pointed to them what are those for will the sailors blow on the sails with them to make the ships go faster my father my uncles and everyone else who heard me laughed i knew then i was wrong that made me angry i stamped my foot and screamed as if i were being made a eunuch my uncle tiberius turned to herakleios and murmured constantine should clout him when he acts like that herakleios nodded my father did not notice the byplay even though i was screaming i did i screamed even louder just to annoy my uncles the more my uncle called to a swarthy hawkfaced man who walked along behind the workers with the tubes and the bellows attend us kallinikos the swarthy man approached and bowed very low first to my father then to each of my uncles in turn and last of all to me i was surprised enough to quiet down how may i serve you emperor kallinikos asked he was an educated man i could tell that at once yet his greek had a guttural undertone i had not heard before since the arabs burst out of the desert syrian accents have grown scarce in constantinople tell the prince justinian my father said pointing to me why these men are fitting our ships with the devices you have invented of course emperor kallinikos bowed first to my father and then to me he did not bow again to my uncles i liked that to me he said prince these tubes will project out across the water and onto any ship that comes close to one of ours a liquid fire that will cling and burn it up how is it made i asked kallinikos started to answer then hesitated looking to my father who said we should not speak of that here on the docks where so many men can listen the making of this liquid fire is a secret and we do not want the arabs to learn how it is done do you understand he spoke gravely i nodded as he had intended he had taught me a lesson that secrecy could matter not only to a boy but to an emperor i have remembered my father went on kallinikos here being a good christian man he made the sign of the cross as did my uncles as did i as did kallinikos himselfcame here to the queen of cities from heliopolis with his invention not wanting it to fall into the hands of the followers of the false prophet all at once he looked quite grim and soon we shall see just how much use it is to us too two years before the arabs had captured smyrna on the western coast of anatolia and kyzikos which lies under mount dindymos across the propontis from constantinople to serve as bases for their assault on the queen of cities when full spring brought good weather and reduced the chance of storms on the narrow sea between kyzikos and constantinople the deniers of christ sailed up and laid siege to our godguarded imperial capital with my father and my uncles i watched from the seawall as their fleet drew near i had never seen so many ships in all my short life they seemed to cover all the water of the propontis i pointed out to them see how the oars move back and forth like a centipedes legs i said i had smashed a couple of centipedes in the past few days good weather brought them out as it did the arabs theyre like centipedes in another way too my father answered if they bite us we will die out ahead of their fleet rowed dromons much like ours save only that they lacked wooden towers amidships faint over the water i heard for the first time the chant their oarsmen and soldiers repeated endlessly allahu akbar allahu akbar what does that mean i asked my father god is great he answered absently he was paying more heed to those oncoming warships than to me our own dromons put out from the proklianesian harbor and the harbor of theodosios to meet them a great cry rose from the men and women watching on the seawall god with us christ with us the virgin with us they drowned out the chant of the arabs the patriarch john held up a holy icon of the mother of god one made by divine hands not those of men and now this leo the one whos been ruling us these past fourteen years he calls icons graven images and says we should smash all of them you ask me only a man with the mind of a jew or a saracen would say such stupid things no doubt you reckon me a foolish old man brother elpidios but i doubt youll argue with me there come to that justinian and i met this leo before he was so much of a much i wonder what my master will have to say of him i know brother each thing in its own place read on the sea breeze played with the patriarchs robes gorgeous with cloth of gold and pearls and jewels and fluffed out his great white beard after my encounter with kallinikos i looked for our dromons to breathe out fire like dragons and send all the ships of the misbelieving arabs to the bottom at once that did not happen of course life is more difficult than it looks to little boy s the arabs dromons sprinted toward ours their oars churning the water to a frothy wake behind them the other ships of the deniers of christ made for the thracian coast south and west of constantinople some roman war galleys broke through the screen the followers of the false prophet tried to set between them and the transports carrying arab soldiers my father my uncles i john the patriarch everyone on the seawall screamed in delight when a dromon rammed a fat merchantman right amidships the dromon backed oars after striking the hole it punched in the other ships side must have been huge you could watch the merchantman wallow and start to sink heads bobbed in the water sailors and soldiers trying to swim for their lives the archers aboard our dromons must have had fine sport with them and sent many souls on to eternal torment but my fathers exultation did not last it is not enough he said they will gain the shore in spite of all we can do he was right from the suburb of kyklobion less than a mile from the golden gate at the southern end of constantinoples double land wall to the town of hebdomon four or five miles farther west the arabs beached their ships and swarmed ashore onto the soil of thrace peering west and a little south i could make out some of the nearer landings at that distance the deniers of christ in their white robes reminded me of nothing so much as termites scattering when the piece of rotten wood they infest is disturbed out on the sea the fight between the arabs dromons and our own went on from their towers amidships our bowmen could shoot down onto the decks of the enemy war galleys and the arabs could not reply in kind little by little we seemed to gain the advantage but that was not what i wanted to see where is the liquid fire i demanded and then louder where is the liquid fire tiberius and herakleios looked at each other i suppose they were hoping my father would slap me across the face and make me be quiet if he tried i vowed to myself i would grab his hand and bite it i had done that before and drawn blood mostly though he indulged me which never stopped irking my uncles and why should he not have indulged me i was then his only son i indulge my little son tiberius the same way someone told me what happened to tiberius there at the end he was just like his father at the same age only more so do you know that story brother elpidios you do all right take no notice of an old mans maunderings then where is the i was screeching now like a cat when somebody steps on its tail but a rising cry of wonder and delight from all along the seawall made my voice sound small and lost my father pointed out onto the sea of marmara my eyes followed his outthrust finger there in the water not far out of catapult range from the wall a dromon full of the deniers of christ was burning flames licking along the deck and smoke billowing up from them oh mother of christ it was beautiful the arabs on the dromon ran about like men possessed trying to put out the fire they were not chanting their accursed allahu akbar anymore they were screaming in terrified earnest and as i watched them do their best to douse the flames i understood why for water helped them not at all one of those who followed the false prophet lent strength no doubt by fear picked up a great hogshead and poured it down onto the fire it did not quench the flames instead still burning merrily they floated atop the barrelful of water and where it stopped they stopped too starting new blazes in those places when the arabs perceived that their screams redoubled they might have learned as much merely by looking down to the slightly choppy surface of the sea where more fire floated indeed our dromon the one that had projected the liquid fire onto the arab warship had to back oars quickly lest the flames on the seawater cling to it and make of it a pyre to match its foe my father cried out in a great voice fifty pounds of gold to kallinikos to whom god granted the vision of this wonderful fire all the people on the seawall cheered like men possessed danger was not banished from the queen of cities far from it but we took new heart from having a weapon our enemies could not match a few minutes later my uncle tiberius shouted in a voice that cracked with excitement look another galley burns and sure enough the liquid fire was consuming a second arab dromon that victory was not complete however for our galley did not escape the liquid fire on the water and also burned some of its sailors swam to the base of the seawall where the soldiers and people of the city let down ropes to rescue them others poor souls drowned perhaps the deniers of christ had intended landing marines at the base of the seawall along with the darts the catapults on their dromons could have hurled such an assault would have stretched our defenses thin they might have been able to make and then to take advantage of a breach in the land walls but if that idea had been in their minds the liquid fire put paid to it their war galleys drew back from our fleet and from the walls of the imperial city protected by god they made for the thracian coast there to guard the arabs great flotilla of transports from our dromons seeing the arabs galleys withdraw the men on the walls burst into cheers weve beaten them some cried others shouted out a latin acclamation still used in the city tu vincas constantine i looked to my father proud like any son to hear him praised i expected him to show he was proud too and to show delight in the victory the romans had won over the barbarians but his long thin face remained somber weve not won the war he said perhaps more to himself than to anyone else weve survived the first blow nothing more i pointed out to sea where those burning dromons still sent up thick pillars of smoke and where the wreckage of other vessels most of them belonging to the followers of the false prophet bobbed in the waves our own warships protected the seawalls like a pack of friendly dogs guarding a farmhouse look father i said maybe thinking he did not know what we had done he looked then he looked westward where the arabs were still swarming off the vessels that had reached the thracian shore now the battle begins he said my father was right the followers of the false prophet had not labored so hard nor come so far to flee when their first assault miscarried it was to be four years before constantinople saw the last of them from april till september the arabs would attack the land wall or roman troops would sally forth from it to raid their encampments at kyklobion sometimes they would catch the raiders before our men could regain safety then often they would kill them before our eyes to put us in fear sometimes our men would return in triumph with prisoners and booty i remember them singing as they led dejected arabs up the mese from the wall to the forum of constantine our headsmen put some of the prisoners to the sword to avenge our own butchered men others were sold for slaves even besieged our merchants would not turn aside from profit the deniers of christ should all have been killed they kept their war galleys busy on the sea of marmara thanks to the liquid fire and thanks to the towers on our dromons that gave our archers the advantage over theirs they quickly grew reluctant to fight great sea battles as they had done when they came forth from kyzikos but they were always out hunting for merchantmen and because they were known to be hunting few merchantmen put to sea deprived of much of the harvest of anatolia that normally fed it the city became a hungry place i did not know hunger how could i i was the emperors son having made its acquaintance since i must say i do not regret missing the earlier introduction but if those years when the arabs besieged the imperial city were empty of bodily hunger for me they were full of the spiritual hunger of loneliness when the weather began to grow chilly toward the end of the first september of the siege the arabs withdrew from their camps on thracian soil sailing back to kyzikos to winter there we rejoiced though even then we expected they would return with the spring like migrating birds and near the time of christs birth my mother presented my father with a second baby boy he named the boy herakleios partly because that name had been in the family for generations and partly i think because he had just made up his latest quarrel with my uncle of that name and wanted to put a tangible seal on their reconciliation herakleios proved a weak and sickly baby which was an omen for the reconciliation as well bearing my little brother left my mother weak and sickly too and even for an empress of the romans with eunuchs and wet nurses and other serving women to attend her should she lift a finger a new baby sucks time as greedily as it sucks milk in looking after little herakleios my mother all but forgot about me my father with the weight of the roman empire on his shoulders already seemed to have forgotten and so by the time i had six years i did whatever i chose for who besides my father and mother would tell me no often i would gather up a couple of excubitores and with them as escort go atop the seawall to watch our dromons and those of the arabs clash on the sea of marmara the excubitores never protested when i put them to such work why should they they were imperial bodyguards and i was the emperors son therefore their duty included guarding me aristotle could not have made a clearer syllogism when the warships did not put to sea i sometimes had my bearers carry me to the land wall so i could peer down at the arabs vainly trying to break into the godguarded imperial city i even went out to the lower outer wall once when word of that got back to my father he remembered me long enough to forbid it that only made me want it more the bearers as was natural stood in too much fear of my father to give in to my wishes and withstood even my fiercest tantrums so did the excubitores that wounded me to the quick they were fighting men could they not see i wanted to put myself at the forefront of the battle when tantrums failed another boy might have tried wheedling not i i had a different plan one morning on the inner wall i turned to the excubitor standing alongside me and complained im too short to see anything from the walkway lift me up to the top of the forewall myakes the forewall running between crenellations is perhaps a foot thick and a little taller than a mans waist it is so high it need not withstand stones from a catapult or the pounding of a ram but only give cover to archers behind it myakes frowned he must have been thinking about something else and only half heard what i said what was that little goldentop he asked using a nickname the excubitores often gave me myakes little goldentop brother elpidios yes justinian was blond so was his father come to that the house of herakleios sprang from armenia thats true but as soon as they got out of armenia and found there were yellowhaired women in the world they started swiving them why constantine once told me old herakleios himself had a bastard boy by a visigoth from spain and let her name him athalaric after her own father she must have been a beauty or good between the sheets to get away with that oh quit spluttering brother if you dont hear worse from justinian later on than you just have from me ill be much surprised that i will justinian if you want to know the truth he reminded me of nothing so much as a cat his face was long that was true of everyone in his family i saw and of the others too if their coins dont lie but it narrowed sharply from the cheekbones down so that he had almost a womans rosebud mouth and a pointed little chin and he was graceful too even that young he always held his body just so tightstrung you might say justinian lift me up i repeated i want to see whats going on out there myakes frowned but did nothing else to me then he was a man grown he was mantall with a peasants broad shoulders and broad face he carried a spear taller than he was and a shield with christs holy labarum painted on it x p i could make up my mind in an instant why could he not i did not realize two things being but a boy myself for one though my father and uncles like me decided and acted all at once not all men matched my kin in that and for another myakes was scarcely more than a boy himself despite height despite shoulders when the sun shone on his face you could see his cheeks and the outline of his jaw through the beard that sprouted there a sure proof he had not long been able to raise it thus inexperience and uncertainty also made him hesitate at last after what seemed a very long time but probably was not he laughed and said well why not not much to see but what there is you can he leaned the spear and shield against the forewall and picked me up i could tell at once how he had got to be an excubitor for he was strong as a bull he might have been lifting a mouse not a boy i felt i was flying as he set my feet on the forewall he kept a grip on my waist but only to steady me not to hold me tight i had counted on that i twirled away from him and ran along the forewall saying as i went promise youll take me to the outer wall myakes or ill cast myself down between them right now i looked down at the outer wall there perhaps a hundred feet in front of me it was quite handsome bands of stone alternating with brick the same scheme the inner wall used i have always had a good head for heights i was not frightened or giddy but i remember thinking how far down the ground looks myakes stared at me come back here little goldentop he said dont make foolish jokes he spoke the same kind of clipped elided greek the sailors in the proklianesian harbor had used i understood it better now from more exposure i am not joking i told him and i was not had he said no i would have jumped i suppose they would have taken whatever was left of my body and buried it in the cemetery of pelagios with the other suicides myakes did not say anything he took a step toward me i could not back away from him for i was up against a crenellation i bent my knees readying myself to leap out as far as i could from the wall but i had forgotten how much faster than a child an adult can move myakes sprang forward grabbed me and pulled me back onto the walkway of the inner wall even as i was trying to leap to my death now he said breathing hard and looking back i cannot blame him for what would he have told my father and what would have happened to him had i jumped i am going to give you a choice i will take you back to your father the emperor and we will both tell him our stories or i will give you a beating here and now for what you just did you decide i tried to kick him in the shins he jerked his leg out of the way i tried to bite him he would not let me i cursed him using all the words i had learned from the excubitores he let them roll off him like water from oilsoaked cloth you do it i said then whatever you do to me my father would do worse my father was not so mild with me as he had been before the arabs came he had worse worries now he still would not often strike me but when he did it was as if a demon seized his arm for he would not stop come then myakes said recovering his spear and shield he slung the shield over his back took the spear in his left hand and seized firm hold of my arm with his right we walked along to the nearest fortified tower for all the world as if he were taking me to piddle at a latrine there nothing more the latrine was empty when we walked into it it stank of endless years of stale piss which offended me in the palace sewer pipes swept waste away before it grew so ripely odorous myakes did not turn loose of me for a moment no doubt he thought i would try to run off if he did no doubt he was right remember our bargain he said and set down the shield and spear he must have had a kindly father for while the chastisement he gave me left my buttocks hot and tingling it was all with the open hand never once with fist or foot or the metalstudded belt he wore at last he said maybe you will think twice before you play such games with me again i will think twice i said but i knew i had made the right choice almost i told him how mild he had been but i refrained he might after all have decided to make amends instead i went on now that the bargain is sealed take me back out to watch some more of the fighting from the inner wall here he said not from the outer one not from the outer one i agreed come then he repeated and we went out together myakes by she who bore god ive never been so frightened as i was in those few minutes i was sorry id offered the bargain as soon as it was done hit the emperors son me afterwards he might have said anything at all that id beaten him worse than i had even that id taken him into the latrine to try and sodomize him who would constantine have believed his firstborn or a guardsman whose name he might not know but what would the emperor have done to me had his firstborn splattered himself on the cobblestones that bore even less thinking about and if once i let justinian get his way with such a ploy he would try or threaten to try again till he owned me my idea such as it was was to make sure that didnt happen god was kind to me it worked it did more than work it made justinian my friend id never imagined that poor puppy he must have been so ignored at the palaces that even the flat of my hand on his backside felt good because it showed i knew he was alive and here i sit past my threescore and ten blind and shrunken and how strange to hear myself spoken of as young and brawny and crammed to bursting with the juices of life so many memories most of them i fear so full of base carnality as to be sinful even to remember and so i wont trouble your ears with them eh oh very well just a few but then you read again justinian for five springs in a row the deniers of christ sailed forth from kyzikos against this godguarded and imperial city i grew to take their yearly arrival utterly for granted anything that happens through half a boys life becomes fixed in his mind as an ineluctable law of nature what a host of warlike men they threw away in their futile assaults they could not breach the land walls nor as they found in the last year of the siege could they undermine them and on the sea the fighting towers on our dromons and the liquid fire they hurled gave us romans the victory again and again as if i were a pagan watching christians martyred by fire in the arena i stared avidly out from the seawall as the followers of the false prophet burned alive the unquenchable fires on their galleys foreshadowing the flames of hell myakes usually stood at my side as he had been since the second spring of the siege toward the end of that fifth summer the arabs sailed away from their thracian camps earlier than was their wont their warships withdrew from our waters cautiously my father ordered our dromons across the propontis to spy out the enemy and when those dromons returned they did so with hosannas and cries of thanksgiving for the followers of the false prophet were abandoning their enterprise and their base there and were returning in disgrace to the lands ruled by their miscalled commander of the faithful how we praised god for delivering us from the foe despite the multitude of our sins and how many more sins i have no doubt when looking back on the time with a mans years were committed to celebrate that deliverance having then but nine years i was limited as to the sins of the flesh but poured two cups of neat wine into my little brother herakleios laughing like a madman to hear him babble and watch him stagger when my uncles saw little herakleios who would have been three then they laughed themselves hoarse when my mother saw him she was horrorstricken but she laughed too and when my father saw him he laughed so hard he had to lean against the wall to hold himself upright and when he was done laughing he gave me a beating that like so many of his made the one i had had from myakes seem a pat on the back by comparison i went looking for my only friend but did not find him not then i had a hard time finding any excubitores had an assassin wanted to sneak into the palaces and slay my father that would have been the time to do it with so many guardsmen off roistering but on that day of days surely the assassins were off roistering too nothing i can do goldentop he said the next day when i did tell him my troubles the emperor is your father and he has the right to beat you when you do wrong and you did wrong he spoke slowly carefully and quietly not most likely for my sake but for his own for he must have been nursing a thick head with anyone else i would have been angry but myakes could say such things to me not least because with him unlike my father and my other kinsfolk i was the one who chose how much heed i paid where everyone else is glad i am almost sorry the arabs have gone away i said what he stared at me are you daft why because now i wont be able to go out with you and watch the fights by land and sea i answered myakes laughed at that but quickly sobered they didnt come here for your amusement he said his voice as serious as if he were talking to a grown man even when i was a boy he always took me seriously i had taught him up on the land wall i was not to be trifled with he went on they came to sack the city and kill your father the emperor and kill you too or make you a slave or a eunuch or both war is not a game if you go into it you go into it with everything you have your father would tell you the same he was right of course i did not need to ask my father i could hear the truth in his words i have remembered them from that day to this and when i war against the enemies of the roman empire or against the vicious treacherous dogs who overthrew me once and conspire against me even now i fight with everything i have even beyond the frontier between this roman land this romania and the dominions of the miscalled commander of the faithful the emperors reach remained long my father urged the brigands known as mardaites to sweep down from their fastnesses onto the plains of lebanon which they did overrunning nearly the whole of the country and discomfiting the arabs no end and god also revealed his love for the roman empire and for the queen of cities in other ways although the followers of the false prophet had abandoned thrace earlier in the season than was their habit and although they sailed away from kyzikos well before the coming of the autumnal equinox in the hope of avoiding the storms that wrack the mediterranean with the arrival of fall they could not escape the heavy hand of divine punishment a great tempest overwhelmed their expedition off the southern coast of anatolia the fleet was smashed to bits by pamphylian syllaion with only a handful of men coming home to phoenicia and palestine and egypt and alexandria to tell the tale of what had befallen them hardly had this news reached our godguarded and imperial city when word came that three of my fathers generals florus petronas and kyprianos had crushed an arab army slaying it was said thirty thousand of the followers of the false prophet truly god was merciful to the romans in that year and at that season again and again folk reveled in the streets of constantinople again and again the great church the church of the holy wisdom the church of the holy apostles and all the other innumerable churches in the city filled as worshipers offered up thanksgiving to god and his wholly immaculate virgin mother for delivering the roman empire from the jaws of the arabs the sweet savor of incense rose from the churches in clouds so thick that for hours at a time you could scarcely discern the usual city odors of horse dung and slops mauias the arabs leader concluded further warfare against romania was useless because of our divine protection he sent two men to constantinople to seek peace all the imperial family received them sitting in a row my father i my uncle herakleios my uncle tiberius and my brother herakleios this display of might or at least of fecundity was intended to overawe the arabs envoys prostrated themselves before us when they rose one of them addressed my father in whom of course all true power rested very well emperor you have won this round the commander of the faithful will pay you a tidy sum to put the mardaites back on the leash he speaks greek i whispered to my uncle herakleios he speaks good greek he was glad to whisper back like me he was there only for show why shouldnt he speak greek the arabs still use it in their chancery and damascus was still a roman city when he was a boy i started to say something more but my father chose that moment to reply to the ambassador i looked for him to hurl anathemas and the fear of hell like a churchman how often in years gone by he had scorned the arabs as infidels and heretics and urged our roman people to defend not only the queen of cities but also the true and holy faith but what he said was hed better itll cost him plenty too after everything he put us through the past few years im going to squeeze him by the money bags till his eyes pop of all the sovereigns in the world only the arabs ruler stands in rank with the emperor of the romans my father then addressed him as an equal through his emissaries and not only as an equal but almost as a near neighbor i thought and think still this beneath the dignity of the emperor but it was my fathers way who would have presumed to differ with him in my years of lonely exile at kherson i watched men in the marketplace dicker for hours over the price of the smoked flesh and salted roe of the mourzoulin and other fish like it so like a man buying salt fish in the market my father dickered with the arabs the haggling went on not just for hours but for days in the end coming to no agreement with mauiass envoys my father sent them back to syria and sent with them an ambassador of his own john pitzigaudis he chortled after sending them off by land and told me and whoever else in the palaces who would listen to him john will do better with mauias than i could with his emissaries hes sure of heaven for if by some mischance or great sin he winds up in hell hell dicker his way free out of the devil he knew whereof he spoke he never lived to grow old i am oneandforty as i go over these words and have not far from a decade more than he ever attained while at the time of which i speak he was but twentyseven but even without great experience he was a keen judge of men after long discussion john pitzigaudis came back from damascus with an agreement that the followers of the false prophet were to send us three thousand nomismata fifty highbred horses and fifty bondsmen a year for the next thirty years one of the eunuch parakoimomenoi stephen the persian rubbed his hands together in delight and crooned over and over again three thousand pieces of gold a year as if every one of them were to be delivered straight to his chamber he carried on for so long and acted so foolish that at last my mother who hardly ever spoke up to rebuke anyone reminded him the money goes to the fisc not to you stephen turned red then white he bowed to my mother and took his leave but he was still mumbling of nomismata i never saw a man with a passion for gold to match his but then he had no other passions he could satisfy myakes justinian was wrong there and he must have known it when he was writing but you cant think of everything all the time only god can do that eh brother elpidios theres another passion a lot of eunuchs have and stephen the persian had it more than most he was as nasty an item as i ever had the misfortune to meet what do i mean what eunuchs hanker after brother is revenge revenge on the whole world when you think about it you cant hardly blame them now can you if somebody cut me like that i would have vengeance is mine i will repay saith the lord oh yes of course brother elpidios that is what the holy scriptures say but not every man can follow them as well as we might like if we could follow them better wed not need them so much eh am i right or am i wrong no wait never mind we can argue theology or you can read we cant do both at once id sooner you read if you dont mind ah i thank you and may god bless you and keep you justinian news that the followers of the false prophet had agreed to make peace and pay tribute spread all throug h the world with amazing speed proving to the lesser rulers that the roman empire while diminished in extent from what it had been in the reign of justinian my namesake yet remained as of course it shall forever the grandest and mightiest empire of them all realizing this once more the lesser rulers hastened to send envoys to constantinople to congratulate my father for what he had achieved and to confirm that he was also at peace with them first for their lands were nearest came men from the sklavinias the little territories the petty kings and princes of the sklavenoi have carved out of the land between the danube and the sea they brought bricks of beeswax and pots of honey to lay at my fathers feet one of those feet was bandaged when he received the sklavenoi with myself my uncles and my little brother once more ranked beside him to lend ceremony to the occasion he suffered from gout and when it flared the slightest touch was to him like the fiery furnace into which the king of babylon cast daniel long ago the whole of the empire presently suffered from this as i shall relate in its own place the sklavenoi fairhaired roundfaced men in linen tunics elaborately embroidered with colorful yarns stared in awe at our crowns and the shimmering silk robes we wore and at the jewels and pearls decorating our raiment their pale eyes also went wide at the marble and gold and silver in the throne room at our thrones of gold and ivory at the precious and holy icons of christ and the virgin and the saints on the wall although being pagan they appreciated the beauty and ornament that went into their creation not the piety and at the floor mosaics which i believe they took for a moment to be real things rather than images while they spoke to my father in bad mushy greek i turned to my uncle herakleios and said its as if theyve never been inside a building before they havent not a building like this he answered they live in little huts with straw roofs mostly by riverbanks christ crucified if poverty is a virtue theyre the most virtuous people in the world but they can fight i did not fully understand him not then how could i i had spent all my life in the palaces what did i know of huts made of sticks and straw but i have learned and when you are cold and wet and hungry a hut is more a palace than a palace is when you have all you want afterwards came emissaries from the khagan of the avars swarthy men with narrow eyes set on a slant flat noses and even flatter faces all of them bowlegged from spending most of their time in the saddle their gifts to my father included a double handful of fairhaired young women slaves taken from among the sklavenoi several of whose tribes were under the dominion of the khagan i reckoned them a paltry present some of them looked to be only a couple of years older than i was myself but my father and my uncles inspected them with scrupulous attention to detail at last my father said i shall put them to work here in the palaces i expect well get good use from them he laughed something i had never heard him do at an audience which is in most instances almost as formal and solemn as the celebration of the divine liturgy my uncles laughed too and so did the avar envoys again i did not understand i had but nine years at the time we also received ambassadors from the lombards whose possessions in italy were and are mixed promiscuously with our own after all these years i do not recall which of their dukes and princes sent us men along with those who came from their king there were several i remember that much the lombards fight among themselves and seek our support in their quarrels just as we try to use them to our own advantage as he had with the various sklavenoi and the envoys of the avar khagan though my father made peace with them and sent them away happy there also came to this godguarded and imperial city an emissary from the king of the franks the blond tribe now ruling in gaul i was excited when i heard of his arrival for as i told my brother the kings of the franks are called the longhaired kings which means they have hair growing all down along their backs like hogs maybe their ambassador will too herakleios who by then was four years old received my news with the usual amount of fraternal trust youre making that up he said what about the frankish kings i am not i said and hit him whereupon the little wretch ran and tattled to my father who hit me a good deal harder i still believe though i have never seen one the frankish kings have hair growing down their backs like swine their ambassador did not he had no hair on his cheeks and chin either though he let his mustache grow long and droop down over his mouth to show he was no eunuch he could not even speak greek but had to mumble away in latin while his interpreter an italian i suppose turned his words into ones we could understand once translated those words seemed friendly enough after an exchange of presents and of good wishes he departed from constantinople on the long road back to his cold gloomy homeland when the frank had left the throne room my father though still in full regalia abandoned imperial solemnity for a moment weve got it he cried full peace complete peace freedom from all care north and south east and west weve got it he turned to me to drive home the lesson not since your greatgreatgrandfathers day since herakleios beat the persians and the deniers of christ had not yet burst out of arabia to torment us has the roman empire been at peace against all its many foes at once then it will probably be just as long i said before we know such peace again he boxed my ears right there in front of everyone but i was right having made peace with all our neighbors my father decided to see if he could also create peace within the holy orthodox church this was no easy task for the clerics had been at strife with one another for as long as we had been at war with the arabs and our other enemies indeed the two struggles bore no small relationship to each other the christian folk of what were in herakleioss day the provinces of the roman east syria and palestine and egypt have for centuries wrongly emphasized christs divine nature at the expense of his humanity even claiming that after the incarnation he had but one nature the divine the fourth holy ecumenical synod that which was held at chalcedon condemned the impious heresy but the foolish obstinacy of the syrians and egyptians made them cling to it nonetheless by my greatgreatgrandfathers time the roman government had been trying to root out the monophysite heresy for almost two hundred years this of course was as it should have been for the one true and godguarded empire must have only one true faith how else is unity to be maintained but as i said the heretics were stubborn and would not abandon error my greatgreatgrandfather herakleios sought a theological formula both the orthodox and the monophysites could accept seeking to plaster over the differences between them rather than destroying the heresy the patriarch of constantinople in his day was himself of syrian blood and had monophysite ancestors this fool of a sergios suggested the emperor declare that while christ did indeed have two natures a single divine energy animated them herakleios being a better soldier than theologian duly did this the patriarch of rome the pope as he is often known at the time a man named honorius assented in the doctrine of one will if not energy in christ the monophysites rejoiced recognizing this doctrine as their own heresy in sheeps clothing but the patriarch of jerusalem anathematized herakleioss formula so did many other leading theologians so many that my greatgreatgrandfather recognized he had gone too far but he also wanted to maintain such goodwill as he could from the monophysites of syria and egypt for the ungrateful wretches far from aiding him in the fight against the followers of the false prophet then erupting from arabia were welcoming the arabs as liberators from roman rule to those who denied christ one group of christians was no more offensive than any other and so thinking he was doing something great herakleios put forth his statement of faith forbidding discussion of whether christ had one energy or two and declaring that as pope honorius had said he had but a single will the monophysites once more were pleased the orthodox dismayed this new doctrine prevailed in constantinople but was condemned in jerusalem in carthage in numidia in mauretaniaa and in italy where all the popes after honorius rejected his formulation my grandfather constans attacked his theological opponents with as much energy as he used to fight back against the followers of the false prophet he sent troops from ravenna in italy down to rome and seized pope martin and maximus who had crossed from africa to strengthen martins zeal against the monothelite doctrine the two holy men were fetched back to the imperial city tortured when they refused to renounce their faith and that also failing to make them recant exiled to kherson having known exile in kherson i declare that my grandfather was truly a hard man so matters stood when my father became emperor of the romans in the early years of his reign he had little time or energy of his own to devote to affairs of the church though i know god was always in his mind and in his heart all his strength went first toward avenging the murder of his father in sicily and then to defending romania against the great arab onslaught those things accomplished though he turned his mind toward matters spiritual and also i do not deny toward matters purely pragmatic when he announced he was going to convene an ecumenical synod and formally overturn monotheletism my uncle herakleios demanded how can you go against the will of the founder of our dynasty and that of your father and mine nothing simpler i have a will of my own my father answered i was studying irregular verbs with a pedagogue certainly old enough to have known herakleios the founder and maybe phokas before him my attention wandered away from the aorist passive participle of syndiaphero theology is far more important than grammar misspeaking will get you laughed at true but misbelieving endangers your immortal soul and watching my father and uncle quarrel was fascinating too my father uncle herakleios and uncle tiberius were all emperors in name but every bit of power lay in my fathers hands the only things his brothers got to do was wear fancy robes and appear beside him on ceremonial occasions how they resented that now herakleios shouted well be the laughingstock of all christendom east and west if we turn our backs on beliefs weve supported these past fifty years and what have we got for all that support my father shot back will the monophysites in syria and egypt rise up for us against the arabs because we confess christs two natures have but one will it doesnt look that way to me by the virgin theyre even starting to go over to the creed of the false prophet and the popes have been throwing anathemas at us ever since honorius dropped dead if it werent for our greatgrandfather wed be nothing my uncle insisted if it werent for him the roman empire would be nothing just on account of that his views deserve respect my father glared even with the great herakleios at the root of the family tree you are nothing he said and my views prevail now not his and most especially not yours my brother a short deadly silence followed at last uncle herakleios bowed very low emperor he said i have never heard a word freighted with so much poison he stormed out of the chamber his robes flapping as he went my pedagogue had been blind to all this in truth he was almost blind being so shortsighted that anything out past the end of his beard was but a blur i was told he had grandchildren but i wondered how for if ever a man was wedded to ink and papyrus it was he i am not surprised i have forgotten his name now with my uncles furious footsteps still echoing in the hall he said and the genitive singular of the participle is syndienekhthentos i answered absently i did not love my lessons but i learned them fear of my father made sure of that very good the old man beamed he had not expected me to know that one he raised his creaking voice your majesty you have here a scholar among men he meant it as nothing but one more piece of the idle flattery the emperor hears every waking moment of every day it was more idle than most too by god romania needs soldiers these days not scholars if she is to survive let him be wise my father said so long as it does not harm his piety my pedagogue looked dismayed but lacking the spirit to disagree with the emperor of the romans bowed his old gray head in acquiescence the very next day my father being a man who wasted time neither in making up his mind nor in acting once it was made up the patriarch theodore was summoned to the palaces like his predecessors since the days of herakleios theodore held to the monothelite doctrine when my father announced he intended to convene an ecumenical synod to overthrow monotheletism the patriarch protested but your majesty consider the holy words of dionysios the areopagite who spoke of a single humandivine energy in christ surely this also applies to his will which unites the natures in his person i do not believe that my father said folding his arms across his chest and glaring at theodore how can christ be perfect man if he lacks a human will theodore tried to go on justifying his belief my father cut him off you will not confess that christ has two energies and two wills without division without change without separation without partition and without confusion theodore had courage no emperor i will not i cannot the following day my father removed theodore from the patriarchal throne he replaced him with a certain george who was reputed to be more pliable and who lived up to his reputation the imperial summons to an ecumenical synod went out in short order myakes you werent yet born when that synod was held were you brother elpidios no of course you werent that was fifty years ago now and yet when i reach back into my memory it seems like i can touch it thats what happens when you get old time squeezes together till everything that ever happened to you feels like it happened year before last no more i cant see but i dont need to see to know my beard is white and my hair too what i have of it i can hear how mushy my voice is and no wonder for i havent many teeth left these days either but in my memory im just a stones throw from the young strong swaggering excubitor who guarded the emperor and his son at the ecumenical synod and who kept order there too and order needed to be kept let me tell you what do i mean youre a learned man brother so surely youll know how many bishops came to constantinople for the synod two hundred eightynine you say how fast you rattle out the number i said you were a learned man if its in a book the book or any other you know where to find it and what to do with it once you have it think for a moment though here were two hundred eightynine bishops from all the ends of the earth brought together in one place some of them now wanted monotheletism done away with some of them though some of them didnt like theodore the patriarch that was they believed what they believed much good it did them justinian the ecumenical synod was convened at the great church of the holy wisdom in november of the twelfth year of my fathers reign which was also the eleventh year of my age by then my father had concluded no more bishops than the two hundred eightynine already present in the imperial city would arrive bad weather having made the mediterranean unsafe for further travel in that season as the followers of the false prophet had discovered to their sorrow and our great joy two years before how gorgeous the bishops were as they stood to hear my father speak from the ambo of the great church to open the synod how gorgeous and how varied for though they were all christians all part of gods holy and universal church yet they were also from many lands with robes of different cut and many colors so that assembled there they put me in mind of josephs coat as my father spoke setting forth the reasons for abandoning the false doctrine of the one energy and one will in christ his words came echoing back from the high dome of the church when the justinian for whom i am named first saw that dome which his architects created in accordance with his vision he cried out solomon i have beaten you thanks to the wicked babylonians we have not the chance to compare solomons temple to the church of the holy wisdom by the awed looks on the faces of the bishops especially those from beyond the borders of the roman empire who gaped at the wonder justinian had wrought most would have agreed with him i was particularly struck by the amazement on the face of one man a plump fairhaired latecomer from somewhere in the west who as luck had it had been on pilgrimage to jerusalem when my father sent out the summons for the synod and who came up to constantinople to take part you would have thought he found himself unexpectedly transported to heaven not in a human church no matter how magnificent i wondered in what sort of drafty cow barn he did his own preaching his robe was among the plainest there being merely dark blue wool but as he had been a pilgrim before coming to the queen of cities that said nothing as to the wealth of his see he joined with the other bishops in applauding my father after my father stepped down from the ambo george the ecumenical patriarch replaced him there he proceeded to make the same points my father had but took four times as long doing it as he cited every relevant scriptural text and passage from the holy fathers to bolster his position most of the bishops listened attentively some were scowling they i guessed were those who still favored monotheletism and who were mentally preparing texts and passages of their own with which to defend the doctrine in the sessions that lay ahead even as a boy of eleven i could have told them they were wasting their efforts when the emperor convenes an ecumenical synod of the church it ratifies the doctrine he has established so it has been since the days of the first constantine so it shall always be the emperor after all being gods vicegerent on earth is specially concerned with maintaining the faith learned though it was i found georges oration tedious watching the bishops trying to guess who would cling to the doctrine of the one will and energy and who would gladly abandon it was a more interesting game and then my eye fell once more upon the pilgrim bishop from the distant west his jaws were working furiously as george spoke i thought he was about to burst out in a tirade against the holy ecumenical patriarch thereby disrupting the synod then he tilted his head to one side and spat something onto the floor of the great church that done he popped something else into his mouth whereupon his jaws began working once more chew spit chew spit after several of these cycles i realized he was eating salted olives i had all i could do to hold my face still here we were in the grandest shrine ever built by man on the solemn occasion of an ecumenical synod only the sixth such in nearly seven centuries of christendom and this backwoods bishop reckoned nothing more important than the snack he had brought with him had my father stayed and seen him he would have been less amused than i was at last george droned to a halt having run out of citations to hurl at the clerics assembled before him he had not noticed the hungry bishop like my pedagogue he believed the most perfect reality lay in ink on paper the pious bishops broke up into knots the murmur of theological disputation rose up into the dome of the church of the holy wisdom i turned and caught myakes eye do you speak latin i asked him a little prince he answered i had outgrown goldentop soldiers we use it some good i said and pointed to the peckish bishop i want to meet that man and he may well speak no greek you will accompany me i was learning to command even so young accompany me he did we steered our way through the assembled prelates some of whom moved toward me to give me their views on the one or two wills and energies presumably in the hope these would reach my father a wasted hope even if realized his mind being unalterably made up while others drew back from myakes shield and spear the western bishop looked up in surprise at finding himself my target he had manners he bowed and said good day prince justinian in greek not too vile he must have learned it on his long journey from the barbarous west good day i answered tell me your name and where you are from he bowed again i am arculf bishop of rhemoulakion a small city in gaul he answered and paused to eat another couple of olives i saw more pits than i had expected on the ground by his feet do you do nothing but eat i asked him pointing down to them the gallic bishop flushed as he was so fair you could watch the color mount from his throat to the very top of his head exposed by his tonsure he was so flustered he forgot his greek and spluttered out something in latin i glanced over to faithful myakes who translated for me he is embarrassed for you have seen what a glutton he is he fights the sin as best he can but that best is not yet good enough thank you bishop arculf told him he went on for himself in greek once more i pray in jerusalem at the church of the holy sepulcher for god to take this sin from me it does not happen yet he rolled his eyes mournfully now i pray here too at the church of the holy wisdom sooner or later god will hear me his round face filled with serene faith how do you stand on the question of christs wills and energies i asked i was jealous he had been to jerusalem which the followers of the false prophet stole from us in the days of my greatgreatgrandfather i believe with your father the emperor of the world arculf said christ has and must have two wills two energies all christians in the west believe this what of pope honorius i asked he agreed with sergios of constantinople that christ has only one will arculf looked at me in a new way before he answered you know these things he said almost accusingly before he had been polite to a boy who was a prince now he saw he had to weigh his words as if to a man i looked smug at my side myakes looked proud he had no learning to speak of but admired mine arculf went on if pope honorius says this if the holy ecumenical synod decides he says this let him be anathema with others who say this i agree i told him let all who confess one energy and one will be anathema let their bones be dug up he did not understand that not even after myakes did his best to turn it into latin i realized it was constantinopolitan slang not ordinary greek and explained it means down with them no mercy to thema little did i dream then that one day the worthless fickle city mob would be screaming for my bones to be exhumed well the wretches who led and misled them are mostly dead now and those who still live shall not live much longer alet their bones be dug upa arculf fixed the phrase in his memory he said you are very sure of the right dogma prince of course i am i told him surprised he was surprised my father has decreed it the ecumenical patriarch has agreed to it now the holy ecumenical synod will ratify it it must be true had he argued with me i would have screamed for all the assembled bishops to hear that he was an infamous heretic and likely would have ordered myakes to clout him in the side of the head with his spear shaft too but he had already said he supported the doctrine of two wills and two energies and all he added now was yes and the popes of rome also confess as you and your father do yes and the popes of rome i agreed politely the popes do deserve honor for their line goes back to peter the rock upon whom christ founded the church but rome itself from all i have heard is a village if set alongside constantinople which is also the true and only capital of the roman empire these days to remind arculf of the difference i waved my hand all around saying is this not the grandest church you have ever seen words failed him literally he was eating yet another olive and choked on the pit i thought for a moment god was about to punish him most severely for profaning the church of the holy wisdom but he spat out the stone when myakes thumped him hard on the back even afterwards he was reduced to spluttering in latin which i could not understand myakes followed enough to make sense of it for me he says this is the grandest church he has ever seen he has seen many in the west and in jerusalem and in alexandria but this is the finest he says he thinks god must be holding up the dome because otherwise it would fall i smiled at that which was a thought i have often had myself arculf recovered his greek then and went on constantinople and the roman empire are full of holy things i should hope so i exclaimed and pointed to a large ornate silver chest heavily encrusted with precious stones that stood not far from the ambo where first my father and then the patriarch george had spoken in that chest for instance lies the holy and lifegiving wood of the cross upon which our lord and savior jesus christ suffered we venerate it each year at easter as you shall see if you stay with us arculf made the sign of the cross himself i and then myakes imitated him he said this is a great and holy thing truly but i also see and hear of many small and holy things the icon of saint george the one on the stone column now i felt embarrassed for i did not know of this icon tell me what you saw and heard of it i urged him not wishing to show my ignorance i only hear this he said they say a man a witless fellow strikes at the image with his spear the last word came out in latin but it was one myakes knew the spear goes into the column of stone the mans hands go into the column too and all his ten fingers they are stuck there arculf held out his own hands the fingers extended to show what he meant he made as if to pull back and be unable he had no small skill as a mime though olive oil greased the skin of his right index finger and thumb he went on he is stuck as i say he prays with tears he repents and god who desireth not the death of a sinner but rather that he may turn and live he quoted from ezekiellets him go but the marks where his fingers go into the stone these are there to this day it is a great icon true true indeed i said and crossed myself again then arculf told me of an image of the altogether immaculate virgin mother of god inspired by the devil a jew took it down from the wall on which it had been set threw it into a privy nearby and then shat on it to dishonor christ a pious christian learning what had happened rescued the icon cleaned it and washed it in pure water ever since that day the gallic bishop said it gives out from itself a pure oil a goodsmelling oil that cures sickness better than any man of medicine i see this image i see this oil with these eyes he touched each eyelid with his index finger so i could not misunderstand these icons have much strength true true i repeated making the sign of the cross once more now i had always known of the power of holy icons had not the one human hands did not create helped defend this godguarded and imperial city against the attacks of the followers of the false prophet but arculf seemed to be seeing these things with fresh eyes and he made me see them so too since that day i have advanced the holy images in every way i have thought of including some never used before in all the days of the roman empire myakes is that where he came up with his idea brother elpidios you could knock me over with a feather and that is the gods truth if ive thought of bishop arculf of rhemoulakion or whatever the name of his town was three times in these past fifty years its a miracle nothing else but but it seems he never escaped justinians mind which only goes to show you never can tell old fool that i am id forgotten about that icon of the mother of god too i wonder how the emperor leo would explain its power i do i do but he might have a way he was always tricky leo was well enough of that go on justinian as have all such the sixth holy and ecumenical synod the third held in constantinople proceeded on the course the emperor had set for it from the beginning i headed an everincreasing number of the sessions myself for my father began to be concerned with reports that the bulgars a loathsome tribe then newly arrived at the danube were raiding roman cities and farms south of the river he dared not let my uncles preside both herakleios and tiberius as i have noted were vehemently of the monothelite party although i feel certain they would have espoused orthodoxy with equal vehemence had my father favored monotheletism thus i presided over the debates of the learned and the not so learned theologians as they worked their way toward consensus only one voice was consistently raised in opposition to the doctrine of christs two wills and two energies that of makarios patriarch of antioch his patriarchal see being under the rule of the followers of the false prophet he could uphold his own misguided beliefs without fear of retribution from the emperor like theodore former patriarch of constantinople makarios justified his vile and erroneous dogma by means of dionysios the areopagites phrase referring to the divinehuman energy of christ the rest of the bishops hurled against him a great barrage of quotations from the scriptures and from the writings of the holy fathers of ancient days he refused to own himself beaten but his views plainly were those of but a tiny minority of the assembled clerics winter wheeled round toward spring lent began ushering in the approach to the day of our lords holy resurrection from the dead and then at the fifteenth session of the ecumenical synod one of makarioss few backers a scrawny cleric named polykhronios who had made himself notable both for ostentatious piety and for what was obviously a lifetimes abhorrence of cleanliness presented me with a memorial addressed to my father thank you your reverence i said thankful mostly that he withdrew once more into the ranks of his fellow bishops read it prince he called in harsh syrianaccented greek the salvation of your soul depends on it a man who is ostentatiously pious can sometimes also get by with being ostentatiously rude and since the synod had been summoned for the salvation of souls i could hardly disregard him the memorial was legibly written i could not dispute that my lips moved as i rapidly took it in your reverence i said i see little here different from the views the assembled bishops have decided to be heresy and error and so i they are not heresy and error polykhronios shouted in a great voice so that his words came echoing back from the dome of the great church they are the truth when he interrupts the son of the emperor of the romans even a man of ostentatious piety has gone too far the ecumenical patriarch george said reverend polykhronios surely you forget yourself we who have gathered here at the emperor constantines urging the truth polykhronios all but screamed he pointed to the memorial which i still held set those holy words on a dead mans chest and he will live again just as lazarus did when christ called come fortha he could not have cause greater commotion among the assembled bishops had he set fire to the great church some shouted that he was a fool others that he was a madman but still others including a surprising number who till that time had seemed warm in their support for the doctrine of the two wills and two energies shouted just as loudly in support of polykhronios one of them pulled the beard of a man who had remained loyal to that doctrine his victim hit him in the pit of the stomach they fell to the floor together kicking and clawing at each other in what looked like a death struggle order i cried let us have order that seemed to be only the first fight to break out of many that were simmering what would my father do to me if at a session over which i presided the holy ecumenical synod degenerated into brawling and riot making him a laughingstock not only throughout christendom but also to the arabs some lessons i did not want to learn order i cried again but my voice was still a boys high and shrill they did not heed me i glanced back to the excubitores in mute appeal thank god there behind my left shoulder stood faithful myakes his eyes asked a silent question i nodded desperately i suspect order he and his comrades yelled together a deep roar that cut through the bishops bickering like a knife slicing cheese the guardsmen slammed the butts of their spears down on the stone floor so hard i hoped they did not crack it for a moment i had silence into it i said i do not think polykhronios can do what he says he can that threatened to start the hubbub anew i looked back at myakes again and again he and his fellow excubitores struck their spears against the floor which bought me another brief tenuous stretch of quiet i went on let him prove it if god grants him the ability i pointed to him if the dead man does not rise will you admit the doctrine of the one will and energy is wrong he will rise polykhronios declared so confidently that i wondered if he knew exactly whereof he spoke george the ecumenical patriarch of constantinople whose church that of the holy wisdom was said no corpse shall defile and pollute this shrine one of the excubitores shouted out take the stiff to the baths of zeuxippos hell come clean there by jesus whoever he was i could not tell he brayed laughter like a donkey the rest of the guardsmen laughed too but polykhronios cried yes to the baths of zeuxippos and in a moment all the assembled bishops had taken up the cry and to the baths of zeuxippos we went myakes i didnt mean it for anything but a joke brother elpidios how was i supposed to know theyd take me up on it so justinian never knew i was the one who yelled eh i didnt think he did when you get right down to it im glad he didnt did i think polykhronios could raise the dead i tell you this brother he surely thought he could id never heard anybody claim that before matter of fact ive never heard anybody claim that since if he could do it i wanted to be there to see it happen you had best believe that justinian though rebuilt after a fire in the reign of my namesake a century and a half before the time of which i write the baths of zeuxippos between the palaces and the hippodrome are far older than that they were built by the emperor septimius severus more than a hundred years before constantine the great accepted christianity and transformed byzantium into constantinople i mention this because the baths were ornamented in pagan style with eighty statues of philosophers and poets and even figures from their false mythology many of the bishops drew back in dismay on seeing them some making the sign of the cross george the patriarch of constantinople also crossed himself but more as a gesture of peace than as one intended to turn aside evil they are but memories he said and to my surprise polykhronios agreed as christ cast out demons so shall the words of his pure and holy faith protect us against any lingering wickedness here he said holding the memorial before him like a shield we then had some little wait while the excubitores went into the city to find the body of someone newly dead polykhronios i regret to say showed no interest in using the baths for any but his own purposes in the warm steamy air within the bathhouse his sharp stink seemed stronger than ever arculf bought a handful of chickpeas fried in olive oil from a vender for a copper or two and popped them all into his mouth at once so that his cheeks puffed out like a squirrels presently the guardsmen returned carrying the linenwrapped body of a graybearded man who looked to have died of some wasting sickness for he was skeletally lean the aromatic odors of the wine and spices with which he had been washed fought against polykhronioss reek behind the excubitores came the fellows kinsfolk now wailing and beating their chests and pulling their hair now looking hopefully to polykhronios make him live they cried make andreas live again live he shall polykhronios said a woman whose lined face bore the stunned expression of one who has lost someone dear andreass widow she proved to be fell on her knees before him and kissed his dirty feet the excubitores laid the corpse on a silver table that at other times might have held casseroles of fish cheese and vegetables or perhaps salt pork and cabbage cooked in fat along with fruit and honey cakes for the pleasure of the bathers polykhronios was about to set his monothelite memorial on dead andreass chest when another delay ensued a runner came hotfoot from the palace ordering that he do no such thing until the emperors constantine herakleios and tiberius got there to witness the promised miracle by the time their sedan chairs arrived the excubitores had to use spear shafts to clear a path by which they could approach the makeshift bier word of what polykhronios intended had spread quickly through constantinople as rumors have a way of doing and throngs of people many of them arguing the theology of monotheletism with as much sophistication as the bishops of the ecumenical synod gathered in the baths of zeuxippos to learn whether polykhronios could do as he said my father limped in leaning on a stick with his foot bandaged his gout had been plaguing him again in spite of that he was making ready to attack the bulgars when the weather grew more certain he took his place by the patriarch of constantinople my uncles by contrast ranged themselves with makarios of antioc h and his followers nothing would have made them gladder than having polykhronios vindicate the first herakleioss dogma go ahead my father told the man who claimed he could raise the dead polykhronios bowed and stepping up to andreass corpse with portentous stride set his memorial on its chest everything in the bathhouse was silent as the tomb save only a long indrawn breath from the dead mans widow andreas did not move he remained as he had lain since the excubitores set him on the silver table live polykhronios told him but his eyes did not open his chest did not begin to rise and fall his pale still waxy features did not grow ruddy with vitality in a word he remained dead several bishops sighed then the monothelites who had hoped to see their doctrine proved in one fell swoop a moment later other bishops also sighed these i thought with relief the men who like my father supported the doctrine of two wills and two energies thinking of my father i glanced toward him he had just finished signing himself with the holy cross and now stared balefully at polykhronios false priest you are a fraud and your dogma an error he said as if passing sentence and so he was sentence on monotheletism andreass widow let out a great wail of cheated hope and would have attacked polykhronios with clawed fingers had myakes not seized her shoulders and held her back as for polykhronios himself he answered only i am not beaten yet he tugged at the dead mans shroud so his memorial could rest directly on flesh even after that though andreas lay unmoving live polykhronios said this time in some annoyance as if the corpse were a willful child disobeying its father he muttered into dead andreass ears i could not hear everything he said but i think it was incantation not prayer whatever it was it had no effect after an hour passed with no resurrection the assembled bishops grew restive arculf began popping handfuls of chickpeas into his mouth once more in truth he had not stopped doing that all through polykhronioss performance but he had slowed down and george the ecumenical patriarch of constantinople with wickedly sardonic glee quoted from first kings the passage wherein elijah mocked the priests of baal when they proved unable to summon him cry aloud for he is a god either he is musing or he is gone aside or he is in a journey or peradventure he sleepeth and must be awaked some of the bishops recognizing the allusion laughed out loud arculf was swallowing as george spoke and almost choked to death hatred flashed in polykhronioss dark eyes but it surely was as the corpse on the silver table attested hatred of an impotent sort polykhronios kept trying to persuade dead andreas to live until my father at last lost patience with him this took longer than i would have expected but when it happened it happened all at once pointing first to the memorial on andreass unmoving chest and then to polykhronios he demanded having seen your own failure do you now admit the error of your dogma to my amazement to everyones amazement polykhronios shook his head no emperor i do not he declared since the doctrine is perfect and true the error must lie in me and i as i said once my father lost patience he lost all patience he allowed the bishop not another word but shouted let polykhronios be anathema let polykhronios be anathema baying like wolves the bishops took up the cry loudest among them george polykhronioss protests were overwhelmed in an avalanche of scorn and the anathema duly recorded for all time in the acts of the holy ecumenical synod on holy thursday as was the custom each year the three pieces of the holy and lifegiving wood of the true cross were removed from their case and set on a golden altar in the center of the great church as always when the case is opened a scent like that of all the flowers in the world came forth and everyone in the church of the holy wisdom sighed with pleasure my father advanced to the holy and lifegiving wood bowed his head and kissed it after him came my uncles herakleios and tiberius the junior emperors then it was my turn though i had performed the ritual every year of my life since i could toddle to the altar it took on a special meaning with the bishops assembled for the ecumenical synod watching as i brushed the true cross with my lips the wood was smooth from countless kisses at each knot oil with that special fragrance welled forth after easter that oil would be gathered and used to treat the sick for whom it was a surer cure than any physician could give my brother herakleios followed me to the true cross after him came christopher the count of the excubitores the commander of the imperial bodyguard his mandator or chief deputy theodore of koloneia and the other leading soldiers of the realm i remember florus petronas and kyprianos still basking in the glory of their victory over the arabs three years before and the first appearance in the great church of a new general a roundfaced man named leontios who had won distinction in the endless skirmishes in armenia the procession of warriors continued until all the excubitores had kissed the lifegiving wood on good friday my mother the empress anastasia led a similar procession of the women of the court and on the saturday of the passover sabbath the bishops who had come to the imperial city for the sixth holy and ecumenical synod joined patriarch george of constantinople and the other clerics who served the great church in adoring the lifegiving wood when the lips of arculf of rhemoulakion touched it i wondered if he would leave on it oil different from that which it secreted of its own accord as he had been eating olives again while the procession of bishops formed but the man behind him made no complaint so perhaps he had managed to wipe his mouth on his sleeve by easter which fell in that year on the fourteenth day of april the ecumenical synod had nearly finished its work had that not been so the assembled bishops would have faced my fathers displeasure for he who had waited in constantinople while the holy season and three precious weeks of spring passed was eager to depart and assail the bulgars this he did less than a week after the day of our lords resurrection from the dead satisfied the synod had defined the faith as he desired he left me to preside while the bishops discussed other matters of canon law unrelated to the doctrine of christs two wills and two energies on some of these they in the end reached no firm conclusion a failure like that of the holy fathers who took part in the fifth holy ecumenical synod the one convened by the emperor for whom i am named the first justinian almost a century and a half earlier before my treacherous overthrow i made good the deficiencies of those two synods summoning my own to deal with matters they had neglected the other remaining subject of debate was that of anathemas polykhronios had richly earned his there everyone agreed past that consensus faltered four patriarchs of constantinople ended up condemned sergios who first proposed monenergism to the emperor herakleios and his successors pyrrhos paul and peter who upheld monenergism and monotheletism some of the bishops more aggressive in their piety and some of those from the western lands also suggested anathematizing herakleios and constans when one of their number proposed casting my greatgreatgrandfather and my grandfather into the outer darkness of anathema applause rang out in the great church no i shouted i forbid it they stared at me i had not quite twelve years then and my voice had not broken but i was older than constans had been when he became emperor of the romans and only a bit more than five years younger than my father when he gained the rule and he had also been administering affairs in constantinople for some time before that i had no excubitores at my back they had accompanied the emperor in his campaign against the bulgars i knew what he would say i knew what he was liable to do if he returned to the imperial city to find his ancestors condemned to anathema the bishop who had made the proposal said prince they deserve the sentence no less than their misguided patriarchs after all it was your grandfather who made the holy pope martin and maximus the confessor suffer on behalf of the doctrine we ourselves have declared true and correct and so no i said again it shall not be i did not need to think of my fathers certain rage i was filled with rage myself rage at the idea that these little sniveling men for so they seemed to me at that moment could think of declaring my kinsmen heretics without herakleios and constans we should have no universal empire to accompany the true and universal faith the queen of cities would belong to the persians or the avars or the arabs let the emperors enjoy credit for what they did and do not judge what you cannot match after a moment bishops who lived within the boundaries of the roman empire spoke up in support of what i had said all of them of course remembered how my father had turned back the followers of the false prophet most recalled the ceaseless exertions of my grandfather against the arabs and a few the old men among them had seen my greatgreatgrandfather repel the persians and the avars both if they accepted my father as romanias savior how could they deny the similar achievements of his ancestors they could not once that move was defeated the ecumenical patriarch george had his revenge on the westerners who had thought to condemn emperors of the romans his voice smooth and sweet as sce nted olive oil he said honorius the bishop of rome confessed one energy in christ if we anathematize the patriarchs of constantinople for this false doctrine how can we look approvingly upon it in other prelates let pope honorius be anathema oh how the bishops from italy and gaul and africa screamed and bellowed at that they might have been so many justcastrated swine fat bishop arculf of rhemoulakion turned not red but so dusky a shade of purple that i feared he would suffer an apoplexy on the spot but the western bishops though raucous were few and those from within the roman empire not only outnumbered them but had grown weary of their constant prating of perfect orthodoxy in doctrine here was not merely one of them but their patriarch shown by the words written in his own hand to be a misbeliever like polykhronios like sergios like the rest pope honorius was condemned in the acts of the sixth holy and ecumenical synod no doubt he shall suffer in hell for all eternity on account of his errors having anathematized honorius the synod had in essence completed its labors all that remained was for the emperor of the romans to ratify what it had done and dismiss the assembled bishops but my father as i have said had left the queen of cities to campaign against the bulgars the barbarous horsemen who had begun to harass the romans living nearest the danube and on returning to constantinople he found trouble more urgent than any the bishops of the ecumenical synod had caused thus those bishops remained assembled though no longer meeting until almost the autumnal equinox myakes people nowadays say constantine didnt take the bulgars seriously enough what how do i know what people say nowadays brother elpidios well there you have me am i blushing i ought to be twenty years ago when i was still out in the world people said constantine didnt take the bulgars seriously enough there are you happier brother youd make a fine canon lawyer i have no doubt of that whenever people say said that about constantine it makes made excuse me me angry for it isnt so he had detachments from all the military districts of anatolia cross into thrace for the campaign why not we were for once at peace with the arabs and they were paying us tribute he didnt figure theyd jump us from behind and he was right most of the troops from the military districts slogged north toward the danube on horseback the rest along with us excubitores and the emperor sailed up the coast and inland by way of the danube the bulgars in those days didnt live south of the river they stayed up beyond it in the swampy country in the angle between the pruth and the seret they had a sort of a camp there not really a town but a bunch of tents all in the same place and ringed round with palisades of brush and sticks and whatnot as much for keeping their cattle in as for keeping enemies out they must have been pissing themselves when we came up toward that camp let me tell you we made a proud spectacle thousands of men on horseback all of us in chainmail that glittered in the sun the imperial guards with silk surcoats dyed in all sorts of bright colors banners and crosses and icons going before the companies and regiments and divisions of the army the bulgars took one look at us fled back inside the camp and didnt come out for three days straight we could have gone right in after them too easy as you please but whats that the book of proverbs says pride goeth before destruction and an haughty spirit before a fall yes thats the passage i meant brother elpidios thank you you give me those so quick i dont have to grope for them with my own poor wits we thought the bulgars would flee back to the eastern lands theyd come from but they didnt oh other things went wrong too the soldiers from the anatolian military districts didnt care for the country they were in it was damp it was boggy it was misty it was everything the land they were used to wasnt and everybody remembered that the last roman army that had gone north of the danube was the one that had mutinied and murdered maurice back an old mans lifetime before no one said anything about that but you could tell it was in peoples minds even with that though everything might have been all right if only constantines gout hadnt flared up but flare it did not only in his big toe which was where it usually bit him but also in his heel and up the calf of his leg i happened to draw guard duty outside the imperial pavilion the night everything went sour he should have been asleep in there hed brought up a featherbed covered in silk and stuffed a cubit thick with goose down so soft itd be sinful for a proper monk to think about it let alone lie down on it youd take oath a man could set that featherbed on knives and still sleep sound except constantine couldnt hed moan and hed curse and hed moan a little more and hed curse a lot more what he wanted to do i think was scream but he wouldnt give in to the pain enough for that finally when the stars said it was getting close to midnight time for me to roll up in a blanket a lot scratchier than what constantine had he came hobbling out on two sticks his leg all swaddled like a baby and bent so his foot wouldnt accidentally bump the ground and make him hurt even worse than he did already he looked bad he looked old he couldnt have been thirty yet but shadows from the torchlight filled and deepened all the lines in his face you could see white streaks in his beard even in the torchlight he was pale mother of god help me he groaned i have to get some rest i glanced over at my partner a thickshouldered armenian nameda nameda well whatever his name was all those years ago he looked as worried as i felt wine with poppy juice in it emperor i suggested constantine shook his head his face was shiny with sweat not on account of the heat but because he was maybe a step and a half away from keeling over dead i cant he said i need my wits about me ive beaten all my other enemies all around the borders of the empire once i smash these louseeating bulgars too ill have made a clean sweep my partner and i looked at each other what were we supposed to say brother elpidios you have to stop or youll die for one thing we didnt know that was so only god knows such things and for another thing do you think constantine would have listened to us if you had any sense you wouldnt have bet a fortyfollis copper piece against a stack of gold nomismata that any emperor from the line of herakleios would listen to anybody by the way he sounded constantine didnt care whether he went on living or not so long as he got rid of the bulgars he said im going back inside boys i will get some rest he was giving orders not to us but to his own body which didnt much feel like obeying but he was clumsy with his sticks because he didnt need them all that often and as he turned himself around to go back he whacked himself right in the sore foot with one of them poor devil he started to fall down i grabbed him so that didnt happen but he threw back his head and howled like a wolf everybody awake in our camp must have heard him and he probably woke half the troopers who were sleeping except for the sizzle of my own eyeballs cooking it was the most dreadful sound i ever heard christ wouldnt surprise me if it woke up asparukh the bulgar chief he clamped down on it fast as he could made his mouth close and bit the inside of his lower lip hard maybe to make one pain fight another i will rest he said again in a ghastly voice and a little blood trickled down off his lower lip he made it back inside my partner and i we closed the tent flaps after him he wouldnt rest not after that he hadnt a prayer and we couldnt do a thing to help him after a while our reliefs came i didnt think id sleep either but i did the sun woke me i sat up praying god had worked a miracle and healed constantine overnight then i heard a groan from inside the imperial pavilion and knew it wasnt so god works miracles when he feels like it not when you feel like it i snagged myself a mug of wine and went over there to find out what constantine was going to do the only thing i was sure of was that if we attacked he couldnt lead i got to the pavilion about the same time florus and kyprianos did florus was the ugliest man ive ever seen with a big nose no chin to speak of and big ears that stuck out like open shutters on two sides of a house kyprianos now kyprianos looked like a pretty catamite grown up to middle age you ask me though florus made the better general constantine came out to meet the two of them he looked worse by daylight than he had in the middle of the night the purple circles under his eyes said he hadnt slept at all not even a little bit when he said if i dont get relief im going to die florus and kyprianos both nodded he meant it and they could tell as much florus pointed north toward the bulgars camp what about the barbarians what do we do with them if youre not here the emperor made a rude gesture drag them out of hiding with your lances you wont need me here for that theyre frightened spitless of roman power make them come out and fight and youll smash them we shall do as our glorious sovereign commands kyprianos cried he wore chainmail but he talked like a courtier florus said the men wont like that youre going emperor theyll think youre leaving them in the lurch i have to go constantine answered he wasnt lying about that just standing up on one foot and two sticks took an effort that left him white and trembling im sailing down to the baths at mesembria after i soak there i always feel better i expect ill see you soon with captives and booty to show me we shall drag the barbarians forth from their lairs and crush them in your name kyprianos said constantine nodded an emperor always hears yes whod dare tell him no and kyprianos wasnt the worst soldier around hed helped beat the arabs a few years earlier when theyd lost thirty thousand men i guess he really thought he could do what he promised but florus i noticed didnt say anything along with five shiploads of excubitores me among em constantine sailed down the danube and then south along the black sea coast to mesembria it sits out on a rocky peninsula and makes a good harbor the emperor took the waters there before too long he was feelinga not good but better we should be getting news hed say and try to put his sore foot on the ground we should be getting news he must have felt like a bear in a cage he talked about going back up to the frontier and taking over again but he wasnt up to that he waited we all waited if you werent soaking your foot mesembria was a boring place to get stuck even the whores were clumsy sorry brother that just slipped out by luck of the draw i was attending constantine when the first messenger arrived from the north wed just come out of the basilica called the old metropolis where the emperor had been praying for victory a fellow who looked like hed just about killed his horse getting there galloped up jumped off the poor worn beast and threw himself facedown in the street emperor he cried get up man constantine said what news he quivered like a bowstring when youve strung it too tight the messenger didnt get up i suppose he didnt want constantine to see his expression still grinding his face into the dirt of the street he cried disaster constantine took a step toward him by the look on his face he aimed to murder the poor luckless messenger right then and there not quite by accident looking clumsier than i was i bumbled out between the emperor and the fellow whod brought bad news constantine had to stop just long enough to let him start thinking he was headstrong but god help you if you thought he was stupid what happened he ground out the messenger spewed out this great long tale of woe the meat was what florus had said it would be without constantine there the men wouldnt go forward against the bulgars some of them started saying the emperor ran away then they panicked and ran away themselves even though the bulgars werent after em the wicked flee where no man pursueth no not quite brother the stupid fled where no one pursued more like of course after a little while the bulgars figured out the romans werent trying to lure them into some kind of trap and really were running away they came to the danube and crossed it sweeping up our soldiers as they went by the time the messenger got to mesembria the barbarians were already down to the haimos mountains and threatening varna not fifty miles north of where we were constantine listened to it all without twitching a muscle ruined he said at last and nothing more i didnt know what to say there wasnt much i could say he wouldnt be able to put together another army like the one hed thrown away not for years too many men gone ruined was about right he kicked at the dirt hard with his bandaged foot i dont want to imagine the pain that must have cost him his face didnt so much as twitch we sailed for constantinople the next day justinian my fathers return to the imperial city took everyone by surprise stephen the persian was particularly vexed for he had no chance to prepare a triumphal procession to celebrate the extermination of the bulgars but when my father reached the palace bare moments after word he was in the city came to us one look at his face said no procession would be needed father i said proudly stepping forward when everyone else hung back the acts of the holy ecumenical synod await your review and approval that is good he said and seemed to mean it he was a good and pious christian as concerned with the world to come as with our own but he had other things on his mind i shall review those acts eventually still full of myself and what i had done while he was gone i demanded why not now because we were beaten and beaten badly he answered getting all the poison out in one sentence i gaped speechless despite the grim painfilled expression he bore the last thing in all the world i had imagined was that my father who had turned back the followers of the false prophet and had received envoys not only from them but from all the lesser kinds of the inhabited world could have gone down to defeat at the hands of a band of ragged barbarians my mother normally of sunny disposition made the sign of the cross and burst into tears one of the goldenhaired sklavinian maidservants the khagan of the avars had presented to my father a pretty little thing who had been baptized under the name of irene dropped the goblet of wine she had been carrying to him some of the wine splashed the robe of stephen the persian who was standing near my father the eunuch stared down at the red stain for a moment then quite coldly slapped her across the face clean up the mess you clumsy whore he hissed in a voice that might have been chipped from ice i gaped again the imperial court was never subjected to such unseemly displays but my father lost in his rage and misery said nothing irene stood stockstill long enough for the print of stephens hand to form itself in red on her cheek then bowing she said i sorry i fix in the broken greek she had learned and hurried away coming back with rags she began mopping up the wine on the floor no one save stephen and i looked at her he in satisfaction i in stupefaction everyone else formed a tableau as frozen as the mosaic scene irene labored on hands and knees to clean when my eyes moved away from her i found myself as it were turned to stone as well for my father was staring at trying to stare down his two younger brothers herakleios and tiberius had not burst into tears when my father admitted his defeat far from it by their gloating expressions they had everything they could do to keep from cheering out loud or perhaps even from turning handsprings like acrobats earning coppers in the forum of theodosios all three of them had been crowned emperor but all power had been in my fathers hands since my grandfather was murdered in sicily thirteen empty years for my uncles now my father instead of moving from triumph to triumph had blundered his brothers had to be wondering could they strip that power from him he knew what they were thinking how could he not have known what they were thinking had he been born second or third rather than first he would have been thinking the same thing himself my brother herakleios let out a loud wet cough even he had been watching my father and my uncles trying to stare one another down his name as i have said was a bone my father had tossed to my uncle after one of their earlier fights most of the time though my father did not deign to toss bones he was the emperor after all and commonly was to be appeased not the appeaser but today sensing his weakness his younger brothers gave as good as they got instead of breaking under his gaze and slinking off with shoulders slumped and eyes downcast they stood straight against him nor did they glance suspiciously at each other as sometimes happened they knew that if they cast down my father only one of them could take up the reins of power they both wanted without casting him down though neither of them could seize those reins and for once they remembered as much my little brother coughed again and again and again and began to turn blue that drew my fathers notice he went over to young herakleios and took him in his arms which made me angry and jealous my uncles herakleios and tiberius strode away as if they had won a victory and so perhaps they had herakleios my brother not my uncle slowly came out of his paroxysm and rather to my disappointment regained his natural color my father ruffled his hair which was darker than mine and sent him on his way then turned to me speak of the synod he said i did retailing to him the arguments over the anathemas and how i had kept the names of our ancestors from being maligned for all eternity he nodded to me for the first time in my life as one man to another you did well he said in that and in the matter of pope honorius misbelief must be uprooted no matter where it hides even if the affairs of men suffered those of god went well and for that i thank you its more than my brothers would have done lord knows thank you father i said probably sounding surprised for i was unused to praise from him youre growing up he said his tone too was less certain that it might have been i daresay he found the idea startling but he faced it headon as was always his way high time you wore an emperors crown on your head not just a princes circlet if you can do the work you deserve the rank now i know i stared if he crowned me emperor that pushed herakleios and tiberius even further into the background for my rank would vault over theirs and i would be my fathers formally designated heir in a small voice i asked what will my uncles say to that i will tend to your uncles never fear my father promised herakleios and tiberius tried to tend to my father first i think they might have done it anyhow but hearing that he intended to acclaim me emperor for he made no secret of that to the contrary forced their hand soldiers from the anatolian military districts the men who had run away from the bulgars rather then routing them while they had the chance began trickling into the imperial city seeking passage back to the farms they worked when not summoned to war they blamed their ignominious defeat not on their own vile cowardice but on my fathers having abandoned them fools wretches liars knaves my uncles went out among them not to calm their discontent but to fan it myakes they tried to get us excubitores to go against constantine too that didnt go far we knew why the emperor had had to sail away to mesembria then they tried saying things like do you want that spoiled brat telling you what to do when constantine is gone now not everybody got on with justinian as well as i did he wasnt shy about saying just what was on his mind and who would talk back to the emperors son nobody or nobody with any brains anyhow but the thing of it was what had herakleios and tiberius done to show they were anything much either they hadnt done a thing of course one reason they hadnt was that constantine never gave them the chance to do anything still when you got down to it they hadnt proved themselves and by the way they whined about constantine and justinian they were on the bratty side themselves so we excubitores we listened but we made no promises the troops from the military districts now they were another matter justinian herakleios and tiberius flattered the soldiers who stamped through the streets of constantinople and crowded the barracks at sykai across the golden horn from the imperial city to hear them talk the men had had victory in their grasp until my father snatched it away the troops from the anatolian military districts lapped that up like porridge sweetened with honey far easier for them to believe their failure someone elses fault than their own rumors of what my uncles were about did not take long to reach my father ill settle them he told me if they think im a poor excuse for an emperor lets see how they like life without the title he summoned the nobility of constantinople to the palace as if nothing were amiss he also summoned my brothers who sat in their accustomed places at his left hand more excubitores than usual stood close by my father and they wore mailshirts which was not common practice but neither was it unknown rising my father said we all look with pride on what prince justinian has accomplished these past months for our holy and orthodox church he walked over stood beside me and set a hand on my shoulder for his work and to make clear my will as to the succession i intend to proclaim him emperor tu vincas justinian i think the first to make the ancient latin acclamation was faithful myakes although as he stood behind me i cannot be certain i am certain the excubitores raised the shout before the assembled nobles did i saw that some of the imperial guards off to either side of the throne raised their weapons as well in a moment the palace rang with my name and the wish that i conquer ceremonys iron law kept me from turning my head but i let my eyes slide over to my uncles they too joined in the acclamations what choice had they being where they were but their faces declared the words they mouthed lies and worse lay ahead for them for my father went on and since my godguarded brothers during this same time did nothing save sluggishly eat and drink and since they aligned themselves with heterodox frauds anathematized by the sixth ecumenical synod they have brought the imperial house into as much disrepute as my son will bring luster to it is it your will then powerful men of constantinople that i revoke the imperial rank my father conferred upon herakleios and tiberius again the excubitores cried out first let it be revoked again the nobles my father had gathered could follow or risk their riches and perhaps their lives cowed they followeda all save one there was a stir in the brightly clad rows of prominent men as a certain leo a functionary in the imperial mints came forward to stand before my father true to his calling he reached into the leather pouch he wore on his belt and drew from it a gold coin which he held up so the torchlight flashed from it emperor this is a nomisma of carthage he said in a loud harsh voice carthage then remained under the sway of the roman empire not yet having been fecklessly thrown away by the bungling brigand who stole my throne from me do you see the stamp on it you and your brothers emperors all three do not cast them down now that would be treason against them for they were raised up at the same time you were from that day to this i have wondered what leo thought he would accomplish with such foolish freedom of speech was he in the pay of my uncles i had never seen him around them before or did he think his simple words would make my father change his mind could he have been so naive whatever he was he paid for it my father turned to a couple of the excubitores nearest him and said this dogs tongue is too forward seize him and take him to the executioner so he can cut it out leo did not even try to flee he stood staring till the guardsmen laid hold of him and amid awful silence began to drag him away then seeming to regain some of his senses he cried out we confess a trinity in heaven let there be a trinity on earth as well up to that moment my father had dealt with the unseemly interruption as smoothly as might be expected hearing his brothers compared to persons of the holy trinity though enraged him and he shouted to the excubitores that will cost him his hands and feet along with his tongue tell the executioner after leo got what he so richly deserved for his insane insolence my father looked around the throne room again as if seeing whether anyone else had the temerity to challenge him the nobles all tried to pretend they were elsewhere none of them anxious to meet leos fate then my father turned his terrible gaze on his brothers tiberius quickly bowed his head my uncle herakleios was made of sterner stuff which was i suppose why my father occasionally had to placate him but always rode roughshod over tiberius today though my father would placate no one at last herakleios too lowered his eyes in submission and then my father looked at me i met his gaze unflinching partly this was pride was i to humble myself when he had just cleared the way to exalting me above everyone else in the roman empire save him alone and partly i admit on this page where i must be truthful before the lord it was calculation having just degraded my two uncles my father could hardly take vengeance against me upon whom would he then rely my brother little herakleios was not even in the throne room being confined to his bed by yet another sickness he had already come close to dying several times in his short unhappy life he would have to succeed only once to ruin all my fathers plans if he set me aside along with my uncles whatever my reasons i had gauged my father aright when he saw i would not bend my neck before him he nodded and said this is the spirit an emperor must have to rule yielding to nothing and no one until he is dead i have remembered those words all my life and lived by them my uncles also being of the line of the great herakleios had their share of his indomitable spirit had they accepted their demotion and lived quietly afterwards i think my father would have left them at peace had he wished to inflict harsh punishment on them he could have done so at the outset rather than merely depriving them of the imperial dignity but herakleios and tiberius having had the title of emperor since they were children had never lost the appetite for the power accruing to the title power they had never tasted but always seen just as in the pagan myth tantalos never ate the grapes that hung always barely out of reach and so rather than choosing retirement they slipped out of the palace before dawn broke the next morning and rowed in a small boat across the narrow water of the golden horn to sykai forgetting what had happened to leo in the throne room they used his argument with the soldiers from the anatolian military districts and succeeded with it better than they deserved my father and i had our first inkling of this at breakfast when a servant looking apprehensive and rightly so reported to us that herakleios and tiberius were neither in their bedchambers nor so far as anyone could tell anywhere within the great palace the eunuch said perhaps they have withdrawn to a monastery there to pursue a contemplative life i dont believe it i said loudly theyre plotting against me i dont believe it either my father said he knew what spirit his brothers had in them one all too much like his own he dipped the bread he was eating in fine olive oil then took a sip of wine i dont think well have to wait long to find out one way or the other he soon proved right a great many ferries pass back and forth between sykai and the queen of cities and this day those entering constantinople were filled with soldiers from the anatolian military districts some of them brandished swords not knowing or not caring that the penalty for rioting with swords was the amputation of their thumbs their cry was the same as that leos had been we believe in a trinity let us crown the three by which they meant my father and both my uncles had they been a true army they could have launched civil war within the walls of the godguarded and imperial city that had repelled all foreign foes but they were not an army and herakleios and tiberius who had never commanded soldiers their function in the empire having been purely ceremonial could not make them one they were only a mob when my father heard reports that they were robbing shops and sacking taverns he smiled from ear to ear i did not understand this makes them worse not better i cried not only are they traitors they are criminals too criminals are easier to deal with he answered then turned to stephen the persian bring theodore of koloneia to me the eunuch bowed and soon returned with the patrician theodore was a blocky muscular man with features that looked chiseled from granite if you allow that the sculptor after thinking he was done went back and started several new cuts he then decided not to finish half a dozen scars seamed theodores cheeks and nose and forehead although he was only the mandator the chief deputy to christopher the count of the excubitores he had far more to do with commanding them from day to day than the count did myakes ah theodore been a good many years since i thought of him and thats a fact what justinian mentioned him before i missed it i am sorry i am old he was one harsh man every bit as rough as justinian makes him out to be here a few years after this still far from an old man he retired to a monastery i wonder how he fared as a monk he was used to having people obey him not to obeying other folk himself but if he was harsh he was also able he had to be to rise so high with a nature like that give him time in a monastery and hed probably wind up the abbot there and then kyrie eleison on all the monks under him hed enforce every last rule st basil ever thought of and likely a good many basil never imagined unseemly levity brother elpidios what you think i was joking read on about theodore then did i tell you he was sneaky too you dont have to believe me justinian will tell you he was there along with me justinian my father and theodore put their heads together my father was all for mustering the excubitores and turning them loose on the anatolian rabble if they ran away from the bulgars theyll shatter like glass facing real soldiers he growled but the patrician said emperor ill do that if you command it but its a waste of lives on both sides i can do it for you cheaper if youll let me he spent the next little while explaining how my father was not a man greatly given to laughter but he laughed then loud and long by the virgin theodore i should have left you in command against the bulgars not those blockheads who called themselves generals how many men will you need do you suppose a troops worth to make sure the soldiers dont mob me before i can harangue em theodore answered then he turned to me if the prince comes with me too it will make the offer look better i very much wanted to go if i could do anything to keep my uncles from stealing my rightful place in the succession i would but i looked for my father to hesitate if theodore betrayed him and handed me over to herakleios tiberius and the soldiers they led that would greatly aid their cause and hurt his he however nodded and replied at once yes take him not until years later when the throne was mine did i realize he dared not let any doubt he might have had show that could have put doubt in theodores mind as well which was the last thing my father wanted the best way to keep your subjects from doubting you is to look sure regardless of whether you are theodore of koloneia was like my family and unlike most other men i have known in that he made up his mind quickly and wasted no time in acting upon whatever he decided by the time the sun reached its high point in the sky he i and the troop of excubitores he had asked for had left the palace and were on the way to the forum of constantine the plaza commemorating the founder of the imperial city the emperor who like a thirteenth apostle made the roman empire christian even before then theodore had sent runners to every quarter of constantinople calling on the soldiers of the anatolian military districts to assemble at the forum to hear him and me that could get sticky prince if your uncles the junior emperors the former junior emperors i should say show up there too he told me but i dont think they will i think theyll suspect a trap and so stay away i think youre likely right i answered they have to suspect everything and everyone now if we can keep them afraid instead of bold we shall win if you are afraid you do not deserve to rule yes i was parroting my father but his words had struck deep into my soul theodores hard features showed little expression but i thought he looked on me with approval and myakes who marched along with the rest of the excubitores beamed and winked at me he knew my nature no one better when we got to the forum of constantine we found it full of rowdy anatolian soldiers many of them so full of wine you could get drunk from their breath the excubitores a disciplined band in the midst of these wild men cleared a path for theodore and me up to the base of the porphyry column on which stood a great statue of the first constantine decked in a gilded crown with sun rays spiking out from it as if he were the false god apollo himself soldiers of the empire hear me theodore shouted and then soldiers of constantine hear me that was clever for it reminded the mob that the present emperor bore the same name as the one in whose forum they had gathered faster than i had expected he got something close to quiet into it he said soldiers of constantine i wont take up much of your time i just want you to remember a few things who beat the arabs was it herakleios no was it tiberius no it was constantine the emperor who got the followers of the false prophet to pay us tribute who got the sklavenoi and the avars and the lombards and the franks to pay us tribute was it herakleios no was it tiberius no it was constantine the emperor in fact he warmed to his themejust what the devil have herakleios and tiberius done when you look at it boys they havent done a damn thing for years now theyve sat around the palaces drinking fancy wine and pinching pretty girls on the bottom its nice work if you can get it aye but does it set you up to be the emperor not on your life christ crucified lads theodore went on constantines son has already done more than either one of those worthless brothers and hes only twelve years old here prince you tell them about it you dont need me i did not yet have a mans height myakes set his shield on the ground and motioned for me to stand on it when i had done so he and a couple of other stalwart excubitores lifted the shield with me on it so the soldiers from the anatolian military districts could see me and when they did see me so upraised the silence they gave me was deeper than any theodore of koloneia had got this of course was not merely for who i was but for who i might become being raised on a shield is or can be the first step in the coronation of an emperor i glanced down at myakes thanking him with my eyes for his quick wits he winked at me again in that moment whatever nervousness i might have felt addressing a plaza full of unruly warriors all of them angry at my father and therefore at me vanished i said soldiers of romania who guided the two hundred eightynine bishops to the true doctrine of christs two energies and two wills was it my uncles no it was my father and i thanks to us there is once more peace in the church all through the inhabited world most of the soldiers cheered at this but a few let out hisses and catcalls by their looks and accents most of them were armenians whose church being both heretical and in the iron grip of the followers of the false prophet has to this day almost thirty years after the time of which i write failed to ratify the sixth holy and ecumenical synod myakes youll remember brother elpidios that the true name of philippikos who overthrew justinian that second time was bardanes so he was an armenian himself that accounts for the synod he called the one that condemned the sixth ecumenical synod whatever you call him though he lasted only a couple of years on the throne himself and then he went onto the dung heap and his miserable synod with him what you didnt remember that i forget twenty years ago when justinian met his end you were a boy or at most a youth what did you care then about philippikoss real name how time goes brother how time goes justinian i went on when that fraud of a polykhronios said he could use the lying doctrines of the monothelites to raise the dead who hoped he would my uncles my fathers brothers with my own eyes i saw them and did he raise the dead no god let that poor man stay dead to show us that dogma was false my father didnt believe i didnt believe but my uncles did after that soldiers do they deserve to wear the crown many men shouted no but others kept up their vain and foolish chant we believe in a trinity let us crown all three brothers hear me then soldiers i cried to them this was to have been theodore of koloneias part but i had been with him and my father when they devised their scheme and i was up on the shield now so i was the one who set it forth let ten of your leaders come forward to me they will meet with my father and the nobles of the empire to discuss this matter the rest of you go ba ck to sykai by god i swear you will learn from your leaders tomorrow what my father has decided i waited looking out at them watching them chew that over to see what it tasted like they must have liked the flavor well enough the only trouble we had was keeping the number of selfproclaimed leaders down to ten for ten times that many tried to come forward but ten would do nicely and the excubitores under theodores direction chose a mix of officers and private soldiers who did indeed seem to have some gift of leadership the rest of the men from the anatolian military districts dispersed more readily than i had dared hope we had heard them we had spoken to them they were satisfied and being satisfied they streamed out of the forum of constantine toward the wharfs on the golden horn for the trip back across it to sykai tomorrow i told theodore we must give orders that no ferries are to cross from sykai to the imperial city prince i have already made those arrangements theodore paused studied me and slowly nodded i walked straighter i felt i had passed a test we took the selfstyled leaders of those who favored restoring imperial rank to herakleios and tiberius back toward the great palace as we marched east along the mese the excubitores surrounded these men more and more closely taking alarm at last one of them cried are we ambassadors or prisoners i promised you would see my father i answered and so you shall that kept the leaders quiet as we hustled them along toward the palace see my father they did as soon as they were inside the palace the excubitores laid hold of them and stripped them of their weapons then with theodore of koloneia and me leading the way they frogmarched the wretches into the throne room so my father said fixing them with a glare that had chilled my blood often enough you are the traitors who want to give my worthless brothers their crowns back are you the fellow who had asked if they were prisoners an officer named theophylaktos repeated the senseless jingle they had been bawling all along we believe in a trinity let us crown all three brothers no let us not my father said his voice deadly cold what i believe in now is rooting out treason wherever i find it he turned to theodore illustrious patrician take them to the kynegion and dispose of them then take the bodies across to sykai and hang them on gibbets so the troops from the anatolian military districts have something instructive to contemplate theodore bowed emperor workmen are already building the gibbets he nodded to the excubitores and they took the wretches off to the kynegion an amphitheater near the sea where miscreants were frequently dispatched for execution theophylaktos and the rest bawled like castrated bullocks screeching they had been betrayed as if they having betrayed their sovereign had any cause for complaint all went just as my father and the patrician theodore devised indeed they even added a refinement they had scribes write the word traitor on ten large placards and hung one around the neck of each executed man thus when the executioners tied the wrists of the dead leaders to the upthrusting arms of the gibbets the corpses displayed the reason for which they had been put to death by the altogether immaculate virgin mother of god i wish i could have been in sykai when the soldiers from the anatolian military districts woke up and found out what had become of the fools who they thought were getting what they wanted from the emperor instead those fools got what they deserved the soldiers could not even take their worthless outrage to constantinople for no ferries were crossing the golden horn and should they have tried to march around it the gates of the city wall were closed against them later that day ferries did go to sykai but the only place their captains would take the soldiers was across the bosporos to anatolia when the soldiers made as if to balk at this the captains delivered to them my fathers warning go home to your farms now while you still have the chance otherwise you will envy the fate of your leaders i am told the men looked long on the ten bodies hanging from the gibbets then began filing onto the ferries by the time the sun set the whole disgruntled lot of them were back in anatolia and no one in constantinople said one word more about crowning herakleios and tiberius again somehow my uncles got back into the city and returned to the palace without my fathers knowing of it until they appeared at breakfast the next morning as if nothing had happened go ahead he told them sit there smug as you like the crowns will never go on your heads again thats for god to decide not you tiberius said meaning i suppose that my father could not know whether he would die tomorrow and perhaps also that he and herakleios might have a hand in my fathers demise then herakleios pointed at me and said better we wear the crowns than this arrogant little bugger with ten casually spoken words my uncle snuffed out the last of my boyhood i thought we had always got on well herakleios and i we used to mutter to each other as we sat through endless ceremonies where our role was purely ornamental but my uncle having seen himself demoted could not bear the thought that i might gain one day that to which he could no longer aspire not only rank but power i was not his nephew any more only someone who stood between him and what he wanted above all else my father said hes done well by the virgin and hes done things for me the ecumenical synod to name just one you herakleios you just want to do things to me give tiberius and me our rights herakleios said thats all we ask tiberius added our father crowned all three of us who are you to take away what he gave yes our father crowned all three of us my father answered but he set me to rule from the day he sailed off to italy and sicily somehow you always manage to forget that who am i you say i am the emperor the emperor give you your rights ill give you more than that ill give you your deserts having made up his mind my father as was his way acted at once he summoned once more the nobles of constantinople before whom a few days earlier he had demoted herakleios and tiberius from the imperial dignity now though instead of sitting beside him they stood in front of the throne like any other men who were to be judged i sat at his left hand and my little brother to my left my father gave my uncles one last chance even then asking them well herakleios well tiberius what am i now am i your brother or your emperor if you tell me i am your emperor all will be well for you but if you say i am only your brother he let them draw their own conclusions tiberius stood silent perhaps hoping silence would be taken for acquiescence but herakleios turned as if appealing to the courtiers and bureaucrats who had been brought together to hear his fate he answered you are our brother and the eldest and we honor you for that but we cannot call you our emperor for our father the emperor constans crowned us all together at the same time tiberius is this your word also my father demanded miserably tiberius nodded he and herakleios looked to the nobles of the city for support they found none my father had saved the city from the arabs my father and i had restored peace to the church and my father had mutilated leo for daring to speak on my uncles behalf so be it you have condemned yourselves my father said to herakleios and tiberius sighs ran through the throne room the moment though expected was hard when it came my father passed sentence you shall have your noses slit so that being physically imperfect you shall no longer be able to aspire to the throne and you shall be sent into exile tiberius simply stood and stared perhaps accepting his lot perhaps unable to believe he was about to suffer the deserved fate of all failed plotters and rebels but herakleios stabbed out a finger at my father and cried may what you give me fall on you one day brother then that finger which at the moment seemed long and thin and sharp as a claw pointed first to me and then to my little brother and may it fall on your heirs as well to emphasize what he said herakleios spat on the mosaicwork floor my father made the holy sign of the cross to turn aside the words of evil omen so did i so did my brother clumsily and a beat late so did the assembled nobles and the excubitores who crowded the throne room neither my brother nor my father lived long after that but on neither of them did herakleioss curse fall on me by the incontestable judgment of god it did but my uncles whom the excubitores now led away never were seen in this godguarded and imperial city again herakleioss curse fell on me aye but i have overcome it like every other obstacle in my path and with him and tiberius gone no more obstacles stood between me and eventual imperial rank i wondered whether my father would immediately have me crowned as a junior emperor now that my uncles were vanished from the scene in fact i expected him to crown me had i not earned a coronation of my own for helping to persuade the soldiers from the anatolian military districts to stay loyal to him and not go over to herakleios and tiberius but no ceremony seemed forthcoming emboldened by my new status as heir apparent even uncrowned i asked him why not to my relief he took the question seriously instead of growing angry and replied i think my father made a mistake by crowning all three of his sons i dont want to imitate him if i crown you how can i keep from crowning your brother with you and if i crown you both i sow the seeds of strife for a new generation i dont think little herakleios could ever be a danger to me i said i did not think my younger brother was likely to live out the year but i did not say that to my father he set a hand on my shoulder you never can tell son he said when i was a boy my brothers were so much smaller and younger than i was that i didnt think they could be dangerous either but as you both grow older differences in age become less important than they are when youre children and so i was wrong and you might be too you never can tell when i look back on all the twists of fortune that have gone into the skein of my life i have to say he was right about that and then any notion of crowning me was forgotten for the bulgars sent three envoys to constantinople seeking tribute in exchange for refraining from penetrating deeper into romania than they already had having seen so great a part of his force heedlessly thrown away my father felt he had little choice but to pay the barbarians what they demanded he summoned them to the throne room to impress them with the splendor still remaining in the roman empire my brother and i as part of that splendor sat at his left hand our three seats were the only ones there the two additional thrones formerly occupied by my uncles had vanished i never learned whither the bulgars their names as best i can set them down in greek letters were krobat batbaian and kotrag were quite the ugliest men i had ever seen they were short and squat and swarthy with wide flat faces noses almost bridgeless and narrow eyes set in their heads at a slant they could raise hardly more beard than a eunuch a few hairs sprouted on their cheeks and chins and a few more enough to make up scraggly mustaches on their upper lips they smelled of horses instead of silk and linen they wore fur and leather and also as if to make up for their physical hideousness great quantities of gold rings and armlets and necklaces and clasps and even in the case of krobat who was their leader hoops in his ears i stared never having seen a man decked out in that effeminate style they all spoke greek after a fashion my father ignored their twittering accent and their endless solecisms treating them with as much dignity as if they had come from the misnamed commander of the faithful in damascus the question was never whether to pay them only how much for my father reckoned himself unable to drive them back north of the danube he did not let them know that however instead he made sure that wherever they went in constantinople they were sure to see large numbers of soldiers as if he were contemplating renewed war should their demands prove exorbitant the ploy worked they cut their demands in half and then in half again your people has no great need for gold my father told krobat pointing to the numerous ornaments of precious metal adorning the barbarian it is only a symbol of the relationship between us he then had to spend some time making sure krobat knew what a symbol was that done he went on if the symbol is more expensive than the war it replaces we would sooner fight in his bad greek krobat said you talk like what is name fish merchant like fish merchant yes he sneered he had big yellow teeth made for sneering my father simply stared at him so did i adding my indignation to his my brother may well have done the same thing but i did not shift my eyes to look at him i kept staring at krobat letting him know without words he could not address an emperor of the romans thus silence stretched at last batbaian muttered to his leader in their ugly tongue krobat muttered back angrily but when kotrag also spoke to him he returned to greek and growled out something that would do for an apology my father dipped his head to accept it and the dickering went on as if the insult had never occurred myakes constantine had that knack for looking at you looking through you so you knew he thought he had every right to command you and you believed it too yes brother elpidios justinian had it too i was about to say so patience is a virtue or so i hear tell the veterans among the excubitores said constans had it so it must have run in the blood herakleios now herakleios was forty years dead by then but he couldnt very well have been without it not with everything he did whats that brother what do i think of leo the emperor we have now aside from the icons i expect you mean well you could compare him to constantine i suppose on account of they both held the arabs away from the imperial city but you have to remember brother i knew leo when as they say he may be a strong emperor now but he wasnt born to it and id bet that shows and who knows what his son his constantine will turn out to be like when his time comes to wear the crown is the story they tell true that when he was a baby he shit himself in the baptismal font not the best omen you could have no indeed it isnt you ask me they dont make em the way they used to and thats a fact the world isnt the place it was when i was young and i dont need eyes to see as much but then what old man doesnt say the same justinian the sum the bulgars finally agreed to accept was twenty pounds of gold a year fourteen hundred forty nomismata they went back to asparukh with the first years installment in their saddlebags and seemed happy enough to get it after they were gone from the capital not before i said thats not what i would have done father id fight the barbarians and beat them once for all when the roman empire is yours youll do as you judge best he answered now it is mine and i reckon this course best we have peace on all our borders to give us time to recover from our wars and we take in more than twice as much gold from the followers of the false prophet as we pay out to the bulgars to my surprise i found myself agreeing with krobat at whom i had scowled a few days before i thought my father was running the empire as if it were a fishmongers shop calculating every follis of profit and loss but as he had spoken i dared not continue the argument and while he lived we paid the bulgars their tribute the sixth holy and ecumenical synod held its final session a few days before the fall equinox by then the two hundred eightynine bishops who had labored for ten months were anxious to depart for their homes especially those of them who had to travel by sea my father and i presided together over that last session which was held in the great church by your acts my father told the assembled bishops holding up the copy of those acts to which they had affixed their names some in the uncial script in which books are usually copied some in the newer cursive by your acts i say you have restored peace to all us christians may that peace be deep and lasting he made the sign of the cross as did many of the bishops who listened to him during those last few years of his life peace was very much on his mind as if having seen so much of war and strife in the earlier years of his reign he wanted to avoid them at all costs thereafter understandable enough i suppose but not my way he went on by your acts you have also rightly defined our holy christian dogma for the rest of time a thousand years from now men may not remember your names though some of you surely shall be among the saints but whenever they confess christs two natural wills and energies they will remember what you have done here i had not thought of the synods work in those terms but no doubt he was right just as today no doubt many confess that christ and god the father are of the same substance without ever thinking of st athanasios who saved our holy church from the vile and infamous heresy of areios it seemed also to have been a new thought to many of the bishops but one of which they approved not least because it magnified their importance in the scheme of things bishop arculf of rhemoulakion for instance paused long enough in eating whatever he was eating on that particular day to clap both hands together arculf did not return to the synod i summoned ten years later to decide questions of canon law left behind by the fifth and sixth ecumenical synods i sometimes wondered if he safely reached his home in distant gaul later to my surpise i learned george the ecumenical patriarch blessed the assembled bishops and thanked them for giving of their piety and wisdom for the benefit of all christians throughout the inhabited world the bishops bowed to him and then filed out of the church of the holy wisdom for the last time the world will not soon see such a gathering of great theologians again myakes aye brother elpidios justinian was pious no one not even his enemies of whom he had a great whacking host would have denied that but i dont think its from piety alone that he has such fond memories of the ecumenical synod that was the time that was the place when he first started doing things on his own he found out he could and he liked the feeling me yes i think the bishops were a good and pious bunch they started only a couple of tavern brawls i know of and over the space of most of a year thats pretty fine dont you think and only one woman i heard about claimed a bishop got her with child and not everyone believed her you say your standards are higher brother well you have to remember youre a holy monk and i was just an excubitor in those days i started tavern brawls aplenty and if no pretty girl said i put a loaf in her oven it wasnt for lack of trying yes i was a sinner and constantinople was a good town for a young man oh all right for a sinner to be alive in too that it was whats that you never saw the place you never saw constantinople well yes now that i recall you have said you were born in the provinces and of course youve been here since you were young but youve missed something mighty fine that you have theres not another place like the queen of cities in the whole wide world not half there isnt damascus damascus cant hold a candle to it thessalonike thessalonikes not a bad town i was there with justinian hell talk about that later on i expect but thessalonike is a town constantinoples a city its the city they dont call it that for nothing you know how is it different well just for starters its got more people in it than you can shake a stick at youll never in all your days see so many people all in one place youll never in all your days smell so many people all in one place either its a strong odor but its not always a nasty one and in constantinople there always seemed to be a hint of spices and perfume to it its not just ordure and folks whove gone too long between baths ah maybe thats an old mans memory playing tricks on him but maybe its not too but where else could you walk down the street and see good old ordinary romans and blond slavs and arabs in robes and persians in hats that look like chamber pots and lombard merchants with greasy hair and folk from who knows where bumping elbows with one another and not even hardly noticing they were doing it you ever notice how when a stranger comes into a village or a little town everybody gives him the onceover even if hes a roman like everybody else its not like that there theres too many people for them to keep track of who belongs and who doesnt so they treat everybody like he belongs takes some getting used to i know but its true and theyll swindle their fellow townsmen just as happily as they will a stranger too oh aye indeed they will theyll steal the tunic off your back and sell it to you before you notice how you got to be naked but you can get anything you want there anything at all i think if you can find it anywhere in the world you can find it in constantinople that means churches too mind you brother elpidios when you think of constantinople you think of the church of the holy wisdom of course and maybe the church of the holy apostles too where they bury the emperors and their kin youll hear about that in due course but those are only the big ones theyve got other fancy ones dedicated to the virgin and john the baptist and saints sergios and bacchus anda i could go on for a while but you get the idea and theyve got little tiny churches that maybe only a dozen people can crowd into at a time some of them dedicated to saints nobody three blocks away ever heard of something for everybody like i say even leaving the palaces out of the bargain youve never seen the like of some of the houses there they dont build em like that out in the country let me tell you i grew up in a shack made of mud bricks my old man had to shore it up after every big rainstorm not like that in the city no sir the fancy brickwork the rich folks have on their houses lord baked bricks one and all and not just baked bricks but bricks baked in different colors to make pictures or designs makes me shudder to think what work like that must cost so it does no poor folk dont have anything that fancy of course but they do live in stone houses or ones made of baked brick some of em just have rooms in big buildings four or five stories high they put up so they can crowd more people into the same space you wont see anything like that anywhere else either the main streets are all cobblestoned so you can use em in any weather thats not so in the alleys i grant you but still how many times have you gone outside in the rain and sunk up to your backside in mud a good plenty i dont doubt same as me same as anybody but you dont have to not in constantinople not all the time anyhow and the things you can buy let me tell you brother elpidios along the mese theres everything your heart could desire there are shops that sell frankincense and myrrh from down in arabia and others that sell amber from way up north somewhere god must know where the stuff comes from but i dont not exactly there are coppersmiths and jewelers and potters and leatherworkers and candlemakers and oil sellers and boatbuilders and fishermen and weavers and tailors and cattle drovers and wool dealers and butchers and bakers and glassblowers and scribes and and i dont know what all everything whats that you can find people who do those things in every town you can find one or two maybe most places in constantinople there are dozens sometimes hundreds of people who have the same trade so you can pick exactly the one you want the one who does your kind of work at your kind of price or whos sly enough to make you think its your kind of price anyhow and you will find trades at constantinople you wont see anywhere else silk weavers for instance and the dyers who make the purple for the emperors robes theres always the stink of rotting sea creatures round their shops but you can buy the meat from the murexes for cheap because they dont use most of it take em to a tavern for the cook to fry up in bread crumbs and olive oil and theyre as tasty a little supper as your heart could desire oh the taverns if you had gold in your pocket you could drink with the lords of the city so you could and the places theyd go were near as fancy as their houses dont you doubt it for a minute some of them liked buying excubitores drinks they hoped wed tell them things about the emperor gossip in constantinoples like nowhere else too anybody who let his mouth get ahead of his wits didnt last long though things went down from there too down to dives nastier than ive ever seen anyplace else dives where the wine was vinegar and the beer was mule piss and piss from a sick mule at that some folks though dont go to a tavern to talk they go there to drink vinegar and mule piss will get you where you want to go if thats all youve got in mind like i keep saying something for everybody girls for every price too no i dont remember how fancy a wench it was who said a bishop put a loaf in her oven a bishop though youd think hed want something choice along those lines wouldnt you yes of course i mean if he was sinner enough to want anything along those lines at all you could find em if you were looking in taverns or strolling along the mese after all they were for sale too or in brothels too of course some of em ended up marrying well some saw the light and went into convents eh god bless them of course god bless them did i say anything different some just got old and ugly some werent that young and werent that pretty to start with they couldnt charge as much unless they did things none of the others felt like doing oh sure enough a young man with a little gold or even a little silver in his belt pouch could have himself quite a time that he could aye if i hadnt had my eyes burned out id likely be a sinner still i make no bones about it all things work for good in the end is that what you said there i wont argue brother elpidios how could i argue with the likes of you justinian a couple of months after the end of the sixth holy ecumenical synod my father suffered his first attack of stone i learned of it when my mother at most times a quiet woman let out a shriek at dawn one morning that had everyone in the palace rushing toward the bedchamber she and my father shared because the rooms holding my bed and herakleioss were close by that of my parents i was among the first into the imperial bedchamber and what i saw there made me slam the door in the faces of those who came more slowly including my own brother my father lay senseless on the floor a shattered chamber pot close by had spilled a nights worth of piss over it and over his tunic even as i turned back from the door he groaned and sat up one hand going to the small of his back his face was pale as parchment mother of god help me he said in a voice not his own and then wonderingly she has helped me the pain is gone he got to his feet and though he swayed a little did not seem on the point of falling what happened my mother demanded her nightgown was wrinkled from sleep her fair hair wild around her head i could not remember the last time i had seen her anything but perfectly robed and coiffed i woke up perhaps half an hour ago my father answered plainly explaining as much to himself as to her and me at first i thought it was the gout again but the pain lay here he touched his back againnot in my foot it moved slowly he ran a hand down his back toward the bottom of the cleft of his buttocks even the memory of the pain made sweat bead on his face though the bedchamber was cool it felt it felt as if there were a torch soaked in liquid fire burning inside me all the way down i got up to make water hoping to squeeze the pain down further and i woke up on the floor suddenly noticing his tunic was soaked and dripping he let out a hoarse cry of disgust at that moment someone rapped on the door a loud peremptory knock that cut through the babel out in the hallway let me in curse it a man presumably the fellow who had knocked called in a loud deep voice how the devil am i to attend my patient with him on one side of the door and me on the other i looked a question to my father he nodded saying let peter come in but no one else mind you a physician will do me no harm though he probably wont do me much good either i opened the door a palms breadth repeating my fathers command as i did in spite of it the forward rush almost overcame me it was as if a besieging army had broken in the gate of a city but a big burly man with a thick black beard threw a couple of judicious elbows that doubled over the men just behind him peter got in then helped me shut and bar the door once more before anyone else could follow that done he turned to my father and as ceremony required even under those circumstances began to prostrate himself before him when my father waved for him not to bother he said tell me your symptoms my father did in words almost identical to those he had used with my mother and me peter listened attentively then said you passed a kidney stone emperor what you felt was it moving from your kidney down to your bladder it may stay there or you may pass it out of your body sometime in the next few days when you make water will i get more of them my father asked one let me tell you was enough for a lifetime everyone who suffers from stone says the same thing thank god if you care to that yours passed quickly instead of lingering for hours or even days peter said my father shuddered the physician went on will you get more he spread his hands god alone knows i pray you dont he hesitated then said suffering from stone emperor along with your gout is not the best of signs my father shrugged could the soldiers from the anatolian military districts who said he ran away from the bulgars have seen him them they would have quivered in shame akhilleus chose glory over length of days or so the pagans say he told peter my family has a way of dying young my father to a murderer his father to consumption my life may not be long but already it has been full having saved the empire from the followers of the false prophet and our holy christian church i leave the rest in gods hands peter crossed himself then bowed very low so did i i had never seen my father more worthy of respect holding faith in the face of pain is the hardest thing a man can do and he did not merely hold it it shone forth from him as light does from a lamp the clamor in the hall got louder what shall i tell them peter asked tell them i had an attack of stone tell them it has passed and i am well again my father smiled a thin smile all that has the advantage of being true tell them also that in most cases the stone does not recur from what peter had said that was not true a physician however being able to do so little against illness carries hope as a standard medicament and peter with his big voice and bluff blustering manner was the perfect man to put forward what my father wanted everyone to believe by the time he was done haranguing the servants and guardsmen out in the hall they all sent up cheers and cries of thanksgiving to god that my fathers trial had been so light and so fortunately ended also in the hall close to the door stood my brother despite peters glib fluent speech herakleioss face always pale and thin remained tight with worry he knew illness too well to believe it could be so casually dismissed he looked a question at me i nodded as reassuringly as i could after a moment he nodded too i have always wondered whether he believed me my fathers next attack of stone came halfway through the spring myakes those last four years of his life constantine wasnt the same man hed been before better worse i dont know but different maybe some of it had to do with losing to the bulgars up till then he must have thought he was invincible and why not hed beaten every foe he faced and the arabs seemed more dangerous than anyone imagined the bulgars could be so what happened with the barbarians likely had something to do with clipping his feathers but it wasnt only that constantine didnt go to war with his neighbors any more he softened you might say the bursts of temper hed loose against anyone who got in his way the same sort justinian had and from what i heard the same sort constans had had too they stopped coming again part of the reason for that may be that he didnt have to worry about his brothers any more but more of it i do believe sprang from his being sick so much of the time he suffered a lot from stone from all ive heard theres no worse pain a man can know a woman in childbed maybe but not a man i must say i dont see the justice of it never have he knew what hed done justinian puts the words in his mouth hed saved the roman empire and reunited the church and what did he get hell on earth and an early grave no i dont see any justice there whats that brother elpidios who am i to question gods judgment nobody at all just an old blind man and i dont question not really but i dont understand either justinian between my fathers first attack of stone and his second i grew taller by the breadth of a couple of fingers nor did my growth slow after that i was entering my thirteenth year and making the passage from boy to man my shoulders thickened though i have always been slim my muscles hardened i began to have more than down on my cheeks and around my private parts and my voice absurdly was a boyish treble one moment and the next the deep note i have struck every since in the course of those few months the world became a different place my brother herakleios was suddenly not just smaller than i but on the the far side of what seemed an unbridgeable chasm my father and i by contrast constantly butted heads as if we were an old ram and a young charging at each other in springtime if he said it i was certain it was wrong for it came from his lips and what i was certain of i said in no uncertain terms he did not take kindly to that something i understand better now than i did at the time and like a young ram i began to take notice of the ewes i had known for some time what passes between man and woman but when i was a boy it struck me as so absurd and unlikely that i could not take the notion seriously though both my father and myakes assured me it was true why on earth would any man want to do that and why would any woman let him if he did then one day in a hallway in the palace i walked past a serving girl who was carrying some freshly washed bed linen out to dry in the sun being still wet the bedclothes had also wet her tunic which clung to and revealed the shape of her breasts and nipples i gaped at them and my body stirred in a way i had not known before i stopped and stared after her i had of course seen how women walk before that day but i had never seen it till then perhaps noticing that my footsteps no longer sounded in the passage the serving girl looked back over her shoulder when she saw how i was looking at her she smiled saucily then turned a corner and disappeared that night or was it the night after so many years have gone by i confess i am not certain i had a dream unlike any i had ever dreamt not surprisingly the serving girl was in it somehow she was dry and wet in her tunic and bare all at the same time i moved toward hera and then i was awake alone in my bed in the darkness my nightshirt and the bedding were wet i thought for a moment i had pissed myself in the night like a baby but quickly realized it was not urine that had spurted from me my body still glowed with the remembered sweetness wishing i could remember the dream of the serving girl in more detail i rolled over and went back to sleep myakes oh dont cough and splutter so brother elpidios yes of course i know its satan who sends such dreams seeking to lead men away from virtue and toward sin and lasciviousness but they are sweet while they last as justinian says arent they and this was his first one you say you dont think they are well you can say what you like brother god gave us free will after all didnt he aye you can say what you like but that doesnt mean you can make me believe it is there going to be more of such filth how should i know when justinian gave it to me i never saw anything but the outside and im not likely to set eyes on anything more than that now am i do you want to stop reading your purity and chastity wouldnt be challenged then ah you think you can overcome any challenge you find im glad to hear it that i am read some more then am i laughing at you brother elpidios like i said im an old blind man would i do such a thing ill keep all my snorts to myself from now on i promise justinian i had looked at the serving girl and she had smiled at me i wondered how to proceed from that point to the operation that although it still struck me as preposterous might in fact perhaps have had something to recommend it before this time as i have written the only times i had anything to do with the serving women in the palace was when i wanted them to fetch me something or to take something away except for those times i had like any foolish boy done my best to pretend they did not exist now awkwardly i began to change my ways having gained one smile with a smile i started smiling more especially at those among the serving women whose smiles i most wanted in return and indeed i did win some of those smiles looking back i marvel that i should have been so anxious not only was i young and reasonably well favored i was also the emperors son and likely heir the combination should have made me irresistible in fact it did but i took a while to reali ze that about a week later i had another of those disturbing delightful and messy dreams i do not remember what happened in that one so vividly as i do the first but when i awoke from it i understood what had happened more quickly and with less confusion than before i vowed to myself that the next time i found such pleasure it would not be in a dream one of the serving girls at whom i had formed the new habit of smiling was the yellowhaired sklavinian who had been baptized as irene she was i think closest to my age of all the servants the khagan of the avars had given to my father three years before she to my disappointment did not smile back but would nod and say good day in her halting greek then one day a couple of days after that second dream i happened to be coming back from the kitchen where i had just absconded with a bun stuffed with raisins and honey and chopped nuts when she came out of a storeroom and almost ran into me i sorry she said nervously even the higherranking servants could beat her if she did something wrong stephen the persian no doubt among others had taught her as much if she displeased me she must have thought i would have her tied in a sack and chucked into the bosporos as i suppose i could have but i said its all right no harm done and indeed none had been to prove i meant it i smiled at her as usual she did not smile back then i had a better idea i tore the sweet bun in half giving her the larger piece she did smile at that her whole face lit up our fingers brushed when i handed her the bun mine afterwards felt as if they were on fire i thank you very she said and ate the bun in a couple of bites this good she added with her mouth full and then went on to chatter about food for a while mostly in greek but every now and then slipping back into her barbarous dialect i gathered she did not much care for the pungent sauces and spices with which we romans are in the habit of making our fish and vegetables and meat piquant she could have been talking about the antipodes or stirrups or tadpoles it would not have mattered to me i was not listening to her not with the tenth part of my mind i was watching entranced the way her eyes shone the way her pink lips moved showing me every now and then her white teeth and the tip of her tongue the curve of her jaw the curve of her neck and other curves covered but not hidden by the linen tunic she wore irene did not take long to notice how i was staring she smiled again then a different smile one that made me think our ages had a large gap between them after all it was i realize now a womans smile not a girls at the time it alarmed me as much almost as much as it aroused me you give me prince she said i give you too come she stepped back into the storeroom from which she had just emerged and beckoned for me to follow i do not know what i thought she had in there some little trinket hidden away perhaps i went in there with her it certainly was the ideal place in which to hide a trinket shelves on all four walls reached from the floor almost to the ceiling and were crowded with pots and dishes on one side of the room lamps and braziers on the other some were of brass others of clay the likes of irene would not have been allowed to have anything to do with vessels of silver or gold she walked around me and looked out into the hallway i did not understand why as no one had been out there nor as best my ears could tell was anyone there now suddenly she shut the door the storeroom plunged into gloom for only a small window above the shelves on the far wall let in any light alarm rose in me again had someone my exiled uncles perhaps bribed her to try to stick a knife in me i had a knife of my own on my belt my hand went to it i was lucky she did not see me for she was pulling her tunic off over her head i give you she said again tugging down her thin linen drawers and letting them fall to the floor prince i give you you like she stood where she was for a moment so i could see her there was plenty of light for that she was very fair her skin where the light did not touch it white as milk the nipples on her small firm breasts a pale pink the hair in her armpits and between her legs as light as that on her head whereas mine in those places was several shades darker i remember all this as vividly as if it were yesterday yet how much of it i truly noticed in those first few stunned heartbeats i cannot say she was a woman and she was naked in front of me and that was enough dear god how much more than the imagination truth is seeing me gaping she smiled that ancient secret smile once more you no do before she asked numbly i shook my head it was a foolish question had i had practice in such things she would already have been down on the ground with her legs spread wide but she said never mind no worry i show you all things and stepped forward into my arms between the two of us we managed to get my robe and drawers off me in not much more than twice the time i would have needed were i undressing for bed alone i almost brought my hands up to cover my privates though irene seemed to feel no shame at letting me see her i was shy when she looked me up and down she spread my robe and her tunic on the floor then got down on them i got down beside her my heart pounding as if it would burst from my chest even with the clothes as makeshift mattress the floor was hard i did not care as she had promised she showed me all things where my hands and mouth should go on her and what they should do when they got there in this unlike the instruction i still endured from my pedagogue i proved a quick study some of her sighs and little moans no doubt were to build my pride but some of them i think i hope were real nor were her hands and lips idle though she did not grasp my manhood as i touched her secret place fearing no doubt i would spurt too soon if she did but then as it became obvious our joining would not be much delayed i wilted like a candle in a hot room a boys nerves i did not know how to be a man in this most virile way of all i fix irene murmured in a tiny voice mindful of any passersby in the hall she had me lie on my back then crouched beside me and bent her head to the flagging part in a moment it flagged no more but stood tall and stiff as the column in the forum of constantine head poking proudly from the foreskin of such sensation i had never dreamt but yet another lesson awaited me seeing me proud once more irene straddled me took me in hand and guided me into her she sank down upon me with a soft sigh and i was engulfed to the hilt she raised herself then lowered again from my dreams i had memories only of the explosion now i discovered how delicious reaching it was when irene found i would not spend myself on the instant she moved more vigorously i began to move too no doubt i was clumsy but who is not the first time presently her breath came in gasps as mine had been doing for some little while she took my hands in hers and brought them up to her breasts i squeezed and was afraid i had hurt her for she whimpered deep in her throat but she squeezed me at the same instant down there where we were joined several times one right after another and i i spurted my seed deep into her a moment later as irene scrambled off me something hot and wet splashed down onto my leg good she said it fall out less chance baby now that our passage was done she became all brisk practicality getting into her drawers tugging her tunic out from under me and dressing with smooth haste i did my best to imitate her when we were both clothed she opened the storeroom door saw no one in the hallway and tugged at my sleeve so i would go out first that made sense she might have had indeed had had some legitimate business in there which was not true of me the precautions though sensible were needless the hall was so quiet it might have been deserted since the palace was built she came out closing the door behind her and i greatly daring i thought set a hand on her shoulder can we do this again i asked she looked astonished you a prince i a servant a slave she said pointing out the obvious as if she were telling me this is the sun that is the moon how i say no then she looked worried no doubt fearing i would be offended to think she gave herself to me only because of the difference in our ranks i do anyhow she added sweet good make me feel good looking back i still think some of that was true at the time i drank it down as if it were unwatered wine from thasos i felt nine cubits tall and five cubits wide ready for anything especially anything female another time then i said grandly and left her to get back to her work myakes you did that very well brother elpidios only two or three coughing fits the whole time what is that what my first time was like oh not that different i was a year or two older and maria was a maiden too so neither one of us was sure what we were doing but we managed so we did i was on top not the other way round how about you brother what you never vowed chastity before you could even think about breaking your oath you say thats very holy brother elpidios no wonder youre so curious about what the real thing is like how does it compare to what brother elpidios i tell you frankly i dont know sorry i cant tell you but ive never found out nor been curious if you really want to know eh whats that no of course the abbot doesnt have to know you asked the question nothing wrong with curiosity i sa y if you werent curious you wouldnt be reading justinians book isnt that right brother yes you can read some more now if youve a mind to when you read i hear his voice inside my head isnt that strange i remember it changing just as he says justinian not only did i seek out irene whenever i found the chance i also got in the habit of going around with a sweet bun or two from the kitchens having caught one fish with that bait i went angling for others and my luck while not perfect was good enough to make me a happy or at least a sated young man though the first lesson teaches most of all i learned a good deal afterwards too that was a happy time for me that little stretch of years beginning my manhood the happiest time i have ever known save these past few years when i have found revenge a pleasure surpassing the love of woman as the psalmist said with somewhat different meaning to the words my father had the peace he desired the peace he had bought and paid for he took great delight in it in spite of or more likely because of his growing bodily infirmity gout and stone continued to wrack him though he was or should have been still in the prime of life and he pissed blood after some of his attacks his physician peter muttered darkly at that symptom but peter i was discovering was given to dark mutters at any excuse or none a mans body can go wrong in so many ways and god has given us knowledge to fix so few of them that anyone choosing the physicians trade if not a bit mad merely for entertaining the desire will be driven so by the frustrations of his craft and yet i touch my nose and i remember that not all the doctors art is useless or not entirely so in sickness and in health as i said my father maintained peace both with the empires neighbors and within the church this latter required some effort for as we learned a couple of years after the fact when the bishops of rome translated the acts of the sixth holy ecumenical synod into latin for the benefit of the westerners too ignorant to have learned greek in the anathemas they mentioned pope honorius but deleted his title so as not to have to acknowledge his heresy to that part of the world administered by the see of rome on hearing that i grew furious you ought to order the exarch of ravenna to send troops down to rome and force the pope to tell the whole truth i said to my father but he shook his head for the sake of preserving the work of the synod i shall practice economy here he said economy is the term theologians use for overlooking differences without doctrinal import without it i suppose there would be endless friction in the church as if sand were poured into the gearing of a waterwheel but too great an exercise of it countenances heresy i said as much to my father i was at the age where i challenged him more freely than i had he shook his head again the anathema against honorius remains he is who he is and burns in hell for what he did regardless of whether they give him his proper title i could not sway him though i said surely the pope who gave the order for this lie after sending bishops to the ecumenical synod will also burn in hell agathon the pope who sent bishops to the synod is dead and facing the decrees of a judge greater than i my father answered his successor then i persisted i had not heard that agathon was no longer among men but then rome being at the very edge of the empire seldom drew my notice and my father said his immediate successor leo has also suffered the common fate of mankind the new bishop of rome a certain benedict has in his brief time been a good enough man on the whole one more reason to stay quiet about the way the anathemas were translated and indeed benedict and my father exchanged a couple of cordial letters my father writing in greek which the papal secretaries could render into latin for the bishop of rome i hoped more accurately than they had the anathemas and the pope in latin which despite its being little used in these parts save in the army and to a lesser degree among lawyers we managed to puzzle out one day my father summoned me and my brother herakleios to the metropolitans church near the palace a crumbling wreck of a building seldom used for anything i went unwillingly for the summons meant i could not keep an assignation i had made with some girl or another at fifteen which i was then you feel your life will be blighted forever if you do not dip your wick on the instant but had i disobeyed my father i knew perfectly well what sort of unpleasant things would have happened to me and so though unwilling i went i was surprised to find not only my father but also george the ecumenical patriarch awaiting herakleios and me i was even more surprised to find theoktistes the barber waiting with them whats this father i asked youre not making us into monks are you herakleios laughed at that one of the few times i remember making him laugh but i wondered if i was joking had my father decided for some secret reason of his own to be rid of us what easier way than shaving our heads and clapping us into a monastery monastic houses are easy to enter but hard to leave but my father shook his head no hardly he said and i relaxed he went on the bishop of rome this benedict has asked if he might become your spiritual father and i have agreed he made the sign of the holy cross a man can never have too many prayers in this world and those from a good and pious man will surely be effective as a token that i do agree to this spiritual adoption justinian i will send him a lock of your hair and one of yours too herakleios that explained why theoktistes was there then george the patriarch who was present in lieu of the pope prayed while theoktistes snipped a lock from where my hair grew long behind my ears and then did the same with my brother whose hair was several shades darker than mine the barber wrapped my hair in a square of red silk herakleioss in a square of green and handed them both to my father well done my father said as if theoktistes did not make his living trimming hair i shall have the artisans fashion a container suitably fine for such a rich gift and send it on to the pope in rome may his prayers sustain both of you as the blessing of the bishops of rome have helped me since i decided to convene the ecumenical synod and restore and renew the orthodox faith may it be so herakleios and i said together both of us crossing ourselves alas god whose judgment in all things is beyond the ken of mere men chose for his ineffable reasons not to grant my fathers wish my brother herakleios died three months to the day after theoktistes cut the locks from our hair when he fell ill no one not ever peter the physician was much concerned over the years he had shown he fell ill at any excuse or none and always managed to recover but not this time i hardly remember the earliest course of his illness at most i would have thought something like mother of god has the little wart caught another cold he milked his diseases for all they were worth and i often wondered whether he was as sick as he made himself out to be or if he was faking to get sympathy he did not deserve after a couple of days neither i nor anyone else thought he was faking his fever rose till his face looked and felt like redhot iron he coughed and coughed and coughed and would not could not stop weak lungs had been the death of our greatgrandfather and they were the death of herakleios too peter did everything he could with poultices and plasters and fomentations smelling tinglingly of mint but to no avail after raving in delirium herakleios slipped into a sleep from which he never wakened he had just reached his tenth year anyones death brings mourning and lamentation from those who knew and loved him a childs death comes doubly hard for in it the natural order of things is reversed and the old must lay the young in his grave and when the child who died was son to the emperor of the romans that cast all of constantinople into gloom because herakleios like me had never been crowned junior emperor my father chose not to bury him in the church of the holy apostles which has served as the final resting place of emperors and their consorts since the days of constantine the great instead he was laid to rest in one of the hypagogai the underground vaults used for the interment of the nobles of the imperial city my father my mother and i all wearing black robes all beating our breasts and wailing followed the servants who bore my brothers pitifully small corpse shrouded in white linen to its tomb beneath the rituals of grief my feelings were curiously mixed he was my brother true and i had grown used resigned might be a better word to having him around but then again in the imperial family having brothers was dangerous i needed to look no further than the case of my father and my uncles to prove that to me suppose i became emperor of the romans would herakleios have tried to steal the throne from me as his uncle herakleios tried to steal it from my father maybe i was better off without him surely god will take his soul into heaven my mother wailed poor chick he was too young to have stained himself with sin i made the sign of the cross now that herakleios was gone from the earth i did wholeheartedly wish him to join god rather than having demons drag him down to eternal torment but i also crossed myself for the sake of my own soul every fornication with a maidservant back to that first one with irene smote me like a slap in the face how would i defend myself before the judge of all when my time came to stand in his presence fear of death fires every mans faith could we live our lives thinking each moment likely to be our last how much better and more pious the world would be we went down into the hypagoge and laid herakleioss body in the niche that had been readied for it lamps made the underground chamber bright incense spiced the still quiet air george the ecumenical patriarch prayed for my brothers soul though what he might have said that would have moved god if my mothers plea failed was beyond me then the mourners who had accompanied us departed one by one taking their lamps with them until at last only we and the patriarch and a single lamp burning before herakleioss last resting place were left we went upstairs he stayed behind all alone soon so soon the lamp would gutter out as had his poor life it had begun to rain while we were in the hypagoge the very heavens mourn your loss george said if the heavens mourn why did they allow it my mother said harshly george did not answer that question has no answer nor ever had nor ever shall have save only the will of god which may not be questioned sorrows hunt in packs or so it seems just when you are over the first or sometimes before you are over the first along comes another to tear at you till you wonder how you can bear griefs piled one upon another like pelion upon ossa the only way to make them more terrible would be to have them known in advance as they are to god and even that might let you prepare for them so far as it is granted to mankind to prepare for anything autumn passed into winter winter into spring spring into summer i wish i could say the sense of sin that filled me at my brothers funeral persisted and enabled me to maintain bodily continence but i know too well it is not so within weeks no the truth here within days i found a new washerwoman a girl actually she was younger than i who stirred me and nothing would do but that i storm the fortress of her virginity which i discovered in due course someone had conquered before me my life as life has a way of doing went back to its usual rut in all senses of the word the same was true for my parents though for them and especially for my mother sorrow lingered longer my father seemed in better health than he had in some time being less afflicted by both his gout and his kidney stones than had been so of late perhaps to celebrate his reborn feeling of wellbeing one hot muggy evening not long after the summer solstice he doused his plate of roast kid with half a pitchers worth of fermented fish sauce i remember my mother wagging a finger at him i wish you wouldnt do that in this weather she said in mild reproof fish doesnt stay good oh rubbish anastasia he said and to show he would not be thwarted poured on the rest of what was in the pitcher till his meat was fairly swimming in sauce far more than he would have normally used he ate it with every sign of enjoyment being the man he was he would have done that i am certain even had he despised it but he always was fond of kid in fish sauce dessert was as splendid a honey cake as the cooks ever made with fine fine flour mixed with boiled must to give the sweetness a winy tinge and covered over with candied figs and apricots had it been given to me alone i would have gone through it like an army sacking a town without a wall as things were i begrudged my parents the slices a servant set on their plates my father did not finish his at least not right away he left the table suddenly with a startled look on his face ill be back he told my mother and me keep eating had he not spoken up we should have had to stop too the custom being that everyone is done when the emperor rises he returned some little while later by which time i had done formidable damage to that part of the cake which had not been served out at once in the lamplight his face was shiny with sweat and a little pale as he sat down once more are you all right my mother asked for he had been fine when he left his chuckle sounded both forced and selfconscious which last was most unlike him perhaps i should have listened to you about the fish sauce dear he said again the sort of admission he seldom made that was unpleasant he picked up his slice of honey cake and began to eat but had taken only a couple of more bites when he had to rush away again there do you see my mother said severely when he came back once more youve gone and given yourself a flux of the bowels so i have he said through clenched teeth he made no move to finish the cake now but gulped wine no doubt hoping it would restore him a little color came back to his face a hectic splotch of red over each cheekbone he breathed slowly and carefully as if each inhalation hurt maybe you should go to bed father i said for he had not looked much worse during his most savage attacks of stone yes maybe i should he answered and i knew then he was seriously ill he rose and started for the door halfway there his departure turned into an undignified dash with that gait he was running for the latrine not the bedchamber im going to send for the physician i declared as if i expected my mother to argue with me had she argued i would have overridden her but she said not a word she nodded to me her eyes wide and worried i pointed to a servant and told him to fetch peter at once instead of leading peter to my father the idiot brought him back to the dining room the physician looked first at my mother then at me dyspepsia he asked he could be more cutting with fewer words than any other man i have known the others approaching him also mostly being physicians seeing so many sick and dying people they have but small chance of helping does something to their spirits just as experience in war inures a man to gore we are well thank god i said resolving to have the servant whipped for his stupidity which i did the next day despite the chaos engulfing the palace you need to attend my father i explained the symptoms and how they had suddenly come upon him peter looked grave you did well to call me anything with bad fish in it is not to be taken lightly he bowed to me then to my mother and hurried off toward the imperial bedchamber now i drank unwatered wine a large goblet though in hopes of restoring my spirit rather than my body my mother spent the time until the physician returned praying quietly to god and to the altogether immaculate virgin i prayed too wishing all the while i could do something more for as long as i can remember i have been one who prefers acting to waiting for the actions of others here unable to act i felt it acutely when peter returned i did not like the flat blank expression he wore like a mask well i demanded my voice cracking i was after all but newly turned sixteen he is not well prince not well at all the physician answered he suffers from a violent derangement of the entrails with the bloody flux typically accompanying such derangements i told him not to drench his kid in fish sauce my mother said peter bowed would that he had listened to you what can you do for him i asked always the critical question when dealing with a physician identifying an illness is oftentimes easier than treating it i have given him a large dose of poppy juice peter answered not only will this relieve some of the discomfort from which he suffers but its constipating action should to some degree oppose his diarrhea to some degree i said surprised like anyone who could afford it i used poppy juice to fight disturbances of the bowels it always plugged me tighter than the bung driven into a barrel for days at a time but the physician replied yes to some degree prince as i said this is a violent derangement and i would hesitate to offer a prognosis before seeing how nearly the poppy brings the flux under control with a small shock i realized he was telling me my fathers life was endangered my mother grasped that a moment after i did and let out a keening cry of despair as if my father had already passed from the world of men my father had been strong for her when herakleios died who now would be strong if my father died no one but i could do that becoming a man i discovered had aspects less enjoyable than hiking up a maidservants tunic and yanking down her drawers it will be all right i told my mother though i knew nothing of the sort she nodded trying to reassure me as i was trying to reassure her i got up from my seat ill go see him now and i my mother said her voice small but determined peter hurried ahead of us i started to order him back then held my tongue my father might tolerate a physician catching him squatting over the pot but would not want me or my mother to see him in the throes of such fleshly weakness after going into the bedchamber peter emerged and nodded the drug has begun to take effect at least on his spirit he said he does want to see both of you though as if he were a common servant himself he held the door open for my mother and me even before i went inside the sickroom stench hit me i knew it all too well from my brothers room a combination of the chamber pot sour sweat and medicaments of one sort or another here though the odor was sharper harsher than i had smelled it before it had a metallic stink i could not place till i remembered the doctor had spoken of a bloody flux my father lay on the bed as if he had been poured there as if not even an earthquake that threw the palace down around him could make him get up and move his eyes traveled slowly from me to my mother and back again the lamps were not bright but his pupils were so small he might have stood in noontime sun an effect of the poppy juice i learned later bless you he said to both of us his voice was thick and slow and slurred as if he were drunk pray for me i have things left to do he seemed to want to say something more but his eyelids slid down over his eyes a moment later he began to snore how large a draught of the poppy did you give him my mother asked peter had spirit answering as large as i judged he could stand if his dysentery is not abated he spread his hands if god grants my prayer he will sleep the day around and be better when he wakes and if not i said roughly before the physician could reply my father grunted softly in his drugged sleep the latrine stink grew gaggingly thick so did the iron odor of blood hes fouled himself my mother cried she rushed to tend him with her own hands as she gently stripped my father of his robe and wiped the bloodstreaked dung from his buttocks and legs with cloths she wet from a pitcher i looked to peter and saw him make the sign of the cross he caught my eye and murmured pray indeed prince its out of my hands now he pitched his voice low so my mother would not hear but how could she help but understand that for herself for the next three days she cared for my father herself driving away the servants who tried to help me she tolerated and peter the physician though him just barely and less and less as it became clear his nostrums would not make my father well she must have slept some during that time but if she did i did not see it my fathers life flowed out of him in a foulsmelling tide if the poppy juice could not stem the dysentery it did keep him from feeling any great pain when he was awake which happened at irregular intervals by both day and night he knew who my mother and i were i do not think he knew he was dying because of the drug he had no clear notion of time once he exclaimed in surprise that suddenly it was night when a moment before the sun had been shining into the bedchamber the hours between simply did not exist for him not long before the end he looked at me and said high time we found a girl for you justinian by your age id already married your mother yes father i said he surely knew i was no virgin he wanted me to have a wife though i seemed obedient the idea of being limited to one woman did not appeal to me still he was right for the sake of the dynasty i needed an heir and a legitimate one and even had he been wrong who would contradict a man on what was plainly his deathbed someone i do not know who perhaps my mother perhaps peter perhaps stephen the persian or some other palace functionary summoned george the ecumenical patriarch to administer the sacrament of unction to my father george looked in need of unction himself his own health was visibly failing my father did not wake while the patriarch anointed him and prayed for the forgiveness of his sins he roused a little while afterwards his eyes found mine he inhaled once deeply i thought he was going to tell me something ever so slowly his breath sighed out his eyes stayed open when i moved they did not follow me i gestured to peter he felt for a pulse then let the wrist drop limp first the right then the left he closed my fathers eyes myakes after herakleios none of that dynasty lived to grow old they didnt last long but god and all the saints they burned hot while they were here strange to think about it brother elpidios but do you know constantine could be alive today hed be eighty more or less a great age aye but not an impossible one he was a fine man while he lived maybe even a great one when you remember all he did while he ruled and hes been gone these past fortyfive years and more and who thinks about him today you and me inside this monastery and nobody else in the whole wide world thats what fame in the world is worth peace with the lord is better or maybe having some fun in the world and then peace with the lord oh dont click your tongue between your teeth at me brother werent you the one who was asking questions about women and all right ill not go on not if you say it upsets you it didnt upset you then it yes brother constantine a fine man as i say and a pious man a good christian yes if hed lived longer he might have tried holding the empire on a more peaceful course but he didnt live longer that left it up to justinian he had his own ideas about things and now no one to tell him no justinian my fathers washed and anointed body lay in state in the throne room for two days he faced east as is the custom his arms formed in the sign of the cross on his chest a holy icon in his right hand candles and incense burned to either side of him my mother and i spent most of our time there lamenting while nobles and clergy and soldiers and common people filed past to look on him one last time and to mourn with us we laid him to rest in the church of the holy apostles he being the emperor no other choice was conceivable for the second time in little more than half a year my mother and i dressed in black paraded through the streets of the godguarded and imperial city to lay our nearest kin to rest my fathers body still dressed in imperial robes as it had been while it lay in state rested in a wooden coffin on a blackpainted cart drawn by a pair of lowing oxen excubitores in black surcoats their spears fixed with black streamers marched to either side of the cart behind my mother and me came a great crowd of nobles and palace servants all of them crying out their grief that the lord of the inhabited world the vicegerent of god on earth was dead the people of constantinople lined the mese and packed the squares of the city to bid my father a last farewell what will we do without constantine my mother shrieked over and over again i set my hand on her shoulder i will care for the empire now i said and care for you as well she shook me off i pray to god you make a good emperor as you are a good son she said but you are not my husband nor can you be she was far from an old woman and i at thoughtless sixteen did not understand how much of her life had come to an end along with my fathers past the church of st euphemia through the forum of constantine and through the forum of theodosios the funeral procession made its slow sorrowful way then we proceeded northwest up the mese toward the kharisian gate past the church of st polyeuktos after the church of the holy wisdom perhaps the grandest in the city past the column of the emperor markianos on the opposite side of the thoroughfare and on to the church of the holy apostles less than a bowshot from the remnants of the first inadequate wall constantine the great had built for the new rome that came to bear his name the church of the holy apostles resembles that of st john in ephesos being of cruciform plan with five domes the excubitores lifted my fathers coffin down from the cart and carried it into the church the mosaic on the floor of the narthex showed constantine the great offering the basilica to christ my mother and i both crossed ourselves as we walked over the mosaic and into the church itself after setting the coffin on a stand next to the altar the excubitores withdrew my mother went up into the womens gallery whence she could gaze down on my father or the mortal part of him for the last time george the patriarch prayed for my fathers soul as he had for that of my brother and also prayed for the roman empire as is usual when an emperor passes from men we are fortunate he said in a slow voice that put me in mind of nothing so much as a tired man scuffing through dry leaves plainly his patriarchate would not long outlast my fathers reign we are fortunate i say that constantine who must now sit at the right hand of god left behind for us a successor who being just now arrived at the first flush of manhood will surely rule for many long and prosperous years i stood straighter till then i had been so consumed with my fathers passing and with readying his funeral i had not thought ahead to what would be my reign now i did just for a moment my father had not run the roman empire as i would have nor had he heeded me when i told him as much the power had been his now it was mine i could make changes i would make changes soon george having finished celebrating the liturgy my mother came back down to the main level of the church the excubitores returned and lifting the coffin carried it down the marble stairs to the mausoleum below i followed as did my mother and george the ecumenical patriarch had trouble going downstairs after a moment a priest hurried up to lend him support despite torches and candles and lamps the air in the mausoleum was cool and rather damp i went from one sarcophagus to another reading the great names the first constantine the first theodosios who beat the last pagan army in the west and ended the olympic games the second theodosios who erected the walls fortifying constantinople to this day the justinian for whom i was named and my greatgreatgrandfather herakleios my father would rest in worthy company the excubitores set down the coffin that had borne my father from the great palace to the church of the holy apostles they lifted his remains from the coffin and placed him in the stone sarcophagus that awaited him when they set the lid on the sarcophagus my mother wailed anew console yourself empress with the knowledge that your husband has gone from this world into one far better one where he will know god face to face the ecumenical patriarch told her pausing for a moment in his prayers what you say is true my mother answered through her tears but life is hard for those left behind that also being true george bowed his head in silent agreement his lips had a bluish tinge to them before long he too would know god face to face when the last prayers were over and we went out of the mausoleum the young strong priest had george put an arm around his neck and bore most of his weight and the climb upstairs while performing his ecclesiastical duties the patriarch was strong and vigorous when he had to be a mere man he faded either his spirit or the spirit of god working within him imbued him with holy zeal in the same way that soldiers in the heat of battle perform prodigies of valor they cannot even contemplate when times are quiet once on the main level of the church george sank panting into a chair with a back of carved ivory that had been placed by the altar perhaps for just such a need i strode up to him and said i hope you will be well soon that was true i did not expect it but i hoped he caught all the meanings underlying my words i will be well enough he said for your coronation i assumed the imperial crown four days later a week to the day after my fathers passing instead of the black robes of mourning i donned for the first time the full imperial regalia the long red tunic the skaramangion over it the cloak known as the sagion or in the ancient usage the chlamys in purple with goldembroidered border and ornamented with shimmering pearls the long bejeweled scarf of the loros draped over my chest in the shape of the letter chi x symbolizing christs holy and victorious cross and on my feet the tzagia the purple boots permitted to the emperor alone the procession from the great palace to the church of the holy wisdom was not what i had imagined it would be when i was small i had thought of being crowned a junior emperor like my uncles and had expected them to be there along with my father and my brother but they were mutilated and exiled and my brother and father dead i was the center of every eye and would be for as long as i ruled for the rest of my life i thought not knowing all that lay before me my mother still in black walked behind me to the great church excubitores now resplendent once more rather than somber kept back the people who crowded close some of the peoples exuberance surely was due to the pleasure constantinopolitans take at spectacle of any sort but more sprang from the silver miliaresia and gold nomismata palace servitors flung into the crowd as largesse to celebrate my coronation late in my fathers reign the imperial mint was lucky enough to find a certain cyril an engraver of such genius that he could show a mans perfect portrait in the compass of a coin no broader than a thumbnail having made the last nomismata of my fathers reign marvels to behold he now worked his magic with me some of the gold pieces the servitors gave out had my picture on them as i looked then under the imperial diadem i would don that day a long thin face with rather pinched cheeks and a narrow pointed chin as my beard was still thin and spotty i shaved my cheeks and jaw a practice i would soon give up i do not know what prodigies of labor cyril required to ready these new nomismata for the day but ready they were and ready and more than ready the crowds were to receive them fights broke out among the people struggling for them as always happens at such affairs so long as men battled only with fists and elbows and knees the excubitores took no notice of their sport but when just as we arrived at the church of the holy wisdom one ruffian stuck a knife into another not twenty feet from where i stood the guardsmen waded into the crowd and seized him the victim i believe recovered stephen the persian turned to me emperor must we give out this largesse he asked in his sweet eunuchs voice it brings with it nothing but strife wed have worse strife if we didnt i answered the people expect it and if they dont get what they expect he sniffed mob rule he said disdainfully and though i think more than half his objection sprang from spending the money i have seen enough of demokratia since that day to admit he had a point and since in his blind avidity for gold he incited the mob against him among other outrages but my pen races years ahead of events to divert the city mob from its squabbles over coins i signaled for the excubitores to raise me on a shield thereby showing the army accepted me as legitimate heir to my father the four men chosen for the ceremony were christopher the count of the excubitores his mandator theodore of koloneia of whom i have already had a good deal to say a captain who must then have been prominent but of whom i remember nothing save a huge black mole right between his eyes and faithful myakes i promoted him to officers rank so he would not seem out of place alongside his colleagues in the ceremony to my surprise he tried to refuse the promotion surely one of the rare instances in the history of the roman empire where a man sought to avoid aggrandizing himself rather than the reverse but when i ordered him to accept he obeyed for how can any man refuse the command of the emperor myakes christian humility brother elpidios i wish i could take credit for it but thats not what made me want to stay a simple soldier why did i nothing simpler i was happy right where i was the duty was easy the pay was fine i had plenty of good food to eat and good wine to drink and the girls were just as impressed by a plain excubitor as they would have been by a fancy one if you take my meaning officers yelled officers worried officers had to keep track of a pack of wild men like me from where i stood it looked like too much work to be worth the bother and when justinian promoted me in spite of my squawks i found out i was right it was too much work to be worth the bother but hes right once hed said yes i couldnt say no justinian these four men then hoisted me up on that shield for the crowd to see though no emperor had been crowned for almost a generation the people knew and some at least had been rehearsed in their role tu vincas justinian they shouted and then other acclamations some of them quite antiquated suitable for the occasion many years justinian justinian ruler of the world flourish justinian bestower of honors then came a new acclamation one devised by stephen the persian hail justinian restorer of a rich name i stood on the shield supported by the stalwart shoulders of myakes and of the three other officers of the excubitores waving out to the people letting them see me and letting them get used to the idea that i rather than my father would be appearing on ceremonial occasions from now on they waved back at me and kept on cheering more i daresay for the diversion i represented than for any virtues inherent in myself an elephant might have done even better but we had no elephants so they had to content themselves with me after the city mob had gawped at me long enough i looked down at christopher and hissed get on with it the count of the excubitores myakes theodore of koloneia and that captain whoever he was slowly carried me into the church of the holy wisdom the folk outside bore up philosophically at being deprived of my presence for the palace servitors threw fresh handfuls of coins into the crowd the people inside the great church were of more consequence to me for i would rule through the highranking bureaucrats and soldiers and clerics who packed it tight their robes made a bright rainbow of color within the church these men and their wives and daughters and no doubt concubines in the womens gallery above shouted acclamations as the common people had outside i stared down from my high perch along with the army these men had to acknowledge me their sovereign as they were doing then one of my bearers missed a step that added to my own inattention nearly made me fall off the shield whose bronze surface was smooth almost slick and smash my head on the floor of the great church a worse omen at a coronation i can hardly imagine but myakes bless him reached up with his free hand and caught me by the ankle till i steadied just as he had stopped me from leaping off the city wall when the deniers of christ besieged constantinople we reached the ambo without further mishap george the patriarch stood there waiting leaning on a stick to take some of the weight from his legs his vestments of silk and wool worked with gems and pearls and gold threads in the shape of many crosses rivaled the imperial regalia in splendor on the ambo rested a cushion of purple silk embroidered with eagles in gold thread and on that cushion sat the crown that had for so many years been my fathers its golden circle of bejeweled and enameled panels the glittering prependoulia that dangled from it and its surmounting cross were of surpassing magnificence theodore of koloneia caught the eyes of the rest of my bearers at his nod not that of christopher his nominal superior all four men went to one knee lowering the shield so i could descend they rose once more having gained my full height by then i was taller than any of them though they were all thicker through the shoulders george the ecumenical patriarch beckoned i went to him setting his hand on my head he called out holy in a voice so loud and dee p no one would have guessed him ill at the coronations of frankish kings i have heard they are smeared with scented oil in imitation of biblical practice no such ritual existing among us the patriarch offered the customary prayers for the occasion altering them slightly to stress christs two energies and two wills as defined by the recently past ecumenical synod and finishing may god bless his servant and our master the emperor justinian had my father been crowning me junior emperor the patriarch would have stepped aside then and let him set the crown on my head junior emperors are made and unmade by the will of the emperor but my father was gone george crowned me a sign i was receiving the symbol of my new station by the will of god the crown was heavy almost oppressively so it surprised me gold combines small bulk with great weight i wondered how my father had put up with wearing it hour after hour day after day year after year and now having worn it so long myself i take its weight altogether for granted when the maddog usurpers mutilated me and exiled me to lonely kherson on the peninsula jutting down into the black sea from the north my neck felt curiously limber for some weeks so accustomed had it grown to supporting the crown along with my head i had to get used to it all over again when i took back what was rightfully mine a burden i assumed with pleasure no matter how heavy the crown felt there in the great church i knew i had to bear it without complaint or flinching and so i stood very straight and very still looking a challenge out to the dignitaries who were looking in at me and trying to take my measure i do not know what they thought of me as they shouted for the acclamationstu vincas justinian many years to the emperor justinian that with those of the people with my being raised on a shield by the soldiers and with the patriarchs coronation formalized my accession to the throne what i thought was now i rule you all and you had better obey book b justinian romans i said loudly pitching my voice to carry and doing my best to make sure it stayed deep romans i stand before you full of grief grief that my father who fought so fiercely to force back the followers of the false prophet now no longer dwells among men and rules romania but has so soon gone to earn gods reward for his greatness here on earth i made the sign of the cross so did the ecumenical patriarch so did many of the dignitaries in the great church many of them were up on their toes leaning forward slightly so as to be able to capture every word and from those words to try to divine the future course of the roman empire that suited me i had no intention of hiding my aims on the contrary i said as much as my father wished to be most beloved by the barbarians so he who is now emperor of the romans wishes to be most feared by them all so that no barbarians might invade our provinces and do them harm we shall as soon as may be trouble them with continuous attacks a sigh went through the church of the holy wisdom the wars would not begin at once it was too late in the season to start a campaign but begin they would my father had told me i could set my own course when the empire rested in my hands and i aimed to do just that romans tu vincas should not be only an idle acclamation spoken and then forgotten i said earnestly nor is passivity preferable to fighting the peace we have with the bulgars a peace existing for no other reason than that it is bought and sold is shameful and slavish better by far to bear wounds in our bodies than in our souls before long the barbarians shall learn a lasting lesson i paused the notables cheered nothing else was possible i was the emperor i had defined as i had the right to define the direction the roman empire would take their task was to make it go in that direction nothing more they sensed as much giving me the cry of tu vincas again over and over till the ancient latin words came echoing back from the great dome that as some writer from the age of my namesake says seems more as if it is suspended from the sky by a golden chain than a part of any merely earthly building i paraphrase without the book before me i fear up to this time all acclamations had gone to my father save for rare moments like that in the forum of constantine hearing hundreds of prominent people shouting my praises was heady as strong wine i had not yet learned those nobles and clerics and soldiers would acclaim a usurper a rebel a tyrant as fulsomely as their legitimate lord with the crown on my head i strode out of the great church to receive fresh plaudits from the people i already knew the city mob was fickle anyone attending two days racing at the hippodrome could have said as much but for now they were all with me and i basked in their acclaim like a fence lizard basking in the sun on the procession returning to the palace the servitors helped keep the people happy by throwing more coins out to them as at the church of the holy wisdom struggling over the nomismata and miliaresia seemed as enjoyable as having them a tagline from some pagan play ran through my mind man seeks god and seeking finds him and is not gold a god for far too many when i was back at the palace my palace now i thought of summoning a serving girl to my chamber and celebrating my accession in the most enjoyable fashion i could imagine then all at once i recalled my fathers deathbed words to me he had been more than half out of his wits with sickness and poppy juice but that did not mean he had made no sense instead of some lively wench i called for stephen the persian when he came before me he prostrated himself that took me aback another reminder i was the emperor i told him to rise and then said fetch my mother and having brought her you stay as well i would take counsel with the two of you he bowed in obedience and hurried away like every palace servitor he had always been attentive to my wants what he was now was as far beyond attentiveness as that was beyond indifference i had not realized the power the emperor enjoys until it fell into my hands and i could feel of it stephen returned with my mother a few minutes later the eunuch parakoimomenos wore a fine robe of seagreen samite shot through with silver threads a fitting bit of splendor for my coronation ceremony but an odd contrast to my mothers black wool of mourning her face bore a curious mix of expressions partly the stunned sorrow that had held her since her husband died partly pride that her son should have succeeded to the lordship of the world both of them stood silent after a moment i saw they were waiting for me to speak another imperial perquisite i had not before encountered i came straight to the point i think i should wed and as quickly as possible too my mother nodded at once she too remembered my fathers words i think you are wise you are the last man of your line and gods will is unknowable to us we have seen that her voice went ragged with pain as she crossed herself if the family is to go ona she nodded again while i would not presume to disagree with the emperors wise wordsa stephens strange voice was as always dulcet beautifully modulated he was a courtier through and through to disagree by denying he was disagreeing his decorous pause allowed me to order him to silence if i so chose when i waved for him to go on he did saying the treasury having been strained by todays festivities will for some little while be in poor condition to absorb the further expenses inherent in a wedding celebration and so it might be more prudent to wait and now i did cut him off with a harsh chopping motion of my right hand the nomismata in the treasury are not yours stephen i said sharply they belong to the empire and to the emperor to me if i say they shall be spent on my wedding they shall do you understand stephen bowed i do indeed emperor my only thought was to serve both you and the treasury as well as i could looking back on it i suppose he hated me at the time i neither noticed nor cared he would obey that was what mattered i turned to my mother but whom shall i marry i knew by then a good deal about bedding serving maids and just enough to realize that was not the same as picking a wife i did not even know which of the notable men of constantinople had daughters of marriageable age the women of the wealthy and prominent live sheltered lives and are not casually seen by men outside their families i certainly did not know which of those daughters of marriageable age might suit me we must think carefully my mother said her voice more lively than it had been since my father first took ill we must look at the character of the girl at who her relatives are at her dowry stephen the persian put in my mother nodded albeit reluctantly that does matter but less here than it would in another marriage if the emperor must depend on his wifes brideportion for what he needs the roman empire has fallen on hard times indeed true stephen admitted but everything else being the same more is better than less gold never goes to waste yes he was one of those who spoke the word gold as another might say god i noted that then and put it to use later i shall inquire my mother said she had something to do now some direction in which to go the smile she gave me was wan but it was a smile is there anything more emperor it was the first time she called me what i now was i shook my head dismissing her and stephen having given them a purpose i soon found one of my own the one i had rejected before soon i was frolicking with one of the blond sklavinians not irene but another one if i was to be restricted to a wife thereafter i would enjoy myself while i could one thing i quickly discovered when the bridegroom is to be the emperor of the romans every family in the city has an eligible indeed an ideal daughter or imagines it has some of these my mother quickly eliminated from consideration no i did not want to marry the headsmans daughter or a screaming harridan of thirtyfive who remained unwed and undoubtedly virgin because every man who got near her had fled in terror or a girl who although of the requisite age and social standing had the misfortune or the greed to be wider than she was tall she would not suit you my mother said seriously speaking of this last candidate there are appetites and then there are appetites i stared at her it was the first time i had ever seen ever thought of her as a woman rather than merely as my mother the first time i truly realized what losing my father meant to her not knowing what to say i kept silent over the next few weeks she and stephen the persian winnowed the list down to three among these i cannot choose she said best you should meet them all and pick which one suits you and so i did zoe the daughter of florus the patrician was like the general in being clever and plainspoken unfortunately she also looked like him and florus while fearsome to his foes was also fearsome to behold i was sure floruss status and her own good sense would get zoe a match one day but it would not be with me anna was the daughter of john the eparch of the city but although john had the brains to administer constantinople a quarter hours conversation convinced me anna had none in her head or concealed anywhere else about her person she was pretty and well made which tempted me but before making up my mind i decided to see the third of the girls my mother and the parakoimomenos thought a possible match for me before i did meet eudokia i teased my mother saying this whole business reminds me of the way ill choose a new patriarch when old george dies the synod of bishops will send me three names and ill pick one from among them choose wisely then my mother answered choose wisely now too and so i met eudokia the daughter of philaretos her father was count of the walls the officer in charge of maintaining the long wall the fortification protecting the part of thrace nearest constantinople from barbarian attack philaretos was a less prominent man than either florus or john which had advantages and disadvantages both while he brought less influence than either of the other two men he was also less likely to get above his station and think that being fatherinlaw to the emperor entitled him to conduct himself as if he not i ruled the romans i dined with philaretos and his family in the tribunal of the nineteen akkubita a ceremonial hall that stephen the persian assured me had been built in the reign of constantine the great the count of the walls was bluff and affable his wife marina plump and pleasant her father having lately died she and my mother who were about of an age commiserated together philaretos also had a couple of sons one older than i one younger neither of them said much no doubt they had been told to keep their mouths shut unless i spoke to them beyond bare politeness i did not i was more interested in their sister eudokia was close to my age half a year younger it turned out when we compared birthdates she was less lushly put together than anna but far from displeasing unlike poor homely zoe her hair was dark like her fathers but showed little reddish glints when the lamplight shone on it her eyes were an interesting color somewhere between brown and green i wondered whether philaretos or marina had a sklavinian or a german down near the roots of the family tree she said thank you for inviting us into the city emperor because of my fathers post i come here less often than i would if i could when she smiled not brazenly but not as if in apology either she showed good teeth i liked her voice too not squeaky not raspy but smooth like wellaged wine but do you come less often than your father would like i asked out in thrace you have less chance to spend his money if you marry her emperor thatll be your worry not mine philaretos said with a laugh more than most men would have dared sitting where he was hell be able to afford it better than you can father eudokia said which was also daring though certainly true the feast and the talk afterwards went on longer than they had when i was meeting zoe or anna the servants kept bringing in wine and we kept drinking it philaretos did a hilarious impression of a bulgar with a hangover even my mother and his wife in mourning though they were laughed till they had to hold on to each other to stop when sometime close to midnight or perhaps after it we rose from the table eudokia said thank you again for inviting my family and me here emperor i enjoyed myself i realized i had enjoyed myself too i had not particularly expected to i had looked on the dinner as something i needed to do not something i wanted to do a woman with whom i could enjoy myself if that was not a recipe for a wife what was my mother was in a sour mood the next morning probably from too much wine and not enough sleep are you trying to imitate philaretoss bulgar i asked and won from her half a smile then i said of the three of them i choose eudokia that did lighten her mood oh good she said i hoped you would but i wondered if you would rather have anna because of her looks not that eudokia isnt a nicelooking young girl she added hastily as if afraid she might make me change my mind i like the way she smiles i said the night i met your father i was too nervous to smile my mother said by the look in her eye that night was very close to the present in her mind he forgave me she seemed to come back to thinking about me may god grant you and eudokia many years many children and much happiness she crossed herself so did i god has his own purposes he must weigh the happiness of my family against other matters in his scales and find it comes to not so much of course he has all of his plan before his eyes at all times where for us humans it unfolds bit by bit myakes justinian hit too close to the mark there brother elpidios and he didnt see all of it though he heard the last anastasia had to witness every bit of that houses misfortune right down to the end i wonder how she bore so much sorrow and what happened to her at last so many things we never get to know justinian stephen the persian conducting the negotiations over eudokias dowry those went quickly and were settled to my entire satisfaction maybe i ought to put you in charge of the treasury i told him i was joking at the time but remembered the words later he having proved himself both skilled and diligent we announced the betrothal just after the end of summer with the wedding to be held in november at my mothers invitation eudokia and her family were installed in the great palace philaretos delegating his duties to a subordinate until the wedding before my father died he had paid the bulgars their yearly tribute so we had no reason to expect trouble either from them or from the seven sklavinian tribes they had brought under their control and indeed all remained peaceful in the north as it did with the arabs their misnamed commander of the faithful sent an ambassador congratulating me on my accession i suppose in the hope i would continue my fathers policy on that frontier as well i did not say no i did not say yes having eudokia in the palace was awkward in a way my mother might not have considered on inviting her on the wedding night eudokia needed to show herself a virgin which meant i could not indulge myself with her beforehand but with her there i hesitated to take the serving girls to bed lest they bring back tales to her or foolishly put on airs before her and so till the wedding day i lived a nearly monkish existence and was often shorttempered no angry on account of it everything concerning the emperor must be magnificent with his wedding no exception to the rule servants set up tables in every forum in the imperial city to feast the people i ordered chariot races for the amusement of the city mob though such amusements are no longer the allconsuming passion of the city as they were in the days of my namesake a century and a half ago the people would have thought me mean and niggardly had i omitted them as stephen had said all this took large sums of gold i wished my father had not paid the bulgars and i wished we collected more in tribute from the followers of the false prophet for most of what the empire raised in taxes on land and crops and commerce was promptly spent again on soldiers and dromons and buildings but despite dark mutterings from my ministers we had enough the day we had set dawned crisp and cool and clear a good omen i said to my mother as we got ready to parade to the church of the holy wisdom so the ecumenical patriarch could perform the marriage ceremony the way its rained the past week i was afraid wed have to splash through puddles all the way there your bride will be lovely she answered and then went on you chose well son eudokia is a fine girl the more i see of her the more i see to like yes i said enthusiastically responding more to the first part of that than to the second though i was looking forward to seeing far more of eudokia than i had yet i was also curious as the only virginity i had been involved in losing up till then was my own stephen the persian came in and fussily adjusted the way the ends of my loros crossed each other i wore the same regalia as i had to my coronation and as i had then i went bareheaded today i would don not the emperors crown but that of the bridegroom i could not see how eudokia looked as we left the palace which served for her in place of her parents home for as was customary she was veiled against all intrusive eyes mine included her white silk gown though fit tight enough to give me a new idea of her figure and i liked what i saw there when we got to the church of the holy wisdom and walked up to the altar george struggled to his feet to perform the marriage service he was by then almost literally on his last legs but still managed to make his voice carry as he asked us if we both consented to the marriage yes i said and then had to repeat myself so anyone but he and eudokia could hear me her voice was not loud but very clear yes one of the priests attending the patriarch handed him a sheathed sword on a belt swollen fingers fumbling he girded it round my waist a symbol of imperial power then slowly he turned to the altar and lifted the crowns of marriage from it where most folk make do with tinned copper ours were of gold he set one on my head the other on eudokias between where the crowns had lain stood a golden goblet the patriarch offered it first to me then to my bride we shared the wine the goblet held eudokia lifting her veil just enough to drink george read from the letter to the ephesians and from the book of john he prayed for long years together for us for happiness for children for prosperityfor you and for the empire he said as he would not have at a wedding for bride and groom of lower rank eudokia set a golden ring on my finger its bezel showing christ joining a couple together in marriage i gave her an iron ring in return a golden wedding belt waited at the nuptial chamber george took the crowns of marriage off us and handed them to myakes who despite my mothers grumbles and stephens sniffs served as my groomsman he hurried off to set them on the posts of the marriage bed for luck once the crowns were off george blessed us one last time bent his head in silent prayer and then with an effort straightened justinian and eudokia are wed he said what therefore god hath joined together let not man put asunder after that we paraded back to the great palace to the cheers of the nobles and officials and officers who had filled the church of the holy wisdom and to those of the common folk of constantinople as well no sooner were we out of the church than the epithalamia began the farther we went the louder and bawdier the wedding songs got if eudokia had not known what we would soon be doing and since she was a wellbroughtup maiden she might not have she would have been left in little doubt by the time we got to the palace the wine was already flowing freely there mimes and dancing girls entertained the guests my mother being the only family i had left in the world she and i and eudokia went into an antechamber for the ceremony of removing the brides veil i had of course seen eudokias face before but in theory i might not have seeing my mother nod encouragement eudokia took off the veil under it her cheeks were flushed perhaps from the crisp breeze outside perhaps from excitement too my husband she said sounding proud of herself as well she might have my wife i answered and then added my beautiful wife she looked down at the floor for modestys sake she had indeed been properly brought up but she was smiling god and the virgin bless both of you my children my mother said i was not thinking of god at that moment and of no virginity save my brides fix your veil again i told eudokia so i can lead you to the nuptial chamber so i can make you truly my wife was what i meant as the white veil concealed her features once more i thought she looked nervous and wondered what if anything her mother had told her of what happens on a wedding night everyone cheered when my mother and eudokia and i came out because everyone knew where eudokia and i were going and what we would be doing once we got there a good many people followed us down the hall bawling out epithalamia on that very theme some were far more specific than any sung on our way back to the palace i wondered what eudokia made of such gleeful obscenity just before we reached the door to the bedchamber she giggled that seemed a good sign even after we went inside and closed the door behind us the loud lewd racket went on the bed had on it only a plain white linen sheet on the posts faithful myakes had hung the marriage crowns take off your veil i said to eudokia were alone now soon she would take off more than the veil but maybe she did not want to think about that yet and i still had to give her the marriage belt which lay wrapped in white silk on a table by the bed i unwrapped it how the bright gold glittered twentyone small medallions and two large ones on either side of the clasp showing christ joining the right hands of bride and groom together i carried the belt over to eudokia and put it round her waist it fit perfectly a maidservant must have measured her for the jeweler she looked down at herself and at the splendid ornament how beautiful she whispered this was the first time i had touched any part of her but her hands i let my own hands linger on her hips how beautiful i said in an altogether different tone of voice she cast down her eyes once more a modest bride indeed but there is also a time when modesty should end and that time had come leaving one hand where it was i raised the other to her chin and tilted her face up to mine she looked nervous but determined which under the circumstances was as much as i could expect i quickly discovered she knew nothing about kissing of the sort in which a new groom and his bride are apt to engage she learned fast though my own first instructions in these mysteries were close enough in time that i remembered them and used them as a guide in teaching her while we kissed we clung to each other ever more tightly my manhood rose as it was pressed between us she must have noticed but she gave no sign that she did perhaps again from modesty perhaps because she simply did not know what to do i took one of her hands in mine and guided it down there she started to pull away when she felt the bulge but i held her hand there that is she said and then stopped half a statement half a question in two words yes it is i answered my voice full of what i would rather call enthusiasm than raw lust i took my hand away after a tiny hesitation she left hers where i had put it i nodded another lesson learned i needed both hands to undo the catch of the marriage belt my fingers trembled as i worked it a pity to take this off so soon after putting it on you buta then i had to step away from her for a moment to set the belt on the table once more when i came back to her i began to undo the catches that held her wedding gown closed she stood very still under my hands i slid the gown down off her it puddled at her feet the small nipples on her breasts were tight and hard more no doubt from nervousness than passion i bent my mouth to them first one then the other her breath caught that feels again she did not finish but she put on hand on the back of my head to keep me at what i was doing presently i pulled her drawers off her so that she stood naked before me i am a lucky man today i said and smiled the smile i had been practicing since before the little sklavinian girl took me into the storeroom then it was my turn to divest myself of my robes when i was through eudokia stared at me i knew how women were made and had learned from her nudity only the particulars of her body in my nakedness she saw for the first time the generality of maleness my erection stood out as straight as if i were about to fence with it ill try not to hurt you i said taking her hand and walking with her to the bed though it may the first time i spoke as if i knew in detail wanting to make her feel easy although as i have said the only virginity i knew was my own losing that had not hurt by no means we lay down together i did not go into her at once but kissed her and caressed her with my hands when i stroked her secret place she sighed and her legs which she had held tightly closed till then opened of themselves after a while my mouth followed my hand a maidservant had taught me that a year or so before sucking the fig she called it she and several others had seemed to like it more than a hand stroking the same place and so by her little gasps did eudokia without my asking she took me in her hand and laughed to feel me throb against her palm then on hands and knees i got up over her and guided myself inside her she being wet i went in easily until all at once i was halted eudokias face which had been full of surprised delight twisted in pain she was indeed a maiden i had not had any serious doubts on that score but proving it was a relief we must finish what weve begun i said and she nodded i thrust with all my strength and broke through the barrier eudokia did not cry out but her breath hissed through her nostrils i have heard soldiers make that sound when they take a wound is it all right i asked after a moment she nodded again slowly i began to move inside her bu t as my own heat built i forgot about restraint and soon gasped out my spasm of delight when i came back to myself i saw her eyes were tightly closed a tear had run down the side of her face from each of them she hissed again when i slid out of her i looked at myself at her at the stained sheet and nodded happy with the world no one would have cause to doubt i had taken her maidenhead she too sat up and looked at the blood that had come from between her legs you are truly my wife i said yes eudokia got off the bed and walking as if she had been on horseback for a long time poured some water from a pitcher into a basin soaked a rag in it and washed her private parts after a moment i did the same a wedding night of one round only is a poor wedding night indeed and i had in mind teaching her some things i had not shown her before our first joining being clean would help if i had the stamina now that i did then or if i had known then what i know now the night might have been even more memorable but it was quite fine enough as things were some time along toward midnight i stripped the sheet from the bed put on my robe and displayed the trophy to all the wedding guests who had not yet drunk themselves to sleep or gone off with a dancing girl loud raucous cheers greeted me what are you going to do now someone shouted go back in there and put some more stains on it i answered and the shouts that came echoing back were even more raucous than before to whoops of laughter i shut the door and proceeded to do as i had said i woke the next morning to sunlight streaming into the bedchamber eudokia lay naked beside me i thought about waking her with the same music to which we had fallen asleep when you are but sixteen you can contemplate such things after a night like the one we had had but even at sixteen that next round was far from urgent i rolled over and yawned and stretched feeling lazy and contented eudokias eyes came open she let out a startled squeak at finding herself in bed with a man but quickly remembered how and why that had happened proof of which being that although she started to cover herself with her hands she stopped with the motion half begun and let me look all i pleased my husband she said her eyes traveled from my face downwards sure enough i had begun to rise again i do not know whether she was impressed being ignorant of the ways of men she had no standard for comparison looking back across a quarter of a century i am certainly impressed and so we did play that same sweet tune over again myakes there you see brother elpidios you read that all through with only a handful of wheezes and hardly a splutter first times are strange but after youve done something once the second time is always a lot easier what do you mean that wasnt the reason you had an easier time here oh the other was just fornication and this was talking about real marriage and so not a sin in the eyes of god i see if the difference makes you happy brother far be it from me to argue with you even though justinian was doing the same things as before not all the same things oh sucking the fig yes they like that same as we like it when they play the flute for us no when you get right down to it i dont think theres anything in the holy scriptures against it its not the sin of onan for how can a woman spill her seed out on the ground she has no seed to spill now does she shes just fertile soil where a mans seed can grow you might even say hes watering that ground eh if youre really so curious brother elpidios why dont you ask the abbot what he thinks youre not that curious mm might be just as well read some more why dont you justinian marriage agreed with me being able to slake my lust whenever i felt like it agreed with me and eudokia and i got on when even when not joined together panting on the marriage bed she had an odd sideways way of looking at things that went on in the palace i suppose because she was not accustomed to the life from birth as i was that made me take the ancient customs less for granted too george the ecumenical patriarch died in the spring of my first year as emperor after rather less bickering than usual the local synod of bishops chose the three men from among whom i was to choose his successor paul kallinikos and theodore now theodore is far from the least common of names but having it presented here gave me pause i asked niketas who as synkellos to george administered churchly affairs until a new patriarch was installed is this the same theodore my father deposed because he was a monothelite emperor it is he said but since the sixth holy and ecumenical synod anathematized the doctrine to which he formerly adhered he has truly repented of his earlier error his orthodoxy is now complete and unquestionable complete maybe but far from unquestionable i answered and ordered theodore brought before me it proved to be as niketas said he was indeed of perfect orthodoxy the holy spirit speaks through each ecumenical synod and makes gods will clear he declared i was in error but am no longer restore me to the patriarchal throne and i shall prove to you the truth of what i say the other two prelates the local synod had named were also worthy men each of them later serving as patriarch of constantinople now though reinstalling the man my father had ousted struck my fancy i ordered it and it was done your father would never have done that my mother said after i announced my decision he never abandoned a friend and more important he never forgot a foe i tossed my head i am not my father i said just because he did things a certain way doesnt mean i have to do them that way too i was still arguing with my father as boys do on the way to manhood now though he could no longer answer back so i unlike most boys won all the arguments that would have been better had i been right all the time well i have learned painfully as such lessons are often taught by god by the virgin by the saints i forgive no foes today everyone who advised me not my mother alone seemed passionately convinced all matters should remain as they had been in the time of my father this applied even to theodore the restored patriarch if you but continue on his course emperor he said the roman empire will do well is that so i said shall i depose you then because he did theodore suffered such a coughing fit he had to retire from the throne room i laughed till my sides ached at getting the better of the prelate but while he no longer importuned me after that the bureaucrats and soldiers who came before me kept trying to hold back even the idea of change this of course accomplished the opposite of what they wanted making me even more eager than i had been to overturn my fathers arrangements regardless of whether they had been foolish what lad has ever reached sixteen years without being certain everything around him is the creation of a pack of doddering idiots and deserves nothing better than being tossed upon the rubbish heap i had no patience for what had been done my mind turned instead to what i might do as i say every lad of like age is full of the same ideas being convinced to the uttermost depths of his soul that all the people older than he and especially all kinsfolk and men of authority older than he have not a counterfeit folliss worth of sense among them most lads though have to accept the authority of their elders possessing no power no wealth of their own i was not most lads i was emperor of the romans i had all the power of the empire behind me and all the wealth too i could do as i chose not as anyone chose for me it had not been done that way before precedent and conventional usage argued against it so what furthermore i saw i was certain i saw an opportunity to which my socalled counselors were deliberately blinding themselves after the failure of their impious and infamous assault upon this godguarded and imperial city the arabs had fallen into disarray mauias their longtime ruler passed from this earth into hellfire two years after they gave up the siege upon his death several misnamed commanders of the faithful held their throne in damascus in quick succession none securely abimelekh the latest had gained it in the same year i did though already older than my father at his death through all the turmoil among the deniers of christ my father had sat quiet content to receive the tribute mauias had agreed to pay after his fleet was destroyed and his army beaten he preferred that to battle i thought otherwise summoning my advisers i said with the followers of the false prophet quarreling among themselves should we not seize the moment to take back some of the lands they stole from the romans during the reigns of my grandfather and my greatgreatgrandfather the sakellarios a dour man named romanos said the treasury has not the gold for a long campaign emperor since we are at peace should we not remain at peace john the city eparch said though nothing outside constantinople was properly his area of concern and christopher the comes excubitorum said having been little used of late the army will not be at its peak fighting condition i clapped a hand to my forehead we have not fought and so we cannot fight the longer we do not fight the worse we will fare when the time for fighting comes if we stay at peace for a generation will we be altogether destroyed when war breaks out that is not what i meant emperor i christopher began i cut him off declaring i do not care what you meant i hear d what you said and i did not care for that either we shall take advantage of abimelekhs weakness and the war undoubtedly a short and successful one will more than pay for itself such promises are more often made than fulfilled romanos said sourly you have heard my will expressed you shall carry it out i said they all bowed in submission i glowered at romanos i did not need a treasurer who told me why i could not do things i needed one who would find ways for me to do as i wanted if this copper counter obstructed me i would replace him and i knew with whom but that could wait more urgent was picking the proper general to lead the campaign against the followers of the false prophet christopher the comes excubitorum i dismissed out of hand the only military virtue i had seen him display was looking splendid in his gilded shirt of mail that sufficed in constantinople in the field it did not if i appointed theodore of koloneia commander of the army that left the imperial bodyguards with no one to keep a tight rein on christopher i decided i dared not take the chance theodore also stayed in the imperial city of the three generals who had beaten back the arabs in my fathers day kyprianos had by this time met the common fate of mankind when i asked myakes what he thought of petronas he rolled his eyes he promises more than he can give he said what do you mean i asked myakes explained how in my fathers expedition against the bulgars petronas had promised victory after my father went off to mesembria on account of his gout i knew too well he had no victory there only defeat and humiliation and so i resolved not to name petronas to high command florus now was another matter no one faulted either his cleverness or his generalship and yeta having had the chance to marry floruss daughter but instead having chosen another i hesitated did he harbor did he hide did he nurture resentment under that clever mask if he did his strategic ability might prove more dangerous to me than to the deniers of christ when my house rose to power through civil war when my grandfather was murdered as the overture to uprising i had to make these calculations florus might have done well but i did not send him east having eliminated all these candidates i summoned a man i knew much less well a man of my fathers generation leontios whom i last remembered seeing at the time of the ecumenical synod he was as i remembered him roundfaced broadshouldered with open smiling features and a hearty manner turn me loose on them emperor he boomed thats all i ask turn me loose on them ill beat em for you you just see if i dont this was what i wanted to hear one of the things i had already found out though was that the emperor always heard what he wanted to hear or what the man speaking to him thought he wanted to hear regardless of its truth and so i asked leontios why are you so confident why ill tell you why emperor he had the habit of repeating himself as he spoke he ticked points off on his fingers something else he did all the time the arabs theyve been through civil war and theyve been through famine and theyve been through plague and the armenians hate them because the armenians theyre christians even if theyre heretics and they dont have any use for the false prophet if i march an army into armenia the princes there theyll rise up and help my boys throw the arabs out thats why ill beat em good i said and the reasons he had named were good coupled with his confidence they gave me reason to hope he could do as he claimed i said i shall send you forth leontios and may god grant you the victory you deserve and to help ensure it i will write to the mardaite chieftains and turn them loose against the deniers of christ too leontioss eyes glowed thats fine emperor thats mighty fine with them and me hitting the arabs at the same time their caliph having fought a good deal in the east he used the arabs own name for their miscalled commander of the faithfulhell be itching so many places at once he wont know which one to scratch he was not an educated man he was not a particularly clever man but he had a bluff vitality to him that made those deficiencies matter less than they would have in many another soldiers followed him not just willingly but eagerly i also heard that women fell all over him but that true or not had nothing to do with matters military he having satisfied me i sent him forth and thanks to him and to the mardaites i showed my quivering cowardly advisers what fools they were leontios ravaged that part of armenia under arab control and succeeded so well there that he went on to plunder not only iberia but also media the northwesternmost province of what had been the persian empire before the followers of the false prophet burst from the desert and subjected romanias ancient foes from all these lands he sent back to constantinople a large sum of money which was most welcome i knew the fisc would make good use of every follis leontios sent too having replaced romanos as sakellarios with stephen the persian many eunuchs could care for my comfort as well as stephen had few men entire or not had the gift of caring for the revenue accruing to the imperial treasury and while leontios was campaigning in and beyond arabheld armenia the mardaites ravaged the borderlands from mopsuestia in kilikia not far from antioch north and east up to the roman province of armenia from which my general had set out for a long time their depredations kept abimelekh from responding in any way to leontioss invasion god granted us romans another boon at this time in that one more spasm of civil war convulsed the deniers of christ not long after leontios attacked them distracted as abimelekh was one of the rebels against him even succeeded in briefly seizing damascus his capital he could not hope to withstand our armies and so for almost three years we swept everything before us as mauias had after his force shattered itself against the walls of this godguarded and imperial city the miscalled commander of the faithful sent an embassy to constantinople asking our terms for breaking off the conflict abimelekhs ambassador a greekspeaking christian named mansour had the gall to protest that i had broken the thirty years truce to which my father had agreed in his presumption he might as well have been one of my own advisers not abimelekhs i am not my father i shouted to him as i had to my own bureaucrats unless i so choose his acts do not bind me here i do not so choose mansour bowed his head what i had said was simple truth as any fool could see was abimelekh likely to do exactly as his predecessors had in all things of course not it was a diplomats trick an effort to make me feel i was in the wrong but i did not fall for it having put old mansour in his place i turned him over to the diplomats whose job it was to negotiate the fine details of treaties and let him haggle with them unlike my father i reckoned it beneath my dignity to dicker like a tradesman with foreign envoys and i had other things on my mind i had never sired a bastard on any of the serving girls with whom i had dallied but eudokias courses failed and presently her belly began to bulge i puffed up with pride like a pigs bladder to tell the truth i had feared my seed was cold within me and was relieved and delighted to find this not so what shall we name the baby eudokia asked when she was certain she was with child i had been thinking about that since we both began to wonder i would have liked to name a boy herakleios after the founder of my dynasty but that also meant naming him after my uncle the traitor well call him constantine i said instead i had not been overfond of my father but he had been a strong emperor and the name would make my mother happy timidly more timidly than she usually spoke eudokia asked and if it should be a girl my mind and my hopes being set on getting an heir i had not worried about what name to give a girl by chance eudokia herself bore the same name as the first herakleioss first wife from whom i am descended theres always maria i said a careless indifferent answer that left eudokia visibly discontented as i was assotted of her i did not want that and so put some thought into my next essay what about epiphaneia thats the name of the first herakleioss mother epiphaneia eudokia tasted the name on her tongue her brow smoothed yes it will do that problem was easily solved for my part whenever i spoke of the child to come i called it constantine everyone around me took up the habit as was only natural an emperor needs a successor sooner than leaving the throne empty an emperor might marry three or even four times i would say myakes brother elpidios if you set fire to the book you wont be able to read the rest of it what do you mean you dont care youve come all this way youve read lewd things and turned well hardly a hair and now you want to feed the codex to the brazier a leaf at a time i dont understand and ill own as much justinian was just talking about what he might have done if heresy blasphemy brother if you dont calm down youll feed yourself to the brazier a leaf at a time sounds like tell me whats on your oh marrying three or four times he wasnt talking about it for the sake of fornication brother elpidios but for the sake of getting an heir it is better to marry than to burn eh not three times especially not four times not even to keep the empire from the threat of civil war you dont th ink an emperor would be able to find a priest who would give him a dispensation for something like that what youd break from communion with a priest who did something like that youd go into schism youre aa pious man brother elpidios in any case you dont need to burn the book justinian married only twice and canon law says nothing about that now does it he was only saying what he thought about a mighthavebeen that never was maybe he was wrong it wouldnt have been the only time god knows what about me brother no i never married and yes maybe ill burn for it i was like justinian before he wed eudokia and i didnt have his excuse of being a young pup i liked women so well i never settled on any one woman life is like that sometimes itll get right past you if you dont watch out and then you look back and you say oh lord what have i done or you say what have i missed do i repent of my sinful ways ive been a blind monk these past twenty years if i havent repented by now when do you suppose id get round to it justinian i had hoped to get even more from the arabs than we ended up acquiring but they scored a victory or two of their own to begin balancing ours they captured kirkesion our outpost on the eastern euphrates and raided west from antioch the arrival of that news made mansour more stubborn than he had been even so thanks to the invasion of armenia i won far better terms from abimelekh than my father had from mauias mansour agreed to pay us a slave and a highbred horse for every week of the year an arrangement much like the former one but paul the magistrianos at the urging of stephen the persian held out for a large increase in the amount of gold we were to receive each year when he came to me to report what mansour had conceded his eyes were round and staring a thousand nomismata a week emperor he exclaimed we were getting only three thousand a year before you see i said triumphantly i knew wed hurt the deniers of christ you may agree to that paul but make certain you dont sound too eager doing it i understand he said then he coughed while the payment lies at the heart of the treaty emperor it is not the only provision involved in abimelekhs name mansour has proposed an arrangement the likes of which i have never heard before you must weigh its advantages and disadvantages for yourself tell me then he says that while his master abimelekh commonly controls armenia and iberia our continued raids on those lands and the uprisings they spark create such disruption that he cannot collect the taxes owed him good i said but paul continued mansour also says we do not bring in enough money from the raids to make them worth our while either through him abimelekh proposes that both sides give over warfare in those provinces that we let the armenians and iberians carry on their lives in peace and that we then tax them and divide evenly the money we receive that is a novel suggestion i admitted rubbing my chin whiskers rasped under my fingers my beard had thickened to the point that i was letting it grow but is abimelekh sincere in this or only trying to keep us from raiding armenia and iberia i cannot judge emperor paul said mansour seems sincere but he is an ambassador did he not seem sincere he would fail of his purpose let me think on it i said and sent him away i summoned him again two days later he having prostrated himself before me i said so abimelekh says we should stop these attacks because they cost both sides money eh that is how mansour represents the matter yes the magistrianos answered diplomatically cautious i pounced will abimelekh then agree likewise to share the tax revenues from the island of cyprus and to order his fleets to leave off ravaging its coastal towns if he is sincere he will agree to stop raiding as well as to keep from being raided pauls bow showed respect for my person now not merely for the imperial office i happened to hold i shall put the question to mansour exactly as you have put it to me and shall immediately report to you his response that response was in essence no response on the grounds that the matter of cyprus was beyond the scope of his instructions and that he dared not decide without having consulted his principal mansour felt compelled to write to the misnamed commander of the faithful in damascus before replying the letter went east negotiations pausing while we awaited abimelekhs reply with the impatience of youth i chafed at the delay paul tried to calm me saying emperor we remain at peace with the arabs while the letter and its reply go thither and return hither a bit of time a bit of time i burst out weeks a bit waiting seemed unconscionable even now when i have had to wait years to return to my throne i hurl myself headlong into every enterprise then i daresay i had no patience whatever after what seemed a very long time a messenger brought abimelekhs answer to the imperial city his arrival made the delay seem if not worthwhile at least tolerable for the arabs ruler agreed to codominium over cyprus as well as over armenia and iberia that agreement i had hoped would let us complete the treaty but mansour at abimelekhs urging raised yet another issue paul the magistrianos brought the matter to me emperor the commander of the faithful almost like leontios he was so used to dealing with the arabs he did not append misnamed to abimelekhs titleurges you to take an unusual step in securing the border between his land and making sure no trouble that endangers the peace being arranged between us which peace he adds he will at once assent to upon your agreement to his proposal and that proposal is i asked emperor he asks you to remove and resettle the mardaites whom he terms brigands and bandits and robbers and thieves taking them into roman territory and away from his own you dont like the idea i said though he had continued to speak dispassionately diplomatically paul had made that very clear by the way his nostrils flared by the way he quivered ever so slightly abimelekh as far as he was concerned might have been demanding we serve him up a stew of christian children as prerequisite for ratifying the treaty having been given permission to speak his mind he exclaimed emperor i do not the arabs offer is a snare a delusion a deception for a generation and more the mardaites have stood like a wall of bronze on the roman empires eastern frontier removing them resettling them would accomplish nothing but a mutilation of the empire your father used them to keep the arabs busy close to home so they could not attack us and you yourself augmented leontioss campaign by loosing them against abimelekh at the same time as he invaded armenia what we have done before we shall surely need to do again and yet i said musingly when the arabs make a treaty they generally honor it dont they they being our most civilized neighbors though plainly reluctant paul had to nod he could scarcely do anything else since our other neighbors included then as now barbarians like the lombards and the bulgars as well as sklavinian tribes like the croats and the serbs who hardly deserved to be called even barbarous i went on if the deniers of christ may be relied upon to keep agreements once made would it not be wise to shift proven fighting men and their families to frontiers where fighting is likelier to break out unexpectedly it goes against all traditional usage paul said his voice stiff with disapproval he spoke as if he were a bishop arguing a theological position by citing the view of the church fathers of old and the text of the holy scriptures but the scriptures are divinely inspired while the roman empires dealings with its neighbors save insofar as god guards us are but human and therefore mutable besides arguing tradition to a man who has not yet seen twenty years is like arguing chastity to a billy goat no matter how eloquent you are he will not listen to you i said perhaps we can resettle some of the mardaites elsewhere and leave some of them in place we truly could use such warlike men in other parts of the empire abimelekh has compromised in these negotiations before maybe he will again put the matter to mansour as i have stated it but emperor paul began to protest anew i cut him off i am the emperor of the romans and as emperor of the romans i command you obey or abandon your office yes emperor paul said in tones suggesting i had given him over to martyrdom but obey he did as all subjects of the emperor of the romans must myakes do you know brother elpidios the things you do sometimes end up causing other things you never would have never could have expected when justinian ended up shipping those mardaites to europe i daresay hell have more to tell about that soon enough one of them was a little brat who then would have been oh i dont know how old exactly but not long past the age of making messes in his clothes what oh aye brother there would have been a lot of brats like that the one im thinking of in particular though came out of germanikeia in northern syria does that give you enough of a clue why so it must i hear how you suck in air in surprise yes the emperor leo who rules us now was one of those resettled mardaites who can guess how things would have turned out if leo and his family had stayed behind in germanikeia who would be emperor of the romans now would there be an emperor of the romans or would the arabs have taken constantinople in that second siege it would be a different world one way or another thats certain would god allow such a thing no dont consult the scriptures now brother elpidios it will wait you have justinians book in front of you read that instead justinian while we were awaiting abimelekhs reply to mansours letter asking if he would accept partial rather than complete resettlement of the mardaites eudokia went into labor looking back on these leaves i realize i have scanted my wife saying little about her since the time we were wed i can offer no better defense than saying quiet contentment leaves little to record my mother brought me the news i have attended to everything she said i have summoned the midwife i have summoned peter the physician though god forbid he be necessary i have summoned the patriarch to bless the baby and to exorcise the evil spirits that attend a birth and i have ordered a girdle brought from the monastery of the virgin to make the labor easier i bowed to her as if i were a servant and what is left for me to do wait she snapped pray when the time comes receive your son or daughter in your arms and say what a beautiful child it is it wont be newborns are of an odd color and their heads are apt to be misshapen say it anyhow eudokia will expect it of you having outlined her plan of campaign and given me her orders she went off to help eudokia through her trial i waited i prayed those palling i called for wine eventually i fell asleep i woke in darkness my head ached it was the eighth hour of the night two thirds of the way from sunset back to sunrise i called for more wine and some bread to go with it sopping the bread in the wine i made a nighttime breakfast of it i prayed some more i waited some more presently i summoned a serving woman and told her to bring me back word from the birthing chamber when she returned she said the physician peter is his name yes is busy in there and shouted at me to go away i told him you had sent me and he told me to go away anyhow her eyes were wide and astonished peter had defied me he was most rude i hurled across the room the heel of bread on which i had been nibbling that peter had shouted was of small moment to me that he was busy in there though made me tremble with fear on the one hand it is against all custom for a husband to enter the chamber where his wife is giving birth on the other hand that which is pleasing to the emperor has the force of law as the jurists who served my namesake put it and if i scandalized the midwife i expected a few nomismata would put things right serving women fled gabbling before me when they saw where i was going i sighed i would have to put things right with them too i was about to round the last corner when i heard the high thin indignant cry of a newborn babe the midwife was holding the baby it had already been washed and swaddled in woolen wrappings she nodded to me thanks to the servants she had known i was coming emperor you have a daughter she said and held the baby out to me what will you name her epiphaneia i said shortly i did not take her from the midwife instead i started for the chamber in which she had been born the midwife moved to put herself between me and the door we stared at each other my wife i said eudokia pray for her the midwife said and made the sign of the cross it was a hard birth and she began to bleed i could not make it stop i wasted no time calling in the physician emperor your mother was there shes in there yet and she will tell you the same i know peter he is better than most of the butchers who go by the name of doctor but there is only so much to be done she held out the baby again you have a fine daughter here strong and healthy stand aside i snarled and in my fright and fury i would have struck her had she dared disobey that she did not she scuttled aside like a frightened mouse but at the same time as i set my hand on the latch a great burst of lamentation came from inside the chamber i knew my mothers cries of anguish how could i not having heard her mourn my brother and my father mixed with them were peters vile but helpless curses death had beaten him again numbly my hand fell away from the door as if from very far away i heard myself say kyrie eleison christe eleison i felt as if i had been rolled in ice cold and stinging at the same time a woman who lies down in childbed risks her life no less than a man going off to war we men do not think on this not until or unless we are are forcibly reminded the door to the birthing chamber opened out came my mother her face haggard and drawn when she saw me she cast herself into my arms tears flooding down her cheeks too much god she screamed too much how can you let one person one family suffer so much i had no tears not yet those would come later when i started to believe nowa now peter the physician came out he had washed his hands and arms but eudokias blood still fresh and red splotched his tunic on looking more closely i saw it under his fingernails as well behind him lay a still form covered by a sheet the sheet was stained with blood too noting the direction in which my eyes had moved he made haste to close the door after himself then he stood very straight as if he were a sentry acknowledging a generals presence i failed you emperor he said baldly she hemorrhaged i did everything i could to stop it nothing worked he spread his hands his bloodstained hands i thought although as i have said the only blood physically on them lay under his nails do what you will with me it occurred to me then that i could order him slain as alexander had the physician who could not save his beloved companion hephaistion the temptation the desire were very strong that must have shown for peters face already pale went paler get out of my sight i said my voice thick with the fury i strove to hold in peter if not wise enough to save either my father or my wife had the sense to obey me his withdrawal was the next thing to headlong flight he did not show himself before me for some weeks thereafter by then my grief having lost its edge i was willing to suffer him to live my mother took epiphaneia from the midwife the baby made noises that put me in mind of an unhappy kitten as the midwife had my mother held her out to me take your daughter she said but i backed away as if she had offered me a viper no i said if it werent for her eudokia would be would bea then i felt myself start to cry although i had not willed it i tried to stop i could not i stood there in the hallway tears streaming down my face my hands balled in useless fists at my sides my mother gave the midwife back the baby she took me in her arms we clung to each other and wailed to a heaven that had proved itself deaf to us my brother my father my wife all young all stolen from me in the span of four years to this day i pray god forgives me for the blasphemies i loosed against him in the madness of my grief the door to the chamber where eudokia had died opened once more out came the ecumenical patriarch looking as grim and mournful as peter the physician had thinking back on it seeing the mans face once more in my mind i recall that the patriarch was paul not theodore who had suffered a fit of apoplexy and expired while conducting the divine liturgy a little more than a year after i restored him to his throne not the worst way for a bishop to be called to god paul must have heard my vain useless senseless railing against the lord of all being a kindly man he forbore to mention it saying only because of her great virtue your wife is surely in heaven even as we speak he made the sign of the cross i remembered myself enough to do the same i am glad you were here to give her unction i said as i am he said gravely even if i was summoned for another purpose he turned to the midwife and pointed to tiny epiphaneia but you are blessed with a fine and god willing healthy daughter to remind you of her get out i shouted had my mother not restrained me i would have set on him but she held me back and paul shock and fear both on his face half staggered away from me get out of here i cried again i never want to have anything to do with her never do you hear me she killed my wife she killed eudokia if it werent for hera i dissolved in tears once more paul crossed himself again you are distraught emperor he said which was certainly true when you are more fully yourself i trust you will change your mind you cannot blame the child for what is surely gods will but i did blame epiphaneia and i never changed my mind i could not stand to be near her she reminded me too much of what i had lost and even the marriage i eventually tried to arrange for her was as much a punishment a revenge as anything else having already written overmuch in these pages of funerals i shall say little here of eudokias she was laid to rest in the church of the holy apostles in a sarcophagus of rosepink marble may god have had mercy upon her if i am lucky enough to be forgiven the many sins staining my soul i shall see her again in heaven with eudokia i buried i think a great part of my own youth it is i daresay no coincidence that shortly after this time i summoned to the palace cyrus the engraver and ordered him to mint nomismata of a new type showing me as the man i was rather than the beardless youth i had been the portrait he produced for these new nomismata had all his usual skill i approved it and the goldpieces were duly struck yet it left me dissatisf ied in a way i could not define even to myself i was searching for something else but would not find it for another couple of years myakes well brother elpidios i have to say justinian is right when he talks about himself so up till eudokia died he could be playful every now and again but not afterwards not for years and not until a lot of water had flowed under the bridge when he lost her he lost something special something he couldnt find anywhere else me brother yes i liked eudokia pretty well cant say i was what youd call close to her that wouldnt have been fitting not with another mans wife but she treated me she treated all the excubitores like flesh and blood not like part of the furniture she was a soldiers daughter herself youll remember that probably helped what did i upbraid and exhort justinian to pay poor epiphaneia more heed you dont upbraid and exhort the emperor of the romans i mentioned her once or twice every time i did he gave me a look fit to freeze my marrow im not stupid i got the idea and shut up justinian emperor of the romans though i was the world did not stop turning because of my sorrow abimelekh eventually responded to mansours question paul the magistrianos brought me that response along with mansours graceful expression of consolation and condolence which i listened to although i did not much want to hear it mansour says abimelekh says he will accept a partial resettlement of the mardaitesa provided it includes at least twenty thousand men of fighting age paul reported his tone going from sympathetic to cold and sardonic in the space of a sentence good heavens i said he wants us to take away the substance and leave behind only the shadow i doubt the mardaites have more than twentyfive thousand men under arms all along our border with the arabs exactly so emperor the magistrianos replied had i not been emperor of the romans and he like everyone else within the empire my servant i have no doubt that instead of agreeing he would have said i told you so he asks too much i said he is the one who wants this treaty not i tell mansour the war goes on if that number does not come down paul bowed and departed i had no doubt he would convey my words exactly as i intended for i meant every one of them i was ready i was more than ready to hurl leontios into armenia once more if abimelekh wanted to avoid more war he could meet my terms and the numbers did come down paul and mansour haggled like a couple of old women trying to get the better of each other over the price of a sack of beans at last paul came to me reporting he is down to fourteen thousand emperor i had hoped for twelve but tell him twelve thousand or war i said if you hoped for that we shall have it and we did have it faced with that bald choice mansour capitulated paul and mansour having drawn up the terms of the treaty i signed two parchments in scarlet ink and affixed my seal to each of them paul then accompanied mansour to damascus where abimelekh observing virtually the same ceremonies i had also signed and sealed both copies of the treaty he kept one and sent the other back to this imperial city with the magistrianos to whom he had shown every honor while paul was in damascus also accompanying paul on the road back from damascus was the first years payment of the new tribute fiftytwo thousand gold nomismata more than seven hundred pounds of gold some of the coins were old roman mintings dating from before the days when the arabs stole syria and palestine and egypt from us some were newer obtained from us in trade and some were their own issues imitating ours but all were of the same weight and purity as the treaty had specified seeing them i felt like midas in the pagan myth the treaty having been completed both abimelekh and i sent messengers to the chieftains of the mardaites ordering them to assemble at sebasteia in the eastern part of the military district of the armeniacs for resettlement several of the messengers did not return some of them were returned to officials of the misnamed commander of the faithful and to my own officers in pieces the mardaites were convinced the orders they had received were a trick on abimelekhs part to lure them from their mountain fastnesses and destroy them and i daresay had the arab thought of such a ploy he would have used it paul the magistrianos and several of my other advisers were almost jubilant on account of the mardaites intransigence if my plans failed they would regain lost influence but i did not intend to fail summoning paul and the others i said i will travel to sebasteia myself if the mardaites know i am there they will not be afraid to go there themselves let word of my journey go forth word went forth and in due course so did i up till then i had never traveled far from constantinople oh i had been out of the imperial city now and again once or twice visiting philaretos by the long wall and often crossing the bosporos to hunt in asia but my life had revolved around the palace the court and the city i was anxious to leave for more reasons than one not only did i want to see more of the empire i ruled but i was also eager to leave constantinople behind for a while to escape the memory of eudokia and so riding my own horse rather than traveling in a cart or horsedrawn litter i set off across anatolia for sebasteia until you have seen more than your own home you do not understand even that home for you have nothing with which to compare it so i discovered in this journey i knew constantinople was the greatest city in the roman empire knowing that i expected other cities to be very much like the city but smaller it was not so i saw most of the towns along the way to sebasteia were hardly more than fortresses strongpoints from which to defend the local countryside ruins around the walls said many had once been more than that but how can a town survive how can its hinterland feed it when it is continually oppressed by war as the towns of anatolia had been since the persian invasions in the reign of phokas a long lifetime before so much of the countryside both in the coastal lowlands and in the plateau that makes up the heart of anatolia was also all but empty save for the soldiers settled on the land in the military districts in exchange for their service in time of need broad tracts of what should have been good crop and pastureland had no farmers or herders on them who would want to who would be mad enough to work land that would surely be despoiled by an invader in a few years time but the land needed to be worked for the sake of the towns and for the sake of the fisc the mardaites whom i would meet in sebasteia would not be nearly enough to fill these broad territories and in any case i had more urgent need for them in europe still i resolved that if ever i had more folk to resettle i would put them in anatolia sebasteia lies just north of the halys river a dusty fortress of a place much like the other dusty fortresses i had seen but when i was riding down the road from sebastopolis and siara and first drew near sebasteia i cried out in wonder saying have they given their fields over to flowers for the precincts surrounding the town were awash with bright colors reds and blues and golds and greens as splendid a sight and as unexpected a splendor as i have ever found they were not flowers they were as i discovered on coming closer the tents of the mardaites twelve thousand warriors and their families are not just an army they are a city and all that city did me honor as i rode through it men in white robes and others in rusty mailshirts prostrating themselves in the dirt and shouting my praises in greek in arabic in armenian and persian and for all i know in other tongues as well sebasteias garrison had been beefed up by summoning some of the soldiers off their fields in the armeniac military district even so the local commander a certain basil was nervous they outnumber me emperor he said they outnumber me by a lot if they want this place they can take it why on earth would they want it i said very much as if i meant it the only reason they have come here is to meet me before they resettle them well invite the chiefs into the city and feed them full of wine and mutton well feed the warriors full of wine and mutton outside the walls and give their brats candied figs everyone will stay happy and then a few at a time everyone will start on the long road west no one will even think of doing anything else he gave me an odd look one i did not fully understand until later i did not realize then how while i took intrigue utterly for granted having grown to manhood at its very heart the court others especially others far from constantinople had to have things spelled out for them very well the mardaites could if they so desired take sebasteia we could do nothing about that not in a military sense for the time being the key then was making sure they did not so desire that in fact the idea of taking sebasteia never so much as entered their minds how to do that but putting extra men on the walls by having the garrison prepare to sell its lives dear if attacked what better way to show the mardaites our secret fear to plant the idea of attacking in their minds when it might not even have been there before they were warriors they could smell weakness we gave them nothing to smell by proceeding as if everything was perfectly normal we made certain everything stayed perfectly normal i got drunk with their chiefs and listened to stories of throatcuttings and townburnings all along the border mostly told in a vile greek i had trouble following even when i could not follow i kept smiling and promised them many throats to cut and many towns to burn in the places they were going i promised no one would collect taxes from them for five years i promised myself i would make sure the wine was better at the next such carouse but the mardaites did not need to know about that band by band a few hundred at a time they set out west along the highway back to constantinople by the time four or five bands had departed the ones who were left were a far smaller threat to the town or the garrison basil looked at me as he might have at a wizard i looked at him with something like pity doubting any chronicler would ever remember his name i soon headed west across the same highway myself when in the course of my journey i came to ankyra about halfway between sebasteia and the imperial city i passed the night in the fortress there indeed the capital of the military district of the opsikion is little more than its fortress these days the citadel a strong rampart with pentagonal towers sat on its hill overlooking a bathhouse grand public buildings several churches and many many houses all dusty ruins destroyed first in the persian invasions and then in the onslaughts of the followers of the false prophet as at so many stops on my journey the contrast between what had been and what was now saddened me at the feast that night a blackhaired serving girl made certain my wine cup was never empty when wobbling as i walked i went back to the chamber in which i was to sleep i found her waiting under the covers for me i started to order her out of the room having had no congress with women since eudokia died before i could speak though she flipped back the blanket the flickering lamplight showing she was naked come she said it is only a night her accent absurdly reminded me of myakes had i had less to drink i think i should have sent her away her abundantly displayed charms notwithstanding but wine is a mocker strong drink is raging my lust raged in me and i had not the will to withstand it throwing off my robes i got into the bed as naked as the girl and took her with the light still burning she was gone when i woke the next morning my head pained me as did my conscience fornication being a sin in the eyes of god but oddly along with the guilt i also knew a curious sense of release as if i had taken a long step toward accepting that eudokias death was in the past and irrevocable those two feelings warred in me until i returned to the imperial palace no sooner had i arrived than my mother thrust epiphaneia in my face exclaiming see how much she has grown while you were gone see how she can smile now smile for your father little pretty one ephiphaneia smiled a toothless smile i recoiled from it as from a demon seeing the baby still reminded me unbearably of her mothers fate my own mother began to cry i pushed past her and past my daughter calling loudly for wine as i went i stayed drunk for two days and bedded three maidservants yes a sin two sins but sins that pushed aside pain myakes he was a man brother elpidios and not a perfect one youll notice he admits he was a sinner ive known a whole great swarm of men out in the world and here in the monastery too who if you listen to them talk never did one wrong thing in all their born days well maybe so but maybe not too i havent heard of a whole lot of people walking on water lately have you no i wasnt along on this trip to sebasteia id come down with a flux of the bowels and for a while there i wondered if i was going to go the same way constantine had i ended up getting better instead but i was flat on my back for more than a month ill tell you something though if i had been along id have arranged to put a girl in justinians bed that was the medicine he needed sure as sure yes im a wretched reprobate god will punish me no doubt youre right about that brother god has already punished me in this world and he has all eternity to do as he likes with me in the world to come but i dont have all eternity here i dont know how much time i do have but id doubt its a whole lot id like to hear some more of the words justinian left behind if you dont mind too much justinian i had peace with the followers of the false prophet and had it on better terms than my father had managed to wring from them not only that but abimelekh faced yet another uprising against his rule my judgment was that my eastern frontier was as safe as it would ever be i called up the cavalry from the military districts of anatolia and ordered the horsemen to cross into europe as my father had in his illfated campaign against the bulgars i intended to campaign against the bulgars too and sent their emissaries away emptyhanded when they came to collect the tribute to which my father had agreed but the campaign i had in mind would not merely put the bulgars in their place it would also deal with the sklavenoi some of whom were under the control of the bulgars and some of whom in their revolting freedom plundered roman settlements all on their own the suffering the land south of the danube had endured made that of anatolia seem as nothing beside it as had my father and grandfather and greatgreatgrandfather before me i took the field in person if the soldiers would not perform well under my eye they would never perform well and the sklavenoi were so barbarous i was certain they could produce no leaders with the wit to stand against us they were also divided among themselves each little sklavinia existing in a state of squalid independence as often at war with its neighbors as with the roman empire like a foolish man in a fight who covers up where he has been hit rather than trying to anticipate where he will be hit next they or at least those not dominated by the bulgars who had better sense were not likely to come to the aid of one another i had been out to the long wall before but no farther philaretos the count of the long wall greeted me at selymbria the town anchoring the wall to the sea of marmara i had not seen him since eudokias funeral god grant that my granddaughter thrive he said for she is all i have left by which to remember the girl god grant it i echoed and said no more he made the sign of the cross thinking me pious but what i meant was more on the order of god had better grant it for i intend to have nothing to do with it the long wall is different from that of the imperial city rather than alternating courses of brick and stone it is built of hard pinkish cement with chunks of brick embedded in the cement it also i must sadly say differs from constantinoples wall in its effectiveness or lack thereof where along with the protection of god constantinoples wall has kept the city inviolate since it was built barbarians have repeatedly penetrated the long wall and plundered the suburbs it was meant to protect stretching more than thirty miles from the sea of marmara to the black sea the long wall was too long to garrison adequately still though it did offer the regions nearest the imperial city some protection passing beyond it i felt i was leaving safety and entering land that while nominally under the rule of the roman empire was in fact detached from romania i aimed to make roman rule real there once again and nominal no more had i wanted to push the army straight down the via egnatia the military highway of the romans for the past eight hundred years and more i could have been in thessalonike very soon but i had planned a campaign not a military parade and so in search of sklavenoi the army plunged off the highway and into the forested sometimes marshy valleys that lay to the north i prayed at the church of st glykeria in herakleia or as the antiquarians call it perinthos and had my prayer answered the very next day the army flushing out several little sklavinian farming villages north of the town the barbarians seemed utterly astonished at the presence of roman soldiers in land they obviously believed to be theirs none of them spoke greek i had their headmen haled before me and asked them would you sooner die or obey me i thought at first that my interpreter had suffered a coughing fit but he was merely translating the question into their hideous guttural dialect their answers were as full of choking wheezing noises they say they will obey emperor the interpreter said good i thought that would be a choice even a sklavinian could understand i said since they say they will obey tell them i am going to resettle their whole clan or tribe or whatever they call themselves in anatolia tell them they can farm there and pay taxes to the fisc and furnish us with soldiers when we need them emperor i can tell them they will farm the interpreter said i can tell them they will give us soldiers but i cannot tell them they will pay us taxes their language has no words for such things what they dont know about taxes i threw back my head and laughed very well tell the poor barbarians what you can theyll learn about the other soon enough the officials of the fisc will give them detailed lessons i have no doubt a small escort of romans led the sklavenoi down the via egnatia and then east toward constantinople whence they would cross into the empty lands of anatolia i allowed them no more than they could carry in their hands considering how little they had i did not greatly deprive them the season being summer the millet and barley in their fields were too far from ripe to feed my army they did however have a good store of grain hidden in underground pits as those familiar with their habits had foretold we added that to our own supply and our horses had good grazing in the fields it soon became clear that although we had captured their villages we had not sent all of the sklavenoi off to the imperial city for resettlement some of them must have escaped into the woods and run off to warn their fellow tribesmen for the next sklavinian settlements we came upon were deserted not only the people but also the livestock being gone i required no training in logic to realize the sklavenoi from the abandoned villages were in turn surely letting more barbarians know we were on the march a young officer familiar with the sklavenoi bardanes the son of the patrician nikephoros confirmed my impression not i say that it needed much confirmation emperor the next ones we meet will resist us he said no doubt youre right philippikos i replied and he beamed at me he preferred that thoroughly greek name to the armenian one his father had given him as a sign of his ancestry i went on i trust the army will be ready to meet their onslaught man to man shield to shield in an open fight wed smash them to bits he said they arent likely to give us an open fight though theyd rather spring ambushes and he looked aroundthis country is made for that sort of thing he was right the land being rough and broken and woody the roads leading north off the via egnatia no better than cattle tracks and now that we had moved a couple of days journey inland sometimes disappearing altogether he was also right about the sklavenoi as our horsemen having no other choice went up a game path in single file javelins flew out of the woods and wounded one of them and two horses after that i dismounted some of the soldiers and sent them through the undergrowth to either side of the road the sklavenoi shot arrows some poisoned at them but they caught and killed a good number of barbarians too our advance through the sklavinias continued not all the sklavinian chiefs and petty kings fled on hearing of our approach some yielded themselves and all their people up to us i resettled them just as i had the sklavenoi we had captured and overcome in war although i allowed them to take along their livestock and carts and wagons filled with their belongings the better to start their new lives in anatolia you could never tell what would happen in any particular little sklavinia all depended on the will of the chieftain who ruled that patch of ground rather more of them i think chose to fight than to surrender their poisoned arrows were weapons not to be despised several of our men died from them while others were mutilated the sole cure the physicians knew was to cut away the flesh around the arrowhead to keep the venom from spreading throughout the victims system the physicians gave these poor fellows great draughts of wine infused with poppy juice before plying their scalpels but screams still echoed through the gloomy forests of thrace a certain neboulos was kinglet of the largest and strongest sklavinia not under the control of the bulgars it lay north and east of thessalonike this sklavinian had the arrogance to send envoys to me warning me not to enter the territory he reckoned his you do that he kill all your men all your horses one of these men said in bad greek he will have his chance i said he kill you emperor in particular especial the envoy warned redundantly he will have his chance i repeated and sent the sklavenoi away with the message that neboulos could either yield or face the weight of roman wrath that evening our army camped by a stream with a marsh and reeds on the far bank more reeds grew on the western bank where we were encamped i took my horse down to the edge of the stream to water it and to get a drink for myself having been in the saddle all day nikephoross son bardanes or again to use his own coining philippikos went down to the stream alongside me intent on the same errands stooping to fill a cup of water for himself he suddenly froze in place then he pointed to one of the reeds that seemed to me no different from any of the others do you see that emperor he asked quietly yes i see it i said but what bardanes did not answer not in words instead he reached out and yanked the reed out of the water it had i saw to my surprise neither roots nor leaves being merely a length of stem a moment later i got another larger surprise a sklavinian popped to the surface where the reed had been bardanes had dropped it and snatched up his bow i quickly drew my sword at bardanes peremptory command in the sklavinian language the man came up onto the bank of the stream water dripped from his long yellow hair and from his beard he was naked but for a sword belt bardanes spoke again the sklavinian loosed the belt and let it fall a couple of the excubitores came hurrying up to take him away he went off between them careless of his unclothed state how did you know he was lurking there i asked bardanes emperor hiding in the water is a favorite sklavinian trick he answered picking up the reed he showed me its entire length had been hollowed out theyll stay down there for hours even a day at a time breathing through one of these waiting till their enemies go away but you can usually spot them because they cut the ends of the reeds straight across where a naturally broken reed he pointed to a couplehas a jagged end cunning i said barbarously cunning with tricks like that no wonder theyve given us romans so much trouble down through the years im glad i spied this one bardanes said who knows what mischief he might have done had you come here alone who indeed i said thank you philippikos myakes so that was how bardanes philippikos caught justinians eye was it i didnt happen to be one of the excubitores who came and got the sklavinian so i couldnt have told you the tale for certain he saved justinians life eh or he made justinian think he had which amounts to the same thing philippikos turned out to be more dangerous than any dripping sklavinian to justinian and to me but that tale is a long way down the road as yet we havent even got to thessalonike have we no i didnt think so still a good ways to go yet justinian on our entering the country neboulos claimed as his own opposition from the sklavenoi did become fiercer as the men he had sent to me warned it would bands of barbarians some armed with shields and javelins would burst from the woods and undergrowth and rush the lines of roman horsemen shouting horribly when we stood fast they would melt away as quickly as they had advanced i do not care to think what might have happened had we shown flight during any of these attacks that would have fanned the fire of sklavinian impetuosity where in fact our steady demeanor damped that fire skirmishes though these were in them we both gave and received wounds in them too i learned hard lessons about the aftermath of battle where the cries most commonly are not as the poets would make you think the exultant shouts of the victors but the groans and screams of hurt men from both sides i went with the physicians as they did what they could to repair the damage edged metal had wrought but though churchly law forbids it as murder the kindest thing a physician can do for a sklavinian with his guts spilled out on the ground is to cut his throat and let him die at once and while cauterizing the stump for a roman who has lost a hand may perhaps if god so wills save his life the fresh torment the hot irons inflict will make him wish for a time it had not after the first small battlefield i was simply numb with disbelief after the second i drank myself into a stupor to keep from thinking about what i had seen after the third i summoned myakes to my pavilion when he came in he had a bloodsoaked bandage on his left arm youre hurt i exclaimed that he could be hurt made the horrors of battle even more immediate than they had been if such a thing could happen to him it might even happen to me but he shrugged off the wound saying you should see the damned sklavinian his voice was thick and rather slurred he had had some of the physicians poppylaced wine to ease his pain while his injuries were sewn up how can you go into a fight knowing something like this or worse is liable to happen to you i asked meaning not that alone but also how can you obey the orders of superiors who send you into fights he shrugged again you can die of the plague you can cough yourself to death you can get a flux and die of that the way your father did the way i almost did last year you can be smashed in an earthquake or burn up in a fire you can get a scratch and have it fester and rot you go into a battle either you win or you have a fair chance of dying quicker and easier than a lot of other ways i had not looked on the matter from that point of view having lost my brother my father and my wife in quick succession i thought of death as something to be avoided averted shunned myakes way made more sense sooner or later i would die try as i would to flee my fate furthermore as a christian i knew in my heart the world to come was far preferable to the one in which i passed my bodily existence making the sign of the cross i said you are wiser than i i doubt i ever sounded humbler than at that moment me myakes first stared then started to laugh yes he was drunk theres a joke for you emperor all i am is a halfbright soldier who wasnt smart enough to keep a howling barbarian from taking a slice out of hi m if thats wise christ have mercy on the foolish he crossed himself too superficially he was right but that did not make me wrong he accepted the world as it was and did his best within those confines i have often wished my nature were more easygoing but it is not and i have come to accept that we pressed deeper into the shadowy realm neboulos had built up within the confines of the roman empire i say shadowy not only because his rule had no right to exist but sprang like a toadstool from the shadow of roman weakness and also because in the forests the sklavenoi infested we were literally in shadow so much of the time that we once got east and west confused and cried out in fright to discover the sun as we thought rising in the west one morning but it was no prodigy only our own error captured sklavenoi told us where neboulos made his headquarters when after some fumbling and mistakes as i have said we came to that valley we found what was not quite a town and not quite a nomad encampment like that of the bulgars which my father had assailed the sklavinian kinglet had circled the huts of his people with a number of wagons making a fortified position of no small strength from inside those wagons and from behind them and from below them the sklavenoi howled defiance at the roman host brandishing their javelins they screamed what had to be bloodcurdling threats in their revolting dialect and indeed had we had to storm our way past those wagons it might well have cost us dear but the sklavenoi in their barbaric ignorance did not yet fully understand all that facing romans entailed we won our wars not merely thanks to the courage of our soldiers though when that was lacking we failed as my father had against the bulgars but also by using the wits god gave us and so seeing the wagons full of fairhaired savages i said let the liquid fire be brought forth acting on my command my officers determined the best way to employ the fearsome fire that had routed the followers of the false prophet when they sought to capture constantinople the wind was blowing out of the west so they chose to use the fireprojecting tubes and bellows on the western side of the sklavinian position to let the breeze spread the flames it created the one drawback to the liquid fire was that it had to be projected onto the target to be burnt from a range far shorter than bowshot the corresponding advantage this first time was that the sklavenoi would not know what we were doing with the fire until we had done it by which time it would be too late to distract them further a large contingent of cavalry from the anatolian military districts delivered a spirited attack against the eastern side of their wagon wall if our men broke in there well and good if not they would at least help distract the barbarians from the truly important point distract them they did through the gaps between wagons we saw hideclad barbarians carrying throwing spears and bows and arrows rushing toward what looked to be the most threatened area at my signal the excubitores advanced on foot against the barrier the sklavenoi had thrown up their shields protecting the relative handful of artisans who trundled along the carts that carried the liquid fire and the bellows and bronze tubes through which it was projected my greatest fear had been that the sklavenoi would swarm out from their wagons and try to overwhelm the excubitores by weight of numbers but we had cavalry on either wing to protect the imperial guards and they with their mailshirts helms and shields and with their spears and swords had to be foes to make unarmored barbarians think twice about engaging in close combat with them myakes if justinian was nervous brother elpidios i have to tell you i was about ten times worse than that the sklavenoi were screeching and shrieking louder than anything you can imagine boys maybe girls too for all i know kept running up and bringing them bundles of javelins and whole great sheaves of arrows i was in the front rank as we marched up to the wagons thats what i got for being an officer that and a fancier shield and a helmet with a tuft of reddyed horsehair sticking up out of the top so the sklavenoi didnt want to kill me just on account of i was there the way they did your ordinary excubitores they especially wanted to kill me because i was close to em and i looked important lucky me by the time we got near enough their wagons for the clever lads with the liquid fire to do their work my fancy shield had so many javelins and arrows stuck in it it looked like it was practicing to be a hedgehog one javelin hit me square in the chest but my mailshirt mother of god thank you didnt let it through and a couple of arrows clattered off my helmet too some good men werent so lucky my chum anastasios whod eaten beans with me ever since i joined the imperial guards took an arrow right in the eye like i told justinian not the worst way to go he never knew what hit him anyhow that one would have killed him whether it was poisoned or not and he was far from the only one who fell too the biggest thing we had going for us was that the sklavenoi didnt know what justinian says the same thing all right then tell me what he says hell probably put it better than i could anyway justinian our greatest advantage as i have said was that the barbarians being ignorant of the liquid fire did not fully grasp why this body of foot soldiers was approaching the wooden rampart from which they were conducting their defense like the achaeans when the warriors of troy reached their beached ships they aimed to keep fighting against us as fiercely as they could but we romans had rather better incendiary tools at our disposal than our trojan ancestors had known in that earlier age a trumpet blared a command the excubitores in the front rank stepped hastily to one side or the other exposing the tubes and bellows and the men who worked them eager as a small boy i watched events unfold truly i felt swept back to my own boyhood having last seen liquid fire employed against a foe in the final year of the arabs siege of the imperial city now i shouted to the military engineers burn them now they could not have heard me not from so far away through the din of battle and the sklavenoi were showering them with missiles of every sort without the protection of the excubitores shields along with their own several of them were struck down in quick succession but having prepared for that case as well as every other they brought up replacements and went on with their work torchbearers sprang out in front of the mouth of each of the halfdozen bronze tubes aimed at the enemy a javelin knocked one of them down but a brave military engineer snatched up his torch in the nick of time and held it to the tubes mouth thus all six streams of flame were projected together against the wagons of the sklavenoi great thick clouds of stinking black smoke rose from the streams of flame the barbarians shrieks of horror were as sweet as honey sweet as wine in my ears i shouted with glee to watch some of the heathen sklavenoi caught in the fire twist and writhe and burn gaining for themselves in this world a tiny foretaste of the eternal flames of hell they would assuredly know in the next they were brave some of them careless of our soldiers rushed out between burning wagons to pour buckets of water on the liquid fire to try to douse it but their efforts led only to fresh cries of dismay for the sklavenoi discovered as had the followers of the false prophet before them that the liquid fire continued merrily burning even though soaked with water we had at first set four wagons ablaze god in his kindness to us christians then granted that the breeze from the west which had been fitful began to blow more strongly it carried flames and burning embers not only to the wagons close by those we had ignited but also to the thatched roofs of the huts in the village the wagon circle had been made to protect along with the guttural shouts of sklavinian men the high shrill cries of women and children came to my ears the fire reaching the huts the battle was as good as won while some of the sklavenoi did continue trying to withstand us others turned instead to fighting the fires and still others abandoning fight and fire both ran for the shelter of the woods our soldiers were hunting them like partridges having great sport i let that go on for a short time but then sent forth a new order if the barbarians wish to surrender let them the more captives we take the more we can resettle in the empty lands of anatolia after a moment i had another thought a pound of gold to the man who brings me neboulos the socalled kinglet here because the village was burning the roman soldiers herded the prisoners into the fields nearby they had to keep some of the sklavinian women from slaying themselves because their husbands had been killed officers familiar with the character of the sklavenoi told me their women were more tender in this regard than those of any other people we know our men threw the corpses of those husbands and of the women and children who died in the village into a large pit they made some captives dig no one brought me neboulos i hoped he had fallen in the fighting and been burned beyond recognition but on questioning sklavenoi through men who knew their tongue discovered no one who admitted having seen him go down disappointed i concluded he might well have escaped as sklavinian resistance crumbled commanders were busy rewarding roman soldiers who had fought well some with promotions some with money and some with their pick of the sklavinian women among the prisoners one of the barbarians tried to keep his attractive wife from going off with the soldier who had chosen her for his enjoyment and was promptly speared to death the woman shrieked and wailed the soldier led her away anyhow as someone as i write these words i cannot remember who said in the early days of rome woe to the conquered one of the prisoners a yellowhaired woman of outstanding beauty despite a large smudge of soot on her cheek struck my fancy approaching an officer who was making sure the romans did not quarrel over their rewards i asked may i be considered to have fought well he looked startled for a moment then bowed and replied with a smile emperor without your orders we would not have fought at all since we won you must have given good orders which is surely the same thing as fighting well he could hardly have said no but i liked the way he said yes pointing to the woman i wanted i said have her brought to my pavilion when the emperor of the romans travels even to war he travels with as close a reproduction of the comforts of the grand palace as his servants can give him at the time never yet having traveled as a mutilated exile on the deck of a miserable little ship with only bandages and a loincloth to call my own i took for granted such luxuries as a wide soft bed hanging lamps and a tall heavy wooden chest that held not only my robes but also a gilded suit of mail in case i wanted to join in the fighting myself i also traveled with a large retinue of palace servants some eunuchs some whole men i ordered them to bring me a jar of good wine and two cups and then to go away and stay away till morning i shall be entertaining tonight i said grandly my servants retired sniggering entertaining eh i heard one of them say to another hell be entertained is what hell be his friend laughed i paced impatiently about the pavilion waiting for the sklavinian woman the soldiers did not take long to fetch her they had scrubbed the soot from her face but she still wore the same smokestained wool tunic decorated at the bodice with flowers and fantastic birds embroidered in red and blue thread she had had on when i first saw her she stared around the pavilion in dull wonder lamps of glass and silver a bed that stood off the ground on legs my own gorgeous raiment perhaps even the tall chest all these must have been strange and splendid to her i had by then seen the inside of sklavinian huts only the richest of the sklavenoi were well enough off to be reckoned poor the rest had less much less than that do you speak greek i asked her she shook her head i shrugged what we would be doing did not require much in the way of words i poured her wine with my own hands not even my generals enjoyed such an honor she stared down into the cup except when they got it by trade or theft from the romans the sklavenoi did not drink wine having instead a barley brew of their own so she may not have known what it was after a taste though she gulped the cup dry i drank a little more slowly when i held out the jar to her she nodded i filled her cup again she drained it as quickly as she had before i pointed to the bed she looked at it at me at it again she must have known why i had summoned her to my pavilion she must have known too i was no man of ordinary or even of merely high rank whether in her barbarian ignorance she realized i was the emperor of the romans i cannot say she held out the wine cup to me i poured for her once more willingly enough if that would make her tractable all the better i had been wondering if i would have to fight her or beat her into submission and wondering also whether that would kill my enjoyment or spike it she drank down the cup then said something in her own language i knew none of that but from the flat resigned tone could guess what she meant something on the order of might as well get it over with she pulled the long tunic off over her head let it fall to the ground walked over to the bed and lay down i stared at her a moment before undressing myself she was as well made as she was beautiful which says a great deal when i lay down next to her she did not turn her head toward me but kept looking straight up at the poles and ropes supporting the pavilion and the silk cloth stretched over them i bent my mouth to hers she let me kiss her but her lips did not respond in any way she lay there still unmoving expressionless as i kissed and fondled that splendid body even when i brought my tongue down to her hidden parts she did not stir i thought she thought she might escape by not responding that angered me roughly i pulled her legs apart and poised myself between them roughly i thrust myself into her she was wet enough from my spittle if nothing else i forced myself hiltdeep drew back rammed again all the while i watched her face she might not have been there with me at all but somewhere far far away i took my pleasure and did not withdraw afterwards being a young man i knew i would soon rise again and so i did and began the act once more save that she was warm and breathing it was like carnal congress with a corpse only after i spent myself a second time and pulled out of her did she move she rolled onto one side and drew up her legs i thought about taking her again this time from behind but before i could i stretched out to rest a bit and let my spear regain its strengtha and i fell asleep it was no doubt one of the stupider things i ever did but war and wine and venery had their way with me had she so chosen the sklavinian woman could have found a knife could have smashed in my skull with the wine jar could have done any of a multitude of deadly things murder is easy i should know on waking some time in the middle of the night i realized how lucky i was to wake i had twisted so that i lay on my side facing away from the sklavinian woman a posture not far from the one she had assumed since she had not slain me i decided i would enjoy her again before i rolled over to do just that though i took a deep breath my nose wrinkled ignorant barbarian i muttered to myself by the odor either she had not know enough to put the lid back onto the chamber pot after she used it or she had not known enough to use it at all but had done her business on the ground like an animal i did roll over then and discovered she was not in the bed confused i wondered where she had gone she could not have escaped the tent not with guards and servants all around and what point to hiding anywhere inside i sat up and i saw her while i slept she had taken her linen tunic twisted it into a rope tied one end to the bronze handle of my clothes chest and tied the other in a noose around her neck the handles were about at chest height she had had to lie out at full length to strangle herself which was exactly what in grim silence she had done she must have been determined to perish for she could have saved herself by getting up on her knees before consciousness left her her eyes stared sightlessly in a face almost black what i had smelled was the result of her bowels letting go as she died mother of god help me i whispered and made the sign of the cross i started to shout for my servants but then checked myself what could be a greater rebuke a greater humiliation than a woman who killed herself after i brought her to my bed the servants might never have the nerve to bring it up in my presence but that would not keep them from spreading the tale when we returned to constantinople a servant who does not gossip is a servant who has had his tongue cut out abruptly realizing i was naked i quickly put on the robes i had doffed to have the sklavinian woman then i undid the knot attaching her makeshift rope to the wooden chest and after that the knot around her neck touching the dead flesh i had caressed not long before made my own flesh creep but mastering my revulsion i dragged her body behind the chest where it would not be seen if i opened the tent flap and i did open the tent flap a couple of excubitores stood guard in front of the pavilion not too close for they knew better than to eavesdrop on the emperor or rather to risk getting caught eavesdropping on the emperor the moon shining through scattered clouds showed the night to be more than half spent the camp was quiet almost everyone asleep for which i thanked god is anything wrong emperor one of the guards asked as they hurried up to me what could be wrong i answered doing my best to sound bluff and cheerful one of you go fetch me myakes something i need to ask him the excubitores looked at each other i could read their thought wont it wait till morning but i was the emperor one of them trotted away shrugging as he went he came back with my faithful friend almost as soon as i had hoped as myakes drew near me i smelled stale wine on his breath even torchlight made him blink and squint he had been celebrating our triumph himself go off to bed i told the excubitores who had been guarding the pavilion im safe enough with myakes here they looked at each other again obeying might get them in trouble with their superior disobeying would get them in trouble with me the emperor of the romans sensibly they obeyed thank you emperor one of them called over his shoulder as they left i went into the tent holding the flap open for myakes to follow as soon as we were both inside he asked whats gone wrong emperor though never what a pedant would call a clever man myakes was no ones fool wordlessly i pointed around behind the clothes chest h e walked over to see what i meant and suddenly stopped dead as i had he made the sign of the cross she did it herself i said quickly not wanting him to think i had killed her for the mere sport of it i have done a deal of killing since but never for the mere sport of it which is not to say i have taken no pleasure in the destruction of my foes in a few words i explained how i had discovered her body he nodded clicking his tongue between his teeth a couple of times she probably watched her man get killed earlier today he said these sklavinian women theyre not like romans they dont want to live without their husbands having heard that more than once before i accepted it all the more eagerly now even if the blame does rest with her though i said the embarrassment will be mine unless has the grave in which we flung the bodies of the barbarians been filled in no emperor he answered and then without so much as a hesitation you want me to toss her into the pit no myakes was no ones fool thats just what i want i said shes a pagan and damned and a suicide and so doubly damned its not as if im depriving her of christian burial myakes only grunted that aspect of things worried him not at all he picked up the linen tunic untwisted it and shook it out as a washerwoman might a towel and then put it back on the corpse which turned out to be a harder job than i had thought it would but when i said as much he replied be thankful she hasnt been dead long and started getting stiff that would really make things tough he paused then added it would be the devils own time carrying her that way too having dressed her he stooped slung her over his shoulder and grunting again rose i nodded in approval her face lay against his chest and her fair fell down over it obscuring it further and it would be dark outside if anyone stops you i began he followed my thought perfectly interrupting ill say shes drunk herself blind everything should be all right emperor will you open the flap for me i ought to be back pretty soon open it i did and out into the night he went myakes well brother elpidios what the devil was i supposed to do she was dead i hadnt killed her and justinian hadnt killed her either she was a pagan whod killed herself what she wouldnt have done it if he hadnt abused her maybe but maybe not too its not a lie what i told him about sklavinian women if their husbands die sometimes they will kill themselves its something they do the way we christians cross ourselves of course they can only do it once no one did stop me till i got to the camp gate nearest the burial pit and the prisoner pen i saw a couple of other soldiers carrying women through the camp as a matter of fact it was that kind of night the ones in their arms probably were just drunk though the gate guards laughed as i came near them used her up did you one of them said you might say so i answered what with the wine and everything else i grinned and rocked my hips forward and backshes gone and lord wasnt that the truth all of a sudden he made a nasty face aii get her out of here he exclaimed she stinks shes gone and shit herself his comrades all got out of the way then they didnt want anything to do with me not after that it was easy as could be the moon ducked behind a cloud right after i walked out of the gate the night turned black as the soot above a lamp thats been hanging in the same place for twenty years instead of going all the way out to the prisoner pen i stopped by the burial pit it was closer nobody saw me heave her in nobody heard the soft thud her body made landing on the others i waited long enough so it would seem id gone to the pen then i walked back to the gate the guards jeered at me i swore at them enough to sound convincing they laughed and waved me by i went back to justinians pavilion how do i feel about it brother elpidios id sooner not have done it ill tell you that but the emperor told me to so i did i havent thought about it much since then some things youd rather not remember you ask all the questions brother let me ask you one for a change suppose justinian had told you to dispose of her what would you have done then justinian when the tent flap fluttered open i reached for a sword you never lose by being too careful or worrying too much but it was faithful myakes you took care of it i asked him i did emperor he said no ones the wiser his eyes went to the jar of wine i had ordered brought for the sklavinian woman and me after what he had done he needed fortifying i waved for him to help himself the cup he picked up and filled was the one from which she had drunk but i myakes mother of god brother elpidios justinian did not tell him that he having done me a great service he drained the cup then set it down with a sigh ah better if you want gold for this you have it i told him if you want rank you have it if you want emperor what i want is to go back to bed he said that also being in my power to give him i waved him out of the pavilion i lay down myself though i did not sleep the rest of the night and the sklavinian woman no one ever asked me about her the early shifts of guards assuming i had sent her away after i went off duty the late shifts believing her already gone before they arrived when you are of no consequence how easy you are to forget i found that out for myself a few years later i greeted the replacements for the two guards i had sent away after summoning myakes and sent them away too clouding matters further not that i needed to worry as things turned out what did one prisoner one woman matter the next morning we began the hunt for neboulos word of what we had done to the sklavinian kinglets stronghold spread rapidly among the barbarians some of them did go on hiding in trees and flinging javelins at us when we passed below some kept shooting arrows at us out of the bushes alongside the tracks we traveled here and there villagers would offer battle when the roman army came into sight but ever more often as my advance through the sklavinias continued the sklavenoi yielded rather than fighting columns of widefaced fairhaired men and women went tramping down the forest paths toward the via egnatia and ultimately toward anatolia a few of them when they found the chance bolted into the woods preferring their native wild lawlessness to life within the boundaries of the civilized world by far the greater number though let themselves be resettled without the least difficulty as reports reaching me in the field made plain one great reason so many of the sklavenoi surrendered was the impression the liquid fire made on those who escaped from nebouloss village the tales they spread among their tribesmen grew in the telling too as such tales have a way of doing bardanes philippikos came up to me of an afternoon bringing with him a sklavinian whose long yellow beard had ugly streaks of gray bardanes swarthy face bore an amused expression emperor this fellow wants to see the dragon we used to burn up nebouloss wagons he said does he i did not smile i made a point of not smiling tell him he may not see it tell him god gave that dragon to the emperor of the romans who looses it against his enemies it is not to be seen by the common run of barbarian unless he be a foe facing the fire bardanes started to laugh i looked very fierce if the sklavenoi believed what i was saying they would be more inclined to give up his expression changed he translated my words into the nasty grunts the yellowbearded man used for speech the sklavinian gave back a guttural torrent of sound when he was through bardanes said he thinks you are some kind of wizard good i said tell him that if the sklavenoi anger me enough i will turn them all into mice tell him to tell some of his friends and then let them go into the forests to spread what i say to their kinsfolk who still skulk out there if the foe was superstitious i would take advantage of it bardanes translated again the sklavinian stared at me his eyes were big and wide and blue and stupid his hand twisted in some sort of apotropaic pagan gesture he being too ignorant to make the sign of the holy and lifegiving cross i scowled at him stuck out my front teeth ahead of my lower lip and said squeak the barbarian almost wet his trousers bardanes looked as if he would burst but did not let out the laughter he held inside in greek he said to me now i see what you are doing emperor you are playing on his fears of course i am i answered surprised as i had been with basil that anyone would need such a lesson well at least bardanes understood it when it came in front of his face my time at the imperial court and particularly my time on the throne had shown me how seldom men grasp the lessons they are offered on through the hills and valleys of thrace and macedonia we went cleansing them of sklavenoi either through their voluntary surrender or by fire and sword i wondered if i had mardaites to spare for thrace to set up a military district there like those in anatolia if i could find the men for a military district their presence on the land would protect constantinople against barbarous assault no matter where we went we did not catch up with neboulos that grated on me i was never one to like the ends of a knot left loose i doubled the reward for his capture then doubled it again but he still eluded us like water through a clepsydra time was running out in the campaigning season and then as i began to despair of laying hands on the sklavinian kinglet he once more sent me envoys these men were not so arrogant as his previous ambassadors had been they wriggled on the ground before me like worms when at last they rose their tunics were filthy and covered with leaves and twigs their spokesman came straight to the point neboulos yield to you you let him live i thought it over i would sooner have taken his head but leaving him alive and in my hands was better than letting him run loose through the winter rebuilding strength with no roman troops around and probably compelling me to fight this campaign all over again i shall let him live i said not without an inner pang you swear this the sklavinian asked swear by your god your funny god god no one can see i crossed myself by god by the holy mother of god and by all the saints in heaven i swear no harm will come to neboulos if he comes to me of his own free will he come the sklavinian said he come three days time you stay here no fight no burn three days time i hesitated before answering the sklavenoi might have been trying to buy time for some mischief or even for a fullscale assault on us romans if they did try that though i was confident they would regret it and so i said very well we shall stay here for three days without making any attacks but if by the end of the third day neboulos has not yielded himself up to me there will be such a great burning that any crow flying across the sklavinias will have to carry its own provisions for it will find none here the sklavinian wheezed at first i thought him consumptive then realized he was stifling laughter he translated my remark for his comrades who evidently had no greek they laughed out loud what i had intended as grim threat they took for a joke truly there is no reasoning with barbarians i cast a wide net of scouts around the open meadows where we encamped if the sklavenoi contemplated assailing us they would not catch us napping the wait in one place i must say did the army good and was in particular a boon to our wounded who no longer had to endure jouncing along over roads more imaginary than real in our supply wagons several men the doctors had given up for lost recovered thanks in great part to the quiet rest they were able to enjoy and on the third day true to his promise neboulos came to our camp he rode in alone on a better horse than any other i had seen in the sklavinias i received him on a portable throne surrounded by servants and excubitores reproducing as best i could in the field the splendor of the great palace of constantinople when he dismounted one of my grooms took charge of the horse chainmail rattled on his shoulders as he walked toward my high seat he also wore an iron helmet which like the mailshirt looked to have been taken from a roman soldier he had a sword on his belt and almost died under the spears of the excubitores when he drew it but instead of attacking me he stabbed the sword deep into the ground he took off the helmet and hung it on the sword hilt then he undid the mailshirt his armor clattered about him to use the homeric phrase as he let it fall to the ground emperor you are too strong for me he said in greek that like his horse was better than i had looked to find among the sklavenoi i surrender myself to you standing there before me in plain linen tunic and baggy wool trousers he cut a surprisingly impressive figure he was not tall i overtopped him by half a head but very wide through the shoulders and narrow in the waist with arms as thick as a thin mans legs a warrior to reckon with for a sklavinian he was handsome true his face was broad but his features though blunt were regular his eyes were wide and candid and a very bright blue on a woman they would have been devastating he trimmed his buttery hair and beard more closely than most of his countrymen looking at him one might have imagined he was a quarter of the way along the line toward becoming a roman he was older than i but not old thirty thirtyfive at the most you would have done better for yourself and for your people if you had surrendered before i said those massive shoulders rolled in a shrug i thought i could beat you till now i never met any man i could not beat but you have too many horsemen in iron shirts and that fire you throw it was not a grimace of fear but one of anger frustrationi cannot match it and my men will not stand against it and so you have me and what shall i do with you i mused i had promised not to kill him and i keep my promises as both my friends and my enemies have reason to know i had not promised however not to lock him in a tiny chamber somewhere feeding him bread and water till he eventually had the good grace to expire i had not been talking to him either but to myself nevertheless he answered me emperor you send my people off beyond the edge of the world is it not so send me with them let me lead army of them for you you are too strong for me but i know i can beat every other man who was ever born of woman if he could be trusted it was not the worst idea in the world the sklavenoi i was resettling in anatolia could fight many of them had been captured in battle at the point of a spear i intended making military peasants of them paying them some small wage each year with which they could maintain their equipment and mounts and summoning them at need to war my plan had been to put them under the command of roman officers but they might fight better for one of their own neboulos i said if you think you will be a kinglet in anatolia as you have been here think again the roman empire has only one emperor and i am he those wide blue eyes went even wider you are emperor i am your man i will help you against your enemies then he smiled a provocative smile almost the smile a man would use to try to bring a woman to his bed and emperor you owe me four pounds of gold i what i said partly in amazement partly because his greek while good was not perfect and i wondered if i misunderstood him but he repeated it you owe me four pounds of gold he said very clearly seeing me still gaping he condescended to explain you say you will give one pound of gold to man who brings me to you no one does it you say you will give two pounds no one does it you say you will give four pounds i bring me to you here i am he thumped his chest you owe me four pounds of gold i could have killed him on the spot for such effrontery but i had sworn an oath to let him live and in any case i was laughing too hard to think of the headsmans sword and so with a smile he began to betray me myakes ah neboulos i havent thought about neboulos in going on forty years not more than once or twice anyhow he was a piece of work neboulos was no two ways about it youve never heard of him brother elpidios not till you read of him in justinians manuscript you say god and all the saints youve made me feel ancient often enough before why should one more time bother me and thinking about it his heyday was here and gone years before you were born so theres no real reason you should have heard of him but stilla i wondered if justinian would kill him when he came out with that you owe me four pounds of gold every excubitor who heard him was either snickering or rupturing himself trying not to snicker justinians temper was always chancy though if hed taken it the wrong way neboulos was one dead sklavinian oath or no oath but then justinian laughed and when the emperor laughs everybody laughs neboulos yes he laughed too justinian after neboulos came into our camp warfare against the sklavenoi ended we rounded up some thousands more of the barbarians and sent them on toward constantinople for resettlement in this neboulos made himself useful persuading several petty chiefs they would do better to yield than to waste their lives in useless battle with the sklavinias under roman sway i brought the army down to thessalonike which although the greatest european city in the empire after constantinople had been twice besieged by the sklavenoi over the years and might have fallen to them if not for the miracles wrought by st demetrios its patron i rode into thessalonike on a white horse at the head of the soldiers the people of the town went wild to see me for so long thessalonike had been a roman island in a sklavinian sea now it was linked again to the larger part of the civilized world seeing neboulos walking behind my horse the inhabitants jeered and cursed him for they had feared his growing power he took no notice of the jeers even when they began to pelt him first with rotten vegetables and then with stones he dodged only those missiles aimed directly at him and did so with a quick economy of motion that kept all but a couple from striking him let him be i shouted to the crowd he is mine the thessalonikans bayed wolfish approval at that no doubt construing it to mean i had in mind for him a fate more bitter and lingering than any a mere mob could inflict would they had been right in fact though it was only that i admired the courage and selfpossession with which he faced them and did not wish to watch him slaughtered as part of the celebration of my arrival seeing thessalonike and its walls i understood how with the help of st demetrios it like constantinople held out in the face of everything its foes could do it rises steeply from the thermaic gulf the via egnatia entering it less than half a mile from the sea the citadel stands on the high ground in the northe astern part of the city the circuit of the walls counting the seawall which is in a poorer state of repair than the rest is about three miles more than a hundred towers some rectangular others triangular gave roman soldiers fine vantage points from which to fight kyriakos the bishop of thessalonike and also in effect its governor greeted me just inside the kassandreia gate god bless the emperor justinian he cried the godcrowned maker of peace benefactor to this city pious and faithful to jesus christ our lord god bless thessalonike i replied to which the people cheered through his help and that of the great martyr saint demetrios we have triumphed against our foes who are also the foes of the saint the thessalonikans shouted louder for their beloved saint than they had for their city kyriakos leading the way we paraded through thessalonike when we passed under a great triumphal arch perhaps a bowshot inside the wall he crossed himself saying this was built by the archpersecutors galerius and diocletian reliefs on the arch showed prisoners easterners persians perhaps pleading for mercy before a roman emperor in antique costume like that which constantine the great is often seen wearing on his monuments as the bishop had said galerius and diocletian savagely persecuted christians and no doubt suffer the pangs of hell because of it but without their victories the roman empire would have suffered untold grief at the hands of its enemies how was i to feel about them then how i felt at the time was puzzled just north of the triumphal arch was an impressive church dedicated to st george thessalonike seemed to have and to need several churches favoring the military saints it also had along the via egnatia a church dedicated to the mother of god in here kyriakos said proudly rests an icon of our lord which human hands did not paint his pride was justified for by possessing such a holy image thessalonike showed itself to be no provincial backwater but a city to be reckoned with shortly after passing the church dedicated to the virgin we turned north up a meaner narrower street leading to the church of st demetrios a church worthy of standing comparison to any i have ever seen save only the great church in the imperial city it is an oldfashioned basilica rectangular in plan with a wooden roof and with a transept giving it something of a cruciform appearance here we shall celebrate the divine liturgy kyriakos said celebrating also your glorious victory against the godless sklavenoi who have for so long oppressed and harassed thessalonike notables both priests and laymen filled not only the wide nave of the church but also the aisles to either side aisles separated from that nave by columns of red green and white marble a stone with which thessalonike is abundantly supplied i admired the mosaics of st demetrios and others who i learned were a prefect leontios the coincidence of names amused me who had built the first church on the site more than two and a half centuries before and kyriakoss predecessor john who had led the defense of the city against the sklavenoi during my greatgreatgrandfathers reign at the close of the liturgy i took communion from kyriakos eating of our lords flesh and drinking his blood afterwards the bishop introduced me to a whole great swarm of prominent thessalonikans men whose names vanished from my head the moment i left the city they inhabited and why not men who think themselves worth remembering come to constantinople to see if they can prove it a partial exception was dorotheos commander of the garrison of thessalonike even he though was less than he might have been allowing kyriakos to take the leading role in administering thessalonike in that though he but acquiesced to a longstanding tradition of episcopal control in city affairs to me dorotheos said you have done a great thing emperor in subduing the sklavenoi hereabouts theyve made life miserable for us the past hundred years your hinterland is free of them now for ive cleared them out by the tens of thousands i answered and then paused struck by a happy thought i had been contemplating making thrace a military district on the order of those in anatolia doing the same around thessalonike would give the city warriors on whom to draw should the barbarian menace revive i said i will send military peasants here to settle on some of the lands cleared of the sklavenoi and you dorotheos you i shall name the first commander of the military district of hellas at the last moment i chose that more sweeping title instead of naming the district after thessalonike thank you emperor dorotheos exclaimed we both knew of course that great stretches of hellas remained outside effective roman control indeed outside any roman control at all being overrun by more bands of sklavenoi all the same the name offered the promise of eventual redemption for the territory named then kyriakos said what a splendid promotion for you dorotheos in tones suggesting he did not find it splendid at all i realized the bishop was used to being the leading man in thessalonike and found anything tending to aggrandize a rival distasteful in the extreme i also realized i would be wise to do something to placate kyriakos as he would probably remain more important here than dorotheos even after the military district of hellas was established at a supper later that evening i found a way to grant kyriakos a favor without diminishing the new authority i was conferring upon dorotheos the centerpiece at the feast was a roast kid basted with olive oil and crushed garlic watching neboulos amused me while relishing the fatty richness of the dish he cut away the crisp outermost slices of meat and shoveled on salt with both hands to kill the taste of the garlic the sklavenoi like many barbarians being less fond of it than we romans when he noticed my eye on him he said emperor i am glad again i surrender to you you romans live by sea make all salt you want you do not sell salt to me you do not sell it to my people now at last i can eat all i want and he reached for the saltcellar again selling salt is against our law i said and let it go at that without salt preserving food is much harder that makes the stuff a weapon of war hardly less than iron anyone selling his foes that which strengthens them deserves what happens to him neboulos sprinkled still more salt over the fresh surfaces of kid his knife exposed turning to kyriakos i adapted the text of the book of matthew saying in the sklavinian you see a man for whom the salt has not lost his savor true enough emperor he said and then lowering his voice i would not mind if like lots wife he were turned into a pillar of salt not only would we be rid of him as a man which thanks to you we are in a different way but we could break him up and sell him for a good price i laughed but quickly grew thoughtful you want to sell salt for a good price ill tell you what ill do ill give the church of saint demetrios a salt pan all to itself and all the revenues from it to thank the saint for aiding us against the sklavenoi let the salt pan be entirely free youll pay no taxes for it and you will not be obliged to furnish salt from it to the soldiers without payment does that suit you kyriakos god bless you emperor the bishop exclaimed which i took for an affirmative my secretaries will draw up the edict tomorrow i said and kyriakos looked more joyful still thessalonike lying by the sea granting the church he headed the privilege of producing its own salt would bring it extra revenue without seriously inconveniencing the garrison which had other salt pans upon which to draw it also helped salve the bishops bitterness at the greater authority dorotheos was to acquire if i could not live in constantinople i would sooner make my home in thessalonike than in any other city i have seen but i could not stay there long it was already september the beginning of a new year and i wanted to strike a blow at the bulgars before returning to the imperial city for the winter to reach the bulgars the roman army had to pass through the territory of the seven tribes of sklavenoi they had subjected to themselves when they settled south of the danube after my father failed to crush them north of the river the roads leading up to that country were frightfully bad even when it was under roman rule it had been a raw frontier district and it had been ravaged by goths and huns and avars and sklavenoi and bulgars whatever highways had existed were now dirt tracks at best memories at worst the sklavenoi of the seven tribes tried to withstand us from villages surrounded by a circle of wagons as neboulos had the dreadful roads must have prevented word of what we could do to such works from reaching so far north liquid fire proved as effective against them as it had against him he stood at my side as the flames leaped forth and seized the wagons how do you romans do that he asked me watching the sklavenoi try and fail to douse the flames watching our soldiers take advantage of the chaos the fire caused and cut down the barbarians it is a gift from god i answered neboulos was free enough within the camp but not so free as to be able to sniff around the wagons where the liquid fire and the tubes and bellows used to project it were stored i had warned his guards their heads would answer for that they believed me which was as well for i meant every word of it your god is a strong god neboulos said he knew little of the true and holy christian faith worshiping instead the lying demons who calling themselves gods have deceived and damned the sklavinian race these sklavenoi did not resist so stoutly as had the barbarians neboulos had led on our breaking into their village they threw down their bows and javelins and cried for mercy in their own tongue and in such fragments of greek and even of latin this having been before the barbarians invasions a latinspeaking land they must have learned it from a few surviving peasants as they had we took prisoners by the thousands and sent them down toward the via egnatia for resettlement among the prisoners were many comely women as far as i was concerned the soldiers who wanted them were welcome to them having defeated the sklavenoi of the seven tribes we pushed north and east over the haimos mountains invading the land the bulgars held directly they fled before us driving their herds of cattle and sheep with them unlike the sklavenoi who lived in villages and farmed the bulgars were nomads without fixed abode and the more difficult to bring to battle against their will on account of that we might yet have punished them as they deserved they being unprepared to resist so many romans roaming through the land they had stolen had not the weather turned against us it might as well be a different world north of the mountains the olive does not grow there nor does the grapevine the winters in that benighted province are too fierce to let either survive and the first snowstorms came early that year covering the land in white the chief quartermaster an officer named makarios approached me with a worried look on his face emperor we have campaigned all through the summer he said we have not the supplies especially for the horses to go on in the face of snow well take what we need from the peasant villages and i broke off i had already seen how peasant villages there north of the haimos range were few and far between i had not intended in any case to winter north of the mountains ordering an army to winter in barbarian territory was what had brought maurice down in ruin and set in train the events that raised my family to the throne i did not aim to start some other familys rise to power at my expense but having to withdraw with my attack barely begun also galled me i said we will go on for another few days and see what happens makarios bowed and withdrew what i hoped would happen was that we might get a break in the weather another week or two of mild days after that snowstorm in which we could strike at the bulgars plundering their herds if nothing else instead less than half a day after the first snowstorm ended another blew in this time it was myakes who came to me as perhaps no one else would have dared he told me the truth straight out emperor even the excubitores are starting to grumble at staying here so long and if were grumbling the cavalry from the military districts has to be fit to be tied theyve already missed the harvest and they didnt like that they arent fond of being stuck up here not even a little they arent not only had unhappy soldiers overthrown maurice they had also murdered my grandfather and ruined my fathers campaign against these same bulgars inspiring his brothers to try to cast him down from the throne an emperor whose soldiers were unhappy with him was an emperor whose throne shook under him thank you myakes i said not getting everything i wanted was always hard for me here though i saw i had no choice well go on for today and see what we can do come tomorrow its back to the imperial city we did little that day seeing neither bulgars nor their herds when we encamped for the evening i announced our return to the whole army they could scarcely have been more joyful had i told them christ was coming back day after tomorrow their delight showed me myakes had been right and also showed me i would have had little service from them had i insisted on continuing the campaign they did not complain about going through bulgarheld territory on the way to a pass through the mountains closer to constantinople than the one by way of which we had entered the chilly northern land nor did they complain about acting like soldiers on the march which is to say about plundering and burning everything in their path they would have burned for the sport of it arson being deeply ingrained in the warriors soul but they did so all the more enthusiastically for being able to warm themselves at the fires they set as before the bulgars ran away from us their rule when fighting romans seemed to be to advance when we retreated but to retreat when we advanced oh a few of their scouts always hung close to the army now and then exchanging arrows with our own outriders but they always fled when we sent larger detachments after them by the time we started traversing the pass that would take us back to romania i took them for granted as a man takes for granted the taste of the pitch that makes his wine keep longer than it would otherwise that quickly proved a mistake as did my earlier contemptuous estimate of the barbarians strategy they had placed an army in the pass intending to block our way south their standards were horses tails one two three or more mounted on poles behind their line drums thumped echoing and reechoing as the khagan of the bulgars shifted his men to meet our dispositions as we drew near the barbarians screeched what were surely insults at us in their unintelligible language my own speech to hearten the soldiers was simplicity itself pointing south i said there lies the roman empire there lies the godguarded imperial city there lie your homes and there stand the bulgars between you and those homes will you let the barbarians keep you from them no the men shouted with all their might their outcry startled the bulgars and silenced them if only for a moment then forward i said waving toward the foe we shall ride through them we shall ride over them and we shall return to our own land once more at my command the horns blew the order to advance thud thud went the bulgars drums shouting their war cries they rode at us too both sides loosed arrows which began to fall like deadly rain hearing thousands of men shouting my name as a war cry made the hair on my arms and at the nape of my neck prickle up in awe the fight was very simple the bulgars wanting to trap us and crush us our own men battling bravely to return to the roman empire after having traversed a large part of the enemys territory we were better horsed than the bulgars and wore iron while they were in leather and so we broke through scattering them before us and leaving large numbers of them dead on the ground i drew from this combat an important lesson never to let the foe place himself between my army and my own heartland myakes why am i coughing brother elpidios being an old man isnt reason enough justinians right that was a good lesson to learn he forgot it once years later and paid dear for forgetting but thats not all youve been reading a good many days now brother i havent often heard justinian shade the truth but he does here aye we broke through but to hear him talk about it it was as easy as smashing up the sklavenoi it wasnt like that not even a little bit i wish it had been the bulgars horses were little and scrubby but they were fast their bows shot farther than ours not a lot but some and the leather they wore had been boiled some kind of way till it was almost as hard as iron as for the damned bulgars themselves they were as tough as you could want still are i guess come to that does justinian say how many dead romans lay on the ground no eh well there were plenty if we hadnt outnumbered the bulgars i think they would have beaten us we made it into thrace aye but we werent a happy bunch afterwards just as well winter came down hard we went home the men from the military districts back to anatolia and the excubitores to constantinople and the bulgars they stayed home for which we were all duly grateful especially i think justinian justinian all the while we were traveling through the country the bulgars had stolen from my father during the battle against them and on the road through thrace back to the imperial city i studied neboulos he affected not to notice me but his blue eyes were watchful too yet he said nothing knowing i suppose his fate was not in his own hands like any barbarian seeing constantinople for the first time he gaped at the citys walls and then all over again at the wonders they contained so many people all in one place he marveled and then in his clumsy greek asked me with so many people here why do you want us sklavenoi too the countryside is emptier i told him even constantinople has fewer people and more open spaces than it did a hundred years ago hundred years he shook his head who remembers so long ago augustus the first emperor of the romans ruled in the time of our lord jesus christ almost seven hundred years ago i replied god has never allowed a break in the line of emperors from that time to this neboulos looked at me by his expression he thought i was lying to impress him then he looked from me to the marvels of constantinople once more they presented a better argument as to my truthfulness than any i could offer for no barbarians their thoughts rooted only in the present could have conceived of them let alone built them when he turned back to me his face was troubled how do you stand living in shadow your ancestors cast he asked they are our guides i said we follow them as best we can and because we know christianity whe re they were mired in pagan falsehoods we have surpassed them this god who gives you fire is strong he admitted he drives away all other gods you used to have yes you might say that i answered how to put it any more clearly to a letterless barbarian ignorant of the true and holy faith except insofar as he might have delighted in plundering a church of its treasures should he have managed to take a roman city and i he said thumping his thick chest with a big square fist i will be strong for you i drive away all enemies you have now he had not pestered me about that notion of his not in thessalonike not in the bulgars country not on the return from that country to the imperial city had he pestered me about it i should naturally have come to suspect him but now when we were just across the bosporos from the many sklavenoi i had resettled in northwestern anatolia seemed an equally natural time for him to inquire about my plans for him in my minds eye i saw him leading a force of fairhaired warriors combining sklavinian cunning and roman discipline further i saw myself loosing him like an arrow from a bow straight at abimelekhs heart not yet having learned the full depths of sklavinian cunning i said so you will make me an army from among your fellow tribesmen will you yes i will make you army he said and his eyes glowed bright as stars i will make you special army you show me your enemies you take me to them i drive them all away that fit in so perfectly with my own thought of a moment before i said let it be so i shall send you to anatolia make me an army make me a special army neboulos and i will show you all the foes you want i am your slave he said stephen the persian prostrated himself before me as he had in the days when he served in the palace rather than the treasury emperor he said in his eunuchs voice on arising i have seen how much gold your campaign against the sklavenoi and the bulgars cost and i am pleased to be able to tell you that when the tribute from the arabs and the taxes collected within the roman empire are both taken into account we have gathered in more than you expended that is good news i replied your predecessor always seemed to be finding reasons for me not to do the things the roman empire requires of me you now you find the gold with which i can do those things that is what i want in a sakellarios stephen so i have interpreted my duties from the beginning stephen said i should also like to commend to your attention a certain theodotos a former monk from thrace who has ably served your cause being most ingenious in sniffing out those who would keep from the fisc monies rightfully belonging to it if he does that he is truly given by god i said playing on the meaning of theodotoss name stephens beardless cheeks plumped as he smiled i went on bring his name to me again that i may reward him for his diligence i shall send you a written memorandum emperor detailing his contributions in full stephen said better yet i told him and he bowed his way out of the throne room that evening i took supper with my mother i had i confess been avoiding her since my return to constantinople for she kept assailing me with the multifarious virtues of my daughter epiphaneia a subject on which i remained resolutely deaf the more she praised the child the less desire i had to learn whether any of the praise was true indeed the only reason i consented to dine with her was her promise not to raise the subject of epiphaneia at the meal that promise she kept in a way instead of talking about epiphaneia she talked instead about prospects for my remarriage how happy you will be she said when you hold a child in your arms and give it all the love that pours from your heart you know mother i said if you were looking for a way to put me off the idea of remarriage for good you couldnt have found a better one not in a year of trying for i heard all too clearly the unspoken reproach that i did not hold epiphaneia in my arms and give her my love i now realize my mother was right i had an obligation to my family and to the roman empire to remarry and to produce an heir as soon as possible thereby securing the succession and reducing the risk of civil war but i still mourned eudokia and the thought of yoking myself to a new wife held no appeal and if i lost a second wife as i had the first grief not love would pour from my heart the previous few years i had had enough of grief and to spare and i was still very young when you are twenty or so an endless sweep of years seems to stretch out before you ignoring the past history of my family i was certain i had all the time in the world to marry again and get an heir little did i know then the fate god in his ineffable wisdom had decreed for me and further not to put too fine a point on it i was and am a man of my house meaning a man of strong will the quickest way to set me against an idea forever was and is to urge it on me too strongly no donkey or mule could dig in his heels more stubbornly than i under such circumstances the course my mother advocated was one for which i did not care the more vehemently and persistently she advocated it the less i cared for it she was stubborn herself no doubt having acquired the trait from my father if it was not inborn in her all through the time before my throne was stolen from me she kept urging no she kept nagging me to wed again i can think of no more important reason for my failure to do so then thinking to distract her so i could finish my supper in peace i said i hope you dont miss stephen the persian too much here in the palace he is as good in the treasury as i hoped he would be and the hopes i had for him were of the highest distract her i did that eunuch is a shark in mans clothing she said her eyes flashing angrily were it not for his robes you would see the pointed fin on his back he has not held office long but already everyone in the city hates him what better recommendation for a tax collector i said with a smile dont joke about it my mother snapped he goes too far he goes much too far anyone who dares protest either how much he collects or how he collects it suffers he is fond of the switch and if that fails the whip i shrugged the fisc must be fed or the roman state starves he is a bloodsucking wild beast and he thinks the fisc is the soul of the roman state not its belly i told him as much to his smooth fat evil face i told him he was making you hateful to your subjects too and what did he say to that i asked he said that if he didnt collect all he could he would make himself hateful to you my mother replied and that is not all and do you think he was wrong i broke in my mother held up her hand you are the emperor now and so you may speak when you like but you are also my son and so you will hear me out i had not finished she paused waiting to see how i would respond she was indeed my mother no matter how annoying to me she made herself at times so i waved for her to go on which she did as i was saying before you interrupted me that is not all your precious stephen the persian said nor all he did he said i should mind my own business and let him mind his an excellent idea i said she kept on talking right through me and he picked up one of the switches he uses to thrash those who will not pay what he demands and he hit me once across the back with it as if i were a schoolboy who had not learned his lessons she was my mother had she not also been nagging me pushing me in directions in which i did not wish to go no doubt i should have been outraged as things were the first thought crossing my mind was good you deserve it saying that though would only have made our quarrel worse what i did say was now that i am back in the imperial city i will tend to matters of the fisc myself you need never have anything to do with stephen the persian again it was not enough looking back i see that at the time i deemed it the height of generosity my mothers mouth thinned to a pale narrow line thank you so much emperor she said and left the dining chamber quite abruptly and quite against etiquette i do not think she spread the story through the city in spite of our spats she was always loyal to the family i know i did not spread the story nevertheless it did spread which meant it must have spread from the lips of stephen the persian boasting of the power he wielded perhaps he made himself feared with such tales he surely made himself hated and as my mother had warned me he made me hated too we both paid the price for it a few years later emperor have mercy the fat little man john his name was arose from his prostration with a wail like that of a distraught mourner in a funeral procession have mercy on the pitiful island of cyprus he was the archbishop of cyprus even so having learned that anyone coming before the emperor of the romans on his throne will make a small problem seem large and a large one seem the end of the world i discounted at least half that anguished wail what remained after such discounting though was enough to concern me have mercy on cyprus i said raising an eyebrow i thought i have had mercy on cyprus arranging for the taxes from the island to be shared between us and the followers of the false prophet the island has had no share of fighting ever since not no fighting emperor less fighting john said your armies and those of the arabs miscalled commander of the faithful do not clash there but s trife between their villages and ours remains and we christians there have to pay a tax for the privilege of practicing our true and holy faith do they make you pay that tax over and above their half of what they collect or is it part of that half i asked knowing the deniers of christ made their christian subjects pay that tax through all the lands they ruled johns face twisted he must have hoped i would not ask that question as part of their half of the total tax to be paid he said unwillingly idiot i shouted and he blanched blockhead imbecile cretin dolt for a tax which he is within his rights to levy you want me to go to war with abimelekh and for the harassment our villages endure yes john said it is not enough not close to enough i told him begone since you are in a christian land here go to the church of the holy wisdom and thank god for my mercy in not sending you home with stripes on your back and while you are there pray to god to grant you some of his wisdom for plainly you have not got enough of your own he fled some of the oldest courtiers had served since the last days of my greatgreatgrandfathers reign nearly half a century before they united in telling me they had never seen anyone withdraw from the imperial presence so precipitously anybodyd think hed been struck with the urgent squats one of them said chuckling i froze him with a glance whereupon he withdrew from my presence almost as fast as john the cypriot had done i remembered too well how my father had died at the next imperial audience the old fool did not attend me pleading an indisposition i sent word that the longer he remained indisposed the happier i would be he never returned to court and died the following year his funeral for that of a man of such high rank was remarkably illattended john soon went back to cyprus sadder and probably not wiser his pleas even if i could not honor them left me thoughtful if i resettled the cypriots on territory definitively roman i could gather for myself all the taxes they yielded sharing none with abimelekh since the treaty between us said not a word about such resettlement i would have been within my rights to do so but the time was not yet ripe the war with the bulgars might well have continued into the following campaigning season and i did not wish to embroil myself with them and with the followers of the false prophet at the same time so long as abimelekh paid his tribute as he should cyprus would have to wait not long after john had returned to cyprus the ecumenical patriarch paul approached me saying emperor your piety is renowned among christians throughout the civilized world for which i thank you i said his opening obviously being preface for a request of one sort or another i said no more waiting instead to see how he would proceed the sixth holy and ecumenical synod was a splendid jewel in your fathers crown of accomplishments perhaps the most splendid in all his reign he said perhaps though he would have been in a poor position to call the synod had he not protected constantinople from the deniers of christ i returned rooting out the misguided doctrines of monotheletism and monenergism weighs more in the scales of god who surely aided him in preserving the imperial city so that he could restore correct dogma to the true and holy faith the patriarch said it may be so i admitted after a little thought for who can deny that the world to come wherein we shall exist for all eternity is of greater moment than our tiny eyeblink of life here on earth it is so paul declared luminous faith on his face after a moment he went on magnificent as the ecumenical synod was however and marvelously as it established the doctrines of the holy christian church its work regrettably was incomplete as had the fifth ecumenical synod before it convened by the great roman emperor who bore the name with which your father endowed you it dealt with doctrine at the expense of discipline i knew that as my father had known it before me some questions of discipline now had awaited settlement for nearly a century and a half not surprisingly dogma had to be established first whereupon all too often the zeal of the holy fathers flagged i asked the question he no doubt expected me to ask what remedy do you propose a new synod emperor he replied one that will deal solely with the matters of discipline the last two holy and ecumenical synods failed to cover you must agree these matters have gone neglected too long i do agree i said paul took no notice once started on a chain of thought he would pursue it link by link even if the person to whom he was speaking had skipped several links and reached the end before him now he said matters such as ordination proper clerical dress simony and alienation of monastic property stand in urgent need of definition and legislation so do less purely ecclesiastical matters like marriage and public morality manumission of slaves and the correct representation of our lord jesus christ and the suppression of base and ignorant superstition he ticked off the points on his fingers one by one as if to make sure he omitted none plainly he had forereadied them i thought more of him for that not less having had many hours of my life wasted by lackwits unprepared for the audiences they had gained with me all those matters and others as well do need regulation i said i agree he gaped at me in glad surprise you do i said so twice now i put a hand on his shoulder begin getting ready for the synod at once send out letters to bishops within the roman empire to those under the control of the arabs and to those in the western lands the blond german barbarians rule set the date for the synod as hmm two years from now that will give all the clerics wishing to attend time enough to come to constantinople and will give us plenty of time to prepare for their arrival he bowed emperor you are generous beyond what we deserve nonsense without the church how shall we be saved after a moment i went on and i want as many bishops from the western lands as possible to come there were only a few i particularly remembered arculf of rhemoulakionat the holy ecumenical synod which i suppose is why they would not admit their pope honorius was anathematized at the synod i want no such ah misunderstanding after the synod to come quite right emperor the ecumenical patriarch said the pretensions of the bishop of rome grow tedious at times peter may have founded their church but andrew founded ours and he too was an apostle and rome these days is a contemptible ruin of a town as your grandfather discovered when he traveled to the west while constantinople is and shall always be the grandest city in christendom let the ignorant western bishops see our magnificence and taste of our learning and return to their own lands better and wiser men they will be as good as they will be i replied let them return with correct doctrine and spread it through those barbarous regions yes emperor that too he said myakes everyone who talked with justinian around that time did his best to talk him out of resettling the cypriots then and there in all the hundreds of years of the roman empire i dont think theres ever been such a man for resettling people as justinian was if you lived somewhere and your ancestors had lived there for the past five hundred years to him that was plenty of reason all by itself to move you someplace else you know what it puts me in mind of brother elpidios it puts me in mind of the assyrians in the holy scriptures who resettled the ten tribes of hebrews so well theyve never been heard from since ah now ive gone and surprised you i hear it in your voice yes ive paid attention when they read the holy scriptures here why shouldnt i im an old blind man being read to is all im good for anyway this time we managed to keep him from shipping the cypriots to anatolia he would sometimes listen to reason and with everyone telling him to wait to be patient where reason lay was pretty plain this time sometimes of course he wouldnt listen to anyone or anything at all life gota interesting then for him and for the whole roman empire justinian the next spring i crossed over into anatolia to see how the sklavenoi i had resettled were getting along and how neboulos was progressing with the creation of the socalled special army most of the sklavenoi had been transferred to points along the gulf of nikomedeia the easternmost projection of the sea of marmara had i given more detailed orders to the men bringing them into romania they would have been widely scattered across anatolia as things were though their keepers had taken them along the military road to the eastern frontier from chalcedon across from the imperial city to libyssa and then to nikomedeia and there perhaps forty miles from constantinople had turned back toward the capital leaving the sklavenoi to fend for themselves that the sturdy barbarians had done as i traveled the military road myself i saw a good many thatchroofed huts like those the sklavenoi had made in the villages i had captured the year before in thrace and macedonia the men and women working in the fields were fairhaired sklavenoi the sun making their yellow locks shine like gold although not long in their new homes they had wasted no time in buckling down sensibly so for had they dawdled they would soon have begun to starve from nikomedeia the military road runs east another lesser road goes south from the fortified town toward nikaia site of the very first holy ecumenical synod it leaves the gulf of nikomedeia at the harbor of eribolos ten miles south of nikomedeia i did not follow the road all the way to nikaia but went west along the southern shore of the gulf about halfway to the seaside town of prainetos for more sklavenoi neboulos among them had been resettled thereabouts only a track hardly deserving to be called a road ran from eribolos to prainetos most travelers from one to the other would have gone by sea sometimes there were cliffs right at the waters edge with more high ground lying farther inland but here as on the flatter terrain north of the gulf sklavinian farmers were out in the fields tending their crops and minding their flocks and herds as he had before he surrendered to me neboulos made his home in a village larger and wealthier than the mean sklavinian mean when accompanied by my excubitores i rode up to that village i saw fairhaired men wearing leather jerkins practicing with javelins in a field close by neboulos himself stood among them i could not follow his barbarous dialect but he seemed to be congratulating the warriors who threw well and upbraiding those who did not a broad sincere smile was on his face as he left the sklavenoi and approached me have a care emperor myakes muttered anybody in charge of soldiers who looks that cheerful theres something wrong with him ah emperor neboulos called you come to see my special army your special army i have them go through their paces for you that is what i came to see i told him wondering if he was not too eager to show off the barbarians how convenient that he should have had a unit of them exercising just when i arrived was it too convenient word of my coming might have got there ahead of me giving him the chance to show me what he wanted me to see nothing i could do about that though being shown what others want him to see is a bane of the emperors existence everything is always prettied up everyone on his best behavior and so i watched perhaps a thousand sklavenoi march and countermarch throw javelins and shoot arrows at bales of hay they did well enough to look to be a useful addition to the roman army are these the only men with whom youve been working i asked neboulos how many men do you propose having in the special army these are not only men no neboulos answered how many men do you want in special army you resettled lot of sklavenoi in this country if you want twenty thousand men i give you that many if you can give me twenty thousand men i felt weak and dizzy with desire as if like david spying bathsheba i had suddenly and unexpectedly come upon a beautiful woman in her nakedness but my lust was for martial conquest not carnal with twenty thousand fierce sklavenoi joining the cavalry from the military districts i might be able to seize damascus the arabs capital i might even be able to take back from the followers of the false prophet the holy city of jerusalem as my greatgreatgrandfather herakleios had regained it from the persians i put twenty thousand men in your army emperor neboulos promised maybe thirty thousand even we march where you march we fight where you fight that promise he ended up keeping too my own euphoria did not last long for i was used to men exaggerating what they could do in hope of gaining advantage they did not deserve i would have been satisfied had he ended up giving me half of what he claimed but as i say he unlike so many did fulfill his promise that unfortunately proved to make matters worse rather than better but as i do too often with such comments i get ahead of myself at nebouloss command the sklavenoi cut the throats of enough sheep to feed me and my escort along with themselves then butchered the carcasses and roasted them over fires made in pits they dug in the ground they served us the mutton along with both wine and the barley drink they brew rough fare rougher even that i had eaten when campaigning against them but filling and in its own way satisfying even so i had mutton fat in my mustache and could smell it every time i inhaled no matter how often i wiped my mouth neboulos leaned over to me and asked do i hear right emperor your wife is dead yes i said shortly who could expect a barbarian to have manners you stay here with us tonight yes he said and went on without waiting for my answer shall i bring you pretty woman to keep you warm to keep you happy most times most places i should have said yes to that in those days but hearing neboulos put me in mind of the night after we sacked his village and of the sklavinian woman i had chosen from among the captives no i exclaimed perhaps more sharply than i had intended neboulos being an ignorant heathen who knew no better then asked if you do not want pretty woman shall i bring you pretty boy no i said again even more sharply that before so sharply in fact that nebouloss eyes widened in surprise i explained in the law of the roman empire those who partake of this impious practice are put to the sword it is criminal as the holy scriptures clearly set forth even bishops who succumb to it face harsh punishment i know of one who was tortured and sent into exile and another who was castrated and paraded through the streets for the people of his city to mock seems silly to make such fuss over this thing neboulos said never having had the privilege of learning the precepts of the true and holy christian faith then though he shrugged if you do not want pretty girl or pretty boy i do not bring you pretty girl or pretty boy you sleep by yourself you are emperor you can do as you like i was not altogether by myself in bed that night being accompanied by an inordinate number of mosquitoes but pederasty is not only against the law of god and man it has never been to my taste and remembering the one untamed sklavinian woman i was not anxious to try another what neboulos had shown me left me encouraged on my return to the imperial city he did seem at least to be attempting to do as he had promised when he surrendered up north of thessalonike perhaps the special army he had vowed to create would be worth hurling at the arabs better by far i thought to spend sklavinian lives than roman emperor stephen the persian said i want you to examine these coins we have received from the followers of the false prophet in their latest tribute payment his voice quivered with indignation stephen could be relied upon to take seriously anything pertaining to gold the coins he handed me were not roman nomismata though their obverses copied from goldpieces of my predecessors closely resembled our mintings when i turned the coins over though i saw at once what had upset him it was not so much that the deniers of christ truncated the cross on the reverse of their goldpieces thanks to their false religion they had been doing that for some time but the inscriptions on these new coins were not in the greek and latin characters we romans use on our nomismata they appeared instead in the sinuous ophidian letters the arabs employ to write their own jargon what do they say i asked something extolling their false prophet and senseless god i have no doubt stephen replied that they copy our coins is bad enough that they do such a thing as this is much worse i wonder how they would like it if we minted coins with legends calling their mouamet a liar i said and then in an altogether different tone of voice i wonder how they would like it if we minted coins calling their mouamet a liar the idea appealed to me not least because it would be the plain and simple truth that is an interesting notion emperor stephen the persian replied but not one that is germane here the question at hand being what is to be done about the presence of these anomalous coins in this years tribute as i had seen in matters having to do with money he was singlemindedness itself the notion of calling the false prophet a liar and a blasphemer on our nomismata remained most tempting for those coins pass current far beyond the borders of the roman empire and it was an opportunity for us to tell the arabs what we thought of their misguided diabolically inspired heresy reluctantly i brought my mind back to the question the sakellarios had asked and i asked a question of my own are these goldpieces of the proper weight and purity they are he said sounding as if he hated to admit it then this year at least we shall accept them i said we can melt them down and remint them so these offending messages do not spread through the empire it is a nuisance i know but i am not yet fully prepared to go to war with abimelekh as you wish he said again unhappily listening to him i got the idea that for the sake of any tiny alteration in the goldpieces we received as tribute he would have sent every soldier we had marching against the miscalled commander of the faithful never having been one to turn the other cheek to slights no matter how small i might under other circumstances have felt the same when i did not i wondered why and realized i wanted to wait until nebouloss special army should be ready before warring against the arabs only then did i fully understand how much hope i had for that army the tribute will stop at least for a while when we do go to war against the deniers of christ i reminded him i want to be certain we have enough in the treasury to fight for a long time even without the tributes coming in and also to run the state afterwards without it you may depend on me for that stephen the persian said i should also note that my colleague theodotos whom i commended to you before has proved most ingenious in gaining for the fisc all taxes due it good i told him congratulate him on his diligence gold will be scarce when the arabs leave off paying tribute however large a store of nomismata we can build in advance will help us pay for the war we must get this money by whatever means prove necessary by whatever means prove necessary stephen repeated you may depend on me and on theodotos for that he was as good as his word and so was theodotos who proved so capable i promoted him to general logothete a position of equal rank to stephens over the next few months petitions pertaining to the collection of taxes increased sharply so did the anguished tone of those petitions when handing me one sheaf of them the logothete in charge of petitions a whitebearded bureaucrat named sisinniakes who might have served the empire since the days of my greatgreatgrandfather said emperor these people hate your tax collectors so much they and others like them are liable to end up hating you too if i had not heeded that advice from my mother i would not heed it from sisinniakes either i stared at him until he lowered his eyes and muttered in embarrassment at having spoken out of turn the fisc must be served i said those who seek to cheat it of its rightful due must be discovered and made to pay in full remember your pay comes from the treasury too he bowed and withdrew leaving the petitions behind more soon came in to the palace fools kept grumbling because the state that protected them from the ravages of the barbarians and the followers of the false prophet could not do so free of cost but sisinniakes was right at least to the extent that even the grumbling of fools could prove dangerous and so summoning stephen and theodotos to the throne room in the grand palace i allowed some of those alleging my officials had wronged them to come before me and try to convince me they were right stephen as was his wont dressed richly he had the love of ostentation so common among eunuchs his undertunic was of gold silk the robe he wore over it of green gold rings gleamed on his fingers a heavy gold chain stretched around his fat neck the buckles of his sandals were also of gold theodotos by contrast wore a plain black wool robe as if he were still back in the thracian monastery from which he had come he was tall and thin and pale a pallor accentuated not only by the robe but also by his hair one lock of which kept flopping down over his forehead and his long thick beard which were both the color of pitch his cheeks were hollow he continuing to practice an ascetic way of life here in constantinople while his eyes though dark glowed as if from an inner fire the first to protest against his exactions was a certain artavasdos a wine merchant after prostrating himself before me he pointed at theodotos and said his voice quivering with fury emperor inside that monkish robe dwells a wolf do you know what he did to me do you know i collected the monies due the fisc theodotos said calmly he sounded as he usually did as if he knew precisely what he was doing and would proceed on that course without hesitation no wonder then i favored him my own mind running in similar channels artavasdos leaped into the air a remarkable turn for such a short plump man he came to my shop emperor with soldiers they tied my hands together with ropes and hung me up over a beam then they piled sawdust and chaff and such under me and lighted them with a lamp they smoked me emperor like a ham they smoked me over the fire till i thought i was going to die to make me tell them where i hid my money i turned to theodotos who was sorting through sheets of papyrus what have you to say about this matter emperor artavasdos son of symbatios owed the fisc the sum of a long pale finger slid down the list of names he was holdingtwentyfour and seventwelfths nomismata said arrears having accumulated over the period of four years after my visit to him his debt to the treasury was paid in full did you owe this sum i asked artavasdos his already swarthy face grew darker yet rage suffusing it he pointed at theodotos again what he did emperor only a monster would do not a human being i was choking in the smoke coughing wheezing my shoulders like to be torn out of their sockets and he stood there laughing laughing i tell you do you deny owing the fisc these twentyfour nomismata i demanded suddenly getting my drift artavasdos stopped blustering no he said in a small voice did he and the fisc take any more money than was owed i asked no emperor theodotos said and most reluctantly the wine seller agreed get out of here i shouted get out of here and give thanks to the merciful mother of god that i dont tear out your cheating tongue you dare to rob the treasury and then complain when youre caught good theodotos here should have smoked you into ham for youre a swine wallowing in the trough of our generosity get out court ceremonial forgotten artavasdos left at a dead run he might even have been faster than john of cyprus several men who i thought might be petitioners also hastily departed without pleading their cases before me but one group in tunics plainly their best and as plainly none too good did come before me having completed their prostrations they rose their spokesman a loutish fellow as shabbily dressed as the rest said emperor im called ioannakis whoever had styled him little john had done so on the principle of contrariness for he was large and burly with a wrestlers shoulders he went on im one of the heads of the carpenters guild and these here are some of my boys his companions nodded he spoke a rough greek of a kind seldom heard in the grand palace but seemed to be doing his best to be polite with it say on i told him ioannakis pointed to stephen the persian a lot of men pointed fingers in the throne room that day emperor that fellow is a bad one he said he cut our pay for some of the repair work weve been doing here at the palace and when we complained about it he set ruffians throwing stones on us look and see for yourself he pulled up one sleeve of his tunic displaying a jagged poorly healed scar on the big muscle of his upper arm emperor the pay for these workmen comes from your privy purse stephen said smoothly when i looked a question at him i discovered them working more slowly than they should have and adjusted their wages accordingly thats a lie ioannakis shouted and several of the men with him shook their fists at stephen and bawled coarse curses we were doing fine till he stuck his pointy nose in where it didnt belong looking for ways to make us hungrier dont see him looking any too hungry he added staring insolently at stephens plump prosperity imperturbable the eunuch said it is not a lie the work to be completed would not be finished by the time assigned necessitating the reduction in wages previously mentioned following the reduction the workers threatened to damage such work as they had already done i found a way to force them from the area without summoning soldiers and provoking worse bloodshed ioannakis and the other carpenters kept shouting and cursing even after i raised my hand for silence as stephens comments had already shown they knew neither discipline nor respect for their betters i gestured to the excubitores flanking the throne only when they slammed the butts of their spears against the marble floor did the carpenters come to their senses and quiet down now i pointed at them if you cannot do that which is required of you you have no business coming here and complaining to me of it obey those set above you and you will do better now go i pointed again this time to the way out but instead of obeying as all subjects are obliged to do when the emperor of the romans commands ioannakis hubris filling his spirit shouted out to everyone who would listen this is a cheat do you see how he cheats us his vain insane followers bellowed like nonsense rage ripped through me i pointed first to the carpenters then to the excubitores yet more pointing fingers on that day seize these men i told my guards cast them into prison until we can properly decide their fate then ioannakis and his henchmen did make for the door but more excubitores stood there and prevented their leaving the guardsmen who had been stationed to either side of the throne advanced on them trapping them between two groups of soldiers after a little scuffling the arrogant insolent mannerless wretches were seized and taken away calm having been restored to the throne room the rest of the days audiences proceeded smoothly myakes yes i was there brother elpidios why didnt justinian listen to the downtrodden workmen ill tell you why hed told stephen and theodotos to squeeze as much gold out of people as they could he says as much youve read the words they were doing what hed said they were enjoying themselves doing it true but he didnt care about that one way or the other he cared about obedience and about money anyone who got in the way of that had to look out we took ioannakis and the other carpenters down to the praitorion the city eparchs headquarters on the mese and threw them into cells there what i figured would happen was that the eparch would let them stew for a couple of days tell them what idiots theyd been for insulting the emperor and send them home it looked like a neat clean way to get free of the mess trouble is id guessed wrong about ju stinian i thought hed angry up and calm down and forget about things but he didnt the very next day he sent an order to throw away the key for ioannakis and his friends they were still in prison the ones who were still alive anyhow when he was cast down from the throne and they were a long way from the only ones too youre right brother so far as i know nobody in the roman empire ever did anything like that before justinian except for having people tonsured and shutting them away in monasteries that is what its not the same i suppose not especially if they let you keep your eyes before they shut you away bitter why on earth would i be bitter i thank god every day that im alive well almost every day some days certainly justinian but for a few small raids by the bulgars the empire remained at peace over the next couple of years and those raids were met promptly and well by the mardaites whom i had resettled along the frontier with the bulgars my advisers had claimed i would tear down the brazen wall between the roman empire and the followers of the false prophet the mardaites represented but they were mistaken the mardaites did however build up a soldierly wall between the empire and the bulgars a wall sorely lacking up to that time abimelekh the arabs miscalled commander of the faithful continued sending me the annual tribute the treaty to which i had made him agree required of him each year though more and more of the goldpieces contained within that tribute were neither proper roman nomismata nor close arab imitations of our coins but rather their newfangled mintings with inscriptions in their own tongue furthermore the papyrus the deniers of christ sold to our chancery was now marked not with the holy and lifegiving cross as had always been the custom but with passages from the lying works of their false prophet remembering my earlier conversation with stephen the persian i summoned the engraver cyril saying to him i want you to ready for me new designs for our nomismata these having inscriptions mocking mouamet choose whatever texts you like so long as they are properly insulting if you have trouble coming up with ideas talk with a priest or even with the ecumenical patriarch cyril being a fine and pious christian i had expected him to leap gladly on the orders i gave him instead he looked troubled saying emperor must i change the coins that way he did not speak disrespectfully as the arrogant manikins who called themselves carpenters had done the respect he showed helped me keep my temper instead of growing angry as i might otherwise easily have done i replied good heavens why on earth would you not want to do this his earnest face twisted i dont know if i can make you understand emperor he thought for a little while then said let me put it like this a nomisma isnt something just for the moment its something that lasts a long time you look through a pile of goldpieces youll see coins struck in the reign of herakleios of the first justinian of anastasios of theodosios even of constantine those are scarce god knows but they show up now and again five hundred years from now people will find your nomismata the same way seems a shame to put slogans on em for the quarrels of a moment if you know what i mean greek as it is customarily written having many memories of ancient days in it does not well reflect greek as it is spoken by men of little education as cyril certainly was in trying to call back to memory his words i am certain i have made him more eloquent than he was yet sincerity blazed from him and when backed by such sincerity his words commonplace though they may have been had their effect on me for the point he was making was an important one unlike some barbarian kingdoms the roman empire spans the centuries no less than it bestrides the civilized world extending even in these sorry days from the southern pillar of hercules where the mediterranean meets the great outer ocean to the caucasus mountains seen from that longer viewpoint concerns of the moment all at once seemed less pressing i said very well perhaps mocking the arabs false prophet with slogans is not the best way to show we disapprove of what they are doing with their coins but i do not intend to let them think they can get away with their outrages either oh no emperor the engraver exclaimed i dont want that either let me see if i can find a better way to do it so that anybody who looks at your nomismata even a thousand years from now will see how splendid they are a thousand years from now i murmured i wondered who would be emperor of the romans then and what his nomismata would look like surely they would be pure from the days of constantine the great to my own a span of more than three and a half centuries the roman empire has struck coins of pure gold seventytwo to the pound i saw and to this day see no reason for that not to continue forever ill come up with something good emperor cyril promised ill think and ill sketch and ill pray till i do god will put something in my mind so i can give him the glory he deserves let it be as you say i said dismissing him and it was as he said although two years passed before god graced him with the vision he immortalized in gold the wait though longer than i would have liked was i must say worth it myakes somewhere right around the time he was writing those words brother elpidios the arabs took the southern pillar of hercules away from us and ran up into western iberia the land ive also heard called spain and nobody nobody roman anyhow knows how far to the east theyve spread word of the false prophet these are hard times for us christians if constantinople had fallen in that last siege there might not be any christians left in the whole world today whats that brother on account of our sins you say maybe but arent the arabs sinners and followers of a false religion why do they flourish when all we do is suffer eh brother elpidios why is that justinian that same summer churchmen began arriving for the synod that would make good the lack of regulations issuing from the fifth and sixth ecumenical synods indeed because it was intended to be a supplement to those synods the ecumenical patriarch styled it in his letter of announcement the fifthsixth synod penthekte in greek and i learned from western arrivals who had had the letter translated into the latin more commonly used there quinisextum in that tongue the synod itself was not to begin for another year at first i was surprised to learn of so many bishops coming so soon but a moments reflection sufficed to explain that what man of sense offered the choice between spending time in whatever dreary town he called home and in the queen of cities could fail to desire the latter in that same otherwise quiet summer came a letter from the brother of theodore of koloneia who served as bishop of the city from which theodore had sprung in it he complained of the iniquities of the paulicians a heretical sect originating among the armenians by whose country koloneia lies their crimes included not only misbelief by also idolatry not wanting my name for the orthodoxy tarnished at a time when bishops from throughout the known world were gathering in the imperial city i ordered the bishop to suppress these heretics against whom in an earlier outbreak my father had also moved by whatever means proved necessary up to and including summoning troops from the armeniac military district to break up their robbers nests any who refused to recant their error or who returned to it after such recantation were to be burned alive after their leader who to help him escape detection went by two names sergios and titus met death in this fashion these paulician heretics ceased to trouble the borders of the roman empire to this day i remain proud of having succeeded in putting them down once for all and in restoring the area to perfect allegiance to the orthodox faith myakes whats that you say brother elpidios there are still paulicians around and theyre still heretics and still bandits i should be sad i am sad for i dont love heresy not even a little bit but thats not what i meant im sad for justinians sake its one more thing he thought he did that turned out to be built on sand thats the way of the world isnt it faith lasts you say god lasts i pray youre right justinian in the following year a sufficiency of bishops having gathered the fifthsixth synod was convened i ordered the sessions held in a domed hall of the great palace for which reason i have sometimes heard the synod called that held in the dome the westerners in whose tongue the word dome is signified by trullo are most prone to this usage as the synod opened all the assembled bishops prostrated themselves before me they having risen i addressed them as my father had addressed the bishops who had come to the imperial city for the sixth ecumenical synod holy fathers i said and my words came echoing back from the dome that gave the hall we were using its name employing me as his instrument god has given you the chance to complete and perfect the work of the previous two ecumenical synods which concerned themselves more with dogma than with discipline you are the protector of the church justinian the bishops responded though we live in an age of corruption and despair you will restore the light we once knew i made the sign of the cross the bishops imitating my gesture such formal praise as that which they had just given me is not always sincere but i basked in it nonetheless knowing that by summo ning the fifthsixth synod i had become part of a chain of emperors dating back to constantine the great who would be remembered forever for their association with the holy ecumenical synods how could a christian want a memorial better than defining the faith and its rules rooting out error and making the truth shine forth the problems before us are many i said even now almost seven centuries after the incarnation of our lord jesus christ pagan practices persist among the peasants we christians also stand in danger of corruption by the mischievous ideas of the jews our morals are appallingly lax this holding true for both layfolk and clergymen and further both in the west where barbarians rule and in armenia certain unacceptable practices have taken root and need to be eradicated in mentioning the armenians i did not refer to the paulician heretics but rather to the customs that had gained acceptance within the regular christian church of armenia that church has never fully reconciled itself to the condemnation of the misguided doctrine of the single nature of christ and being more often than not under the power of the followers of the false prophet is not so fully susceptible to ecclesiastical discipline as i should like we shall make the world new and pure and holy the bishops chorused we shall correct all errors remove all ambiguities and that over the next few months is exactly what they set about to do with my approval they took severest aim at suppressing worship of the demons who had fooled the folk of the days before the divine incarnation into thinking they were gods even in my time people would people do swear oaths by these pagan gods the synod made those swearing such oaths liable to excommunication as they richly deserved to be for their thoughtlessness men and women trampling out the vintage remained in the habit of calling on bacchus the false god of wine as they did so they too were made liable to excommunication as were those who celebrated bacchuss festival the broumalia the great festival of pan who as every educated man knows died shortly after the time of our lord as the pagan writer plutarch acknowledges the bota and the old pagan new years festival near the vernal equinox village dances celebrating the pagan gods were also condemned laymen participating in them being made subject to excommunication and clergymen to removal from their order the same penalty applied to those wearing masks whether tragic comic or satiric which were connected to the false cult of dionysos the assembled bishops also outlawed divination horoscopes ventriloquism and fortunetelling of all sorts because of their unchristian nature gods will may not be influenced thus and may not be known until he chooses to reveal it in the fullness of time perhaps because offenses of this nature are so common the synod decreed six years penance for them rather than excommunication as it should have done the fifthsixth synod also protected us christians against the pernicious jews who yet persist among us steadfastly denying with their stubborn ignorance the reality of the new dispensation decreed by jesus christ the bishops ordered laymen excommunicated and clergymen deposed who ate of the jews unleavened bread who accepted medicine from jews whose reputation for skill as physicians no doubt springs from satanic assistance and who bathed with them or had other similarly intimate dealings while condemning these errors the synod also perfected the laws governing us christians it forbade picturing jesus christ as the lamb of god ordaining that he be shown only as the man he was lest the ignorant conceive from the misrepresentation that god had truly sent his son to earth in lambs shape and it prohibited using the cross in a floor mosaic to keep feet from trampling on and profaning the holy symbol sensibly the synod affirmed and strengthened previous condemnations of adultery fornication abortion and maintaining a bawdy house it banned gambling with dice and also outlawed appearing as an actor in a theatrical show from the time when these rules were promulgated i vigorously enforced them myakes that he did brother elpidios that he did you should have heard people grumble too you tell your constantinopolitan he cant have his shows you tell him he cant throw the dice and he wont be very happy id be lying if i said i never got down on my knees in the dirt myself matter of fact yes i was at the sessions yes i heard gambling with dice condemned why did i do it its fun thats why im a sinner now give me news i havent heard eh what do you want to know did justinian leave off his drinking and fornicating after he set his signature on all those canons he was twentytwo years old give or take a year and emperor of the romans what do you think he did youre right thats what he did if you already know the answers why ask the questions justinian as i urged it to do the synod condemned certain practices followed by the armenians and by the barbarians in the west the armenian bishops raised no objection to the four canons that sought to regulate affairs in their church nor at the time did the few clerics who had come from the west complain about the forbidding of fasting on saturdays during the lenten season about prohibiting the eating of meat from strangled animals or about other smallsouled exotic and newfangled usages prevailing in that part of the world and so the synod moved on to consider canons pertaining to marriage it affirmed that men previously married who were ordained as deacons or priests could and indeed were required to keep the wives with whom they had exchanged the holy and sacred vows of matrimony here basil the bishop of gortyna on the island of crete who being under the jurisdiction of the pope of rome had also helped represent rome at the sixth ecumenical synod protested saying the custom in the west is different and requires complete celibacy of priests and deacons those there who have wives must put them aside to be ordained this is but another barbarous error on the part of western clerics the ecumenical patriarch said have they forgotten the words of the book of matthew what therefore god hath joined together let not man put asunder for your reference he added slightingly as if basil could not be expected to know this is the sixth verse of the nineteenth chapter paul spoke as if explaining proper doctrine to a child not to a fellow churchman the bishops under the jurisdiction of the see of constantinople made only the slightest efforts to conceal their amusement having long since wearied of the arrogant pretensions of the popes who dwelling in the ruins of what was once a great city think to dictate doctrine to the entire civilized world basil of gortyna held his temper he said practice in the west differs and the differences are of long enough establishment to be tolerated under the principle of economy george and daniel pope sergioss regular legates in constantinople nodded in agreement but paul shook his head saying the principle of economy covers differences of ritual without doctrinal importance that cannot be said of rules pertaining to the proper ordination of priests and deacons basil looked mournful the holy pope will not care to set his signature on canons going dead against the custom in his patriarchate he and the papal legates wrangled on with the ecumenical patriarch and the bishops from within the roman empire for some time over this matter and others such as the canon that only reconfirming the acts of the second and fourth ecumenical synods placed constantinople with rome in patriarchal privilege ranking after it only in the listing of the patriarchates i heard much of this later for i did not attend all these sessions of the fifthsixth synod having other matters to occupy my attention chief among these was the return of the cypriots who again petitioned me to let them leave their island and settle within territory under the sole rule of the roman empire where i had refused them before i now accepted their pleas resettling a good many of them in bithynia not far from the imperial city thanks to abimelekhs insolent provocations with his coins and papyrus sheets i was more inclined toward war than i had been previously and thanks to the exertions of neboulos who to my amazement was building his army to the size he had promised more confident of the outcome in my honor the cypriots renamed the town in which i resettled them new justinianopolis this touched me even more than it might have otherwise for their luck during the resettlement was not good a storm sank some of the ships carrying them to their new home while a pestilence raged among them after the transfer but they sent john whose acquaintance i had already made to the fifthsixth synod despite his previous foolishness i was glad to see him there as a sign of their making themselves at home not long after the cypriots had been moved to new justinianopolis cyril the engraver asked for an audience with me emperor i have it he cried upon rising after prostrating himself splendid i said agreeably pleased to see one of my subjects so diligent in his service to me i have it being imperfectly informative though i asked what do you have the way you were seeking emperor to show the deniers of christ the folly of the ways and the glory of the true and holy faith he answered i leaned forward on the throne he had indeed engaged my interest show me what you have i said and beckoned him to me a rare privilege for an artisan even one so skilled as cyril as he approached he reached down to a pouch he wore on his belt a couple of the excubitores who stood nearest the throne stepped between him and me pointing their spears at him with warning growls but he had not come with assassination in mind all he drew from the leather pouch was a sheet of papyrus on which he had been sketching in charcoal the papyrus i saw was one of the new sheets from egypt one on which the customary cross had been replaced by verses from the work of the arabs false prophet that made cyrils sketches all the more glorious for they could have been taken to symbolize christianitys triumph over the wicked doctrines mouamet preached one sketch showed a roman emperor recognizably resembling me standing by and holding a stepmounted cross a cross such as had been commonplace on the reverse of roman nomismata for centuries cyril had lettered an inscription around the rim of the circular sketch d iustinianus servus christi most of the letters were latin only a few greek lord justinian servant of christ he said translating it into the tongue that had replaced latin for most purposes in the empire i nodded but absently for i was looking at the other sketch which was of our lord cyril had portrayed him as christ pantokrator the ruler of all his right hand flexed in a gesture of benediction his left holding a book the cross on which he was crucified appeared behind his head here the inscription read again in a mixture of latin and greek letters ies cristos rex regnantium jesus christ king of rulers cyril translated he looked up at me emperor a nomisma with this on it will tell the followers of the false prophet what we think of him and of them it will i breathed coins go everywhere within the roman empire and thanks to the unchanging fineness of our gold far beyond as well a story told by a certain kosmas who sailed to india during the reign of my namesake a century and a half before my time comes to mind an indian prince asked him and a persian merchant who was also present at his court which of them had a mightier sovereign the persian of course at once claimed his king was the mightier but kosmas told the indian prince both rulers are here by their coins shall you judge them the persians silver was not bad in its way but could not stand comparison to the gleaming roman nomismata and so the prince rightly judged the emperor of the romans mightier than the persian king of kings one thing concerns me i told cyril these drawings are large each was broader than the palm of my handbut a nomisma is small scarcely the width of my thumb will you be able to reproduce them accurately in that cramped space he drew himself up the picture of affronted pride emperor my work satisfied your father and it has always satisfied you up to now do you think i would do anything less than my best when making an image of our lord im sorry i said one of the few times in fact thinking back the only one i can remember i ever apologized while sitting on the imperial throne how soon can you strike examples to show me cyril got a faraway look in his eye i would say three days emperor but like i told you i want this to be my very finest work will five days do that will be fine i said having expected some considerably longer time looking back i should have known better for some of the coins the palace servitors threw to the crowds of constantinople at my coronation bore my image not my fathers the engravers could at need work very fast indeed and cyril proved as good as his word in fact one day better when he handed me the first five nomismata he had struck i brought them close to my face and squinted at them hardly believing he had managed to include so much in so small a compass i could make out the individual hairs long and flowing on christs head and in his beard and mustache i imagined i could read though in truth i could not the words on the book he was holding on the reverse my own image was also impressively detailed down to the three jeweled pendants dangling from the fibula that held my chlamys closed i passed one of the nomismata to myakes saying tell me what you think of this i always think well of gold emperor he answered with a smile which i knew to be true though he was not madly greedy for it as some men are i had given him the coin with the side upward that showed me standing and holding the cross he looked at it nodded in a businesslike way and turned the nomisma over he studied the image of our lord in silence for some little while so long that i began to wonder whether he had caught some flaw i missed then softly he said ahh my gaze went to cyril his expression was the one he might have worn had some beautiful woman come up to him and begged him to take her to his bed that very instant with the possible exception of something like that no artisan could have got higher praise than myakes murmur of awe had just given him to myakes i said keep that coin for yourself i gave cyril back the other four nomismata and you keep these you did everything i wanted my coinage to do and did it better than i imagined it could be done i thank you emperor for letting me turn my wits loose and not ordering me to do the other he answered and i thank god for letting my wits come across this idea for putting it in my mind you might say he knows how to watch over his faith better than any of us does i expect you might as well be a bishop i told him he held up his scarred callused hands im better at what i do he said maybe one day when im too old to use the awl and the punch and the chisel and the hammer as i should ill seek the quiet of the monastery but not yet good enough i said you can make me more splendid coins then he nodded almost although not quite as happy as he had been when myakes involuntary startled praise turned him to a bowl of barley mush i looked out at the bishops each in his finest vestments who had come to this godguarded and imperial city at my urging you are agreed then holy fathers that these canons complete and perfect the work of the last two ecumenical synods emperor we are they chorused as one then let my signature and yours on the canons of this synod be proof of that and so saying i dipped a pen into a jar of the crimson ink reserved for emperors alone and set my name on each of the six copies scribes had prepared of the canons one copy for the imperial chancery and one each for the patriarchs of rome constantinople alexandria antioch and jerusalem paul the ecumenical patriarch affixed his signature next after mine leaving a blank space on each parchment wherein sergios the pope of rome might set his name after him came the three patriarchs whose sees still unfortunately groan under the heel of the arabs miscalled commander of the faithful and after them i had the pleasure of summoning john the bishop of new justinianopolis who had been translated with his flock from cyprus to bithynia his signature went immediately below those of the patriarchs thank you for the honor you show me and my new city emperor he said bowing i take great pleasure in seeing you here i answered and we beamed at each other he might have been foolish but our thoughts now ran in the same channel after john the rest of the bishops who had attended my fifthsixth synod queued up to sign the canons to which they had agreed as more than two hundred had come to the imperial city and as each man had to write his name half a dozen times the ceremony took some time among those signing their names were george and daniel who regularly represented pope sergios in constantinople and basil of gortyna whose see as i have said fell under the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the see of rome george and daniel signed without hesitation as i saw with my own eyes bishop basil also set down his name but having done so said emperor i fear the holy pope will find some of the canons here hard to bear if he knows what is good for him i said pitching my voice so all the assembled bishops could hear he will give his assent and waste no time doing it i have great things in mind in the east and have no intention of wasting my time enforcing discipline on a barbarous backwoods province like italy if the bishop of rome withholds his signature he shall be punished quickly and severely the bishops from within the heartland of the roman empire nodded knowing they had to accommodate themselves to their sovereigns wishes of the far smaller number of western bishops some looked alarmed others indignant the latter i suppose failed to remember how my grandfather as other roman emperors had done before him had used the exarch of ravenna to seize a pope who flouted his wishes and send him off to imprisonment exile and torture although not eager to do such a thing i aimed to if sergios decided to be troublesome having him inflame dissent and argument was the last thing i needed when i was about to go to war against abimelekh leontioss broad earnest face puckered into a frown emperor your father would never have done a thing like this he said i fought the arabs a lot of times for him but he would never have done anything like this he had not lost his habit of repeating himself but that was not why i glared at him i had by then been emperor of the romans for seven years being told what my father would have done rankled he is dead i answered my voice cold i choose war against the followers of the false prophet not this odious treaty of peace which they have violated and under which the roman empire suffers i thought of you to command my army and chast ise them as they deserve you have succeeded against them before are you afraid you cannot again im not afraid of anything he said puffing out his massive chest not of anything but it wont be as easy as it was before abimelekhs finally put down all the rebellions that plagued him so it wont be easy no indeed that only means hell be able to put a few more men in the line against us i said well have the troops from the military districts well have neboulos and his special army of sklavenoi useless barbarians leontios muttered which made me glare again neboulos having to my continuing astonishment trained up as many sklavenoi as he had promised me barbarians leontios said again emperor if you beat them with a roman army what makes you think abimelekh wont beat them with an arab army they fought well against us i answered exaggerating only a little and since then theyve had a taste of proper roman discipline which was true put them in the line with roman soldiers to help stiffen them and theyll do well i feel sure and besides i went on flattering him a little because thanks to his previous victories i did want him to command the army with you leading the host how can we possibly fail in due course leontios would show me how we could possibly fail at the moment the glow that lighted his features did not spring from the reflection of lamplight off his rather greasy skin like a sponge he sucked up compliments ah emperor you honor me more than i deserve he boomed which also turned out to be true i dont think so i said showing how little i knew of the future now lets decide how best to strike the arabs a hard blow when we do strike them it should be in a way theyll remember for years well hit em a good lick emperor that we will leontios said a good lick yes indeed you have no more objections i asked i wouldnt do it emperor he said i wouldnt i already told you that but if we are foolish enough to do it uh that is if we are going to do it youre right and we should hit em as hard as we can ill do my best to strike a hard blow against em that i will i weighed him in the balance and did not find him wanting continuing to speak against my point of view i told myself took a certain amount of courage courage that could also be usefully employed against the arabs i said send out orders for the armies from the military districts to gather at their assembly points send orders to neboulos and the special army also i shall personally lead forth the imperial guards to join them he bowed emperor everything shall be as you say while i contemplated war against the followers of the false prophet abimelekh contemplated desecrating a famous and holy christian shrine i learned of this as the result of an unexpected embassy from the lands controlled by the miscalled commander of the faithful both ambassadors as often happens were christians sergios of damascus the son of the mansour with whom my father had often dealt who served abimelekh as finance minister and patrikios klausus the leader of the christians of palestine emperor we are in sore need of your aid sergios said after he and patrikios had prostrated themselves before me abimelekh my ruler plans to restore the temple at mecca which suffered in the arabs late civil war why is this a concern to me i asked with genuine curiosity though the center from which the arabs false prophet sprang out like a wolf mecca had never been under the dominion of the roman empire patrikios answered me emperor for the restoration he plans to take columns from the grotto of christs agony at holy gethsemane an outrage i shouted had i not already decided to go to war against the arabs learning of the wickedness abimelekh planned on perpetrating would have impelled me in that direction but mansour held up a soothing hand we asked him not to do this emperor hoping you might supply us with other columns to use in their stead that i can do i said at once this i shall do in my minds eye i saw the fortress of ankyra in central anatolia and what had been the city and was now the field of ruins below abimelekh could have a hundred columns from those ruins alone without making anyone notice they were missing and ankyra was but one of the scores of cities that had shrunk or died in the incessant warfare of the past ninety years the miscalled commander of the faithful was welcome to our rubbish even if i was about to go to war with him sergios and patrikios were effusive in their thanks we knew your generosity would let us preserve the holy place undisturbed patrikios said no matter what happens i promised i will send these columns to abimelekh for his false temple at mecca so that he need not trouble a shrine belonging to the true faith this promise i kept preventing the desecration of the church at gethsemane perhaps i should not have said no matter what happens in so doing i gave a sort of warning of what i intended in aid of my campaign in the east sergios however took it a different way saying emperor on our journey hither we saw your new nomismata and very beautiful they are too they are indeed i said and show as they should christ protecting the roman empire and the roman emperor there is only one difficulty with them sergios said and that is that i fear my master the caliph abimelekh will not accept them in his realm since they contradict the teachings of his religion he will have to pay you the agreedupon tribute in coins of his own minting we agreed it should be paid in nomismata i reminded him he looked worried the weight of gold would be the same emperor so you would not suffer any loss as a result of this only the images and legends of the coins would change that was not part of the agreement we made sergios looked unhappier yet is this the word i should convey to the caliph he will not be pleased to hear it not even when i have the joy of telling him you have made arrangements to spare gethsemane his words showed me courtiers in damascus played the same games as did those of constantinople using good news to offset the bad and to keep their sovereign in as sweet a temper as they could it is probably the same among the blond barbarians of the west it is surely the same among the khazars who roam the plains north of the black sea i have seen that with my own eyes to sergios i said if this message so distresses you you need not deliver it to abimelekh hearing that he brightened but i had not finished i shall give it to him in person i said sergioss face fell so did that of patrikios klausus myakes suffered a coughing fit if i had it to do over again i would have held my tongue but i did not have it to do over again abimelekh would be warned myakes a coughing fit i hope i did brother elpidios i like to have swallowed my tongue is what happened lord have mercy brother the only quicker way justinian could have given abimelekh the news that he was going to war with him would have been to send his own messenger why did he do it no not stupidity i dont think justinian was a lot of things but not stupid whats the word i want the one left over from the old pagan dramas the fifthsixth synod condemned it means overweening pride something like that hubris thank you brother aye thats it hed beaten the sklavenoi leontios had beaten the arabs he had neboulos and the special army he didnt think he could possibly lose so why not let abimelekh know he was coming he figured abimelekh would spend that time shivering in his shoes sounds like leontios tried to warn him about abimelekh i dont have a whole lot of good things to say about leontios but he did try justinian wouldnt listen to him he wouldnt listen to people justinian wouldnt he went ahead and did what he thought he ought to do when that worked it worked fine when it didnta well see what happened when it didnt justinian i ordered nebouloss special army and the armies of the military districts to assemble at sebastopolis in the military district of the armeniacs those soldiers having begun to move before i could the excubitores and i traveled by sea to amisos and then went down to sebastopolis rather than making the whole long slow journey by road as i left the ship that had brought me to amisos the officer in charge of the fleet said good fortune go with you emperor and god bless you and your army thank you apsimaros i said may you have safe winds back to the imperial city he nodded his face was long and thin and pale i believe he had german blood of some sort in him which accounted not only for his looks but also for his peculiar name one without meaning in either greek or latin the excubitores and i rode toward sebastopolis the next day i looked back and saw apsimaross fleet sailing west toward constantinople i sighed a little if we could travel by land as readily and cheaply as by sea governing the roman empire feeding the cities and collecting taxes would be far easier than they are but even a paved highway like the via egnatia while allowing soldiers to move rapidly from one part of the empire to another does not let good travel cheaply take grain in carts more than a couple of days journey and its price doubles or worse and so very often inland districts are more isolated than islands too much time wasted on a wish that is and must for all time be idle when with the excubitores around me i rode into the camp i glowed with pride at the size of the army i had caused to be assembled the tents of the cavalry forces from the military districts stretched over a wide expanse of dusty plain off to one side were other tents and huts these run up in a less orderly fashion i pointed them out to myakes see how large nebouloss special army is as many men there as in the contingents from the military districts id say looks that way he answered peering toward the sklavenoi but how many of em there are is only half the question the other half is how well will they fight they fought us well enough when they didnt have to face the liquid fire i said nettled the followers of the false prophet can no more make the fire than the sklavenoi can what would keep the special army from fighting well then nothing i can think of he said which pleased me but then he added of course the arabs might think of something i cant which did not leontios rode out from the camp to greet me here we are emperor gathered together at your order and as you commanded he proclaimed redundant as usual i waved toward the halfseparate camp of the special army as you see we have the men we need to hit the deniers of christ harder than they expect his round face went mournful oh aye so we do provided we dont come to blows and start fighting among ourselves first what do you mean i demanded the sklavenoi are cursed thieves is what i mean he said every time one of them gets near my romans he steals something a knife a chain some money it doesnt matter what neboulos came up then riding on a pony that struggled under his bulk emperor he cried these cavalry they hate your special army they taunt us they say they screw our wives screw our sisters screw our daughters when they fight us before they laugh they make us hate them worse than your enemies both leontios and neboulos started shouting at me forgetting my station in their quest for advantage then i shouted too silence leontios remembered himself first and bowed his head neboulos less used to having anyone over him went on for another sentence or two before realizing he was doing his cause more harm than good by such rudeness when he quieted i pointed to him and said are your men stealing from the cavalry of the military districts soldiers always steal he said that had a good deal of truth in it which i declined to notice soldiers loot from enemies i said they do not steal from their comrades the warriors from the military districts are the comrades of the special army do you understand that yes he said giving leontios a look anything but comradely good i told him you had better the next sklavinian who steals from a comrade will have his hand cut off do you understand that he nodded sullenly i said good see that your men understand it too thats fine emperor leontios said beaming thats fine and dandy i turned my gaze on him are your men taunting the sklavenoi as neboulos says he looked less happy urra ahha some of them maybe emperor some a few that must also cease i declared all of us here in this camp must join together against the common foe the followers of the false prophet tell the men from the military districts that any of them caught obscenely mocking their comrades in the special army will be given a choice i smiled unpleasantly a choice emperor what kind of choice leontios was not so swift to follow my thought as i would have liked a choice of the part he would sooner lose i answered his tongue with which he boasted of the lewdness he had committed or his prick the instrument of that lewdness you romans you like to cut things neboulos observed i ignored him watching leontios the generals round face which he was not good at keeping closed said he had not truly reckoned the men of the special army his comrades i will make certain the cavalry from the military districts knows of this choice he said at last see that you do when assembling my army i had not considered that its separate parts might find each other as inimical as the arabs if making them all fear me more than they hated each other yoked them in common cause make them fear me i would for all his former bold attacks against the arabs leontios proved a cautious even an apprehensive commander instead of setting out at once and storming into territory held by the deniers of christ he spent day after day drilling the cavalry from the military districts and nebouloss special army i chafed at the delay but did not follow my first impulse and order him to advance the reason he adduced for waiting was plausible enough planning cooperation between the sklavenoi who were foot soldiers and the mounted men from the military districts he tried several different formations at last settling on one that placed the special army in the center of the line with cavalry on either wing and a body of horsemen behind the sklavenoi as a reserve the cursed butterheads cant move very fast anyhow he said to me well let them hold the arabs and use the cavalry to get round the foes flanks dont call them butterheads i said two romans had lost their tongues for taunting the sklavenoi four men from the special army had had their hands cut off for theft the rest of the romans understanding they had been warned accepted their fellows punishment as something they had earned i was less confident of the effect of my order on nebouloss men who were unused to discipline from their chieftains or anyone else save possibly their wives i went on i wish we were already in combat with the followers of the false prophet that would help pull us together soon emperor soon leontios said soothingly wont be long we have to be ready we have to prepare again he repeated himself again he said the same thing twice in slightly different ways i do not know whether sergios and patrikios on their return to damascus told abimelekh enough to let him anticipate my intentions or whether the spies the arabs keep in roman territory just as we keep spies in the lands they rule sent word that our men were on the march however he learned of it the misnamed commander of the faithful hastily gathered together his soldiers and treacherously invaded romania before we began our stroke against him thus was my wish for a speedy meeting with the arabs granted though not in the way i had intended frontier guards all but killed their horses galloping back to sebastopolis with word of the invasion its a big army they have emperor one of the men said on being brought before me i didnt reckon they could put so many men in the field so fast but i was wrong and the standard theyre fighting under another scout added what standard is this i asked the scout hesitated then answered emperor theyve skewered a rolledup parchment on a spear and carry it before them saying its the treaty youve broken liars i shouted satanic hypocrites theyre the ones who broke the treaty not i theyve put their own false filthy words on their coins and on their papyrus and im going to punish them for their presumption yes emperor the scout said hastily bowing his head all im doing is telling you what ive seen and what ive heard very well i said reminding myself the messenger was not responsible for the news he bore a thought occurred to me does abimelekh lead them in person i saw myself parading the miscalled commander of the faithful through constantinople in chains before sending him to the mines to work himself to death but all the frontier guards shook their heads no emperor said the one who had told me of the arabs lying standard it is his brother mouamet the prince of northern mesopotamia a prince of the arabs ruling line struck me as good enough prey having dismissed the scouts i took counsel with leontios discussing how best to defeat the arabs and drive after them into their territory when the general heard who commanded the followers of the false prophet he looked solemn this mouamet is not a warrior to be despised not a man to hold in contempt emperor he sheds blood without pity when the arabs were fighting their civil war he took mesopotamia and syria and armenia from the rebels and restored them to abimelekhs rule youve beaten the arabs before i told him surely since god is on the side of us christians you can win another victory leontioss large head bobbed up and down relying on his ability to duplicate the successes he had enjoyed in the past i sent him away and summoned neboulos we fight soon emperor the sklavinian chieftain asked i hear these arabs they come into your land like you come into my sklavinia ignoring the comparison i said yes we will fight them the brother of their ruler commands this army of theirs i want to capture him and treat him as he deserves for breaking the treaty you treat him as bad as sklavenoi whose hands you cut off neboulos said worse i promised at which he looked suitably impressed i should have paid more attention to the tenor of the questions he was asking looking back i see that unfortunately for the roman empire at the time i did not we moved east from sebastopolis the next day we did not go as far as i would have liked the sklavenoi who marched on foot compelling the cavalry from the military districts to slow down so that the two parts of the army would not separate from each other leontios rode up to me fuming look at those disgraceful barbarians he said pointing to the men of the special army you have known for some time they are foot soldiers have you not i asked annoyed at the tone he took with me yes emperor he said but still without the proper submissiveness he pointed again and as was his wont repeated himself look at them disgraceful look i did the sklavenoi were not marching in neat wellordered ranks and files they ambled along in groups that might have been made up of friends or relatives or men who came from the same wretched little village as they walked they sang and joked and passed skins of wine back and forth their weapons stuck up at all different angles they certainly lacked the disciplined appearance of the regiment of excubitores accompanying me but however unaesthetic their progress might have been to the eye of the military purist such as leontios was giving every indication of being they were moving along every bit as fast as the imperial guards i pointed this out to leontios well so they are emperor he said and if anything goes wrong which god forbid youll see them run a lot faster than the excubitores too what do you know of the sklavenoi i said angrily you never fought against them your station has always been here in the east i was the one who beat them leontios it wasnt lack of courage that caused their defeat we had liquid fire and they did not and they were broken into clans and tribes that did not support each other why should they support each other now then he replied not knowing when to give up the argument theyre still broken up into clans and tribes not so all of which have come under the leadership of neboulos i put ice in my voice general your objections have been noted you shall now carry on with the campaign and defeat the arabs yes emperor leontios said tonelessly and rode away when we encamped for the night the disorder among the men of the special army was enough to distress me too i sent for neboulos he waved my concerns aside saying who cares how we camp we fight good since that was what i had told leontios i let myself be persuaded leontios sent scouts out a good distance ahead on our breaking camp the next morning well before noon some of their number came galloping back having encountered the outriders of the army abimelekhs brother commanded horns rang out and banners waved ordering my force to deploy from marching column to line of battle with so many thousands of men and horses involved that maneuver is more complex than any of the dances concerning which the fifthsixth synod registered its disapproval being practiced at the drill the cavalry from the military districts went through their evolutions smoothly enough the men of the special army performed less well not only were neboulos and their officers shouting at them to hurry but every roman captain who could spare a moment screamed for them to move faster lest they give not only themselves but also the entire army over to destruction by the grace of god we had taken our position perhaps fifteen to eighteen miles east of sebastopolis when the followers of the false prophet came into sight their scouts and ours exchanged arrows our men raising a cheer when one of theirs pitched from the saddle and groaning if one of our own men fell before long the whole of the army the prince mouamet led grew visible from the cloud of dust it had raised the arabs raised a great shout allahu akbar allahu akbar allahu akbar chills ran up my spine i had heard that war cry as a small boy standing on the seawall of constantinople beside my father when the deniers of christ came to besiege the imperial city we beat them then i expected us to beat them again christ with us the virgin with us the men from the military districts shouted back at the arabs they also shouted my name loud and long justinian the sklavenoi were shouting too a great bellowing like the howls of wolves and the roars of lions i sent one of the excubitores running over to neboulos to ask what their war cries meant when he came back he was grinning and reported emperor the barbarian says what theyre shouting is well make soup out of your bonesa that i said is an excellent shout as the scout had told me the arabs did carry in place of their usual banners a rolledup sheet of parchment or papyrus impaled on a spear their standardbearer rode out ahead of their army and called out in good greek we have not broken what we and you romans agreed to with oaths he waved the spear god will judge the truth and take vengeance on those who abandon it my army waited to hear what i would do pointing to the arab i did some shouting of my own a pound of gold to the man who brings me that lying standard my voice carried as it has a way of doing when i am angry up and down the line a score of horsemen from the military districts spurred their mounts toward the man holding the spear on high followers of the false prophet galloped out to meet the roman cavalry a small battle developed then and there ahead of the larger one to come neither the horsemen from the military districts nor the arabs drew back by so much as the breadth of a finger men tumbled from their horses struck by arrow and sword and spear to my anger and disappointment the arabs standardbearer kept on upholding the spear alleged to bear on it the treaty they alleged i had broken fighting soon became general all along the line from my position not far behind the special army i soon lost sight of the ends of the left and right wings tens of thousands of horses kicking up so much dust from the dry ground across which they galloped as to screen those distant formations from my view as if fogbanks lay between me and them in front of me neboulos was screeching orders like a man possessed what he was saying i do not know for certain as he used his own idiom rather than greek the sklavenoi he led shot their envenomed arrows at the followers of the false prophet and hurled great volleys of javelins when the foe drew close enough to give those some hope of hitting had the arabs pushed close enough to try handstrokes the men of the special army would have been at a disadvantage they having most of them only daggers not swords with which to defend their persons but the torrents of missiles the sklavenoi loosed against them prevented their making that discovery for themselves cavalry from the reserve went hurrying off toward the right no doubt at the request of some officer i could not see if the crisis had been invisible so was the solution that a solution had been found however i inferred from the arabs failure to break through our line of battle if the sklavenoi in front of me wavered i intended to throw the excubitores into the breach my own guards were looking now this way now that eager to find a place where they could battle the deniers of christ they shouted for me to send them into the fray myakes some of them did the troopers were young men brother elpidios and the horsemen from the military districts had been teasing us they couldnt lose their tongues or their prongs for that toy soldiers they called us and sweets in fancy wrappers on account of our gaudy surcoats and other things i wont soil your ears with wed had some fights with them and broken some heads too me shouting to get into a battle id been in a battle against nebouloss men and i found out it was a lot more fun to think about than for real and i was past thirty by then too getting to the age where your blood doesnt boil quite so fast i wanted us romans to win i didnt want nebouloss sklavenoi to what was the word justinian used to waver that was it for one thing if the special army did a lot of wavering there werent enough excubitores to plug the gap they would have made for another if they didnt waver that much my men and i would be fighting the arabs with the sklavenoi alongside us and if they turned their backs and ran then whod be left in the lurch thats right brother elpidios me and my chums thats who but it didnt happen that first day the special army eh whats that brother justinian has a good deal more to say all right read some more of the manuscript well see how what he remembers stacks up against what i recall somewhere in there we might even find some truth justinian had there been need i would not have hesitated for a moment over sending the excubitores into battle i knew how well they could fight i had seen as much when we took nebouloss village and also on other occasions i also knew they could protect my person as effectively or perhaps more effectively while fighting at some distance from me than gathered in a tightpacked mass around me leontios had wanted the battle to unfold like the great victory hannibal had won over the romans at cannae more than two hundred years before our lords incarnation the center here the special army holding firm while the cavalry on either wing swept out and enfolded the foe in a box from which there would be no escape that was what he wanted what he got proved a good deal less he being no hannibal and the arabs proving far cannier than the romans whom the wily carthaginian had lured to destruction when the wings of the cavalry from the military districts tried to fold round the followers of the false prophet the arabs flank guards held them in check after scant progress the deniers of christ thus remaining unsurrounded strategy became secondary to the courage displayed by the soldiers on both sides here a roman smashed an arab in the side of the face with his sword making the wretch reel in the saddle and then dispatching him with a blow to the neck that sent his soul to eternal torment and half severed his head from his body there another roman already bleeding from a dozen wound s grappled with an arab and dragged him from his horse so they both fell together i also saw then what i remembered seeing when the followers of the false prophet besieged constantinople in my youth and what the history of their wars against the roman empire had shown that they despite their misbelief had courage aplenty when they rode close to the sklavenoi to ply them with arrows one of them had his horse take a javelin square in the throat the animal crashed down as if it had run headlong into a wall allowing its rider barely enough time to kick his leg free so it was not pinned beneath the horse that rider could have fled away back toward his own line instead scrambling to his feet he drew his sword and ran straight for the sklavenoi he killed or wounded several of them before they dragged him to the ground once more and slew him neither side giving way then and neither side being able to gain any great advantage the fight went on from the time when it was joined till sunset without a substantial advance or retreat if anything we romans had the better of the day and when evening came it was the deniers of christ who withdrew from combat but they made no great retreat only pulling back out of bowshot and leaving enough skirmishers out ahead to show that they intended to renew the fight when morning came again leontios also proved willing to halt for the night which considering how evenly the battle had gone on the first day i could hardly protest roman forces made three rough camps those of the cavalry from the military districts to either side and that of the special army in the center corresponding in that way to the disposition of the soldiers during the battle i summoned leontios neboulos and other lowerranking officers to my pavilion to see if we could think of a way to do better than we had done i was hoping these men trained in war would be able to see what i did not in that i found myself disappointed well keep hammering at them emperor keep hammering away leontios said hit em enough blows and i expect theyll crack how can they keep from cracking if we keep hitting em this is how you won your name as a general i exclaimed leontios assumed an injured expression i felt like injuring him but wondered if he had the brains to notice i turned to neboulos thinking he might have imagination mixed in with his barbarous cunning how would you make the fight turn our way tomorrow but all he did was shrug you pay us emperor and we do not let arabs through you tell us what to do we do it well fight it out then i looked at leontios since he showed no sign of having any better idea than that i said it seems we cant enfold them with both wings at once so why not put more weight on one wing and see if we can use it to break through their line aye i could do that emperor he said i could plainly he had had no thought past fighting tomorrows fight as he had fought todays he plucked at his beard now which wing should i choose do you suppose the left i said for no better reason that that i might have been more likely to say the right all right emperor ill do that and off he went someone had told him what to do and he was fit to do it i suppose my father had done that during his reign too i wondered how leontios had won victories on his own not long after my father died maybe he had run across arab generals as hamhanded as himself we had one why not they neboulos saw the same thing i had that is roman general he said if he fights me i beat him to you emperor i lose i always remember that he rose nodded and also departed the lesser officers quickly went out into the night leaving me alone not many battles last two days which is as well for all through the night men who knew they were to continue fighting on the morrow had to listen to the cries and groans and screams of the wounded knowing such could as easily as not be their fate when the sun rose once more some of the injured men had been taken from the field for the physicians to treat but some romans and arabs both still lay between the two armies then their mournful voices were joined by cries of alarm from the roman pickets i heard romans calling to one another in excitement and alarm as they dashed over to the right and from that direction the sound of fighting after perhaps half an hour the racket eased leontios reported to me what had happened emperor the sneaky bastards tried a night attack to see if we were awake but we turned em back we drove em away good i told him i hope they paid plenty for their folly i expect they did his head went up and down up and down there werent that many of them pickets coming over were almost enough on their own soon as soldiers from camp joined em the arabs knew they couldnt do anything to us but they had i remember watching a conjurer at the palace once years ago the man was full of empty distracting chatter he would wave one hand about to keep his audience from noticing what the other was doing and then with that other hand the one we had not been watching he would pluck silk scarves out of thin air nomismata from our ears once even a kitten from a persian skullcap he was so good i had his fee doubled but set alongside abimelekhs brother mouamet he was as a child both armies were astir before sunrise each fearing the other would contrive to steal the battle by striking first men breakfasted as they had supped on whatever bits of bread and cheese and onions and salt pork they had with them then their officers shouting at them to hurry they rolled up the blankets in which they had slept if indeed they had slept anywhere but on the bare ground the cavalrymen mounted their horses and horse and foot alike formed line of battle looking over toward the left wing i could not see that leontios had materially strengthened it perhaps he had done so in such a stealthy way both i and the followers of the false prophet were deceived if so well and good if not i sent one of the excubitores trotting off to him to inquire the guardsman came back a few minutes later emperor he says he didnt because of the night attack the arabs made on our right he says that if they had made a larger attack there later on they might have broken through if hed thinned things out too much he looked nervous as any man might who was bringing the emperor of the romans news he would not care to hear i gave him an order i growled he said he would obey it yes emperor the excubitors nods were quick placating he says he knows that and hes sorry and hell take the blame if things go wrong he certainly will i said but leontios was or was supposed to be a general if he put his own judgment on the scales against mine i had to believe or so i told myself he had a good reason i waved for the excubitor to leave my presence leave he did as if glad to escape allahu akbar allahu akbar allahu akbar the arabs war cry rang out pounding rhythmic waves of sound lifting their spirits and casting down those of the men who would oppose them the romans and sklavenoi shouted back as loudly as the followers of the false prophet but more as individuals than as drops of water in a wave that second day their lying cry of god is great outdid our shouts i fear as before fighting spread all along the line i had hoped that by concentrating our forces on one wing we could break them since leontios in what he judged his superior wisdom had chosen not to do that my hopes had to shift either we might beat them in straighton fighting or demonstrating that we ourselves were steadfast and could not be made to retreat we might force the arabs rather than facing further combat to retreat from roman territory prince mouamet i assumed had plans that might be described as the mirror image of my own with his chief aim to break through the roman line by hard fighting that he thought like a serpent had never occurred to me for more than an hour roman horsemen and their arab counterparts shot arrows at one another and sometimes came close enough to one another to hurl javelins or to slash with swords the followers of the false prophet did not assail the sklavenoi in nebouloss special army so strongly as they had the day before that pleased me beyond measure turning to myakes i said the sklavenoi have taught them respect it looks that way he replied and then scratched his head i wonder why emperor the barbarians your barbarians i mean not the arabs didnt fight all that well yesterday they fought like lions i said indignantly myakes shrugged i allowed him more liberties than most men but even he fought shy of coming out and contradicting me i pointed ahead to the fighting if the arabs dont think so why arent they pressing them harder today that i cant tell you emperor then keep your illfounded opinions to yourself i snapped and myakes bowed his head in submission i sent a messenger up to neboulos ordering him to advance on the enemy if they hung back from attacking the special army the messenger returned with nebouloss promise of obedience but the sklavenoi did not advance i sent another messenger he returned with more promises but the special army remained where it had lined up i cursed here i had a perfectly good army but none of its generals felt like doing anything with it then in the very center of the line an arab trumpeter rode out ahead of the army mouamet commanded raising a horn to his lips he blew three loud discordant notes the sklavenoi not all of them but far and away the greater number of them at least two men out of every three left off what they were doing and stood very still and very straight neboulos shouted something to the special army in their own barbarous dialect thanks to the sudden stillness on the part of the sklavenoi i recognized his voice without possibility of confusion never having bothered to acquaint myself with the ugly tongue the sklavenoi speak i did not understand what neboulos had shouted to his men yet i did not long remain in doubt as to its meaning as if with one accord those men who had stood straight and still abandoned the line of battle they had been holding and trotted across the dry dusty plain toward the followers of the false prophet hope dies hard deceiving myself as long as i could or even a moment longer i said to myakes see they are attacking the arabs after all mournfully he shook his head even then he did not offer direct contradiction he pointed ahead of us the action there disproving my words more effectively than any countering words of his could have done for the sklavenoi although trotting toward the arabs were not attacking them nor did the deniers of christ offer any injury to neboulos or the special army instead they welcomed them as comrades as brothers and the sklavenoi reached up and clasped in friendship the bloodstained hands of the mounted arab warriors later i learned that the night before the prince mouamet alarmed at roman steadfastness sent a man to neboulos with a purse loaded with goldpieces promising him also land for himself and the sklavenoi in syria and women of their choosing not content with the honors i had given him not gratefully remembering i had let him live when i could and should have given him a slow painful death neboulos accepting the gold turned traitor to the roman empire the flank attack that had paralyzed leontios was i suppose intended to draw roman attention to the right and away from the center and achieved its purpose all too well at the time i knew none of this although as i say i could hardly avoid noticing the brute fact of the special armys defection i could also hardly avoid noticing that the sklavenoi having switched sides the center of our line was a line no longer only a gaping hole the arabs could not avoid noticing as much either i drew my sword and shouted to the excubitores forward well fill the gap forward we went i on my horse and the excubitores afoot all around me we linked up with the leftmost end of the right wing of the cavalry from the military districts the sklavenoi who had deserted to the deniers of christ having come mostly from the rightward section of their battle line but an emperor of the romans and a regiment of the imperial guard could not hope to cover the ground some twenty thousand men had formerly filled the remnant of the treacherous tribe still remaining in roman ranks stretched themselves out toward us trying to sew shut the tear in the fabric of our military cloak had we had time to make these movements we might have managed them and saved the battle but the prince mouamet having suborned neboulos and the sklavenoi anticipated the effect of their defection and struck hard into the gap that defection had created his horsemen still screaming allahu akbar as if possessed by demons stormed at what had been the center of our line and broke through splitting the roman army in half i had practiced with the sword any emperor with a grain of sense will do as much in case an assassin should get past his guards or in case those guards should turn against him as happened to my unfortunate grandfather in the bathhouse on the island of sicily but i never thought to have to engage in swordplay in such desperate circumstances the arabs recognizing my regalia made for me in large numbers being mounted they overbore many of the excubitores who tried to stand in their way and had i not fought i would surely have been slain or perhaps worse captured a humiliation that had not befallen a roman emperor since the days of the luckless valerian who ruled two generations before the time of constantine the great die one of the followers of the false prophet screamed at me in greek so i could understand and fear he cut at my head when i turned his stroke sparks flew from our blades then i cut at him his swarthy bearded face took on an expression of absurd surprise as if it had never occurred to him that i might do such an untoward thing barely in time he parried christ with me i shouted and spurred toward him my horse was bigger than his the two of them colliding his had the worse of it throwing him off balance i slashed again my sword bit blood sprayed from his wound at the joining of his shoulder he yowled as a cat will if its tail is stepped on and clutched at the injury i smote him again this time across the face features a gory mask he pitched headlong from the saddle justinian cried the excubitores who were near me though not near enough to have kept that wretch from assailing me he was the first man i ever killed with my own hands seeing him fall knowing i had overcome him hearing the guardsmen acclaim me made warm satisfaction surge through me almost as if i had just had a woman another arab came trotting toward me this time not waiting for his onslaught i set spurs to my own horse and myself attacked that startled him he must have reckoned me as sly and cowardly as his own leaders he soon learned his error after a sharp hard fight i beat down his guard and wounded him first in the arm then in the side and then in the neck blood streaming from him and staining his white robes he turned his horse fleeing for his life by then the excubitores had rallied once more forming a solid circle around me cavalrymen from the military districts also helped drive the followers of the false prophet away from my person for a brief heady moment i thought we might yet win the battle but that was not to be the arabs having split us in two each half of the army defended itself as best it could both halves i daresay would have gone down to destruction had the deniers of christ exerted themselves against us instead of doing so though a great many of them poured through the gap in our line not to attack us but to plunder our camp which lay less than a mile behind the battlefield their officers must have screamed and cursed and invoked their false prophet scores of times trying to hold the men to their principal task but in vain seeing that i tried once more to rally the romans shouting strike a hard blow men dont let them steal not only the victory but also your goods no one rode forward against the arabs myakes stood close by me though i did not recognize him till he spoke a blow having smashed his helmet down over one ear and driven the brim against his forehead so that blood poured down his face he said its no use emperor if we manage to save ourselves we ought to get down on our knees and thank god for that much a plague take everything else we can always get more stuff he was unfortunately correct i realized i have never been one to go any way but forward but his words forced me to recognize the difference between going forward with some hope no matter how small of success and throwing my life away as surely as if i were slitting my own throat and damning myself as a suicide well fall back i said the words bitter as aloes in my mouth and fall back we did still resisting attack from the front and using some soldiers not engaged there to form a line defending against attacks from our left flank these thanks to the mercy of god were less severe than they might have been the arabs being more interested in plunder than in further fighting once our defeat was manifest assaults against me also eased as more roman soldiers placed themselves between me and the foe saving our camp saving our belongings i saw at a glance was hopeless well make for sebastopolis i shouted to the excubitores and the horsemen from the military districts once we get behind the walls of the town we can defend ourselves from the deniers of christ if they go blithely plundering the countryside well sally forth and teach them the lesson they should have had on this field beaten though i was i looked toward eventual triumph that trait availed me little here but would serve me well in days to come my greatest fear was that this half of the army would simply dissolve around me the men fleeing this way and that leaving themselves easy meat for the arabs they must have perceived the danger there though and realized their best hope for bodily salvation lay in sticking together very few deserted our mass the fate of those who did they being quickly snapped up by the enemy helped persuade the rest not to bolt after we had retreated past our camp swinging wide to the south to traverse it at a safe distance the pressure against us eased let the cursed arabs have my bedroll and my cot and my tent myakes said they dont have me one of these days ill get those things back again or others even better more than a thousand years before the poet arkhilokhos had sung the same song having thrown away his shield to escape the barbarous thracians in the words of the historian menander protector who recorded the deeds of the first justinian and his successors the changing circuit revealed such things before our time and will reveal them again and the revelations shall not cease so long as there be men and battles the sun had nearly set by the time we approached sebastopolis as we drew near its protecting walls and towers the men cried out in dismay for they saw as did i another army moving rapidly toward the city from the north east i sent out scouts to hold off the enemy while the rest of us gained safety these men soon came riding back not in headlong retreat but shouting for joy the other army did not belong to the followers of the false prophet but was in fact our own left wing also falling back on sebastopolis commanding them was leontios i had rather hoped considering his sorry performance in the battle itself that the arabs had made away with him god however was not so kind and not only had leontios brought that half of the cavalry from the military districts out of the fight but also the several thousand sklavenoi who had neither fallen to the arabs nor gone over to them that struck me as wasted effort their fellow tribesmen having proved themselves traitors how likely was i ever to trust these barbarians again with weapons in hand still for the moment the sklavenoi were a more welcome sight than arabs would have been in the failing light it took us some small effort to persuade the garrison within sebastopolis we were in fact romans and not deniers of christ attempting a ruse i finally had to approach the walls and shout up a warning about what would happen to those garrison soldiers if they did not open the gates and admit us forthwith enough of them had heard and seen me to be convinced which was as well for i meant every word of my threats the gates opened the army on which i had pinned such hopes passed within beaten but for the moment secure myakes till then brother elpidios i hadnt known whether justinian had courage hed never needed to show any if you know what i mean he had spirit he had temper he had temper and to spare but you cant tell what a man will do when somebody tries to kill him till you see it happen he turned out to do just fine thank you the biggest problem was keeping him away from the arabs he wanted to kill every last one of them himself the sklavenoi brother he spent a lot of the retreat to sebastopolis cursing neboulos and every one of the barbarians ranting and fuming about what he should have done to them when we were fighting back in the sklavinias he wasnt joking either like he said there when he said something like that he meant it that worried me then he got quiet that worried me even worse justinian inside the citadel i stared at leontios wishing i could turn him to stone as the monster medusa had with her victims in pagan myth you disobeyed me i told him in a deadly voice emperor i did what i thought best seeing how things were he answered in fact against him medusa might have glared in vain his head already having been formed from solid marble he went on ive been fighting battles for your father and you longer than youve been alive i know something about them that i do you disobeyed me this time i shouted it you disobeyed me and we lost the battle on account of it the blame is yours yours looking back on it the last word was probably a scream but screaming at leontios was like screaming at a post all he did was bow his head slightly as a traveler in wet weather will do to keep the rain out of his eyes emperor i didnt do a thing to lose the battle he said not one thing if the special army hadnt betrayed us we might have won if your special army hadnt betrayed us was what he meant but not even leontios was blockhead enough to say such a thing to me snarling i answered if wed had a decent attack from the left not the paltry one we got we would have smashed the arabs before the cursed sklavenoi went over to them they would have stayed loyal if wed been winning leontios bowed his head a little farther maybe so emperor he said it could be so i suppose he could not have said liar any louder had he bellowed it at the top of his lungs i sprang to my feet had i still been wearing my sword i would have cut him down where he sat how much grief and torment that would have saved me in years to come but god does not reveal to mere men what lies ahead and in any case i had taken off the sword on coming into sebastopolis and so rather than striking that large hard head from his shoulders i hit him in the face with my fist as hard as i could he too leaped with a roar of pain blood dribbled from the corner of his mouth i hit him again this time expecting the blow he bent his head down so that my fist slammed into his skull pain shot up my arm he was hardheaded indeed i hit him again and again he did not strike back had he done so even once i would have given him over to whatever halfskilled torturers a provincial town like sebastopolis boasted all he did was keep his head down and bring up his arms to protect his face to some degree at last having done to him what thanks in great measure to his wanton disobedience i had not done to the followers of the false prophet i told him get out and be grateful for my mercy he stumbled away leaving a trail of blood drops on the timbers of the secondstory floor i was certain i had blackened one of his eyes maybe come tomorrow he would explain his bruises by saying he had walked into a door as beaten wives i am told often do had he been truly considerate he would have leaped off the city wall and broken his neck but that i supposed accurately was too much to hope for i stood there in my chamber breathing hard beating leontios had left me excited in another way going to the door i spoke in a low voice to one of the excubitores standing guard outside it he nodded and after consulting for a moment with his comrade hurried away after about a quarter of an hour he returned with a woman as i had asked him to do i barred the door smiling the woman began to pull off over her head the long tunic she wore no i said harshly she paused her face puzzled i shoved her down onto the bed ignoring her squawk of surprise and took her as if by force pretending she was my captive though she was there of her own free will i took her several times through the night using her almost as roughly as i had leontios when morning came i rewarded her well as her complaisance deserved and i vowed i would reward leontios as he deserved too although they had suborned neboulos and the large majority of the sklavenoi although they had defeated the army i had assembled against them the arabs did not try to bypass the fortress of sebastopolis and penetrate deeper into romania nor did they linger long around the town the force we still had was too large to let them split up into raiding parties which it might have defeated in detail on sallying forth and large enough to remain a threat to their entire army after burning some fields and pasturelands nearby they withdrew had i worn prince mouamets shoes i would have been bolder but then i had seen leontioss quality only too well while the arab might have remained ignorant of the depths of his fecklessness at any rate scouts having confirmed that the deniers of christ were indeed withdrawing i counted myself and the roman empire lucky in that they were not gaining so great an advantage from their victory as they might have done a couple of days after their withdrawal was confirmed the roman army also left sebastopolis instead of triumphantly advancing into the lands the arabs had stolen from my ancestors we were trudging back toward constantinople in defeat that was hard to bear all the more so in light of the high expectations with which i had invested the campaign the men from the armeniac military district soon detached themselves from the army returning to the farms they tended when their services as soldiers were not required the men from the anatolic military district and that of the opsikion continued westward with the excubitores so did the sklavenoi a remnant less than a third the number neboulos had brought to sebastopolis on our reaching ankyra the horsemen from the military district of the opsikion prepared to take the southbound road going back to their farms and villages i put a stop to that ordering them to accompany the rest of the army as we proceeded west toward the sea of marmara some of the men from the anatolic military district also wanted to break away from the army at ankyra we were already close to their homes again i did not let this happen a few days later we reached dorylaion another goodsized town or rather strong fortress in the anatolic military district another good road leads south from it into the military district of the opsikion once more the men from that military district tried to leave the army i met with some of their officers saying i have one more task these men can perform for me i do not think they will find it a disagreeable task even if it does take them farther from their farms than they might have expected if you tell us what it is emperor one of those officers said well be able to let them know and then we wont have the grumbling thats been going through the ranks his colleagues nodded but i shook my head keep them together and tell them just what ive told you no more no less the mystery will bring them along i think i smiled something i had done little since losing the battle east of sebastopolis the officers obeyed me not least because their curiosity was also piqued i had the same sort of conversation with the officers from the anatolic military district they too got the bulk of their men to remain in the ranks though a few their home villages being so close to our line of march did succeed in slipping away and resuming the farmers way of life in which they passed the time between campaigns i was less concerned at that than i might have been under other circumstances for we were moving along easily de ep within the bounds of romania and i did not expect the onset of any foe indeed all the men we had left except the excubitores had stowed spears and javelins and bows and arrows all the weapons save those they wore on their belts in the supply wagons that rattled along with the cavalry from the military districts we had passed malagina on the way up to nikaia when myakes said emperor i know you have something on your mind but i dont know what if i ask you straight out will you tell me no i said he gave me a reproachful look having sometimes succeeded with such looks since my boyhood i looked back at him making my own features insofar as i could reveal nothing he looked more reproachful yet which i took to mean i had succeeded smiling i said again no youre a cruel man emperor he said still i held my face steady sighing he withdrew from my presence as we traveled the road from nikaia up toward nikomedeia we began passing through country wherein the sklavenoi had been resettled in large numbers news of what had passed at sebastopolis having preceded us to that part of bithynia our line of march found many sklavinian women often with brats at their side or squalling in their arms come to learn whether their men had turned traitor had fallen in the fighting or had returned against the odds sometimes we would see and hear happy meetings and cries of delight sometimes wails of grief when a woman learned her barbarous husband was not coming home only a handful of sklavinian women felt obliged to slay themselves from grief on learning that their men had perished most who discovered their men missing from the shrunken ranks of the special army assumed those men had run off with the followers of the false prophet to syria and so did not deem themselves required to commit suicide to join them in death some indeed wasted no time in taking up with other barbarians because of these women the journey from nikaia up toward nikomedeia which should have taken at most two days needed more than twice that long the army and especially the sklavinian portion of it took on more of the aspect of a migration than a military force i was reminded of the bands of mardaites men women and children traveling the military road across anatolia toward their new homes on the frontier against the bulgars this this carnival is disgraceful leontios complained pointing to the disorder and to the unmilitary persons among the sklavenoi i fixed him with my coldest stare when i desire your opinion be sure i shall request it until such time as i do be so good as to keep it to yourself but emperor i he began i squeezed my horse with my knees urging it up into a trot so i did not have to find out what vacuous opinion he was about to put forward not even he was so foolish as to try to keep up with me which given the depth of leontioss folly says how obvious my move to avoid him must have been on our reaching eribolos which lies on the gulf of nikomedeia a few miles south of the town of that name i ordered the entire army sklavenoi and cavalry from the military districts alike to march west along the coast road by the southern shore of the gulf toward prainetos reproducing on the way the journey i had made a few years before to see nebouloss special army as it was being assembled and drilled the remaining sklavenoi were glad the route taking many of them close to the farms and villages they had established since being resettled in romania from the cavalry from the military districts i heard nothing but grumbling they had thought that in compensation for being prevented from returning to their homes they would be allowed to go into constantinople and now saw themselves diverted from the city as well some of their officers were sufficiently aggrieved at being turned aside from the imperial city to come to me to complain of it for such presumption i would at most times have given them my heartiest imitation of the wrath of god that afternoon though i said only i still have one task remaining for your horsemen one of the officers quicker than the rest asked for the cavalry alone what about the sklavenoi oh the sklavenoi will also be involved never fear i told him he and several other men tried to question me further but i looked enigmatic and said nothing that evening we halted at leukate where white chalky cliffs tumble down steep and sheer to the gulf of nikomedeia far below us small waves slapped the base of the cliffs a gentle murmurous sound at my order the sklavenoi camped nearest the cliffs i broke the horsemen from the military districts into several blocks posting them in a sort of cup around the remnant of the special army and the drabs and nasty little children accompanying the barbarians myakes came up to me as i was talking to messengers i was about to send to each encampment of the cavalry from the military districts being a longtime companion of mine he exercised the privilege such men have saying emperor ive been looking at the dispositions youve made here looks to me like youre going to my own disposition was none too quiet i held up my hand he unlike leontios knew better than to go on after a clear signal to halt what i am going to do myakes i told him is have my revenge i turned back to the messengers tell the men without being in any way ostentatious to arm themselves from the supply wagons and then to await my signal aye emperor they said as one and hurried away emperor have mercy on them myakes said suddenly and urgently he had indeed divined my intentions these are the ones who stayed loyal they are sklavenoi i broke in are barbarians are likely to turn against us in any future campaign are as the holy scriptures say broken reeds that will pierce the hands of those who lean on them are never going to have another chance to betray us romans do you understand me yes emperor he said and looked down at the ground once more years later he would ask me to have mercy on my enemies i told him no then too i was right both times having waited until i judged the messengers had reached the encampments of the cavalrymen from the military districts and those men were arming themselves i summoned more messengers and gave them the next order to take to the soldiers it was the last order i would give them for the night at the signal rush upon the treacherous sklavenoi and slay them all slay them without mercy but for them and for leontios i thought but i knew what i was going to do with leontios toowe would have beaten the accursed arabs now we shall take vengeance upon them as the first group of messengers had a little while before these men answered aye emperor but in their voices i heard the same fierce eagerness that filled my own feeling vindicated i looked round for myakes he had gone because he had served me so long and loyally i forgave him his lack of enthusiasm this once i turned my attention back to the messengers the signal shall be two long blasts from the horn here i told them aye emperor they said again and at my nod of dismissal dashed off with gleaming eyes to pass on my commands again i waited anticipation made my heart pound ever faster so that i had trouble judging the passage of time at last i was certain the messengers must surely have reached even the most distant encampments i nodded again this time to the trumpeter he raised his horn to his lips and blew the two notes of the signal standing next to him i was almost deafened i had wondered if all the men from the military districts would hear the call my doubts now vanished along with some small part of my hearing yet the brief silence that followed was not altogether a product of that stunning calls effect on my ears the sklavenoi who had been raucously celebrating their return to the land in which i had resettled them paused in their no doubt drunken debauch wondering what the two blasts meant they were not left in doubt for long the noise rising up into the heavens was not like that which i had heard during the battle near sebastopolis nor even like that following my soldiers breaking into the sklavinian village from which neboulos had ruled as kinglet upon our breaking into that village after penetrating the circle of carts and wagons the sklavenoi had thrown up around it the barbarians warriors women even children could have been in no doubt as to our intention and comported themselves accordingly herea here as i had intended our onslaught took them altogether by surprise their first cries then were friendly even welcoming they believed the men from the military districts rushing upon them sword in hand had come to join in their revels only when they began falling to the roman soldiers did they realize the trap in which they had been placed and realize also they had no escape how their screams and wails rose to the heavens then and how unavailing those screams and wails were even a welldisciplined force of fully armed soldiers assailed without warning from three sides at once with cliffs on the fourth would have suffered catastrophic losses the sklavenoi as they had proved again and again were anything but well disciplined they were not fully armed nor could they fully arm themselves all their weapons past knives and a few swords being stored in the wagons the men from the military districts controlled and they were not or many of them were not soldiers but the sluts and brats who attached themselves to soldiers everything proceeded exactly as i had hoped it might it was not simply victory it was not simply slaughter it was massacre listening to the sklavenoi d ying under the swords and javelins of the roman soldiers who set upon them listening to the screams of those who leaped off the precipices of leukate to avoid the romans avenging weapons and to those of the sklavenoi whom the soldiers herded over those precipices that being an easier and safer way to dispose of them than any other was as exciting as gratifying as the chastisement i had given leontios in partial requital for his failure at sebastopolis i was certain some of the cavalrymen form the military districts were saving some sklavinian women to enjoy before killing them or perhaps even to keep being filled with bloodlust and simple fleshly lust myself i envied them their acquisitions however much i lusted though i despatched no messenger with an order to put aside one of the yellowhaired women for me one experience with a sklavinian wench brought to me at swords point sufficed for a lifetime i stood in the darkness in front of my tent blood thundering in my ears listening to those who had betrayed me betrayed romania dying as they deserved by midnight it was over with a squadron of excubitores bearing torches i walked through the sklavinian encampment death and the stench of death were everywhere here and there my guardsmen and i had to walk on twisted bodies no open ground showing beneath or around them for all that though there were fewer corpses than i had expected did our soldiers let some of the barbarians escape i growled not concerned over a few women but rather over any large number of men if they did they shall be punished then the excubitores led me to the white chalky cliffs some of them leaned over arms extended thrusting out their torches as far as they could i leaned over myself and peered down the light the torches cast on the scene at the base of the precipices was meager but enough corpses were drifted there like snow after a winter blizzard i still heard an occasional moan not all the sklavenoi forced over the edge having died at once in the morning i would send some soldiers down there to finish their work completely for the time being what i had accomplished would do and i saw every thing that i had made and behold it was very good myakes how did justinian dare to take the holy scriptures words about god and use them to speak of himself brother elpidios yes i think its an outrage too if you want to think god punished him for that sin how can i argue with you considering the way he ended up but he was emperor of the romans remember gods deputy on earth and any man who takes pen in hand uses the words of the bible to help give his own thoughts shape i think thats what he was doing nothing worse i dont think he had blasphemy on his mind something worse oh the massacre i did try to stop it you heard what justinian had to say about that the sklavenoi who came back hadnt done anything wrong they proved as much by coming back but justinian wouldnt listen to me there were times too many times when justinian wouldnt listen to anyone but justinian god was listening well i hope so im an old sinner now and pretty soon ill see him face to face at least i can hope theres something on the other side of the scales to keep those sins from dragging me down to hell i can hope cant i brother justinian having avenged myself against the sklavenoi i dismissed the anatolic troops and those from the opsikion allowing them to return to their respective military districts as they began their journey eastward many of them thanked me for having allowed them to take part in my vengeance the pleasure was mine i said to which they responded with laughter but what sounded like a witticism was nothing less than simple truth accompanied only by the excubitores and by leontios then i went back to nikomedeia the guardsmen marched as if expecting combat at any moment and so perhaps they were the country through which we were marching still being that upon which i had resettled the sklavenoi but the surviving barbarians instead of attacking us fled far away not wishing to invite further chastisement on themselves from nikomedeia to chalcedon across the bosporos from constantinople the journey along the military road was uneventful ferries waited there to take me the guardsmen and leontios back to the godguarded and imperial city although returning sooner and with less glory than i had hoped upon beginning my campaign i had lost no great stretch of roman territory despite defeat at the battle by sebastopolis i invited leontios to accompany me and one company of the excubitores on the ship that would return us to constantinople thank you emperor thats very kind of you he said im glad youre not upset any more and that youve gotten over being angry at me he went up onto the deck of the ferry with a broad smile of relief stretched across his face the wind blowing from the wrong quarter oarsmen took us across the narrow neck of water separating asia from europe before we had gone more than a couple of bowshots from the quays of chalcedon i pointed to leontios and called out to the excubitores near me seize that man and cast him in chains what leontios bellowed like a bull at the moment when the knife makes it into a steer as the excubitores dragged him down he exclaimed emperor i thought youd forgiven me what do i care what you thought i said while the guardsmen were wrapping heavy iron chains around his wrists and ankles and locking them with heavy iron padlocks i never forgive those who wrong me i punish them as they deserve leontios kept on bellowing quite unpleasantly one of the excubitores asked shall we pick him up and fling him into the drink emperor a few bubbles and itd be all over with all those chains on him hell sink like a rock no i said though i should have said yes drowning the wretch is too quick to suit me i want him to have plenty of time to think about his crimes and his stupidity well take him back to the city well throw him into a prison and then well forget about him emperor your father never would have done such a thing leontios said while the excubitores resenting him no less than the sklavenoi for the defeat near sebastopolis howled laughter to see and hear him discomfited he had tried before to use the memory of my father to get me to do what he wanted rather than what i wanted having failed then he merely proved his own foolishness by making the attempt a second time youre right i told him remembering what had happened to my uncles herakleios and tiberius my father would have cut off your nose and slit your tongue or perhaps put out your eyes before disposing of you for good you may thank me for my mercy the excubitores laughed louder yet leontios said nothing i signaled to one of the guardsmen he seized leontios by the hair and smashed his face against the planking of the deck you may thank me for my mercy i repeated thank you for your mercy leontios choked out through cut and bleeding lips his nose also bled i made up my mind to reward the excubitor for serving me well constantinople neared perhaps more rapidly than i might have liked the simplicity of campaigning appealed to me now the emperor of the romans is gods deputy on earth that which is pleasing to the emperor has the force of law basic tenets of roman law aye but practice and law here as in many instances were not identical for one thing i was coming home to my mother who would pester me to marry again which i did not want to do an error i see now but i failed to see it then and to show friendliness toward my daughter which i wanted even less to do for another i was imperfectly enamored of the mass of administrative detail through which i would have to wade on returning to the imperial city and for a third on campaign i did not suffer the constant scrutiny i had to endure at the palace the closer i got to constantinople the better i understood why my grandfather had abandoned it for the barbarous west true lombards and the arabs were troublesome there but i grew ever more certain that was not the only reason for his going if he was not also seeking escape i should be very surprised but considering the fate that found him in sicilian syracuse he must have learned although too late there was no escape from the dangers dogging the imperial dignity and ia i stayed in constantinople and my fate found me there stephen the persian looked grave standing beside him theodotos looked like a vulture bereft of carrion stephen said emperor the treasury would have greatly benefited had the revenues anticipated from this past summers campaign been realized as things are however as things are were flat theodotos broke in his voice a harsh croak made all the harsher by contrast with stephens smooth almostcontralto very well were flat i said how do we recover from being flat stephen the persian shrugged his jowls flabby like those of so many eunuchs flopped up and down most desirable would have been either the continuation of tribute from the arabs or the acquisition of booty of comparable value absent those factorsa he shrugged again i have done such things as i could to increase revenue for both the public treasury and the privy purse but we still face a significant shortfall you have been diligent i will say that much i replied that was if anything an understatement since returning to the imperial city i had found myself bombarded with petitions and complaints about stephens methods of collecting that which was owed to the state up until that time i had not imagined the greek language contained so many syn onyms for extortion most of these petitions i rejected out of hand what man ever pays his taxes with a glad heart even where there was some doubt in the matter i supported my sakellarios for when the needs of the subject and those of the fisc collide those of the subject needs must give way if the fisc fails the roman empire fails and if the roman empire fails the subject goes down in ruin i recall no cases where there was not at least some doubt enough to decide in favor of gaining the needed revenue even so it was not enough theodotos said emperor i know how we can bring in more gold if youll but say the word i leaned forward tell me this is what i want to hear with a nod to stephen the persian theodotos said your sakellarios hes a clever fellow with the numbers but hes too kindhearted by half i looked at the exmonk with new respect a great many men had accused stephen of a great many things but excessive generosity had not till now been one of them theodotos went on oh hes willing enough to squeeze the artisans and the merchants and such but hes hardly touched the nobles and magnates here in the city what have you to say about that i asked stephen there is some truth to it the eunuch replied squeezing artisans and merchants makes them grumble but nothing more squeeze the nobles and magnates of constantinople too hard and they begin to plot against you let them plot theodotos made a quick chopping gesture with his right hand then they end up short their eyes or their noses or their tongues or their heads and the property of proved traitors is forfeit to the fisc both finance ministers looked my way they could propose but i had to decide i nodded to theodotos let it be as you say i told him the nobles and magnates will not plot against me if it werent for my family there would be no roman empire for them to inhabit we would have fallen to the persians or to the followers of the false prophet many years ago or if i am mistaken and some of those dogs prove base enough to turn toward treachery despite that trutha if that be so we shall use them as you suggest theodotos he and stephen the persian both bowed their heads i having made the decision they went forth and put it into effect they were good at what they did i would not have set them in their places had they been anything but good at what they did from that day forth money came into the fisc in quantities adequate to make up for the tribute the deniers of christ were no longer paying but oh how the grandees screeched to have to pay their share to the government that not only kept them safe but kept them rich by the petitions flooding in to me by the complaints from those nobles bold enough to beard me in person anyone would have thought the whole of their wealth was being confiscated not just that part necessary to preserve the whole some of them as stephen had warned me did worse than carp these vicious fools i detected in good time having a fair number of spies of all descriptions scattered about the imperial city some of them i ordered mutilated following theodotoss suggestion others i simply cast into prison along with the insolent guildsmen and with leontios occasionally to show my mercy i would release one or two the rest simply stayed where they were fewer people missed them i am certain than they imagined would be the case they found company in their prison cells too for men being sinful and imperfect creatures not all found themselves able or willing to obey the canons set down by the assembled bishops of the fifthsixth synod those who persisted in lewd practices or in the demonically inspired customs of the pagan past deserved punishment no less than those who sought to conceal their wealth and what they deserved they received if i could make it so constantinople would be a moral city i also had in mind that constantinople should be a safe city safe for me i should say to that end my spies watched not only those still free and able to make mischief but also some of the prominent personages in prison one of these fellows a converted jew named george brought me word of leontios he has two suspicious characters who visit him all the time the spy reported assume anyone who wants to visit leontios is a suspicious character and go on from there i answered to which george who himself looked like a born conspirator nodded emphatic agreement i added who are these people anyway one is a monk a certain paul from the monastery of kallistratos george said and the other a former officer also now a monk called gregory the kappadokian the plain monk i dont much care about i said even leontios is entitled to prayers for the benefit of his soul in fact considering the state of leontioss soul i daresay he needs more prayers than most other people i could name but tell me more about this gregory who was once a soldier he may still remember his old trade right now emperor i dont know any more george looked crafty an expression that by the way the lines on his face fell into familiar patterns he frequently assumed but i can find out he sent me a written memorandum a few days later gregory the kappadokian turned out to have been a kleisouriarch an officer in charge of defending a mountain pass against the arabs and had served under leontios in a couple of his campaigns more reports on him trickled in over the days and weeks that followed he seemed to have been a good if unspectacular soldier before donning the monastic robe and to have no intimate ties to leontios save their common service he had no relatives married to any of leontioss nor did leontios owe him money for that matter he did not owe leontios money either i considered flinging gregory into prison too by choice into the cell next to leontioss so they could talk with each other to their hearts content in the end though i forbore but for his continued friendship with a former commander gregory appeared to be an utterly ordinary fellow and leontios imprisoned as he was could hardly threaten me reasoning so i let gregory stay free and keep on visiting him i would not be so naive today before the campaigning season ended that year the arabs sent several raiding parties into anatolia they did this i gathered every year no truce was in force between them and us these raids though not large penetrated deeper into our territory than the followers of the false prophet usually managed to do i did not take long to find out why sklavenoi from the special army were guiding the arabs through the territory that had once nurtured them receiving that news i rounded on myakes if i had been sorry about slaughtering the sklavenoi i wouldnt be any more infuriatingly he shrugged i dont know about that emperor he said you took vengeance on them and now theyre taking vengeance on you how is one any different from the other how i exclaimed ill tell you how i am emperor of the romans they are a pack of wretched barbarians now do you see all he did was shrug again in his quiet way he could be and often insisted on being a difficult man having been accustomed to his stubbornness from boyhood i tolerated it in a way i would not have from a more recent acquaintance dismissing him i summoned a scribe the man poised reed pen over papyrus to take down my words this order is to go to all roman military commanders in the east i said and the scribe nodded i drew a deep breath before continuing let any sklavinian traitor captured in the company of arab raiders within romania be burned alive as fitting punishment for his treachery let there be no appeal from or reduction to this sentence let the barbarians be filled with fear so that they no longer abet such debased acts of brigandage the chancery having prepared sufficient copies of the order couriers on fast horses sped it to the military district of the armeniacs and to that of the anatolics the two most likely to be concerned with it before the end of the campaigning season i received several most gratifying reports of incinerated sklavenoi i summoned myakes and read to him a particularly fine one isnt that splendid i said reading it i can almost hear the sklavinians shrieks almost smell the meat roasting on his bones this bardanes who would sooner be called philippikos has the makings of a firstrate officer i aim to promote him for the excellent service hes given me if i were you emperor before i promoted him id check to see if he ever really did cook any sklavenoi myakes answered stolidly anybody can tell a good yarn theres people out on the streets of the city who make their living doing nothing else but and im not even talking about lawyers i snorted i think youve been jealous of bardanes since he spotted that sklavinian breathing through a reed youre the emperor you can think whatever you like myakes said me what i think is that story sounds too good to be true and when a story sounds too good to be true it usually is that made me thoughtful i have already remarked on several occasions that the worst curse of being emperor is hearing what people want you to hear not what is true if bardanes philippikos was sending me fancy stories about how many sklavenoi he had given over to the flames so as to make himself look good i needed to know as much and if he had he would be a long time regaining my confidence if ever he did the roman empire has spies among the arabs the followers of the false prophet worse luck also have spies in romania and the emperor of the romans has spies of his own whom he can send forth to examine the deeds not only of foreign foes but also of enemies and potential enemies closer to home i sent out two of these men neither knowing of the other to learn whether bardanes had done as he claimed their separate reports came back to constantinople within days of each other a few weeks later the gist of both being that bardanes philippikos had indeed incinerated a goodly number of captured sklavenoi on receiving the second report i shoved them both under myakes nose asking him what have you to say about these not reading with any great fluency he needed some little while to make sense of the reports when he had finished them he handed them back to me with a single offhand comment all right emperor he didnt get caught this time why myakes i said mockingly i do believe youre jealous to that he made no reply at all but turned and took his leave with far less ceremony than was suitable on departing the presence of the emperor of the romans too late i realized i had wounded him perhaps he truly was jealous perhaps he was but hurt i could have thought him so emperor of the romans though i was and am i have never from that time to this dared to ask him over the next few days with i grant some friendly overtures on my part his demeanor gradually regained the gruff familiarity i tolerated from no one else myakes jealous brother elpidios why on earth would i have been jealous of philippikos because i was a starving peasant when i took up the soldiers life and he had a patrician for a father id known plenty of bluebloods by then its not angels that come out when they sit on the latrine any more than it is with me is that blasphemy brother im sorry i didnt aim to singe your virgin ears i just meant that wasnt the reason because i was justinians friend or as close to a friend as justinian let himself have and bardanes came sniffing round the emperor that now thats closer to the mark i didnt trust him he was too smooth somehow if you know what i mean justinian couldnt see it he never could he paid for it too at the end because bardanes philippikos was a heretic who tried to overthrow the sixth holy ecumenical synod i didnt know that thena and i wouldnt have worried much about it if i did know you didnt hear that last well never mind wasnt important anyhow justinian shortly after learning that the sklavenoi who had defected from the service they owed the roman empire were still tormenting us i had equally unpleasant news from the opposite frontier from indeed the uttermost west pope sergios taking the habitual presumption of the bishops of rome to a new extreme refused to ratify the canons to which the bishops i had assembled for the fifthsixth synod had agreed i admit i was not entirely without warning the pope of rome might behave in such arrogant and senseless fashion several bishops from the west or under papal jurisdiction having predicted his descent into folly but i also admit i had not credited their warning being unable to believe any priest of god could not only ignore but reject canons promulgated by a synod through whose deliberations the holy spirit had surely worked such presumption was all the more distasteful coming from the bishop of rome without the military power of the exarch of ravenna the viceroy of the roman empire for italy the popes miserable city would soon have fallen to the lombards not only are the lombards savage and barbarous even by standards prevailing in the west they also profess the arian heresy when i took counsel with the ecumenical patriarch paul to formulate a joint response to sergioss insolence i spoke in anger we ought to let the lombards have rome and eat it up and the pope with it that would serve him as he deserves the ungrateful wretch paul coughed several times deeply and wrackingly before replying the sickness of the lungs that would claim his life in the following year already had its hooks deep in him when he could speak he said emperor however much such a course might please you now it would cause a great scandal throughout christendom and would do untold harm to the holy church in the west pope sergios is doing great harm to the holy christian church in the west i retorted how dare he refuse to accept these canons after the synod decided they were proper and just paul sighed i regret the popes stance no less than you emperor the bishops in rome being first in honor they often deem themselves first in authority as well you are not the first emperor to discover this he coughed again i know i said my grandfather exiled a pope for his disobedience if i have to do the same i tell you i shall not shrink from it may that not come to pass paul said it would embroil the church in conflicts better left unkindled let us try first to bring the pope to reason very well i said see to it then my father having devoted much of the energy of his reign to restoring unity within the church through the sixth holy ecumenical synod i did not wish to damage his work by causing another schism that was not the purpose for which i had convened the fifthsixth synod the reverse in fact i had intended it to clear up the problems the two previous ecumenical synods had ignored i truly had not believed the pope of rome might reject what the bishops prescribed a few days later paul gave me a draft of the letter he purposed sending to pope sergios it was a small masterpiece of its kind arguing the case so persuasively and brilliantly that i felt certain even the mulish bishop of rome would be made to see the light i wrote i have read and i approve on the draft then returned it to the ecumenical patriarch he let me know when the letter left on a ship bound for italy it was by then quite late in the sailing season i was not sure the letter would reach the pope before spring and did not doubt his reply would not arrive in the imperial city till then i dared hope sergios would ponder his course through the winter months and becoming more moderate with contemplation would announce his acceptance of the canons when good weather once more permitted intercourse between his barbarous ruin of a city and the heartland of the roman empire one can always hope with spring came a resumption of the arabs raids on the eastern frontier of the roman empire as had been true in the previous year some of nebouloss sklavenoi served as guides to the deniers of christ i sent messengers renewing my order to burn those barbarians who fell into our hands again i received from bardanes the son of nikephoros vivid accounts of the sklavenoi he had roasted again they seemed too good to be true so much so that i once more despatched spies to the east to learn whether he was telling me what he had done or what he hoped i wanted to hear again my agents reported back to me that he had in fact given captives from the special army special treatment in recognition of his zeal i promoted him to kleisouriarch spring also brought as foretold a reply from pope sergios that reply nearly prostrated poor paul weak as he already was from his bodily illness when he brought the letter to me he had to be carried to the palace in a litter his face was hardly more than skin and bones and his hand looked skeletal as he passed the popes missive to me the letter was in greek sergios being familiar with that language because his family sprang from somewhere near antioch although he himself paul told me had been born on the island of sicily where my grandfather lost his life since it was in what is now the chief language of the roman empire i had no trouble understanding it having read it i should have preferred it to be in latin or some other even more barbarous tongue so i might have remained ignorant of its import in it sergios lyingly asserted his legates had affixed their signatures to the canons of the fifthsixth council after being deceived as to the meaning of those canons since they had participated in the synod their mendacity and that of the pope were made manifest sergios further claimed that the canons decided upon after deliberation of the participating bishops and signed by all the patriarchs save him alone and by myself went outside the usages of the church and were erroneous innovations he said he would sooner die than consent to them by the mother of god i said to paul nothing would please me better than giving this vain and ignorant bishop exactly what he tells me he wants paul tried to reply and after suffering a coughing fit that ended with bloody spittle at one corner of his mouth succeeded emperor i pray you in the name of the holy church exercise restraint the pope is a fool but he is also heir to peter patriarch of the see of rome the heir to peter patriarch of the see of rome is a fool i answered reversing his words and deserves to pay the penalty for his folly have mercy upon him emperor the ecumenical patriarch begged i tugged at my beard not wanting in the least to have mercy on any man who presumed to defy me but paul plainly was a dying man making this request of me with what was almost the last of his strength perhaps i can put him in fear i said and in so doing warn him of his own fate unless he obeys that would be better paul said eagerly grasping at any straw of conciliation i offered and so on the following day i sent a letter to zachariah the exarch of ravenna ordering him to send soldiers down to rome to seize some of pope sergioss closest followers and to ship them to constantinople for judgment in due course zachariah wrote back to tell me he had obeyed my commands by sending one of his underlings a certai n sergios unrelated to the pope down from ravenna to rome with enough men to lay hold of backers of the bishop of rome unlike pope sergios my sergios obeyed me in every particular as quickly as could be expected he sailed back to constantinople with two of the recalcitrant popes prominent supporters john the bishop of portus a town on the sea near rome and serving it as a harbor and boniface one of the popes advisers what have you to say for your master i demand when they were brought before me their hands chained behind them like those of any other prisoners boniface stood mute john who had more spirit however misguided he was said emperor the apostolic father will never agree to canons he thinks wrong then he will have a hard life i said if i plucked the two of you out of your backwards western land i can pluck him as well and i will if he does not come to his senses it shall be as god wills john answered their fate was as i willed i ordered them cast into prison with those who had tried withholding money from the state and those jailed for violating the canons of the fifthsixth synod since pope sergios was both withholding obedience from the state and violating the canons of the fifthsixth synod i reckoned that fate fitting for his henchmen but like that of pharaoh in bygone days the heart of the bishop of rome remained hardened not long after my sergios conveyed boniface and john to constantinople pope sergios sent me another defiant letter not only rejecting the canons of my synod once more but also demanding the release of those two men paul the ecumenical patriarch wrote sergios of rome another letter warning him of his error and also of my wrath it did no good sergioss presumption continued unabated and indeed grew worse i would have written to zachariah on the instant ordering him to arrest sergios and convey him to constantinople had matters more urgent than the ravings of a backwoods prelate not intervened after defeating us at sebastopolis the followers of the false prophet might well have stolen considerable territory from the military district of the armeniacs this as i have said they did not do contenting themselves with raiding using the skulking sklavenoi to show them where the best booty lay we romans dealt with these raids fairly well and i had hoped the lost battle would prove to have no severe consequences for the roman empire in this as in the treacherous dealings with neboulos on the night after the battle by sebastopolis had been joined i underestimated the depths of the arabs iniquity and so the following summer i received the unwelcome news that sabbatios an armenian prince who had been loyal to us romans since leontioss campaign some years before had given his principality into the hands of the deniers of christ i spent much of the summer trying to repair the damage sabbatioss defection inflicted on the roman empire unlike italy armenia is vitally important to constantinople from its mines we draw much of our iron its sturdy soldiers swell the ranks of roman armies and should a foe control its passes he gains the best routes for invading anatolia furthermore the armenians even if not always of perfect orthodoxy are christians having them come under the yoke of the followers of the false prophet was bitter to me and would surely prove bitter to them sabbatios proving unwilling to pay the least attention to my own entreaties i prevailed upon paul the ecumenical patriarch to write to him bidding him reconsider his abandonment of allegiance to the roman empire in light of our common faith in this ploy i had considerable hope sabbatios having over a period of years established a name for ostentatious piety but the wretch had or pretended to have taken umbrage at the canons of the fifthsixth council condemning certain armenian usages this despite the approval armenian bishops had given those canons what a satanic hypocrite i burst out when paul sadly gave his letter to me he deserves to come under the rule of the followers of the false prophet only they come close to matching his deceit emperor i shall pray that sabbatios may return to his senses the patriarch replied having spoken he paused to catch his breath which he did with increasing difficulty as his illness advanced then he went on and i shall pray for you thank you i said may god hear your prayers he held up a hand the tips of his fingers were not pink nor even white but faintly blue i shall pray for you emperor for you have stirred up hatred against yourself and against the roman empire how dare you i broke in my temper as usual quick to kindle how dare i he answered i dare because i am a dying man what worse can you do to me than my body is already doing soon god shall demand an accounting of my many sins face to face but i say again you have stirred up hatred against yourself and the roman empire in italy and the west in armenia and even here in the queen of cities where rich and poor alike groan under the unfair taxes your ministers inflict on them is it my fault dissembling evildoers abound in both west and east i said as for the whiners and grumblers here in the city when have you ever heard of any man who thinks the tax collector a benefactor even if without taxes the roman empire would come crashing down in ruin paul said emperor i have told you the truth what you choose to do with it is your affair god has granted each of us free will to use for good or ill you are dismissed i said coldly paul left the palace not returning for some time this estrangement kept me from using him to try to bring pope sergios to his senses assuming sergios had senses to which he could be brought which was by no means obvious the very next day sisinniakes the logothete in charge of petitions plopped down a great stack of them in front of me these emperor he said mournfully are almost all of them from people protesting their tax assessments not just little people either mind you some of them are officials in your own government and some others are rich powerful men who like to hear yes when they ask for something they will hear that i am their emperor and i am to be obeyed i snapped angry at the coincidence of these petitions coming so close on the heels of my argument with the patriarch sisinniakes cleared his throat emperor forgive my saying so but youre the fifth of your house ive seen on the throne people respect the house emperor on account of all the fine things the rulers of your line have done but they dont love you i dont love them either i shot back why should i they do everything they can to cheat the fisc in its hour of need and they dance and worship demons and fornicate without the least thought for their immortal souls if they were better they would be easier to rule bowing his head he said no more he did not have quite the same security in offending me as did paul being neither a churchman nor on the very edge of death but if i took his head i would have been depriving the old fool of only a few years of life it seemed hardly worth the fuss it would cause trying to get some use out of him i said you told me almost all these petitions had to do with taxes what about the rest he looked up to face me smiling a sad smile emperor the rest are from men and women who have gone to prison because they got caught breaking the canons of the fifthsixth synod or else from their families begging to get them out they are sinners and seducers and blasphemers i snarled let them stay there till they rot every last one of them i picked up the pile of petitions and thrust them back into sisinniakes arms as for these take them and burn them i do not know whether or not he burnt them i do know i never saw them again that was what i wanted when spring returned to the world the ecumenical patriarch paul finally had the grace to depart from it the synod of bishops of the see of constantinople having sent me the traditional three names from which i could make my choice of pauls successor i selected a certain kallinikos he having a better reputation for pliability than either of the other two on meeting him i found kallinikoss demeanor and physiognomy to accord with his reputation he was a round little man with no sharp angles on his face or anywhere else about his person by the way he leaned forward as if hanging on my every word he gave the impression of being eager to please me nor in fact was that impression false kallinikos was eager to please me kallinikos was eager to please everyone he had a great many chances and used every one of them he was so eager to please he would have made a better whore than a patriarch but i did not know that at the time i want you to draft a letter to sergios the patriarch of rome i told him bidding him to come to his senses to accept the presence of the holy spirit at the fifthsixth synod and to acknowledge the canons the bishops established at that synod his own legates after all were present there as were other bishops from the patriarchate over which he has jurisdiction remind him of all this in no uncertain terms it shall be just as you say emperor kallinikos promised and it was just as i said a couple of days later he sent me a draft of his letter for my approval the text was if anything even more fiery than i had hoped i told him to send it to stubborn sergios forthwith for the moment i was the man he was trying to please and he was doing a splendid job sergioss reply reached this godguarded and imperial city as quickly as such things can be expected given the distance between rome and constantinople and the difficulties and delays likely to be encountered on the journey on account of its contents though i would have been as glad had it taken longer on the way it being full of the same pretentious obstinacy the bishop of rome had already displayed emperor i stand ready to threaten this manikin of a sergios with even harsher strictures than those of my last letter kallinikos declared strictures up to and including anathema i thank you for that i said and meant it patriarchs of constantinople have been known to care more for accommodating themselves to the bishop of rome than to the emperor of the romans sergios did not seem to understand when two of his henchmen were fetched to constantinople the time for letters has passed kallinikos i aim to fetch the pope here to let him answer for his own transgressions how right you are kallinikos exclaimed also sounding as if he meant it no doubt he did he was however ready to say how right you are to anyone who told him anything of any sort off went the letter in it i told zachariah to do with pope sergios as my grandfather had told the exarchs predecessor at that time to do with pope martin to arrest him and bring him to the imperial city so i could pass judgment on him my grandfather had sent pope martin to kherson to me that seemed a good enough destination for sergios just how good it was i would find out in due course myakes by the time justinian became emperor brother elpidios his family had been ruling the roman empire for more than eighty years like he says people loved the house of herakleios people had reason to love it without the house of herakleios there probably wouldnt be a roman empire any more justinian now by the time hes writing of here hed been emperor about nine years in those nine years hed taken all the goodwill people had for his family and chucked it right into the latrine it might not have happened that way if some of the things hed tried had worked out better if wed beaten the arabs at sebastopolis for instance who but god can say for sure about something like that but what really wrecked things for him was that he went on doing whatever he thought he needed to do right then and never had a clue that people were starting to spit when somebody said his name paul the patriarch and sisinniakes both tried to tell him you read me what they said and you heard for yourself he wouldnt listen remember something else too brother justinian was writing here years after what hes talking about he still doesnt see or doesnt believe what people were telling him back then he knew what happened to him as long as he lived he never figured out why justinian not long after the letter to zachariah started on the long journey to ravenna i was startled to receive a request for an audience from the monk paul who had been identified to me as a warm friend of leontioss not only was i surprised i was intrigued this paul must have known i knew of his attachment to a man who to put it mildly i did not find pleasing under those circumstances asking for an audience with me took a certain amount of what was either courage or hubris trying to learn which i granted the request paul put me in mind of my theodotos he was intensely certain of his purpose also like theodotos he wasted no time in small talk having risen from his prostration he said emperor i have come to ask you to free the brave general leontios why should i i demanded my tone halfway between anger that he should dare to say such a thing and curiosity as to why he said it first and foremost from simply christian charity he answered no man deserves to be caged like a wild beast and leontios less than most i shook my head as a man i might do this i said that left open the possibility i also might not do it which was far more likely i continued as emperor of the romans i cannot by his bungling leontios cost the roman empire far too much to let me casually forgive him but emperor in his earlier campaigns he gained great glory and advantage for the roman empire paul said should you not weigh the one in the pans of the balance against the other when he won victories he was promoted he was rewarded how else did he become a rich man and a general to whom i entrusted a great army i said paul remained silent what could he reply to that leaning forward on the throne i asked him are you telling me a man who is rewarded for his successes should not be punished for his failures no emperor he said had he said anything else i would have had him thrown out of the throne room he had spirit though continuing but does he deserve to be punished so harshly for a misfortune that partly sprang not from any error of his own but from the treachery of the barbarous sklavenoi as he had been nowhere near the field by sebastopolis he must have spent a lot of time listening to leontios in his cell i answered i have punished the sklavenoi or such of them as i have laid hands on as they deserved shall i treat leontios as i treated them no for he was no traitor only a man brought down by the treachery of others paul said arguing like a lawyer that is not so he disobeyed my orders which had he followed them might have brought us victory in spite of the sklavenoi i told the monk he looked down at the floor again not knowing how to respond i daresay leontios doing his utmost to show himself in the best possible light had never bothered to mention that small detail scowling down from the throne at paul i said can you still honestly tell me this wretch deserves his freedom to my surprise he nodded as i said before emperor a tiny stinking cell is no fit home for a man if you cannot find it in your heart to forgive him would you be generous enough to commute his sentence from imprisonment to exile that i must say was clever exile being a common punishment for those who have offended their sovereign after some thought i answered i shall not do that at this time i do not reject it out of hand though should i change my mind or should a proper situation arise i will think on it again you are gracious emperor paul said i did not feel particularly gracious part of the reason i had said what i said was to make him go away without committing myself to anything he added leontios will be glad to hear he has some hope of seeing the light of day once more i started to tell him not to let leontios get his hopes up but then held my tongue for leontios to be in prison was torment as paul rightly said i had intended it to be such but for leontios to be in prison thinking each day might be the one on which he was set free disappointed each night when he lay down on his pallet hope building again the next morning only to be dashed once more was that not torment more exquisite if paul wanted to inflict it on his friend he was as far as i was concerned welcome and more than welcome to do so i am glad to see you smile so emperor paul said it gives me hope you will soon show my friend the light of your mercy does it i said and smiled more broadly i walked through the gardens around the palace with kallinikos it had rained earlier in the day drops of water still glistened here and there on leaves and flowers and all the trees and shrubs and plants glowed with the special green they take on just after a rain my mind however was not altogether on the garden i pointed to an old rundown church dedicated to the mother of god that stood near the palace hardly anyone goes in there these days i remarked a pity the patriarch said trying as usual to guess my mood and to accommodate himself to it this time he guessed wrong what i have in mind i told him is tearing it down and putting up a fountain and some seats there so i can have a convenient place to receive the nobles when the weather is fine you want to tear down the church he said frowning this was not the sort of request he received every day but i nodded you can rebuild it somewhere else in the district of petrion say there arent that many churches near the golden horn now you need not pay for this i added since i am tearing this one down ill pay for the replacement that put a different light on things as i had thought it might now kallinikos almost purred of course emperor it shall be just as you say i could see from the gleam in his eye that the church he would build in petrion would be far grander than the one already crumbling to ruins of its own accord here oh i said as if just thinking of it one thing more i want a public prayer from you as the workmen start to tear down this church i pointed again toward the tumbledown building the ecumenical patriarch frowned again a prayer emperor we have many prayers for the construction of a church but i do not know of any for the demolition of a church he risked a jest i am certain the followers of the false prophet know several i looked down my nose at him being more than a palms breadth the taller of us two i daresay you can devise one i said coldly kallinikoss coughing fit would have done credit to his predecessor although paul being consumptive had the better excuse for suffering such a spasm emperor if you require this prayer of me would i have asked you for it if i did not require it i demanded i am not in the habit of making jokes particularly in matters of piety kallinikos stopped coughing he started shaking that suited me better if as i say you require this prayer of me you shall have it i hoped you would say that i told him smiling in such a way as to make him shake even more we held the ceremony for the demolition of the church a few days later splendid in his patriarchal regalia kallinikos raised his arms to the heavens and intoned glory to the longsuffering god at all times now forever and through eons upon eons amen god certainly must be longsuffering for him to have put up for so long with such a lump of suet on the patriarchal throne having knocked down the church i duly erected the fountain and the reception area around it there on pleasant days i passed time with aristocrats from the old families many of whom affected to regard constantine the great as an upstart we drank wine we ate sweet cakes occasionally when they felt bold they would complain to me of the tax assessments stephen the persian and theodotos levied on them since the occasions were social i pretended to listen what did my forbearance gain me only betrayal myakes are you all right brother elpidios i havent heard you sputter that way since the first time justinian talked about having a woman whats your trouble now oh calling kallinikos a lump of suet brother i saw kallinikos a good many times if you rendered him down for fat youd need a big tun to hold it all the prayer when they knocked down the church no justinian never figured out the patriarch meant god was longsuffering for putting up with him a good thing for kallinikos he didnt too or wed have found out exactly how much fat he had in him justinian would have cooked him over a slow fire yes justinian should have paid more attention to what the nobles were telling him he should have paid more attention to what a lot of people told him he didnt listen to me either youve seen that youll see it again god knows justinian was good at a lot of things listening wasnt any of them justinian zachariah did not bring pope sergios back to the imperial city under arrest as i had charged him to do he went with an army of soldiers from ravenna and some of the cities south of it down to rome intending to arrest sergios and put him on a ship unfortunately however through some mischance word of what the exarch intended to do reached rome ahead of him the people of rome prevailed upon zachariahs army not to let sergios be taken out of the city and carried away to constantinople although zachariah himself was a fine man steadfast both in his loyalty to me and in his purpose here the soldiers under his command being for the most part of the same italian blood as the city mob of rome were persuaded by them and mutinied against the exarch some few of the soldiers remaining loyal to zachariah he used them to seize the pope in his residence but his force was so small and that outside so large and inflamed that he lost hope of accomplishing the command i had given him all at once it was as if the wretched sergios were holding him and his few faithful followers rather than the other way round in his letter to me retailing these events zachariah maintained he yielded to necessity years later i heard he cowered under the popes bed with the mutineers baying for his blood god knows the truth in this matter i do not i do know sergios perhaps fearing my vengeance if the exarch were slain did not let the mob work its full and ugly will upon him instead he was merely expelled from rome after being reviled and beaten had the exarch been murdered by these semibarbarous italians i would unquestionably have sent a fleet from the imperial city to burn rome to the ground and to bring sergios here for trial as a common murderer as things were i by no means abandoned my intention of arresting sergios and placing on the episcopal throne of rome another more tractable man before i could make arrangements to bring that to pass however another concern forced itself upon me i received from thessalonike word that dorotheos whom i had appointed general of my new military district of hellas had without warning lost his life having read so far and no farther in the announcement informing me of this i assumed him to have fallen to some unsubdued sklavenoi but i soon discovered such was not the case rather his horse threw him as he was riding into thessalonike after hunting his head smashed into the ground he lay without speaking or moving for three days before breathing his last military districts need generals at their head this was especially true of one such as hellas with barbarians to the north and to the west leaving a vacancy there would have invited the sklavenoi in the area to make trouble perhaps negating everything my campaign against them had accomplished a few years before as one must do in such circumstances i pondered whom to appoint as dorotheoss successor none of the other officers in thessalonike at that time had particularly impressed me nor for that matter had dorotheos his virtue such as it was lay in avoiding serious error not in accomplishing anything great that meant i would need to choose a general either in constantinople or from one of the anatolian military districts who i wondered would be willing to leave the imperial city or the longcivilized lands of anatolia for a frontier district like hellas and then i had what struck me as a happy inspiration having a pretty good notion of where the monks paul and gregory the kappadokian were to be found i sent messengers thither summoning them to the throne room while waiting for their arrival i sent other messengers to the proklianesian harbor in the southern part of the city the monk and the former kleisouriarch did not reach the palace until late afternoon coming in with the stink of prison still clinging to their clothes ignoring that i waited until they had prostrated themselves before me and arisen before saying you want leontios free not so their eyes widened they glanced at each other though neither of them turned his head cautiously paul said emperor that is so he could scarcely deny it but for all he knew i was about to order their heads taken for persisting in a desire i had no wish to fulfill instead i said take him then and go i held out an order to them this will authorize his release you may tell the guards they shall answer to me if they fail to obey my command now they were both frankly staring gregory took the sheet of papyrus from my hand as if afraid it would burst into flame if he touched it his lips moving he read it to assure himself it was what i had said when he saw it was he blurted what made you change your mind emperor the order said nothing about that concerning itself only with leontioss release from imprisonment i am naming him general of the military district of hellas i answered three dromons wait in the proklianesian harbor to take him and you to thessalonike once you get him from the prison go to the harbor without delay if you are in constantinople when the sun comes up tomorrow you are dead men do you understand we do gregory said with a crispness proclaiming him a former officer we thank you for your mercy emperor paul added go i told the two of them and remember what i have said they hurried out of the throne room i never expected to see them or leontios again what i hoped was that leontios trying to accomplish something great and redeem himself from exile not that i ever expected to allow him to return to the imperial city would make the intimate acquaintance of a sklavinian arrow and die a slow painful lingering death i was pleased at my cleverness in sending him away not only was he likely to perish but i would get some use from him before he did not even stephen the persian could have found a more economical solution so at any rate i told myself but the dawn of each new day does not necessarily bring that which one expected the afternoon before nor that for which one had hoped myakes what would i have said brother elpidios if justinian had asked me whether i thought he should let leontios loose i probably would have told him he had a pretty good idea there leontios mured up in jail made people pity him and try and work for him leontios gone though would have been leontios forgotten after a couple of weeks but justinian made one mistake brother he gave paul and gregory the order releasing leontios that was fine he had the little fleet waiting to take them to thessalonike that was fine too and he told the two monks once they had leontios to take him down to the harbor and put him on one of those dromons and even that was fine but he didnt send any soldiers down to the harbor with them to make sure they put leontios on the dromon and then got on themselves would i have reminded him to do that how can i say after more than thirtyfive years i like to think so but who can be sure of such things any which way i never got the chance the company i led wasnt at the palace that evening we were scattered among several buildings with a squadron from them i was watching over the praitorion on the mese not far west of the grand palace to make sure nobody stole either the papyri or the prisoners stashed there the duty was about as exciting as watching paint dry a dead quiet night if ever there was one to liven it up some of the boys and i were rolling dice yes i know thats a sin yes i know the fifthsixth synod had said so not long before i wasnt planning on living like a monk not in those days i wasnt where was i ah thats right down on one knee in a back room all of a sudden somebody started banging on the front door it was barred of course id just won three throws in a row and i didnt feel like getting up while the dice were hot i pointed to a new excub itor a little skinny fellow named john or maybe theophanes after all these years i forget which anyway i told him go see what the devil that is and make it stop off he went i heard him talking but i couldnt make out what he was saying like i told you we were in a back room a minute later he came running back its the emperor he exclaimed what i said whats the emperor doing here this time of night says hes got some business needs taking care of answered john or theophanes or whatever his name was business i scratched my head the only business justinian usually did in the nighttime had to do with serving girls and he wasnt about to come to the praitorion to take care of that the pounding started up again i stared at john didnt you let him in uh he was new all right mother of god i scrambled to my feet hes going to be angry enough to eat us all without salt john theophanes whoever he was started back toward the door wait i told him ill take care of it he isnt so likely to bite my head off bang bang bang from the racket out there i wondered if justinian had ordered whoever he had with him to break down the doors open up in there in the name of the emperor someone shouted not a voice i knew im coming im coming i shouted back when i got to the doors i slid the bar out of the brackets to either side of them and leaned it against the wall then i pulled the doors wide come in emp i began a couple of dozen men stood out there several of them were holding torches all of them but a couple of blackrobed monks were holding swords at their head was a tall widefaced fellow in a filthy tunic whose tangled beard reached halfway to his waist after a couple of heartbeats standing there gaping i recognized leontios i was too startled to draw my own sword right away that probably saved my life instead of running me through the way they would have if id had a blade in my hand leontios and the gang of bully boys hed scraped together just jumped on me and knocked me down i tried to fight back but they started pounding my head on the floor after that my arms and legs didnt want to do what i told em they trussed me up like a hog they didnt plan on roasting right that minute the racket made the rest of the excubitores come running out to see what was going on one of the monks shouted many years to the emperor leontios treason john or was it theophanes cried he did yank out his sword and rushed at the monk a couple of guardsmen followed him most of them though only stood there they werent about to die for justinian john and his comrades did die and in a hurry too my heart sank and i hadnt thought it could go any lower now what emperor one of leontioss henchmen asked hearing that title used for anybody but justinian made my blood boil i tried to break loose but no luck whoever had tied me up he knew what he was doing leontios didnt answer for himself one of the monks spoke up for him now we open up the prison cells where the tyrant has hidden away so many good soldiers and noblemen for so long with them free well have the beginnings of a decent little army of our own and one that wont be any too fond of justinian they found the keys to the cells on their own and didnt have to ask me where they were i lay there with my hands and feet getting numb and thanked god for that if theyd put the edge of a sword up against my throat i dont think i would have betrayed justinian but who can know something like that for sure and if i didnt well i wouldnt be sitting here talking with you now brother elpidios leontioss men were laughing and joking when they went downstairs to set the prisoners free leontios and the two monks along with some of his ruffians stayed in that front hall he spoke to one of the monks paul i know you always told me the stars said id be emperor one day i never believed it i couldnt believe it i thought id die in jail and never come out alive when justinian let me out i expected id be dying soon in a different way why would he make me general of that godforsaken military district if he didnt figure id get killed there what he thought matters no more the monk paul i guess it was answered dont hesitate now and you will seize power listen to gregory and me follow our advice and everything you want will be yours first i heard the prisoners coming then i smelled them and then i twisted my neck so i could see them they took the weapons away from the bodies of the excubitores whod fought for justinian and then disarmed the ones who hadnt fought for him and sent them away whats that brother so then because thou art lukewarm and neither hot nor cold i will spew thee out of my mouth thank you that fits very well some more men came into the praitorion then with swords and spears and clubs enough to fit out the prisoners who didnt have any the monk who wasnt paul yes gregory thank you again said heres what youll do go to all the districts of the city and spread the word that justinians gone crazy and aims to massacre everybody who lives inside the walls people will believe it people will believe anything about justinian tell everybody to gather at the church of the holy wisdom ill go to the patriarch and tell him the same thing except ill say justinian aims to start with him once weve done all that justinian will fall into our hands like a ripe fig i was lying there doing my best to be invisible it didnt work somebody jerked a thumb at me and asked what about him i tried again to get free of the ropes that didnt work either but leontios said leave him be hes justinians lapdog if we fail my head goes up on the milestone come what may but if we kill him and then fail youll all die not one of you will live hes not going to hurt us lying there all tied up when we win we can figure out what to do with him so there i lay outside on the mese the racket got louder than id ever heard it in the middle of the night people were running back and forth riding back and forth and everybody who was going anywhere was yelling at the top of his lungs most of the yells were just yells but then i heard someone shouting dig up justinians bones i felt the same sort of chill i had when most of my excubitores wouldnt fight for justinian after leontios and his toughs broke into the praitorion you shout dig up soandsos bones and you want the worst thing you can think of to happen to that person whoever he is and the more time went by the more people were screeching dig up justinians bones gregory came back then its not far from the praitorion to the great church he was grinning like hed just tripped over a pound of gold in the street kallinikos is with us he told leontios everyone in the praitorion except me and i didnt count started cheering like a madman gregory waited till people calmed down a little then went on of course kallinikos is going to be with whoever talks to him last we have to make sure none of justinians people not that there are many left gets near him hes putting on his robes now as soon as hes done that hes going to preach in the great church more cheers leontios said i need to be there then lets go he started to leave along with all his followers for a minute there i thought they were going to leave me all alone i got my hopes up maybe i could wiggle loose after all no such luck paul remembered me and said now what do we do with him sling a spear shaft through his arms and legs leontios said well haul him along with us that way he wont get into any trouble or any mischief so thats what they did off i went upside down carried on their shoulders yes like a pig heading for the roasting pit brother i was thinking that very thing at the time the world looks pretty strange upside down you know that you never tried it you say ill tell you i wish i hadnt but while they were lugging me east up the mese toward the church of the holy wisdom i saw a couple of poor bastards in worse shape than i was along came this big bunch of laughing shouting people with screams coming out of the middle of it the people thinned out a little when they recognized leontios so he could see what they were up to that meant i got to see too theyd caught stephen the persian and theodotos whod done so much to get justinian hated and tied their legs together then tied ropes to their feet so they could drag em along the street mercy stephen screamed theodotos screamed even louder mercy in gods name what are you going to do with them leontios asked haul em down to the forum of the bull and burn em alive somebody told him and that set the whole wolfpack baying again by the sound of things everybody liked the idea except stephen and theodotos they kept bleating for mercy me i was upside down i was miserable all the same i wouldnt have minded seeing them burn especially since they were the ones whod landed justinian in so much of his trouble but it wasnt up to me it was up to leontios everybody looked at him he looked at the crowd at all the eyes glittering in the torchlight he looked at theodotos and stephen he grinned if theyd had any hope at all that grin would have killed it aye burn em he shouted why not that made the mob like him and hate justinian both at the same time off went the eunuch and the greedy monk their heads banging the cobblestones their wails faded in the distance so did the cheers of the mob but a lot slower on to the great church paul said leontios nodded like hed forgotten and was glad someone was reminding him the church and the courtyard around it were packed make way leontioss henchmen shouted make way for the new emperor that got people to move aside all right some were still yelling dig up justinians bones more though started shouting many years for the emperor leontios and tu vincas leontios doing things properly you see in the middle of a usurpation i think leontios said i shall rule as leo with your beard and hair so long you certainly have the mane of a mighty lion emperor gregory said currying favor in the middle of a usurpation torches and lamps and candelabra made the inside of the church of the holy wisdom bright as day though morning twilight was just beginning to stain the eastern sky because i was where i was i didnt see kallinikos till one of the ruffians who was carrying me almost trod on his toes the patriarch wasnt up at the ambo where youd expect him he stood down by the baptistery instead seeing leontios he bowed to him hello emperor and god bless you he said yes hed trim his sail to fill with any wind i i dont know what he said after that not for a while because i got dropped on the floor like a sack of garbanzos and i was too busy hurting to pay him any heed for good measure a couple of people kicked me and a couple more stepped on me i dont think knowing i was there till their feet found out id landed on my back i could look up and see leontios and kallinikos kiss each other on the cheek a pair of smiling judases paul came up and said something to the patriarch kallinikoss head went up and down up and down whoever said anything to kallinikos hed nod hed do it if you got to him last he was yours people started yelling the patriarch will speak the patriarch will speak it got quiet kallinikos filled himself up with air like a frog about to croak then he let it out all at once this is the day the lord has made let us give thanks and rejoice after that he couldnt go on for a while not through all the cheering when he did it was with about the drivel youd expect this is the day of change of freedom of hope of justice of he probably could have gone on for hours but somebody outshouted him now its just as rude to interrupt the ecumenical patriarch as it is to interrupt the emperor but kallinikos didnt care not this time and neither did anyone else because what the fellow yelled was we have justinian justinian iwoke to tumult some time in the late hours of the night only the earliest hint of dawn showed in the window beside me the girl i had taken to bed for my pleasure the evening before stirred and mumbled and rolled over the soft tip of her bare breast brushed against the side of my arm i sat up the racket was very loud louder than it should have been anywhere near the palace at that hour my sitting woke the girl what is it she asked i dont know zoe i answered whatever it is the excubitores should set it to rights before long assuming the guardsmen would do just that i leaned over and began to caress her she sighed i hope with pleasure and slid closer to me then someone began pounding on the door to my bedchamber i snarled an oath wondering who dared presume to disturb the emperor of the romans at his sport flee my son my mother cried foes are in the palace zoe cried out in fear her forgotten i sprang to my feet to ward against murderers in the night i always kept a sword by the bed even in near darkness finding it was no more than the work of a moment i flung an undertunic over my nakedness and unbarred the door my mother stared at me in mingled surprise and dismay no son she exclaimed out the window she pointedand make what escape you can zoe came up behind me wearing rather less than i was my mother ignored her sure proof of the depth of her alarm flee she said again you have only moments the palace is betrayed i thrust the sword out ahead of me as if to run through an enemy did my greatgreatgrandfather run from danger i demanded did my grandfather did my father when his brothers tried to overthrow him if they want me they will find me ready to fight where are the excubitores my mother groaned most of them stood aside and let the usurpers men into the palace who is the usurper i demanded wondering upon whom i should have to avenge myself before my mother could answer i heard someone around a bend in the corridor say the emperors bedchamber is that way several men came running their sandals pounding against the mosaic tiles of the floor to this day i wonder which of my servants thus betrayed me to my foes i wonder if he serves me yet if he does i wonder how long i can make him last how much i can make him suffer before dying if ever i learn who he is i had no time to concentrate on the voice though for several low ruffians came dashing round the corner they all had swords there he is one of them cried pointing at me in the torchlight not wanting the fight to endanger my mother or even zoe i rushed toward the traitors intending to cut my way through them and however many had invaded the palace they being many and i one though my success was less than i had wished the first man i attacked fell with a groan clutching at a gash in his side but the second being a better swordsman kept me at play dont kill him one of the other brigands shouted leontios wants him alive thus i learned who craved to steal my throne i want me alive my opponent panted parrying a blow that should have laid his face open but as the ancient pagan saying has it even herakles could not fight two that dog kept me too busy to deal with any of the others as they deserved one of them tackled me and knocked me to the floor unable to slash him as i fell i hit him in the side of the head with the heavy pommel of my sword he groaned and went limp before i could do anything more another man grabbed my arm and wrenched the sword from my hand now weve got him my assailants roared i punched and kicked and butted and bit learning the taste of their blood no one came to my aid despite all i could do they swarmed over me binding me hand and foot after that they spent some little while beating and kicking me whether out of general hatred or because of the fight i had put up i cannot say i bent my head down hoping to keep them from smashing my teeth or breaking my nose looking back that seems funny what do we do with him now that weve got him somebody asked take him to the great church answered the man who had fought me sword to sword thats were leontios is at and thats where the patriarch god bless him is at too i cannot imagine why i was surprised to discover kallinikos had joined those betraying me but i was the ruffians hauled me to my feet a couple of them thrust their arms through between my arms and my ribcage and hustled me along dawn was breaking in the trees and bushes around the great palace birds began to sing i remember that quite clearly again i cannot say why god who knows everything will know that as well men came up to me and reviled me like any other dogs they snapped at what they thought weaker than themselves i cursed them as foully as i knew how foully enough to make some of them gesture to avert the evil eye i hope the curses i sent their way bit anyhow as we drew near the church of the holy wisdom a swarm of people came out of it at their head strode kallinikos and a man i recognized after a moment as leontios i cursed him too at the top of my lungs he took no notice having already assumed what he fondly imagined to be the imperial manner bring him to the hippodrome he told the men who had me to the stadium where the horses run even as usurping emperor he remained redundant to the hippodrome and i suppose to the stadium where the horses run we went as we went i saw that two of leontioss followers carried between them a man suspended from a pole he turned his head and saw me too i might have guessed faithful myakes would not stand by without doing his best to keep me from being overthrown his best like my own had not been good enough god bless you emperor he called to me one of the brigands walking alongside hit him in the face forgetting i was also bound i tried to break free of my captors and come to his aid that got me nothing but another buffet of my own my ears rang into the hippodrome we came they hauled me to the stretch of track near the finish line between the main grandstand which was already black with people and the kathisma the emperors seat from which i had so often watched the pounding chariots come down to the line leontios the people shouted tu vincas leontios leontios emperor of the romans many years to the emperor leontios listening to their fickle faithlessness i felt like a husband coming home early one day to discover the wife he had trusted sucking on his best friends prong the men who had charge of myakes dumped him down on the ground that made the mob bay louder many of them no doubt believing him to be me then the cries grew louder still an executioner his features hidden by a black hood came striding up the track toward me lord jesus christ son of god have mercy on me i murmured wishing i could make the holy sign of the cross turning to kallinikos i said if you give me unction before he slays me god might make the pangs you will suffer in hell for betraying me a trifle less agonizing instead of answering kallinikos turned to leontios for permission sure enough the dog had a new master leontios had also heard my words he walked up to me a b road false smile on his face when he held up both his hands silence dropped over the hippodrome like a cloak into it he cried i leo am now emperor of the romans more acclamations rose those rather discordant some men hailing him as leo others who listened but did not hear persisting in calling him leontios how he styled himself mattered not in the least to me i knew who he was i knew what he was so long as i had breath in me even if it should be but for the next moment i would not forget he held up his hands once more silence fell again he said out of the love and comradeship i feel yet for the emperor constantine i shall not slay his worthless son justinian however much he deserves it now the buzz from the crowd was surprised confused i felt surprised and confused myself did he think he could leave me alive without my seeking to avenge myself and regain the throne rightfully mine i had known he was a fool i had not known he was such a fool but he was he went on let justinians nose be cut off as constantine cut off the noses of his brothers herakleios and tiberius and for good measure let his tongue be slit too that you may never more hear him order the ministers you rightly killed today to steal from you your money your property your freedom then off he goes to kherson and youll never hear of him or from him again at all once more the cheers from the grandstand redoubled true the mob would not have the pleasure of seeing a head leap from a body and bump along the track while blood fountained from the stump of the neck but they would have their blood albeit not so much and instead of a quick end to their sport they could enjoy my screams and moans for as long as leontios chose to indulge them now he beckoned to the executioner who advanced upon me behind the hood his eyes were thoughtful the eyes of any good craftsman measuring the task ahead of him emp uh justinian it will be easier for you if you hold very still and let me do what i have to do here he said may you die of the plague i told him may your prick drip pus and wither may your daughter couple with a dog on the mese may the demons of hell tear your flesh from your bones with pitchforks and throw it in the fire to burn forever i thought i might as well have been cursing a stone everything i said rolled off him leaving him untouched i suppose he already bore the weight of so many curses from so many men that one more mattered not at all he turned to my captors hold him tight if you please im going to do his tongue first maybe my words had got through to him after all it was cold cold comfort i clenched my teeth so hard one of them broke that at the moment was the least of my concerns matteroffactly the executioner went through his bag of tools finally selecting a small sharp blade more a scalpel than a knife i twisted my head back and forth until someone behind me seized me by the hair and prevented it the executioner stood before me i spat in his face the spittle soaked into the black hood and was gone i vowed he would not force my jaws open some vows are wasted he grabbed my beard in his left hand and pulled down all at once to my helpless horror i understood why alexander the great had required his men to shave their chins despite all i could do my mouth came open fast as a striking serpent the executioner slashed me with that little knife at the same moment though i was trying once more to jerk my head to the side i could not move much but i did shift a little and so instead of slitting my tongue from root to tip he gashed the side of it also cutting my gum and the inside of my cheek i shrieked both because the pain was bad and to make it seem worse so he would not inspect the wound to see what sort of job he had made of it my mouth filled with blood faster than i can write this i spat in his face again a great spurt of red some went in through the eyehole of the hood and made him rub at himself to restore his vision a tiny measure of revenge but i could take no large ones if i could not he remained professional about the whole business between us wadding up a cloth he stuffed it into my mouth press it against the wound hard as you can he told me it will help slow the bleeding in spite of the rag blood dripped down my chin more ran down my throat tasting of rust but with the rag in my mouth i could not curse the executioner again as i very much wanted to do that worked to my advantage he assuming i did not speak because i could not and that the mutilation had been successfully accomplished as if the executioner were likely to forget leontios prodded him now the nose remember the nose yes emperor the fellow answered which made me try to break free of my captors all over again that anyone could presume to call this bumbling fool emperor of the romans infuriated every fiber of my being the executioner rummaged through his tools this time he drew forth a larger blade than he had used before he tested the edge with his thumb shook his head and stropped the knife against the leather sole of his shoe standing on one leg like a stork to do so after another test he was satisfied and walked up to me once more the early morning sun glittered off the newly touchedup edge you have to hold him still again he told the men who had charge of me otherwise the job wont be as fast and neat as it ought to be he never spoke of mutilation i suppose that by thinking of what he did as the job he saved himself the trouble of thinking about what sort of job it was i think of this now looking back at the moment across a gap of a decade and a half perhaps i should summon one of my executioners to find out if i am right i wonder if they would answer me honestly i wonder if they have even considered the matter every trade has its secrets and every trade has its blind spots too looking at these latest sentences i see that i wish to avoid the narration of what came next as if by speaking of something else i could will that bit of time into nonexistence the executioner set the edge of the knife against my nose just below the point where bone gives way to cartilage and sliced down the end of my nose with the nostrils fell into the dirt at my feet and that is the last i ever saw of it again my blood streamed after it the crowd cheered hell never be emperor again leontios shouted and the cheers got louder again the executioner efficient in his craft pressed a bandage to the hole in my face where my nose had been that might have kept me from bleeding to death but made it very difficult for me to breathe why dont you cauterize the cut asked the fellow holding my hair he laughed nastily thatll make this bastard hurt even more from what ive seen cauterized wounds are more likely to fester the executioner replied a serious answer to what he judged a serious question he turned to leontios unless you want to give him more pain of course emperor let it go leontios said he could have killed me i suppose and he didnt get him on a ship get him out of the city get him out of my sight one of his henchmen prodded myakes with his foot what about this one strike off his head and have done i expected leontios would say yes to that but through a haze of agony i saw him shake his big stupid head no he can go to kherson too the excubitores are my bodyguards now theyd grumble if an officer of theirs died for no reason but that he was loyal myakes did i think theyd kill me brother elpidios lets put it this way i hoped they wouldnt if leontios hadnt killed me back at the praitorion back before he knew whether he could steal the throne i didnt think hed order it now in cold blood but was i sure kyrie eleison no he might have figured the crowd hadnt seen enough blood to satisfy it from watching justinian get mutilated and decided to spice up the show with my head i didnt mind a bit when my bearers picked me up and slung me on their shoulders again they werent taking me to be slaughtered when thats what your choice is everything else looks good and justinian hed need all the help he could get up till then life had been easy for him oh hed had family die but who doesnt lifes a chancy business but hed always had plenty to eat hed always been healthy hed always been handsome hed always had people hop when he told them to hop now he didnt have any of that i wondered if not having it would break him emperor to mutilated exile was a long long step and here he was with no choice but to make it all at once could he i was glad i was alive to find out justinian they dragged me and carried myakes through the streets of the imperial city toward the golden horn where waited the ship that would take me into exile at kherson news of the traitors vile act had spread through every corner of the city people jeered at me as i went cutnose cutnose was the commonest cry how i wished the ground would have opened beneath the senseless mockers letting them fall into the flames of hell as they deserved i could not answer their jeers with curses not with a rag stuffed into my mouth and another tied around the back of my head and over what had been my nose a few of the jackals threw stones and rotten fruit at me some of them hit i scarcely noticed next to the wounds i already had those were small things if only the mob had had a single neck that i might have cut off its head with one blow the pain was fire and would not cease every cobblestone i saw through a red haze i think my senses reeled for a time for we reached the quays faster than should have been possible for a part y of brigands and ruffians carrying one man and dragging along another who had been wounded bring him aboard called the captain of the ship that would take me into exile his greek was peculiar peculiar enough that i noticed it in the state i was in at the time with an effort like that of herakles when in the pagan myth he briefly held up the world for atlas i raised my head that yellowhaired fellowa i had seen him before after a moment the name came to me apsimaros my captors laid me on the deck and cut the ropes that bound me they did the same for myakes the torment of blood coming back to hands and feet helped distract me from my larger anguish sailors armed with cudgels and shortswords stood over us as if we were about to dash back onto the wharf however little i wanted to leave the imperial city my flesh was at that moment incapable of further resistance whether myakes could have fought them or not i do not know taking his lead from me as he had for so long he did not fight seeing us remain where leontioss men had left us most of the sailors soon went back to the business of readying the ship to depart three or four remained close by though enough to overpower us even had we been at the height of bodily strength apsimaros shouted orders in his guttural greek cast off the lines man the sweeps when all satisfied him apsimaros shouted again the sweeps bit into the water little by little the ship moved away from the quay out of the golden horn and toward the narrows the strait separating europe and asia and sometimes still known by its ancient name the bosporos perhaps the sea breeze in my face helped revive me to some small degree though incapable of standing i made it to my hands and knees and crawled toward the stern of the ship several sailors accompanied me on the slow painful journey had i tried to throw myself into the sea i wonder if they would have stopped me i suppose they would the narrows being such a thin ribbon of water a miracle might have let me swim to land and survive and they would not have wanted to take the chance or to explain their lapse to leontios but i had no thought of throwing myself into the sea neither to escape for whether the sailors did or not i knew i had no hope of making land nor to end my life for the only time i came close to suicide as a small boy it was from rage rather than despair nor did i completely give myself over to despair even then i peered back in the direction from which the ship had come until a swell of land hid constantinople from my view i slumped down after that but one thought still burned in my mind i will see the city again by god and his mother i will book c justinian i remember little of my arrival at kherson no i shall be honest i remember nothing of my arrival at kherson i had taken a fever in my wounds while sailing across the black sea and recall only scattered patches of the journey that may be as well many of the memories i have lost surely being ones filled with torment i wonder what the khersonites made of my sudden appearance on their distant shore till that ship reached them i was so far as they knew emperor of the romans in fact when conscious i still considered myself emperor of the romans the rest of the world however had a contrary opinion for the time being and i was in no position to demonstrate how wrong it was myakes matter of fact brother elpidios kherson isnt quite the end of the world even if it is a long ways off and tucked up against the khazars and the other barbarians who roam over the steppe with their herds sailing into it is even kind of pretty it sits in a curved bay on the west side of the peninsula that sticks down into the black sea the land rises up almost like a stairway toward the hills that keep the worst of the winter away when we came into the harbor though the whole place stank of fish a lot of what they live on there is dried and salted fish you hear people talking about bread but you dont see it all that often sometimes they even grind up the dried fish into a kind of meal and bake it into wafers and sheets they arent so bad as they sound not once you get used to them church bells were ringing when we pulled up to their quays theyd seen us from a long ways off and they knew we werent one of the little fishing boats that dot their waters like pepper on top of a stew we were a real ship from a real civilized place and they were greedy not only for whatever we might have brought em but for whatever gossip we had too the tudun himself came down to the harbor to look us over the tudun is like the eparch of the city you might say brother kherson is a town where romans live and romans trade but its not exactly a roman town the tudun is in charge of it for the khazar khagan he has more say there than anybody else the khazars roam right next to kherson like i said and the roman empire is across the sea that would give the nomads every sort of edge in a fight so there is no fight are you from amastris the tudun asked us in greek with a funny accent different than apsimaross you know about amastris brother thats right one of the towns in anatolia right across the black sea from kherson no we are from constantinople apsimaros answered the tuduns eyebrows went up he was a funnylooking fellow fat as a eunuch with a flat swarthy face and scraggly whiskers dressed all in furs and hides what do you bring us from constantinople he asked we do not have ship from constantinople for a long time i bring you greetings from leontios er leo emperor of the romans apsimaros told him that was plenty to make the tudun and everybody else who understood greek start hopping up and down like their tunics had just caught fire apsimaros had style he waited patient as you please till theyd simmered down a little then he said and i bring you justinian justinian right then was lying on the deck i had no idea whether he was going to live or not apsimaros didnt care he pointed to justinian then to a couple of sailors they hauled him up between them so the tudun and everybody else could see he was missing most of his nose several of the dockworkers and touts and whores and such who had come down to see the ship crossed themselves the tudun didnt he wasnt a christian some of the khazars follow pagan gods some follow mouamet and some are even jews whatever the tudun was he asked apsimaros what are we supposed to do with him if he dies bury him apsimaros answered if he lives let him live but dont let him leave here he stays for as long as he lives leontios he shook his head he wasnt used to leontioss new nameleo i mean will send you money to keep him here i dont know whether that meant money for justinians upkeep or a bribe to make sure nobody let him leave probably both i suppose who will take care of him the tudun said he needs someone to take care of him by the way justinian hung in the sailors arms limp as asparagus thats been boiled too long that was plain to anybody with eyes apsimaros pointed my way this is myakes he was one of justinians guard captains and he went into exile with him instead of giving up his head all right the tudun said he is not the first exile here he is not going to be the last exile here either we take him the emperor leo now apsimaros spoke carefullythanks you and thanks the khagan of the khazars too he turned to the sailors put out the gangplank get him off this ship they didnt just obey him they jumped they wanted justinian off that ship i dont really suppose they could have imagined hed do anything to them not in the state he was in but i dont know what else they could have been thinking either apsimaros might have been convinced leontios no i wont call him leo was emperor now but it didnt seem to have sunk in for the sailors they dragged justinian up onto the wharf i followed them i hadnt made any trouble on the ship didnt see any future in it so they didnt give me a rough time either they even draped one of justinians arms around my neck id figured they would dump him on the planks for me to pick up you come with me the tudun said he pointed off to the south toward a low building of the redbrown local stone we put justinian there it is a place for christian monks but it has a xenodokheion a guesthouse too we see if he lives he looked at justinian his eyes were narrow already they got narrower right now i think he dies right then i thought justinian was going to die too fever came off him in waves the wound where his nose had been was raw and inflamed i wasnt going to admit what i thought though take me to the monastery i said its in gods hands not mine yes i said that more pious back then than you thought eh brother elpidios well i daresay we all have a surprise or two in us justinian he had more than that youll see justinian my first clear memory of exile is waking from deep sleep and seeing myakes face above me beyond me and seeming miles above me were the roof beams of an unfamiliar building the straw of the mattress on which i lay was lumpy and scratchy i had never been in such a disgraceful excuse for a bed in all my life with awareness came the return of pain at first i reckoned that the lingering aftereffect of some dream i had been lucky enough to escape but it persisted memory followed awareness by a few heartbeats leontios had done that to me in the hippodrome while the people laughed and cheered intending to get a sword and kill him then and there i tried to stand easy myakes said i just got done thanking god that youre a live i have never been one to heed advice here however i had no choice discovering as i did that my limbs would not support me would indeed barely move at my command the coarse wool tunic i wore was soaked with sweat not from the effort of attempting to rise but as if i had just broken a fever that i realized was exactly what i had just done trying to speak at first i produced nothing save a harsh croak my mouth tasted of stale blood the wounds there had trouble healing on account of the moisture from my saliva but they were not the disabling wounds leontios had ordered the executioner to inflict i tried again and this time made understandable words what is this place a monastery myakes answered adding after too long a moments hesitation emperor i forgave him the hesitation given my state then after another pause he spoke again modifying what he had said before a monastery in kherson more memory returned i needed a distinct effort to nod my head yes i said speech coming easier now he said he would do that to me my voice sounded wrong in my ears and not only because it was rusty from disuse or because i moved my tongue as little as i could the tone the timbre was not what it had been with a gaping hole in the middle of my face i sounded different from the way i had when i was made like every other man cautiously i brought my hand up to the empty place where my nose had been it still pained me as i have said but at a level far below the agony it had inflicted it was a cut it was healing how long have i been here i asked five days emperor faithful myakes said this time without the hesitation over the title that was of course still rightfully mine the tudun and the monks thought you would die but your fever ended last night and now now i want something to eat i said my insides were a vast rumbling cave looking at my hand and arm i saw how much flesh i had lost or rather how much flesh had temporarily melted away from me that melting though could be reversed lost flesh as i and eunuchs will attest is lost forever ive been giving you watered wine myakes said stout fellow he was probably the only reason i had not gone before the judgment of allpowerful god some days earlier now he got to his feet and hurried out of the chamber where i lay from the other beds nearby i realized this was not a monastic cell but the xenodokheion attached to the monastery none of those other beds had anyone in it in kherson guests were few and far between i had made it up to one elbow by the time myakes and a monk came back into the xenodokheion the monk carried an earthenware bowl on a wooden tray i had already resigned myself to fare far rougher than the tender viands i had enjoyed back at the palace and was expecting something like barley porridge that however was not what the aroma rising from the bowl suggested i pointed to it asking whats in there fish stew justinian the monk answered how could i upbraid him for failing to use my proper title when out of charity he was feeding me it smells wonderful with no small effort i sat up straight my head swam but i did not let myself topple over he handed me the bowl and a wooden spoon wherewith to eat from it the stew was hot and salty and rich the fish in it was either dried or salted but i did not care feeling myself restored with every mouthful i swallowed the salt stung my wounded mouth but i had lately known worse hurts than that i did not look up from the bowl until it was empty thank you i said to the monk then that may be the most delicious meal ive ever eaten god bless you for your kindness in saying so he replied sounding not merely surprised but astonished at the time i did not understand before long i did the first bowl of fish stew i ate was surely made with the ambrosia of the pagan gods for a spice the fifth bowl no different from the first tasted good and sated my hunger the fiftieth bowl no different from the first i ate with resignation rather than relish by the time i ate the five hundredth bowl and then i think the five thousandth no different from the first i loathed it with a loathing i had thought reserved for an unloved wife but in kherson eating all too often meant eating fish stew i spent nine years in kherson the monk i found later had lived his whole life there and he was not a young man i daresay he had had a surfeit of fish stew by the time he finished cutting his milk teeth no wonder he was startled to discover anyone with a good opinion of it wine i asked i shall bring you some the monk said when he returned it was my turn to be surprised the wine sweet fruity was an excellent vintage and not one with which i had previously been familiar where does this come from i wondered aloud i have never drunk of it in constantinople we make it here the hillsides are suited to the grape the monk answered we make it mostly for ourselves it is not a famous wine so shipping it far across the sea does not pay i drained the wooden cup he had given me wishing for more over the long years that followed i drank a great deal of the sweet red wine of kherson unlike the stew of salted fish that seemed the characteristic local food it never bored me but then the most the stew brought with it was a bellyache the wine if drunk in sufficiency brought oblivion to an exile in kherson oblivion was sometimes the most precious gift god could grant i did not know then i would spend so many years away from the imperial city for i did not fully understand how isolated from the rest of the civilized world or perhaps i should simply say from the civilized world kherson was my thought then was to heal to raise a force and to return to romania to cast down leontios in the bright glow of returning awareness it all seemed very easy intending to ask for another cup of wine i found myself yawning instead was the vintage of kherson so strong no i was weak and had not realized how weak i was however much i wanted to remain sitting i could not as a man will after waking from a fever i quickly fell back to sleep hes going to make it i remember myakes saying of course i am i thought and thought no more when my eyes came open again it was night somewhere not far away a single lamp burned so the chamber in the xenodokheion was not absolutely dark i remembered at once where i was i also realized at once i was stronger this is not to say i was strong a boy whose beard had not yet sprouted could easily have laid me low it is a measure of how near heavenly judgment i had come beside me someone was snoring at first i thought it was a carpenter sawing through a thick log i had no trouble picking out the rhythm pushpull pushpull pushpull but the fellow was no carpenter and had no saw it was only myakes i wondered how little sleep he had got while i lay in feverish delirium having served me so well through that he deserved to recover now next to his pallet lay a stout cudgel leontioss men had robbed him of his sword and he must have had neither chance nor money to get another since arriving at kherson but he aimed to protect me as best he could and a club was better than nothing i sat up it was easy this time i was stronger myakes might have fed me as best he could but he hadnt fed me much one real meal counted for more than whatever hed managed to spoon into me while i lay delirious and encouraged by how easily i had succeeded in sitting i stood during the time when i was out of my head with fever someone seemed to have stolen my legs replacing them with halfbaked dough that wanted nothing so much as to buckle under my weight i swayed like a ship on a tossing sea no doubt i should have been wiser to lie down again but that would have been as much as admitting defeat besides i needed to piss breathing hard i looked around for a chamber pot the mere act of breathing felt different after my mutilation and not only because the wound while beginning to heal still festered air seemed to strike the interior of my body too soon so that it felt harsh and raw even when it was not and when i exhaled my breath no longer came down over my mustache and lips something i had not noticed with the topmost part of my mind until its absence brought it to my attention spying the pot at last one lamp was not enough to illuminate so large a chamber i made my way toward it myakes and i being the only ones in the xenodokheion the monks could have placed it near us but had not done so i suppose for no better reason than that they had not thought of it they were there to give their guests food and shelter not convenience standing had been hard walking was harder i thought i would fall over at every step i have had a far easier time managing while drunk stooping down to pick up the chamber pot was also anything but easy but i managed to ease myself without getting the floor too wet then returned to bed myakes had not wakened when i rose but the rustle of straw under my body as i lay back down made him open his eyes glancing my way he saw i too was awake you all right emperor he asked with this for my palace how could i be anything but delighted i answered startling a grunt of laughter out of him then i responded to what he had really meant im better than i was at any rate i walked across the room and back just now i spoke with some small pride as if i were pheidippides still alive after having run from marathon to tell the athenians of their victory over xerxes eat and sleep and rest thats what youve got to do for a while myakes said once you have your strengt h back youll he broke off my likely future must have looked bleak to him not to me ill go back to the imperial city and reclaim my throne i declared how long can leontios last as emperor hes a joke and not a funny one in the dim dim lamplight i could not see myakes expression well he must have known that even so he looked away from me perhaps to give himself a moment in which to gather his thoughts when at last he spoke his voice was sadder and more gentle than i had ever heard it emperor leontios didnt cut your nose off just for the sake of hurting you you know i slammed into the full meaning of that like a man running headlong into a wall myakes was right of course leontios had not mutilated me only to imitate my fathers mutilation of my uncles he had done it for the same reason my father had mutilated them to disqualify me from ever seeking to regain the imperial dignity because the emperor of the romans and the roman empire are so intimately connected to each other it stands to reason that a mutilation to one implies a mutilation to the other for as long as the empire has existed a physically imperfect man has been reckoned unfit to rule that is why emperors commonly have eunuchs as their chamberlains they know the servants in such intimate daily contact with them will not seek to take their place on the throne of itself my hand went to the part of me no longer part of me my fingers jerked away from the crusted scabs they found myakes had been watching me now do you understand emperor i understood i understood all too well i understood why he had hesitated before giving me my title that first time he spoke upon my regaining my wits i understood that to him it was now but a title of courtesy a title of pity not the title of respect it should have been that was what it meant to him not to me clenching my fists i said by god and jesus christ his son i will take back the throne myakes i dont care if i dont have this and now i made my hand linger where the fleshy part of my nose had beenand i dont care about anything else it shall be mine again yes emperor myakes said but more as if humoring me than as if believing me how will you do it though and if uh when you do how can you make people accept you how will i do it i dont know yet i answered once i do how can i make people accept me thats easy myakes ill kill the ones who dont once i kill enough the rest will get the idea dont you think yes emperor he said again a couple of days later having heard i was recovering from my wounds the tudun of kherson came to pay me a call the khazars have had their affairs intermingled with ours since the days of my greatgreatgrandfather who persuaded them to join him in attacking the persians they also join us in opposing the followers of the false prophet and have embarrassed the arabs more than once to my way of thinking they have no right to lord it over kherson which properly is as it has always been roman but the sword and the bow make their own law and so ibouzeros gliabanos khagan of the khazars is also overlord of kherson the tudun his governor here was barbarously ugly and spoke a vile greek but i quickly discovered him to be no fool you are to me a problem justinian he said studying me with a curiosity that i judged had nothing to do with my mutilation unlike most he was able to see past it to the man i remained i do not wish to be a problem to you i answered however much i despised the necessity i had to speak him soft for he held the power here do you want to be emperor again he asked i am emperor still i said simply then you are to me a problem he pointed a finger at me i do not want a problem with the new emperor in constantinople he send his ships here we have fighting we have trouble the khagan blame me his nervous expression said more clearly than his words that such blame was liable to be lethal my respect for ibouzeros gliabanos rose a sovereign who could inspire such fear in his subjects was not to be despised leontios will do nothing i said that is what leontios does best nothing the tuduns smile stretched across his wide face but did not reach his narrow eyes you say this he cast you down and you say this he did not move to cast me down his friends moved him i picked up a bowl and set it down a couple of feet away to show what i meant maybe they move him to fight too the tudun said myakes let out a snort showing he shared my opinion of leontios the tuduns gaze swung toward him but the barbarian shook his head you say this i do not know it is true i do not want to find out he pointed my way again justinian if you live in kherson you live quiet you understand live quiet i understand i told him and i spoke the truth but understanding and agreement are not the same the tuduns narrow dark little eyes glinted he was not the least capable of men nor the least suspicious you live quiet he repeated you make trouble we know who does he touched his nose to show what he meant we not let you make trouble we give you back to roman emperor this time he patted the back of his neck to show what would happen to me were i returned to constantinople i understand i said again though still knowing in my heart that i was the rightful emperor of the romans a nomisma does not cease to be made of gold even if dropped into a latrine those narrow eyes glinted again as the tudun studied me i discovered for the first time the advantage of my mutilation not only did it draw the gaze to it in horrified fascination it also made my expression harder to read by changing the contours of my face you be good the tudun said severely as if to a naughty child he strode out of the monastery satisfied he had done his duty youre going to have to be careful emperor myakes murmured youre going to have to be patient i knew those words but had never thought they would apply to me god is teaching me humility i said myakes nodded eagerly he wanted me to stay quiet too that meant he could stay quiet along with me he got his wish though at the time i had not intended that he do so a couple of weeks passed before i was well enough to leave the xenodokheion i thought i had most of my strength back though by looking at my body i could see how much flesh i still needed to restore but what sufficed for walking around in the monastery i soon discovered was less than adequate for the greater journeys required beyond its doors quickly growing winded i had to rely on the strength of myakes who accompanied me as much as on my own this was so despite khersons minuscule size a healthy man could have walked from one end of the place to the other in half an hour even i would not have needed much longer that first time to one used to the marvels of the imperial city being forced to live in kherson was like having to drink water and water of poor quality at that after wine the life of the town such as it was clustered close to the harbor though ships from the roman empire were few and far between the little fishing boats kept sailing out onto the black sea to bring back the catch on which the life of kherson depended many others depended on the boats for their livelihood carpenters netmakers sailmakers brothelkeepers taverners over everything hung the odor of fish i discovered in kherson that whichever part of the nose is responsible for the sense of smell it lies deep within the organ not at the tip which had been taken from me i had no trouble whatever discerning the stinks of fish drying in the sun fish pickling in salty brine fish frying and fish rotting as time passed i grew accustomed to those stinks hardly noticing them in the early days of my exile though they made their presence insistently felt a washerwoman emptied a barrel of water out onto the roadway in front of her shop soaking rapidly into the dirt kherson boasted no paved streets the water soon vanished leaving behind only a patch of mud to entrap unwary passersby and perhaps to enhance the washerwomans trade seeing that brief puddle though gave me an idea shell have more water in there wont she i asked myakes i expect so emperor he answered after a brief hesitation he asked are you thirsty there will be wineshops for that i was not thirsty i had no doubt he knew i was not thirsty he was trying to protect me from myself always a losing battle i went into the washerwomans shop she looked up from the tunics she was wringing out her mouth twisted then of a sudden her faced cleared or nearly cleared youre him arent you she asked in strangely accented greek justinian i mean yes i am justinian till that moment i had never had to humble myself before anyone but my father and found the experience both strange and unpleasant nevertheless i persisted pointing to a wooden hogshead i asked is there water in that barrel there is water she agreed then she went on as myakes had are you thirsty i will get you a cup no i am not thirsty i said i want to see myself may i look she hesitated her lip curled again which should have told me everything i needed to know but i had been polite though she looked troubled she nodded to me nodding my thanks in return i went over to the hogshead and peered down into it in the grand palace in constantinople i had a mirror of polished silver as tall as i was in which i could examine my magnificence when decked out in the imperial regalia a handsome man had always stared back at me from that gleaming surface my regalia now consisted of a dirty wool tunic i had been disfigured the water in that miserable old barrel seemed an appropriate instrument in which to view myself it was dim inside the shop and dimmer within the hogshead for a moment i thought i would see nothing then my eyes having adapted to the gloom i wished nothing was what i had continued to see everyone knows the seeming of a man newrecovered from illness that all but took his life the sunken eyes the skin stretched tight across cheekbones the expression that says and says truthfully he has won a battle against a foe as deadly as any who roars on the battlefield sword and bow to hand all that i expected all that i found in my imagination i had subtracted from my appearance most of my nose or at least i had thought i had done so i have many times been reminded imagination and reality are not identical but never more forcibly than on that quiet morning in that humid little shop in my imagination the wound was neat and precise with pink flesh appearing under where my nose had been in fact my face took on the aspect of a skull with a large dark opening in the center the presence of my eyes above it could not overcome the horrific skeletal impression i created even on myself sickened i turned away from the hogshead for the first time understanding in my belly why ancient custom forbids the imperial throne to a mutilated man who i wondered could bring himself to obey the commands of an emperor whom good fortune had so conspicuously abandoned what disasters would the reign of such a one bring down onto the roman empire turning toward myakes i saw he had long ago grasped what i was realizing only now you see emperor he said meaning the word in its most literal sense yes i see i answered and for a moment despair threatened to overwhelm me i see i repeated heavily and after thanking the washerwoman for what she imagined to be her kindness i spoke again to myakes in listless tones lets go aye emperor he said compliant as always and by that unquestioning compliance he saved me i strode out of the washerwomans shop into the warm bright sunshine myakes followed without hesitation he need not have followed he need not have accompanied me to kherson at all or nursed me when fever from my wounds nearly took my life better for him had he stayed behind in constantinople but he had followed and cared for me he followed still if he followed me mutilated as i was others would follow as well the logic was as inexorable as any the pedagogue whose name i have long since forgotten tried to inculcate in me as inexorable as the logic demonstrating the hypostatic union of the two natures of our lord jesus christ the son of god i will be emperor again i murmured and then i shall be emperor again which partook of more of the flavor of inevitability building in my mind myakes said nothing i daresay he thought i was mad but if he thought me mad why did he still call me emperor humoring a madman perhaps perhaps but why would he have gone on serving a madman as exile i had no claim on him he could have done better for himself had he abandoned me to the bottom of my soul i believe something in him still sensed the power of the imperial dignity clinging to me even in kherson as the scent of perfume clings to a woman long after she sets aside the jar from which it has come i did not traverse kherson end to end not that first day the smell of fish frying in hot oil wafting out of a tavern near the washerwomans shop made my stomach growl like a bear i pointed to the tavern saying lets get some of that it will be better than the salt fish theyll give us back at the monastery i had already had plenty of that myakes looked down at the ground how do you propose paying for it emperor at the monastery they dont ask for money or they havent yet anyhow if we stay there much longer and leontios doesnt send any they will i expect was i more astonished than i should have been maybe i was but in all my life i had never once had to pay for food and the idea that i might need to do so now had never entered my mind almost as much as the glimpse of my appearance it brought home to me the brute reality that in the eyes of the world i was emperor of the romans no more well the world was and is an ignorant place and i have had occasion to teach it more than one lesson nor had i ever had to worry about money for myself before for the roman empire yes but not for myself i had had everything i now had nothing realizing to the fullest how far i had fallen was dizzying i found myself swaying on my feet this i judge was also due in no small measure to my remaining bodily weakness having recovered from that in part i had imagined it completely overcome and now discovered i was in error lets head back myakes said seeing both my discomfiture and my weakness and indeed he took my arm and bore some of my weight when i faltered the salty stew was waiting for us when we arrived i ate of it then crawled under my blanket and slept like a little child after a hard days play when i woke i was stronger one day not long after that myakes said to me i expect youll be all right here for a spell emperor im going up into the town what are you going to do there i asked look for work on the docks he answered well both be better off if we have a bit of cash jingling in our pouches he slapped the one he wore on the belt round his tunic nothing jingled there it being empty but i began i can name no rational reason for the pained embarrassment i felt myakes had been serving me since i was hardly higher than his knee he had risked his life more than once on my behalf why his proposing to labor so that i might have money so affected me i cannot say that it did i cannot deny myakes however would hear none of my inchoate protest got to be done he said cheerfully ive been a farmer and ive been a soldier after those dockwalloper wont be so much of a much he poured down the wine the monks had given us with our morning porridge saltfish porridge of course and went out whistling a dirty song whose tune our pious hosts fortunately did not recognize that left me with nothing whatever to do and with no one with whom to talk the monks being occupied after breakfast with their own concerns i went into the monastery chapel to pray a couple of monks there gave me approving looks after noticing that i ignored them wondering how i should address the god whom i had served all the years of my life who had rewarded me with rank and comfort and pleasure beyond those of which most mortal men can dreama and who had then cast me down quoting the psalmist i said athe judgments of the lord are true and righteous altogethera though easy to say that was hard to accept the lord had judged my family harshly my brother my father my wife all struck down young and now my own fall from wealth and splendor god had let satan inflict boundless suffering on job whose faith had not wavered in the end god rewarded job for his steadfastness that thought helped me shape the rest of the prayer i sent up to the heavens test me as you will lord i am your instrument and if it should happen that you grant me return to the queen of cities i shall glorify your name unceasingly but if it be your will that i remain here throughout my span of daysa i shall glorify your name unceasingly in that case as well i crossed myself i stayed in the chapel a long time next to the church of the holy wisdom it was a hovel but a house of god is a house of god no matter how humble i did not need to think about what to do there i already knew and so i remained while the sun wheeled across the sky as evening approached myakes returned he stank of sweat but had money in his pouch i wont have any trouble keeping us in coins he told me it was like theyd never seen anybody who wanted to do some work and wasnt going through the motions or maybe im just used to moving faster than these people on account of all the years ive lived in the city all right i said still obscurely troubled that he should have to labor with the sweat of his brow for our welfare but what was the alternative that i labor myself for one thing i had not yet fully recovered my strength after the fever that followed my mutilation for another should an emperor of the romans have become a common roustabout i saw that as even less fitting than living off myakes stalwart efforts every morning after that he went off to the docks almost every evening he came back with a full days wages sometimes in roman folles and miliaresia sometimes in silver minted by the followers of the false prophet sometimes in coins i had never seen before coins from out of the barbarous west of the world or the all but unknown east kherson was not a great trading center if only the number of merchants who called there was taken into account but it did draw folk from every corner of the earth myakes was generous in sharing with me what he earned though i continued to spend a good deal of time in the chapel i was also able to make forays into the town and if the impulse struck me to buy for myself a cup of wine or some fried fish drenched in vinegar i had in fact the illusion of freedom freedom that is so long as i did not try to leave or even think of leaving kherson it was not enough myakes do you know brother elpidios i wouldnt have minded so much if justinian had decided to live out his days on the far side of the black sea id be there yet i expect probably not working so hard now id be an old man there s ame as i am here but id have my eyes and that wouldnt be so bad like as not id be sitting in a wineshop or maybe out in front if the weathers fine like it usually is up there and id watch the pretty girls go by every now and then somebodyd ask me to tell a story of constantinople and folks would go ooh and ahh and theyd buy me more wine doesnt sound so bad does it justinian might still be there too you never can tell hed be ugly no doubt about it but khersons not a big place people would be used to him by now once youve seen somebody every day for years what he looks like doesnt matter so much hed just be old justinian who used to be emperor and the stories he could tell id have listened to those myself but thats not how things happened they could have easy enough but they didnt and so justinians twenty years dead and im here an old blind monk you cant tell beforehand brother elpidios only god knows beforehand and he never never lets on justinian while i stayed there in kherson days began to blur together in a fashion i had never known before with nothing to distinguish one from another they slipped past me without my fully realizing they had gone i was taken by surprise when the first winter storm roared over the mountains north of the town surely only a month six weeks at the most had passed since the warm summer day when leontios and his pack of traitors stole my throne from me but no looking at the position of the sun in the sky and the stars at night convinced me that storm was no freak but came at its proper time not many storms came roaring over the mountains although lying the breadth of the black sea north of constantinople kherson has winters generally milder than those of the imperial city this being due to the shielding effect of the high ground snow was more frequently an amusement for the children than a drudgery for their elders and in fact myakes and i had a fine time or more than one pelting each other with snowballs and then retreating into the comfortable warmth of the xenodokheion but though i continued to live in the guesthouse attached to the monastery i was no monk lacking as i did the temperament for the solitary life one day i borrowed some silver from myakes or rather i asked it of him and he gave it to me and went walking up into kherson i knew the sort of place i was looking for and expected to find such a place close by the harbor sure enough when i came to a large twostory building with a muscular fellow lounging outside a sword on his hip and a club in his hand i suspected my search was done nodding to him i said are the girls pretty and pointed inside aye they are he answered would a whorehouse bouncer deny it thereby turning away trade he looked at me in a thoughtful way im not so sure theyll think youre pretty though i made the miliaresia jingle in my pouch theyll think these are pretty he surprised me then saying maybe maybe not this is a town full of sailors business is good enough the girls can afford to be choosy he was not offensive about my mutilation treating it as a simple business problem that left me untroubled indeed it pleased me more than his simply ignoring it would have done responding in a like vein i said may i try my luck he studied me again youre not going to raise a fuss if they turn you down by the mother of god i swear it i said whereupon he started to laugh as did i a moment later an ordinary enough oath yes but not when offered outside a brothel not only did he wave me forward he opened the door so i could enter i had never been inside such a place before as prince and then as emperor of the romans i had had women brought to me and no need to go forth to seek them thus i looked around with some curiosity it was as i might have expected several women some comely some not sat on chairs or lolled on couches waiting for trade they wore thin clinging tunics cut very short none of them bothered with drawers each and every one looked bored the hall smelled of cheap scent and old sweat a plump fellow evidently the master of the place came up to me looking very important what do you want here he demanded that question i had not expected others perhaps but not that one i stared at him then answered ive come to buy some paint the whores realized i was jesting before their pimp did at their laughter he pasted a broad insincere smile across his broad insincere face i dont know friend he said when a man like that calls you friend stand with your back to a wall and keep one hand on your belt pouch and the other on your knife he went on youre not the prettiest fellow who ever came in here you know i daresay he was not the prettiest fellow who had ever come in there either but if i angered him i would not get what i had come to pay for and so as i had for the bouncer outside i showed i had money to spend the silver looks the same any which way he ran his tongue over broad fleshy lips even so he spread his hand if i order one of the girls to serve you ill make all of them angry you see how it is if one of them will go to you by herself fine otherwisea he let that hang i turned to the women not pleading if i had not pleaded for leontios i would not plead before a pack of prostitutes but showing myself to them and waiting to learn what they would do what they did was nothing not one made any move to join me i jingled the pouch again twice the money i said but one by one they shook their heads you see how it is the brothel keeper said again i see i said less angry than i had thought i would be like the muscular lout outside they were matteroffact not scornful that gave me an idea what if i come back after dark and we go to a dark room for twice the usual one of the girls asked yes it was business a deal i said at once she was thin and rather plain but not outright ugly and if she would not be able to see me in the night i would not be able to see her either there in the blackness i could imagine her as i pleased when i went outside after completing the bargain the ruffian out there said no luck eh seeing me doing as i had sworn he was inclined to be sympathetic rather than harsh they told me to come back after dark i answered ah he said understandingly ill see you then i guess as i started to go he added a question is it true what they say that you used to be emperor of the romans no i replied i saw that i had disappointed him but i had not finished its not true i used to be emperor of the romans i am the emperor of the romans all right chum he said in the tones of one humoring a man mad but not dangerously so as guardsman for a brothel he must have come across a good many of that sort even in his amusement though he remained civil i had enough money to pay the double rate but not much more instead of going into a tavern then or an eatery to while away the time till sunset i walked down to the wharves strode out on one to the very end and peered south over the waters of the black sea toward the constantinople i could not see no ships from the roman empire were tied up there only the little local fishing boats no ship from the empire had come in since the one bringing me unless while i lay in my delirium i felt very much alone very much a mote adrift if a whorehouse bouncer would not believe me the emperor of the romans why should i how could i because i am i said a seagull standing near me flapped up into the air with a startled squawk the sun plunged into the sea i waited until almost all the twilight had drained from the sky before making my way back toward the brothel not wanting to be turned away because i was too visible on account of that i arrived at the place later than i expected having lost my way more than once in the gathering gloom should have brought a torch with you the guard remarked when at last i found the proper lane i shrugged and nodded yielding the point why not as he had before he opened the door for me my greatest worry was that the one who had said she would go upstairs with me was already upstairs with someone else she would eventually have come down again yes but imagining her all my own would have come harder but there she sat when she saw me she got to her feet she put out her hand palm upturned i crossed it with silver having made sure i had paid her enough she nodded she took me up to a room big enough for a bed and not much more she closed the door behind us and i barred it going to the little window she pulled the shutters across it and tied them so they would not open it might have been something less than perfectly black in there but it lacked little of that perfection in the darkness something rustled her tunic sliding off over her head i quickly pulled off my own tunic then took a step backward toward the bed it proved to be but half a step away rather than sitting down i almost fell onto it saving myself only by jerking back at the last moment fresh pressure on the mattress said the woman had got down beside me i groped for her my hand closed on firm rounded flesh i caught her in my arms she felt like a woman against my skin she smelled like a woman i did not need to see her to rise tall and proud as i began to caress her she said dont try kissing me it would remind me of of your being noseless she might as well have shouted it it did not kill my ardor nothing would have killed my ardor that night not after so long without all right i answered my voice mild as wine threequarters water i had not int ended kissing her anyhow who could say where her lips had been and what they had done before touching mine my own lips and teeth closed on the tip of her breast as my hand went between her legs what do you want from me she asked youre paying after all rough games had pleased me now and then in days gone by instead of making as if to take her by force though i answered treat me like a lover not a customer what i wanted most of all was to feel as if my mutilation did not cut me off indeed from the rest of mankind the blackened room in which we lay gave that the lie but what we were doing helped me not think about its being a lie she let out a tiny sigh as if i could have asked nothing more onerous of her but then in the darkness she played the part well enough she nibbled my earlobes and kissed my neck and licked my nipples every now and then teasingly stroking my manhood as she did then she took me in her mouth she was not particularly skilled but i was not particularly demanding not then shall i finish this way she asked when i began to gasp no i said and so she straddled me as irene the sklavinian serving girl had done all those years before for my first time but i put my arms around her and rolled us over so i rode her not much later i spurted my seed deep into her when she began to pull away i held her to me for i was still hard i had not gone twice one time right after the other without dislodging myself for a few years but that night after such long abstinence i had no trouble she let me have her again if she took pleasure from it herself she gave no sign i could discern when i rolled off her after the second round she said you should pay twice again but she meant that either as a joke or as a ploy to see if she could get the extra silver from me having faced down angry nobles in the imperial city i had no trouble with a kherson whore i paid enough i answered firmly i dont think i kept you up here long enough to lose much other trade had she threatened to scream for the bouncer i do not know what i should have done he being both larger and more to the point much better armed than i but all she did was sigh and begin to grope around on the floor for the tunic she had doffed a tiny victory for me perhaps but the first i had won since being treacherously ousted from my throne and so one to cherish finding my way back to the xenodokheion in the darkness was another victory one that at the time seemed as large on leaving the brothel i paid a couple of coppers for a torch nothing came free there to light my way southward but the cursed thing went out before i was halfway there leaving me alone in a darkness almost as stygian as that inside the chamber where i had coupled with the whore i stumbled on literally seeing or rather not seeing how full of stones and mudfilled potholes the streets were by god and by guess and by occasional glimpses of stars overhead through rents in the clouds scudding past so long as i kept going south i told myself i would eventually come upon the monastery to which the guesthouse was attached such assurances are often less than reassuring even by light of day in the chilly blackness of night i might as well have been a little boy murmuring charms against the monsters that dwell only in his imagination and so can follow him even under the blankets of his bed i was looking around for monsters i must say but as much by luck as by design found the monastery instead when i walked in through the door of the xenodokheion i found myakes wearing a sword i had not known he possessed and about to come out after me where were you he cried out on seeing me his tone quite different from that by which a subordinate customarily addresses his superior one of the monks was hovering in the chamber never mind i replied in dull embarrassment not wanting to wreck the reputation for piety i had built up since arriving at the monastery myakes though not always what one would call quickwitted was in certain matters no fool oh he said realizing where i must have been and then a moment later oh again when he figured out the likely reason i had had to wait so long before faring homeward hope it was worth it god bless him he sounded almost as matteroffact as the bouncer had been i think so i said the monk looked from one of us to the other in confusion unable to follow our elliptical conversation just as well i thought myakes easy brother elpidios easy we dont ask guests at our xenodokheion here to be saints now do we of course we dont every mans a sinner right the only perfect man was the son of god yes justinian went out and fornicated with prostitutes why are you asking me when he admits it himself yes i know he was the man who fought so hard for the canons of the fifthsixth synod that condemned brothels and those who kept them no that didnt stop him pretty plain it didnt stop him wouldnt you say a hypocrite justinian less so than most men ive known but he was a man and even then well on the sunny side of thirty once his wounds healed up his body drove him same as it does any man that age yes he fell into sin every now and again you get rid of every man whos fallen into sin that way every now and again all of a sudden the world starts looking like a pretty empty place me brother what did i do when we were up there in kherson oh this and that i was working a lot of the time remember was i working all the time now what ever would you mean by that brother elpidios justinian i did not pander to my lusts every so often though when they grew unbearable i would ask money of faithful myakes and go off after sunset to slake them some of the other women at the brothel gradually came to accept me so i did not have to rely entirely on the complaisance or availability of that one as i have already said days and weeks and months in exile began to flow into one another with little to distinguish any particular day from any other only the unusual was worthy of note and little enough of that happened a few times a year a ship from constantinople or one of the anatolian cities of romania sinope or amastris mostly would tie up in the harbor then we would have a brief orgy of catching up on news from the wider world much of it old news by the time it reached us avid to find out how the roman empire was faring i pestered captains and sailors alike for word of what leontios was doing for the first year the usurpers fundament defiled the throne the answer was as best i could tell that he did nothing whatsoever this in no way surprised me being in perfect accord with the character leontios had previously exhibited everything is peaceful the seafaring men would say perhaps hoping to wound my spirits by showing that the empire was doing well without me if that was their intent it failed in calm weather a ships captain may fall asleep whenever he pleases with nothing evil befalling his vessel but if he is asleep when a storm blows up the ship will go to the bottom before he can wake and try to make amends for his carelessness so i judged it would be with leontios and my judgment was vindicated that however as yet lay ahead for news from the roman empire trickled in slowly news from all over the world trickled into kherson slowly it lay on a trade route that stretched east all the way to the land of serinda whence we romans learned the secret of manufacturing silk during the reign of the emperor for whom i was named and west to the island of britannia and even to another island beyond britannia of which geographers may speak but of which i was previously ignorant most merchants travel back and forth across a single section of the trade route but some pulled by greed or the desire for adventure wander far from their homes in taverns in kherson i met men from india the eastern india the one alexander conquered not the one also known as ethiopia and persia from germany the source of so many barbarous tribes that have harmed us romans and from this distant island i mentioned which is called i think ibernia no ive never been to constantinople my own self a traveler told me in a hideous mixture of greek and latin enlivened by a barbarously musical accent but i know a man who has a priest he was out of some little town in gaul arculf i exclaimed the odds were against it i knew but he was the sole priest from a little town in gaul i had met in the imperial city and may i be condemned to the eternal fires of hell if the merchant did not nod aye thats the man he said a good and holy soul he is too yes i said agreeing with him completely how did he come to distant ibernia i needed some time to puzzle out the answer to that arculf it seemed had in fact not gone to ibernia but to iona a small island off the western coast of britannia there the traders uncle a certain adamnan was abbot of a monastery arculf being shipwrecked there related his tales of travel in romania to this adamnan who took them down in latin and so knowledge of the civilized world does reach distantly and in dreamlike wise even those faroff places what happened to arculf after his ship foundered at this island of iona the trader with whom i was drinking did not know learning even so little of my old acquaintance though brightened that day and several after it and also gave me my own tavern tale to spin out in later times not a bad story for a man without a nose another merchant judged a few weeks later and bought me a cup of wine i am emperor of the romans i declared having already had a good deal of wine that day not a bad story for an emperor without a nose he said and the laugh he got gave him the last word as i have intimated no great stretch of time passed before leontios began demonstrating on the throne the qualities on account of which he had so singularly failed to endear himself to me a ship crossing the sea from sinope brought word that raids into romania led by the sklavenoi which had diminished thanks to the vigorous efforts i undertook to combat them were once more increasing in both frequency and ferocity not long afterwards news came that the prince of lazika whose name if memory serves was sergios brought his district which lies on the southeastern shore of the black sea east of trebizond under the dominion of the deniers of christ as sabbatios the armenian had with his a few years before both these tidbits reached kherson months after they happened myakes heard the first of them on the wharves i the second in a tavern when i brought it back to him at the xenodokheion he looked thoughtful and said the generals in the military districts arent going to be very happy with leontios i snorted who would be happy with leontios no one with his wits about him thats certain then unbidden a horrid thought struck me by the virgin mother of god myakes suppose one of those generals overthrows leontios and takes the throne while i rot here across the sea from everything that matters dont really know what you can do about that emperor myakes said he twisted awkwardly trying to scratch the small of his back something bit me something had bitten me too fear back in romania as myakes had said the generals were undoubtedly seething at leontioss ineptitude and if one of them took it into his mind to do more than seethe he had the resources with which to topple the sluggard men and weapons and gold and what had i a pallet in a xenodokheion in a halfbarbarous town owing first allegiance to the khazar nomads and one former guardsman who had constituted himself my servant still and somehow incredibly more than two years had passed since leontios shipped me into exile save for being hale in body once more i was no closer to returning to what was rightfully mine than i had been when apsimaros poured my feverwracked carcass onto the kherson quay suppose someone who actually knows how to rule seizes the throne i said clutching at myakes arm leontios is an easy target but i can think of half a dozen men who would be very devils to put down so can i he answered scratching still he did not sound greatly concerned he was always calmer by nature than i and he had also come to be contented with the life he was living and yet how can i say that having spent so long content to live like a beast satisfying animal lusts but no others nor though i did not yet know it was my exile anywhere near complete my trouble was simplicity itself how was i to go about establishing an army that could retake constantinople in a town lacking enough men to form a proper regiment and in a town moreover where being who i was and what i was i could not hide and where the tudun was determined i should do no such thing easy enough to discover the difficulty discovering a solution to it was years away i had by then made a couple of tavern friends i felt i could trust a halfkhazar named barisbakourios and his brother salibas who sometimes went and whom i preferred to call by the more properly greek name stephen drunk and sober they proclaimed they would be glad to help me regain my throne with faithful myakes they made me an army of three with an army of three i stayed in kherson news continued to trickle into the town however distantly removed from the time when it had actually occurred one of the relatively rare ships from constantinople itself brought word that the arabs had seized carthage i drank myself senseless when i heard that one of the reasons my grandfather constans had sailed to italy and sicily and his eventual murder in the barbarous west was to protect carthage from the followers of the false prophet and now constans having given his life to defend it leontios fecklessly threw it away leontios will have to do something about that emperor myakes said when the next day i took word back to the xenodokheion will he i had a headache like death which inclined me even more than i would have been otherwise toward doubting any possible link between leontios on the one hand and doing something on the other aye he will myakes answered through a mouthful of saltfish stew he was eating in a hurry as he intended to go up to the harbor to look for work but he spared me a couple of more sentences saying losing carthage is like losing thessalonike or ankyra would be he cant ignore it who says he cant i returned ignoring inconvenient difficulties was one of the few things leontios had proved he did well here however myakes proved correct leontios set out a fleet i learned eventually and to my astonishment succeeded in driving the arabs from carthage returning in larger numbers however they then defeated us romans the commander of the roman expedition a certain john sailed back to the empire for reinforcements not having enough men with him to stand up to the larger army the deniers of christ had moved against him on his reaching crete though his junior officers revealed a plan of their own to sail east rather than returning to the west they struck for constantinople having proclaimed one of their own number emperor of the romans he has a funny name a foreign kind of name the sailor who was telling me the story said so people are calling him tiberius instead of ofa his memory failed until i bought him another cup of wine of apsimaros thats it apsimaros i had been drinking wine myself at that name i swallowed wrong coughed and sprayed little drops of red over the tabletop in front of me they couldnt have dug up a bigger nobody if they tried for a year strictly speaking i suppose that is not true phokas whom my greatgreatgrandfather overthrew to the salvation of the roman empire had been but a commander of a hundred before a mutiny raised him to imperial rank in his case i shall not say imperial dignity apsimaros was of higher standing than that after dabbing at himself my informant said thats the name all right once you hear it how can you forget it except of course as a means of gaining more wine hes in sykai now they say across the golden horn from constantinople and trying to figure out how to break in i bought him still more wine in the hope that he could tell me something else but he wine or no had run dry leaving me disappointed to become emperor a rebel must seize the queen of cities my greatgreatgrandfather had managed it against phokas for no one defended the vicious tyrant leontios had managed against me seizing the city from the inside out so to speak apsimaros though was attempting what i would also have to do when my day came breaking into constantinople against opposition the followers of the false prophet had not managed that could anyone the next ship up from constantinople brought the announcement of the accession of tiberius emperor of the romans who it was reluctantly admitted had once borne the barbarous appellation of apsimaros that was all the official word given forth myakes got more out of the sailors who remembering what they reckoned my former rank were reluctant were afraid to speak to me he bribed leontioss soldiers up at blakhernai thats what he did myakes reported they opened the gates for his men and in he came did some pretty good plundering the soldiers he had with him his sigh said he wished hed been there himself but then he brightened ah thats the other thing apsimaros caught leontios he beamed from ear to ear i shrugged since hes calling himself miscalling himself emperor now i suppose he would have leontios must be shorter by a head it was my turn to sigh too bad i wanted to kill him myself hes not dead emperor myakes beamed wider than ever apsimaros the asp bit him sure enough but not to death he packed him off to the monastery of delmatos but first do you know what he did first sooner or later youll tell me why not now myakes took no notice of my irritability and in fact cured it with half a dozen words emperor he cut off his nose my hand went of itself to the scarred wound i bore he did what i said and then held up my hand no dont say it again i heard you truly god is a just judge that comes closer than anything i could have imagined to tempting me to forgive apsimaros for stealing the throne that belongs to me i dont forgive ill never forgive but i am tempted hes ruling under the name tiberius myakes reminded me that made me shrug again hes sitting on my throne no reason he shouldnt steal a name that belongs to my family too as a matter of fact though now that i think on it my clan had also borrowed the name tiberius taking it from the emperor who ruled just before maurice and who was in the days of my greatgreatgrandfather a man of good reputation how and why that tiberius came to bear his name i cannot say he being the first roman emperor to carry it since the one in whose reign our lord was crucified his brother i hear is named herakleios myakes said whether thats his real name or one hes put on i couldnt tell you i vaguely remembered that apsimaros had had a brother who was an officer of some sort for the life of me i could not remember what that brothers name had been in no way had he distinguished himself apsimaros wo uld undoubtedly promote him to high rank anyhow if a man could not rely on his own brother he could rely on no one remembering how little my father had been able to rely on his brothers i felt relying on no one the better choice then i looked over at myakes had i not relied on him had i not had him upon whom to rely i would surely have died not long after my exile began but comparing myakes to my ambitious uncles was comparing figs and fingers myakes was in no position to supplant me no matter what he did apsimaros would always have to keep one eye on his herakleios just as my father had had to watch his brothers herakleios and tiberius just as i would have had to watch my brother herakleios had he lived i said i pray to god myakes that leontios has no one to look after him as you looked after me when i needed you most he grunted id succeeded in embarrassing him emperor ive been taking care of you about as long as ive been a man he answered after a pause for thought ive been doing it so long id hardly know how to do anything else he seemed to feel about it the same way i felt about the throne the one was his destiny as the other was mine but he was luckier than i for his calling unlike mine had suffered no interruption time went on i never abandoned the hope and intention of regaining my throne but i had no luck building any sort of force to help me do it my only new recruit besides the aforementioned brothers barisbakourios and stephen or as i have said salibas he answering impartially to both was a gigantic fisherman named paul who was as strong as any other two men i have ever seen unfortunately what god had given him in bulk he took away in wit with the result that the fisherman was often called though seldom to his face moropaulos foolish paul carthage remained in arab hands apsimaros having been part of the fleet that failed to reclaim it must have regarded it as a lost cause in the east though he beat back an attack by the followers of the false prophet and that frontier being the gateway to anatolia and to the imperial city itself is more vital for the roman empire by the news that slowly dribbled into kherson apsimaros displayed more energy on the throne than had leontios that this is less than the highest of praise i freely admit a dead man would have found it difficult to display less energy than had leontios in the year following his successful defense of roman territory apsimaros sent into exile bardanes sometimes called philippikos consigning him to the island of kephallenia reckoning this upon my fingers i find that it must have been in the fourth year of apsimaross usurpation which was the seventh year of my exile the more i think on it the more incredible it seems and yet i am convinced it is accurate what did bardanes do i asked the traveling jeweler who gave me the news story is that he dreamt he had an eagle shading his head and was stupid enough to say so in front of somebody who took word to the emperor the fellow answered that was stupid i agreed from time out of mind the eagle has been the symbol of roman power and by extension of the imperial dignity no wonder apsimaros exiled him he had as much as claimed he would be emperor one day in the next year the arabs under azar attacked kilikia apsimaross brother drove them back to their own lands with heavy losses the armenians also rebelled against the arabs whom sabbatios had installed as their overlords apsimaros sent men to help them but the deniers of christ proved stronger there driving out the romans regaining the territory that had rebelled and burning alive a good many of the armenian grandees who had risen up against them i know i heard this story in detail far more circumstantial than i recount here but count myself lucky to remember any of it at all sitting not far from the sailor who was spinning it was a small thin brown man with wavy black hair and features of almost feminine delicacy during my time in exile i had learned that such men came from distant india they did not often come from distant india however in those seven years i had seen no more than half a dozen thus i looked at this fellow with some considerable interest perhaps men from india also come to the imperial city from time to time if they do however they do not come to the grand palace before my forced journey to kherson i had seen never a one the man from india also stared at me i had grown resigned to that from children and strangers the general run of khersonites having by then accustomed themselves to my appearance but the indians stare was different from those of many seeing me for the first time curious not horrified after a bit of staring that curiosity got the better of him picking up his cup of wine he came over to me as i stood in front of the bar whereupon pointing a brown finger at the center of my face he asked why do you look like that his greek was not very good and flavored by a singsong accent unlike any i had heard before he certainly did not know enough of the language to be polite why do i look like this i repeated to be sure i understood him he nodded he being a barbarian i thought him also a fool and gave back the sort of answer i should have offered to a roman twit who put such a question to me i lost my nose somewhere and dont know where to find it that got a laugh from the drinkers who heard me the little man from india though nodded again as if what i had said made perfect sense if you want he said i build you new one oh splendid i said will you make it of clay so that i can paste it onto my face i won another laugh with that sally i laughed myself bitterly one winter the second or perhaps the third i was in kherson i had taken a knife and carved a nose out of wood taking pains to let no one not even myakes know what i was about rather than pasting it to my face i had attached it by means of a cord tied round my head when it was done i carried it off to a rain puddle again making sure no one saw me donned it and examined my reflection my opinion of the result may be inferred from the fact that i never wore it again once more however the man from india rather than giving up or growing angry as i was certainly beginning to do replied as if to a serious question oh no very much no i make from flesh of you he wore a tunic not much different from mine instead of a belt though he had a rope around his middle with a flat wooden box dangling from it in place of the usual leather pouch from the box he drew a knife that reminded me of the one the executioner in constantinople had used to try to slit my tongue had i been back at the grand palace anyone daring to produce a weapon in my presence would have met a quick end at the hands of the excubitores or perhaps a slow end at the hands of the executioners his intention in so doing would have mattered not at all the act would have sufficed and more than sufficed but i was in a smoky tavern in kherson my hand went to the knife i wore on my own belt but i did not so much as pull it from its sheath waiting instead to learn what he would do or say make from flesh of you he repeated and with the knife as pointer sketched a flap of skin on his forehead saying do cutting here you see you understand cutting he knew how limited his greek vocabulary was i understand i told him you are speaking of surgery surgery he agreed happily is word i am wanting oh very yes do cutting here i say and it go down overa he pointed to the hole where my nose had been make more cutting he ran his thumb along the bottom of his own nose sew together wait for heal you have again nose they no do this here they do not do this here no even in my own ears my voice sounded far away to have a nose againa i had dreamt of having a nose again but knew too well how dreams vanish on waking my hand moved to the scars smooth now and painless from the passage of years around my mutilation would it be as good a nose as the one i once had without a moments hesitation he shook his head no you still be ugly you not be very very ugly no more oh very yes you not no he did not have enough greek for politeness as when he took out the knife though i remained unoffended his attitude bespoke a certain basic truthfulness i found more questions how is it you know how to perform this surgery have you done it before do it three times me he held up three fingers in case i had not followed him how i know how my brother is right word brother he do this times many hea baidyas this it turned out was as best i can set it down in greek characters the indian word for physician the small brown man being unable to remember its greek equivalent if indeed he ever knew it before i said iatros i do you he asked as he had not before i did not hesitate now yes you do me i said at that time in that place what had i to lose he could not very well have made me uglier than i already was and if i had not died of fever when my nose and tongue were cut i doubted i should perish of it from what as i could see would be a lesser infliction of the knife then he revealed he was indeed a trader i had shown myself too eager the glow that came into his eyes had nothing to do with the lamps and torches illuminating the tavern what you give me to do this he asked what do you want i asked suddenly cautious as emperor i had dickered with the arabs over tribute but till i came to kherson that was my only experience with the fine art of haggling exile had broadened my knowledge of an art for which an emp eror had but limited use even so i knew i was less acquainted with it than a man who had made his living by it from childhood would have been i tried to distract him by asking an unrelated question whats your name auriabedas he answered that again is as close as i can come to rendering it into greek letters he was not distracted is gold good in this part of world he said a tribute to the quality of our roman nomismata i could have done without at that moment he held up a hand showing thumb and all fingers you give five this many of gold five i clapped a hand to my forehead i am not a rich man a humiliating thing for the emperor of the romans to have to say but true i can give you two i did not know how much money myakes had nor what he could spare auriabedass fine features assumed a look of tragedy that might have suited him for one of euripides dramas is not enough oh my no he said you not pay five you stay very very ugly oh my yes three then i said i tell you i am not made out of gold five auriabedas repeated he had not much greek but being a canny merchant had made certain he knew the numbers in our language you no want pay i no want cut he looked at me you no want pay maybe i say ten soon we were two nomismata apart with a nose even one that left me uglier than i should have been had my own encountered a club i could deny i was physically imperfect and hence debarred from the roman throne without a nose i had no prayer of raising enough support to return to constantinople years of bitter exile had proved as much to me was i to throw away my chance to regain the throne in a quarrel over a couple of nomismata five i said hoping myakes had five nomismata to his name auriabedas beamed at me i fix you he said you be ugly but you not have to fuck in dark like i bet now he cocked his head to one side seeing if that shot went home as indeed it did not since arriving at kherson had i taken a woman in broad daylight come to the monastery tomorrow i told him i will pay you if myakes had not the money i knew whom to rob myakes proved to have the money he put it in my hands the only question he asked was this fellows not a mountebank i dont think so i said if he were he would boast more about how wonderful he was and how hed never had any trouble with this surgery and how everyone to whom hes ever set a knife has come out of it handsome as a pagan god a man who tells me straight out ill still be ugly after he cuts strikes me as an honest man having weighed that myakes nodded maybe youre right emperor sounds like youve got a decent chance anyways one thing more he did not would not say to let him know i understood it without his words i said it for him as it had occurred to me the night before besides being as i am what do i have to lose his jaw worked he glanced down at the floor of the xenodokheion but when his eyes returned to mine he nodded once more if i was to be emperor again i had to have a nose i had not told auriabedas at what hour to come to the monastery from sunrise on i paced back and forth nervous as a cat trying to watch three mouseholes at the same time i was beginning to wonder if he would come when a little past noon he did you go outside he said pointing need very much see what i do out we went myakes walking a pace or two behind us sizing up the man from india when he did not say anything or try to dissuade me from my course i concluded he had decided as i had that the fellow at least thought he knew what he was doing auriabedas sat me down on a large stone the wind was blowing off the sea so the stink of fish was missing from the air by then i noticed its absence more than its presence auriabedas gave me a small jar drink he said undoing the stopper wine and poppy i cut you hurt not so much i drank the stuff had a muzzy taste to it after a while the world began to look dimmer than it had an effect the poppy has on the eyes i yawned i felt sleepy detached almost floating away from myself from his little wooden case auriabedas drew the knife he had shown me in the tavern needle and thread some linen rags for bandages a couple of hollow wooden tubes each one thicker than my little finger and absurdly a penandink set he leaned forward touching me with surprising delicacy to measure the exact size of the wound he aimed to repair then inking his pen he drew on my forehead the shape of skin he intended to cut out and fold over the hole in the center of my face it looks like youre drawing a leaf myakes told him he being able to see the shape i was trying to discern from sense of touch alone leaf oh yes auriabedas said for center of nose bottom and for sides you understand he touched the wings of flesh around his nostrils to show what he meant then he looked at myakes seeming troubled as he did so i cut i hurt i make pain you are understanding this oh yes i need mans to hold not one man two mans three mans maybeso more mans not have here i held up a hand once moved it seemed to stay in place of its own accord auriabedas by god and the virgin mother of god i swear i shall not move as you cut me do what needs to be done i shall endure it the troubled look did not leave his face you say this now what you do once i start cut that very very different i tell you you hear me i hear you i answered i shall not move i tell you do you hear me i folded my arms across my chest and tilted my head up so he would have the best possible light by which to work begin he began myakes brother elpidios if somebody told me about it and i wasnt there to see it with my own eyes id call him a liar to his face you know about poppy juice dont you ah i thought as much what it does is it makes bad horrible pain seem like plain horrible pain thats all it does i had some after they put my eyes out i guess i know well justinian he just sat there like he was a marble statue except to breathe he never twitched not even once he didnt scream he didnt yell he didnt even hiss he never once tried knocking auriabedass hand away no i take it back justinian wasnt just like a marble statue marble doesnt bleed if you could stand it it was fascinating to watch me id seen enough battlefields so it didnt bother me too bad the little brown man made the first cuts right above the top of justinians mustache when justinian didnt flinch he sort of muttered to himself and kept on making little cuts till that whole stretch was raw meat once he was happy hed chopped justinian up enough there he started cutting away at the leaf hed drawn on his forehead he cut it from the bottom up i suppose so the blood wouldnt drip on the line in a place where he hadnt cut yet once hed cut a section he had to slide the knife under it to free it from the flesh underneath not that youve got a lot of flesh between the skin of your forehead and the bone there after a while he had the whole leaf free he gave it a halftwist at the bottom so it would still be skin side out when he put it over the hole where justinians nose used to be id wondered how he was going to manage that he knew what he was doing all right justinian hadnt made a mistake there he sewed the leaf to the raw meat at the very base of what would be the new nose justinian didnt wiggle for that either blood in both auriabedas said blood join blood oh yes all good justinian does a fine job of writing down the funny way he talked i can hear it in my head even if i havent much thought of it over the years between then and now id wondered what his little wooden tubes were for he put them into justinians nose or what was going to be his nose to give shape to his nostrils then he did some more sewing and finished bandaging justinians face by then with all the rags there and more rags around where hed sliced that leafshaped flap out of justinians forehead the little brown fellow had wrapped him up good when auriabedas was all done he turned to me he was all smiles now he have nose he said in his bad greek hope it good nose think it good nose oh yes him brave man never see more braver oh very no how you say deserve good nose thank you justinian said justinian it hurt mother of god how it hurt when the executioner slashed my tongue and cut off my nose the pain was also very bad but those two cuts were inflicted quickly and once they had been made my body could turn immediately to the business of healing here auriabedas not only cut once but kept on cutting and digging and prodding and poking and then at last sewing i was glad for the wine with poppy juice but do not think it did much against my suffering any man not dead would have suffered as a result of what the small brown trader did to me two things helped sustain me while he cut first i had given him my oath i would neither pull away nor try to stop him while he worked if a man will not tell god the truth to whom will he tell it and second when the executioner had cut me it was with the express purpose of keeping me from ever regaining the imperial throne every time auriabedass knife sliced into my flesh every time he drove needle and thread through me he brought me that much closer to reclaiming what was rightfully mine for that i would have endured the pangs of hell much less surgery i do not know how long it all took when at last it was over auriabedas gave me more of the drugged wine to drink again it did not take away my pain though for a little while it made that pain seem almost as if it were happening to s omeone else not to me while the little man from india was wiping his knife and needle on a scrap of cloth and returning them to the small box he wore in place of a belt pouch myakes asked me can you get up emperor i think so i answered and then proceeded to prove myself right as i had after i was mutilated i tasted rusty blood in my mouth less this time than before though the bandages barely let me see i turned back toward the monastery and toward the xenodokheion where i had spent no not spent squandered so much time help me back i told my faithful companion now well see how bad the fever gets if i spent a stretch out of my head and ravinga so much the better i thought i should be hardpressed to deny that auriabedas earned his five nomismata rather than cutting me and leaving my recovery to the will of god he came back to the monastery at first daily and then every other day until my healing was well advanced changing my bandages and putting ointment on the wounds he had inflicted the pain the first two or three times he changed the bandages especially the first as a result of all the blood that had dried on them was almost as bad as during the surgery but the wounds healed more cleanly than i had expected perhaps the ointment he favored a mixture of boiled butter and honey had some special virtue to it i have since tried to interest roman physicians in this blend but if galen or oribasios failed to speak of a medicament in glowing terms they refuse to admit it could be of any value nor is a mere imperial command enough to change their opinion myakes would always stay close by while auriabedas did what he had to do with me after the little brown man peeled off the latest set of bandages i would ask how do i look today the first few times i put the question myakes pretended he did not hear it which i took for something less than a good sign but after a week or ten days when scabs had formed over the raw wounds in my forehead and at the base of my nose he began to look thoughtful rather than carefully blank you know emperor he said one day it might not be so bad a few days after that triumph i reached two more milestones auriabedas approached me with a small knife i need to cut stitches take out them he said flesh grow good to flesh oh yes not need stitches no more oh no i submitted to his ministrations the feel of the thread sliding out through my flesh as he drew it forth with a pair of tongs was strange and repellent but soon over having accomplished that auriabedas bade me splash warm water on the lower part of my face over and over again to loosen the dried blood gluing his little wooden tubes to my flesh then he used the tongs to pull the tubes free more blood this fresh not dry followed since he took it as a matter of course i did as well and as i expected from his manner the flow soon stopped he tapped at the thin layer of flesh above the former position of one of the tubes when it held its shape under his prodding he looked pleased you have nose good as i can make he said proudly i am glad to hear it i answered how good a nose it truly was i did not yet know but for myakes increasingly hopeful comments i had not yet found indeed i had not yet sought a mirror or still water in which i could view myself reasoning it would be wisest to wait until i was more nearly healed before doing so but i reckoned the day when auriabedas having taken the bandages from my forehead did not replace them with new ones as a sign that my healing had advanced far enough a monastery was not the ideal place in which to seek a mirror the monks being by the very nature of the lives they had chosen for themselves opposed to the notion of adornment and ornamentation of the body i knew a place however where that notion was embraced rather than opposed and so from the xenodokheion i took myself off to the brothel where i had been in the habit of easing my lusts when those grew too strong to be ignored the guard standing outside was not the same fellow who had been there when i began patronizing the establishment nor his immediate successor either yet he had been there long enough to recognize me which for a moment he failed to do as i came round the corner youve youve changed he managed when i walked up to him i hope so i answered he held the door open for me as i went inside as that first guard had so many years before from that day to this one i had not shown my mutilated face there in daylight the women lounging within exclaimed in surprise first at seeing me there with the sun in the sky and then on account of my changed aspect what did you do they asked over and over again i explained what i had done some of them nodded some of them made disgusted noises may i see myself please i asked i came here for the loan of a mirror that was in fact the only reason for which i had come not having had the crust to borrow no to take more money from myakes so soon after paying auriabedas several of the whores had small mirrors which they used to darken their eyelids and paint their cheeks and lips with red i looked now in one now in another the great scab on my forehead remained looking as if i had fallen from a horse onto my face i tried to imagine it gone replaced by a smooth pale scar but i studied it less closely than my nose as auriabedas had said that was still ugly a far cry from the proud prominence i had once borne it looked as if someone had smashed it with a rock and done a particularly fine job of flattening it but it looked like a nose if a damaged one not a great gaping hole in the center of my face and then to my astonishment one of the women took me upstairs to celebrate my improvement in the most enjoyable way possible i cant give you anything i told her before not afterwards to avoid any possible misunderstandings she shrugged which as she had just got out of her shift i found inspiring not many men coming in today she said dont worry about it and so i did not worry about it go to any business long enough prove yourself a good customer and you will get favors to which someone walking in off the street for the first time could not hope to aspire afterwards i strode through the streets of kherson looking at the town with new eyes letting the townsfolk see me with my new face not all of them recognized me which i found almost as satisfying as the girl had been i went down to the harbor myakes who was rolling barrels of what else salt fish onto a ship waved to me i waved back one of the laborers with whom he was working walked by and casually slapped him on the shoulder i envied him and envy him to this day that easy contact among equals it is something i have never known as prince and then emperor i was set above the rest of the world after leontios mutilated me and exiled me to kherson the rest of the world by contrast was set above me having seen life from above and below i own to preferring the former of life at the same level as everyone else i am ignorant coming down close to the sea i stared south across it how many times i did that in my years of exile i could not begin to say for a long while there though that sea sundering me from constantinople had seemed wide as the unending ocean that flows on forever past the last land of the known world now all at once i felt the imperial city to be barely below the horizon so that if i went up into a high place i might see the great dome of the church of the holy wisdom revealed in all its splendor and ingenuity this was not so of course but the feeling had a reality of its own i had never left off saying i was emperor of the romans not through all the weary empty years in kherson now all at once i felt like the emperor again as if robbed of my throne only yesterday not years before i will go back i said fiercely enough to startle a tern walking near me perhaps in the hope i would throw it a scrap of fish it shall be mine again the tern mewed and flew away and i i started back to the xenodokheion i had not gone far before i met the tudun coming back to his residence after having been away on some business or other escorting him were a double handful of his fellow khazars swarthy stocky men in furs and leather some of them glanced at me then looked away i was not extraordinary enough to be worth staring at what a triumph the tuduns eyes started to slide away from me too but then they snapped back you justinian he said almost accusingly yes i am justinian i agreed my voice was proud what happen to your nose he asked not gone no more he frowned no wait i hear you have someone cut on it thats right rumor was ahead of me then i wondered if auriabedas had been drinking his way through my five nomismata boasting of his surgical prowess in every dockside tavern if he got more business from that i hope he did as well by the rest of his patients as he did by me the tudun was not stupid and knew a surprising amount about roman ways you have nose again you able to be emperor again romans not laugh at you now you want to be emperor again he stared at me as if daring me to deny it i did not deny it not quite i had not thought so far ahead i told him even if i would not have said the same thing while taking a holy oath before god i had a chance to not be ugly not to be so ugly any more and i took it he frowned you come here you promise you dont try and become emperor again you say you live here quiet not cause nobody no trouble i have not done anything differently since i got this new nose of sorts i answered then i held up one finger no i take that back ive bedded a woman without the rooms being so black she could not see my face he snorted a couple of his bodyguards understood enough greek to translate that into their own language which may be even uglier than that of the sklavenoi for their companions the barbarians laughed one of them pointed to my face and then down to my crotch he said something else that engendered more laughter didnt cut that off was my guess as to its meaning woman i dont care nothing about the tudun said snapping his fingers to emphasize the point trouble i care about not want none between romans and khazars i tell you this long time gone you remember i remember i had tried to stir up trouble for the wicked usurpers first leontios then apsimaros from the moment i arrived at kherson because of my mutilation i had failed now like lazarus my hopes were reborn the tudun pointed at me you raise trouble any kind even smallest bit he held his hands close together to show how small a small bit could bei tell emperor tiberius see if he still want you to stay here that brought me up short i had not known apsimaros well i refused to call him tiberius even to myself before my throne was stolen from me and word of his deeds that reached kherson was bound to be sketchy and inaccurate but he unlike leontios seemed to be no sluggard and to have a fitting concern for maintaining his place usurped though that was why else would he have sent bardanes philippikos into exile on the strength of a dream you hear me the tudun asked you understand me oh yes i assured him i hear you and i understand you very well indeed i understood i would have to be careful as i planned my return to constantinople i had understood from the beginning that i would be returning to constantinople still looking at me in the most dubious fashion the tudun went on his way i for my part returned to the monastery a monk not a man i knew waited in the xenodokheion emperor i greet you he exclaimed and prostrated himself before me on the guesthouse floor no one not myakes not barisbakourios not his brother had prostrated himself before me in kherson because of that and because i was just arrived from seeing the tudun and listening to his warning to me not to act the part of the emperor i stared down at this fellow in some suspicion wondering if he might not be a stalking horse intended to goad me into publicly claiming the imperial dignity and thereby giving the tudun an excuse to move against me get up i told him and then had an inspiration in lands attached to a monastery all men are equal before god he rose his face wreathed in smiles emperor how glad i am to see that your reputation for piety is nothing less than the truth if he was a traitor he was an enthusiastic traitor who are you i demanded i did not reach for the knife i wore but my hand knew with the bodys knowledge where it was my name is cyrus emperor he said smiling more broadly yet if a traitor genial as well as enthusiastic i have sailed from amastris to kherson for among other reasons the pleasure and honor of making your acquaintance and why is that i was determined to play my own game at my own speed if this cyrus proved the tuduns agent he would get nothing from me he looked around although the two of us were alone in the large hall dramatically lowering his voice he answered because i have seen in the stars that you are destined to rule the roman empire once more again i did not know how to take that a man in the tuduns pay would say the same thing seeking to entice me and even if cyrus was sincere i still did not know how to respond to his words that one can foresee the future in the stars violates the proved fact of gods omnipotence and for that reason is condemned by the holy church but cyrus was far from the only churchman to have dabbled in such waters leontioss puppetmaster paul also claimed to have seen in the heavens his patrons rise cyrus suddenly seized my hands in his emperor have faith in me he said when i sailed from amastris i had no idea how what i had seen might come to pass you having suffered such cruel injuries at the hands of your foes and here i meet you and find you he cast about for a word and found onerestored is it a miracle gently i touched my new nose flat aye ugly aye a nose unquestionably how to explain to a monk i had received it thanks to the arts of a little brown man who scoffed at the notion of christs being the son of god or even of there being but one god i did not explain if cyrus wanted to reckon it a miracle i would let him when do you intend to go back to amastris i asked go back he shook his head in puzzlement emperor i do not intend to go back i aim to make myself a place here and to aid you in recovering your throne in every way i can once that is done i shall return to romania but not until then if he spoke the truth he easily passed the test i had set him over the next few days i learned from longshoremen that he had indeed disembarked from a ship from amastris he was an abbot there i hear one of them said which explained how cyrus had got permission from his superior to abandon his monastery for another or rather that he had needed no ones permission oh he might have asked his bishop but then again he might not have too abbots being largely autonomous within the ecclesiastical hierarchy in kherson he lived as a monk among other monks if taking orders when he had once given them troubled him he showed no sign he spoke more openly about my return to constantinople than i did sometimes he did so within the hearing of khazar soldiers i saw how they glared if he was an agent of the tuduns either they did not know it or they made a better show of hypocrisy than i suspected to lie within the abilities of such barbarians i was convinced and so little by little was myakes who initially had distrusted cyrus even more than i had hes the straight goods emperor he said one day when we were drinking wine in a tavern i wouldnt have believed it but he is nice to have a man of god whos on our side seven days a week yes i said drawing the word out into a hiss kallinikos had been perfectly happy to work with me and to bless leontios in my placea and to bless apsimaros in leontioss place if i regained the throne no doubt he would bless me againa for a while barisbakourios and stephen i more often thought of him that way than as salibas stephen being the good greek name it was walked into the tavern they hurried over to the table where myakes and i sat that monk of yours emperor hes something barisbakourios exclaimed you listen to him the devils of hell already have apsimaros on their forks and theyre toasting him over the fire his eyes glowed he was ready for anything was barisbakourios the best of the handful who had rallied to my side in kherson people were listening to cyrus too and nodding at everything he said stephen added had his brother gone against me i think he would have too though lacking the spark of barisbakourios he was brave and because his brother was loyal not all can lead and without followers a leader is no more than a voice that crieth in the wilderness were any khazars there i asked no no khazars but a couple of the rich merchants bodyguards were hanging around the edge of the crowd barisbakourios answered the longer they listened the unhappier they got theyre afraid of apsimaros the fools what they were afraid of was the wrath of the roman empire which even when the empire was headed by a usurper so little roman that he had to change his name to have one fit for putting on his nomismata was nothing to be despised i also took the bodyguards unhappiness to mean that their masters would be unhappy when cyruss words were reported to them and very possibly that the tudun would be unhappy too if he was odds were that cyrus truly did support me my other choice in looking at cyrus was to reckon that he sought to incite me to actions by which the khazars or the rich merchants whom i had not previously considered could justify taking my head the more i pondered that the less likely it seemed the merchants reach did not extend to amastris whence cyrus had indubitably come and if the khazars intended taking my head they could do it they needed no justification to the contrary if they did do it they had no need to fear the wrath of the roman empire again to the contrary apsimaros would shower them with presents on learning they had killed me which by ineluctable logic meant cyrus was unlikely to be an agent and likely in fact to have seen in the stars that i would indeed return in triumph to constantinople which in turn meant or probably meant i could trust him one thing an emperor soon learns is that men he can truly trust are few and far between writing out the pathway my reasoning followed takes longer than the reasoning itself did to pass through my mind after taking only a couple of breaths i raised my mug of wine in salute to cyrus i said to cyrus myakes barisbakourios and stephen drank with me even with cyrus vigorously espousing my cause it advanced more slowly than i would have liked having spent so long in kherson i felt every added day like another heavy stone dropped onto my back the first white hairs appeared in my beard while i spent time doing nothing in exile not all the time passed to no good purpose the scabs crusting my forehead finally fell away and the raw pink scar under them began to weather on being exposed to sun and air a year having passed after the indian cut me the scar was no longer pink but a shade only a little paler than the rest of my skin when i visited that brothel none of the whores there hesitated to join with me during the day and they no longer charged me twice the going rate i was no longer so conspicuous as i had been this was true of my physical appearance in other ways though cyruss vigorous advocacy of me and my cause was making me more conspicuous than i had been i was walking into kherson early one morning when a couple of khazars on ponies came trotting down toward the monastery where i had stayed so long recognizing me they reined in one of them said you come with us the tudun is to see you now i ended up walking into town between their horses in all the time i had spent at kherson the tudun had never before honored me by inviting me into his residence to do that would have been to acknowledge i was worthy of honor nor was he in truth honoring me now it was more that i had become a nuisance to him the building to which i was conveyed while made from the local stone had the spare lines that said it dated from the early days of the roman empire perhaps from the first couple of hundred years after our lord walked the earth as a man i wondered if the governors the emperors of those times had sent to this distant outpost of roman soil reckoned their tenure here as much an exile as i did mine the khazars who had led me to the residence turned me over to the guards standing in front the halfbored halfalert demeanor of the latter put me in mind of the fellows who had stood outside my favorite brothel down through the years their boredom fell away though on their taking charge of me rather than doors the tuduns residence had a carpet hanging over the entranceway no doubt to imitate the tents to which the governor was more accustomed than he was to permanent housing inside as i soon discovered this imitation of the nomadic life continued more carpets lay all over the floors making my feet feel as if they were stepping on thick grass instead of the chairs and couches the roman governors had used cushions whose covers were as fantastically embroidered as the rugs did duty for furnishings the lamps stank of butter in lieu of a throne or other high seat the tudun lolled atop a mound of cushions i looked around finding none provided for me having contemplated remaining upright so i could look down on him i decided it were wiser to sit he having a position i acknowledged and i possessing none to which he admitted you have friends making noises over you he said ominously friends making noises about emperor merchants not like he said nothing about the khagan of the khazars which i found interesting but if he was to govern the town he had to pay attention to its prominent folk as well as to his distant master i answered his first comment i am not responsible for what my friends say they think i was treated unjustly i thought the same but again decided wisdom lay in keeping silent on that looking up at him i went on have any of your spies ever reported that i claimed i would go back to the imperial city and regain the crown he did not bother denying he had set spies on me they not say that no i breathed an invisible sigh of relief for i had said it but evidently only among men who genuinely backed my cause his words also confirmed cyruss loyalty to me still he held the power here and i had trouble bearing up under his gaze after a pause he said but your friends they say what you want yes yes indeed i cannot control what my friends say i repeated some say one thing some say another as is true of all men but is it just to condemn me for words i cannot control would you want anyone to do that to you those narrow eyes glinted he jabbed a thumb at his chest i never want to be emperor of romans at constantinople never ah but suppose your friends started saying you wanted to be khagan of the khazars i shot back it would not be true would you want ibouzeros gliabanos to judge you from their loose talk i never want to be khagan either he said but that was not the point and he was clever enough to realize it from atop that mound of cushions he stared down at me at last grudgingly he said maybe he spoke to the guards in the language of the khazars which has always put me in mind of the noises an egg makes frying in a pan without a word to me the guards gestured out toward the curtain they did not follow on my departing the tudun having finished with me i was no longer of any interest to them i reported my conversation with the khazar governor to my comrades myakes ever the most cautious of us said we have to go easy for a while if we get the khazars and the merchants angry at us we lose everything and fast thats so but theres such a thing as being too careful too barisbakourios returned he was ready to sail for constantinople that day or any day so long as the ship held him and me and perhaps his brother as well though i suspect he would have done without stephen at a pinch cyrus said the truth of your right to rule emperor is no less than the truth of the lord and like the truth of the lord it must be proclaimed to those who know it not sometimes the truth of the lord is proclaimed loudly sometimes quietly i said as the holy scriptures say to every thing there is a season now is our season for quiet ripening when the harvest is ripe we shall reap it cyrus and barisbakourios protested but recognizing me as emperor of the romans recognized also that they were bound to obey me and so for the next few months they were less vehement about putting forward my claim regardless of how proper they knew it was the tudun did not summon me again during that time proving he was to some degree lulled but what i had asked of my followers however necessary it seemed went against their grain and mine little by little almost without knowing it cyrus and barisbakourios once more began to speak of my returning to constantinople and to the throne waiting there had the tudun sought to silence them when they first began this i should have eased their eagerness again but he did not and so i did not and so when one day cyrus stood half preaching to half haranguing a crowd of lazy loafers who like lazy loafers everywhere took their entertainment where they could find it he cried out in the eyes of god this apsimaros and leontios before him were and are base usurpers surely doomed to damnation and eternal torment at the clawed hands of satan and his demons here before me stands the rightful emperor of the romans is it not so emperor justinian i turned to the crowd and as if seized by something more than myself shouted in a great voice yes it is so every word i was and am and will be emperor of the romans and will return to constantinople to wear the crown once more how the loafers cheered myakes how i wish he wouldve kept his mouth shut brother elpidios yes that means i was happy enough in kherson i had a place to sleep i had work that wasnt too easy and wasnt too hard either i had plenty to eat i had plenty to drink if i wanted anything more i had places where i could go i didnt go to the same place justinian used but kherson had plenty of them never known a town full of sailors that didnt but thats not what im talking about not this time i wish justinian would have kept his mouth shut because opening it drew notice to him that he didnt want wed been making plans the lot of us we knew what we wanted to do we just werent quite ready to do it yet and doing it with people keeping an eye on us was ten times tougher than if wed been able to go about our business with nobody the wiser justinian though he was never one for doing things by halves whats that you say brother youve seen as much i hope you have what with spending so much time reading his book to me holding back after the tudun warned him it ate at him he couldnt stand it no matter how plain the need was afterwards he felt better he was all happy and smiling and lazy like hed just had a woman after doing without for a long time what you dont know what im talking about oh thats right so you dont poor fellow well youre a holy man brother elpidios and god loves you thatsa very fine but you lay a woman you can get in trouble too its not all fun she can give you a drippy pipe you can put a baby in her even if you dont put a baby in her her brothers and her father are liable to find out youve spread her legs and then come after you with clubs or maybe knives say youve been bragging that helps em find out and when justinian shouted out that he was the rightful emperor and he aimed to get his crown back if you wouldnt call that bragging brother elipidios what would you call it justinian iwaited to see what the tudun would do after i proclaimed my intention of regaining that which i had inherited from my ancestors what the tudun did rather to my surprise was nothing perhaps he was weaker than i had thought or than he had presented himself as being or perhaps the khagan of the khazars had sent him orders to moderate his treatment of me i set barisbakourios to investigate which of those was so but the tudun was not the only power in kherson which like any frontier town was rife with alliances running in more than one direction the older families there looked more strongly toward constantinople than toward the khazars they may also have remembered that apsimaros before usurping the throne had been an officer of the fleet and so more inclined to use it than le ontios would have been not that leontios was ever much inclined to do anything i was spooning up the inevitable inescapable saltfish porridge in the xenodokheion one morning when stephen burst in all sweaty and disheveled emperor he said theyll be coming for you emperor who will be coming for me i demanded though i already had a fair idea myakes was eating beside me he had been grumbling over my announcing i intended to retake the throne and i did not care to give him the chance to look at me as if to say i told you so even if he was too well trained in subordination to speak the words aloud the whole lot of the bastards stephen said which if imperfectly responsive had more flavor than that porridge of mine he went on theyll kill you if they catch you or else send you back to apsimaros the prominent folk in kherson could muster more force than i could hope to withstand and if by some chance they chose to give me over to apsimaros rather than slaying me themselves he would no doubt make up for their neglect in that matter myakes put down his spoon brought the bowl from which he was eating to his lips and gulped down what remained might as well fill my belly he remarked lord knows when ill get the chance again that being full of homely good sense i imitated his example stephen meanwhile was shifting from foot to foot as if he intended running to the latrine at any moment come on he exclaimed the instant i put down my bowl my brother has horses waiting i had hardly been on a horse since my exile kherson was not a city of such great extent as to make riding needful shanks mare sufficing for all journeys thereabouts but we could not stay in kherson not now i sprang to my feet and followed stephen out of the xenodokheion where i had lived for almost nine years after that day i never saw the place again i should not even have looked back at it had cyrus not chanced to come out of the monastery as i was trotting away and to call after me where are you going emperor stephen had not told me what barisbakourios had in mind doing with the horses he had collected but an answer came to my mind as readily as a sword might come to my hand were going up toward the country of the khazars if the tudun had kept silent after my assertion of my rights perhaps his master was indeed more inclined to friendliness toward me than he had been in the past he could hardly have been less inclined to friendliness toward me than the local leaders of kherson not if they aimed to murder me or betray me to the usurper im with you emperor cyrus said and came running after stephen and myakes and me had i been offered while ruling in constantinople such a horse as one of the beasts barisbakourios had waiting i have no doubt i should have ordered a whipping for the wretch rash enough to insult me so any horse however was better than none and these beasts qualified if barely as any horse i mounted the least disreputable of them and we rode by side streets toward the north gate of kherson the guards there were khazars which probably saved my life had they been khersonites i daresay they would have refused to allow me and my companions to leave the town as it was they shrugged and stood aside out of kherson we rode heading north my first intention had been to ride straight for the court of the khagan of the khazars out there on the immense plain from which the peninsula containing kherson depends like the little ball of flesh hanging at the back of a mans throat having just escaped one danger though i wondered whether i ought to thrust myself at once into another for i would be utterly at the khagans mercy if i arrived at his barbaric court without any sort of invitation on his part when i spoke my doubts aloud the others agreed with them here i know what lets do barisbakourios said lets hole up in doros the people in doros they dont care what anyone else thinks or does before coming to kherson i had never heard of doros by then however i had been in exile for a quarter of my life the town up by the neck of the peninsula i said and then nodded yes thats a good idea well do it like kherson doros is formally under the control of the khazars in kherson that formal control has a basis in reality the khagan making a profit from the port the folk of doros formerly derived their income from tolls on trade going into and out of the peninsula the khagans of the khazars have for some years been strong enough to forbid them that such income as they have these days as best i can tell they derive from taking in one anothers washing having impoverished them the khazars no longer bother taking an interest in their affairs they are a comely people the folk of doros tall and straight and some of them fairer of hair and of skin than i that much i had known from meeting in taverns their traders who came down to kherson what i had not known was how nervous being around many of them would make me those of them who spoke greek did so with an accent almost identical to that of apsimaros on reflection that was not surprising he was of german blood of some sort and the folk of doros it turns out are goths the emperor for whom i was named the first justinian conquered the ostrogoths a century and a half ago we romans have had few dealings with the visigoths of the western iberia also called spain since they ousted us from it while my greatgreatgrandfather was distracted with more urgent wars against the persians and avars and arabs it is said though whispered actually that he had more intimate dealings with them than those of war siring a bastard on a woman of their people a truth the women of my family no doubt wish the men would forget myakes see brother elpidios i already told you about that long time gone i know whats what i do justinian in ancient days the goths ruled much of the plain over which the khazars now roam the folk of doros are a remnant of those who did not accompany the rest on their journey to the richer lands of the roman empire they have improved over their ancestors in that they are now orthodox christians rather than cleaving to the vile and abominable heresy of the arians barisbakourios had brought money enough to secure us lodgings in a tavern dirtier smellier and far more expensive than the xenodokheion where i had stayed so long how galling it was that i who had formerly commanded the resources of the roman empire should again have been reduced to living off the generosity of my followers barisbakourios now being general of the military district of the opsikion though i can truthfully say i have requited generosity with generosity as i have also requited treason with vengeance more of barisbakourioss money and i think some of myakes as well went into persuading totilas the leader of the goths of doros not to yield me up to the khersonites if they asked that of him the risk there of course was that they might pay him more to surrender me but our bribe did at least raise the stake in the game totilas said i do not want trouble from kherson i do not want trouble from the romans i do not want trouble from the khazars i do not want trouble of any kind i want to stay here undisturbed like a turnip in the ground i thought totilass nose resembled a turnip being large and purple and bulbous well not all of us are turnips some deserve the imperial eagle as emblem but i had to speak him fair lest he use his petty power to harm me noble totilas i want no trouble either but i take it as trouble when evil men band together to kill me or send me in chains to another man who would surely do that all i want is the chance to live in freedom and to take back what is mine god willing i shall not be in your city long god willing indeed acting on the belief that the khagan of the khazars was at the moment not unfavorably inclined toward me the first thing i had done after having arrived at doros was to send stephen otherwise known as salibas to ibouzeros gliabanos entreating him to accept me at his court being of halfkhazar blood stephen could speak to the khagan in his own tongue if stephen brought back word that ibouzeros gliabanos would accept me i purposed leaving doros at once and repairing to his capital on the plain if on the other hand stephen brought word of a refusala i did not know what i should do then the best plan i had was to board ship sail back to constantinople and try to raise a revolution against leontios such a plan might well have succeeded but apsimaros had shown himself more alert than the usurper he had usurped totilas scratched that great root of a nose i do believe i preferred my own as auriabedas had repaired it to the one with which nature had endowed him if you do not stay long maybe there will be no trouble avoiding trouble appeared to be his alpha and omega in life a turnip indeed i thought sure enough the khersonite leaders did send a delegation to doros seeking me sure enough they did offer totilas a bribe to yield me up to them but being most of them tightfisted merchants they offered only a tiny bit more than i had paid i told him if you try to take me i will make as much trouble as i can i will not go quietly in fact i will set fires in my room and all over that building with any kind of wind they will cause you all sorts of trouble having heard him speak i bore down on the word as if i were a magician casting a spell and so i might have been he turned so pale even that nose became for a moment the color of ordinary flesh dont do that he exclaimed christ have mercy dont do that any leader in any town would have had goo d cause to fear incendiarism put that next to totilass fear of trouble and the game was mine ill send those khersonites away with a flea in their ear see if i dont he did they left doros grumbling by all appearances they were unused to having totilas stand up for the independence of his town actually he was not standing up but being propped up but the khersonites did not know that i breathed easier when they rode away bread in doros was as rare as it had been down in kherson as at the latter place salt fish formed the bulk of the diet the goths of doros had their own way of preparing it though mixing it with cabbage halfpickled in sharp vinegar i cannot decide to this day whether that was better or worse than the fish stews of kherson it was however different from them which at first gave the mixture an appeal the stew had long since lost before long though fish and sour cabbage also began to pall kherson made better wine than doros that did not keep me from drinking a good deal of the wine of doros while waiting for stephen to return like my greatgreatgrandfather before me i became infatuated with a big yellowhaired gothic woman a servant at the tavern though not thinking of herself as a prostitute she proved more mercenary than the whores at the brothel i had patronized in kherson since i had little to give her she gave me little all things considered that may well have been for the best even if i would not have said so at the time i fretted and fumed as the days went by and stephen remained out on the plain i want him here i told myakes i dont care if he tells me ibouzeros gliabanos wont even spit on me i just want to know curse it not knowing is what drives you mad not me myakes said sooner or later itll happen you cant do anything about it till then so whats the point of getting in an uproar to myakes who was not in the habit of looking ahead the future seemed small and distant unworthy of special heed i had done nothing but look ahead since the day i came out of my delirium at the xenodokheion in kherson constantinople and the throne beckoned me the khagans response either eased my way toward what i saw or cast a great shadow across it i burned to know which burn as i would god revealed things in the time he desired not the time i desired his will be done but it nearly led to disaster for me after leaving me severely alone once i threatened to do my best to burn down his small ugly fishstinking town totilas summoned me to his house doros was too insignificant to boast any more significant residence for its leader than a hovel somewhat larger than most of the hovels around it uh the khersonites have been here again he said nervously cracking his knuckles this time they say theyll give me twice as much as the last time they were here this was a thinly veiled indeed an unveiled invitation for me to match their offer i would have if i could i knew how much money my followers had not enough i sighed what a pity i said adding this was such a nice little town the last sentence was a great whacking lie but totilas as i had hoped he would caught the past tense contained therein what do you mean was he said his nose going a couple of shades darker what i said i answered you dont think i havent made myself ready for a day like this do you my friends and i have been here for weeks now and made more friends in doros about every other building here has a little jug or barrel of oil hidden away in it try to seize me try to do anything to harm me and my friends and you dont know who all of them are i promise you will go running through the town tipping over those jars and throwing torches into them i have only rarely heard lies so big that did not come from the mouth of a follower of the false prophet i had recruited one count him one follower in doros a certain theophilos who while more clever than foolish paul was not much more clever nor had my henchmen secreted fuel for incendiaries throughout the town but things like the vengeance i had taken on the sklavenoi and my surviving a mutilation that might well have killed me had given me a reputation for singleminded determination and ferocity regardless of whether i had actually done what i claimed totilas knew all too well it was the sort of thing i might do did he have the nerve to call my bluff one glance at him proved he did not his ruddy face went a dirty yellow his dusky nose went pink you are a devil he exclaimed you would not but he thought i would thinking that he was meat for the roasting leave me alone and i shall leave you alone i said seek to betray me to my enemies and you become my enemy that was true if i helped him exaggerate in his mind my capacity to harm my enemiesa good i rose and went back to my lodgings none of the goths of doros tried to stop me for the next several days though men searched frantically through the town every container of oil they found was no doubt added to my account for good measure i sent barisbakourios out to buy more fish oil for some reason no one in doros would sell him any totilas now was not the man to start precipitate action in fact had i not had the misfortune of knowing leontios i might have reckoned totilas the most lethargic man charged with administering any sort of public affairs i had ever met nonetheless he would conclude sooner or later that i was running a bluff when he did his likeliest action averse to taking action as he was would be to sell me to the khersonites did he find the will he could do it i knew that better than he where is stephen the question had been important before now all at once it was vital and on our lips all the time the only variation being barisbakourioss occasional where is salibas i was beginning to fear he had suffered misfortune either on the way to the court of ibouzeros gliabanos at distant atil or perhaps more likely on the way back from that court if ibouzeros gliabanos was not so well disposed to me as i had hoped he might well deem it expedient to expunge from the landscape my envoy to him my landlord grew visibly more distressed at my presence under his leaky roof if his distress did not grow voluble as well as visible this was no doubt because my followers and i made sure to display ourselves well armed before him at frequent intervals but other armed men began displaying themselves too around the tavern where we were staying for the time being they fought shy of doing anything more than displaying themselves that being certain to have caused the trouble totilas dreaded but these matters could not be indefinitely delayed three or four days after beginning to muster his force totilas approached the tavern where i was for all practical purposes besieged i expected this would be a demand for my surrender his coming in person showing more spirit than i had looked for from him myakes said he hasnt got a sword in his hand emperor nor one on his belt either he was right totilas advanced with both his hands held out before him so i could see they were empty and carried not only no sword but no knife either parley he called loudly i want to parley with justinian come ahead i answered not showing myself at a window lest he have a concealed archer awaiting the chance to puncture me cyrus opened the door to admit the leader of doros once inside totilas said justinian my men and i are holding a certain salibas who also goes by the name of stephen hes one of your followers not so yes hes mine i said as steadily as i could barisbakourios looked as if an arrow from a hidden archer had just pierced him if totilas had seized stephen he was indeed showing more initiative than the amount with which i had credited him totilas licked his lips he says he says he is coming back from seeing the khagan of the khazars thats true i told him and so it was he also saysa totilas licked his lips he also says the khagan of the khazars who is my overlord wants you to go to his court as fast as you can will you go he sounded pathetically eager bringing his next words out all in a rush will you please go that way i can tell the khersonites the truth when i say you are not here any more and they will go away and leave me in peace and there will be thank god no trouble in kherson so will you go how strange to hear him begging me to do that which i most wanted to do in all the world theophilos let out a whoop half the town must have heard not that that is anything remarkable considering what a miserable little town doros is barisbakourios no longer looked wounded by that time however i had learned better than to take anything this side of gods holy truths on faith i said let stephen come here if i hear this from his lips i will go thank you justinian god bless you justinian to my surprise totilas embraced me before lumbering out of the tavern he shouted to his men something in which i heard stephens name but i followed no more than that the rest being in the gothic tongue but he soon proved to have been telling the truth for stephen came running in with us after embracing his brother he turned to me and spoke in great excitement emperor ibouzeros gliabanos wants you with him he cant wait to have you there he says youre the perfect counterweight to apsimaros does he to stephen that was good news unalloyed to me it meant the khazar intended using me as a piece on a game board i laughed i intended using him the same way i think ibouzeros gliabanos and i shall get on very well indeed i said lets go find out whether im righ t of the journey to the khagans court i shall say little little having occurred worthy of mention i shall note however that while riding up the narrow isthmus of land joining the peninsula on which kherson lies to the plains north of it i was able to see the black sea on my left and and the maiotic bay on my right which strikes me as interesting enough to record here those plains themselves are also noteworthy endless undulating grass as far as the eye can reach in any direction in europe in anatolia land has limits and variety forests and mountains and meadows and cultivated fields not there the plains are vast past any possible imagining and reach far beyond the relatively small stretch of them i traveled i did not know whether to be awed or afraid of such unbounded immensity every now and then as we traveled east toward atil the town in which the khagan kept his court we would pass a band of khazars when i first saw such a band i marveled that the nomads had not overrun the entire world for it overspread an enormous area with herds of cattle sheep and horses with men riding round those herds and from one of them to another and with the felt tents in which dwelt those riders and their women and children but there were as i discovered surprisingly few of those tents in each band of khazars and each band required an enormous stretch of territory on which to pasture the animals by which it lived constantly dealing with the herd trains the nomads for martial struggle in a way a farmers life cannot match they are ever in the saddle and accustomed since childhood to riding through gaps in the herds and cutting out groups from among them tactics they also apply in war in war though their forces while fierce are also small which allows their neighbors to survive barisbakourios and stephen speaking their language we were able to ask for food and shelter in the khazars tents the food was of the simplest sort meat both roasted and sundried curds and little flat wheatcakes in place of bread a proper bake oven being too heavy to transport on their constant travels for drink they made a liquor not from grapes as we do or even from barley like the barbarous sklavenoi but from the milk of their own mares to a man used to wine the stuff is thin and sour but it has the same virtue as does wine and when having drunk to excess in the evening one wakes the next morning it makes one regret such overindulgence even more vigorously than does wine the khazars sleep and expect their guests to sleep wrapped in furs and carpets on the ground this gave me no difficulty whatever as we were leaving a band one morning an old man notable because so few of the nomads live to be old said something to barisbakourios who turned to me he is surprised because most travelers he has seen like sleeping softer tell him that after nine years of a thin pallet on the stone floor of the monastery xenodokheion i am sleeping softer i answered with a laugh barisbakourios translated that for the old man he laughed too displaying teeth worn down almost to his gums from years of gnawing at leathery strips of dried meat as i have said each khazar band took up a wide area of the plain but the spaces between bands were wider yet most of the time while we were journeying to atil we might have been the only men on the face of the earth we hunted partridges and pheasants myakes proved to be as good with the bow as anyone else in our band which made him swagger above due measure myakes idid nothing of the sort brother elpidios and i havent the slightest idea why justinian says i did just because i managed to put one right into the eye of a partridge two days running i suppose nobody else came close to that not in all the time we were on the road not that there was any road mind you how could anyone blame me if i let people know about it the sin of pride brother oh no not me what do you mean why not becausea that is becausea what does justinian say next maybe it wont be about me justinian from doros to atil is a journey of upwards of a month even for men riding steadily as my companions and i did in all that time the landscape changed little we could have ridden east for another month from atil and it would have changed little having departed doros we could have ridden west rather than east and the landscape would have changed little we could also have ridden north again it would have changed little if i harp on the vastness of the plains north of the black sea it is indeed because of the strong impression that vastness left on me at last coming to atil now that was a change the town the khazars have made for their capital lies close by the northern shore of the caspian or hyrcanian sea a body of water known to us romans more in legend than in fact though in the persian wars after the death of the justinian for whom i am named one roman general did reach it by way of the caucasus built a small fleet and ravaged persian commerce on it a great river the volga flows south into the caspian sea nearing the sea its stream breaks up into a number of channels as the egyptian nile does in what is called the delta on account of its shape atil straddles one of these channels the district to the west being larger than that to the east though less populous the khagans residence is in the western part of the town calling atil a town now that i think on it stretches the meaning of the word in many ways it more closely resembles the encampments of the khazar bands in which i had sometimes passed a night on the journey from doros only a few of the dwellings are of timber or of mud brick far more of the inhabitants dwell in tents like those of their nomadic fellows these tents however do not wander over the plains the natives making their living for the most part by agriculture they sow crops for miles around in the rich soil of the volga delta and bring in a good harvest but enough of that on our reaching atil stephen brought us to the khagans palace if a building made of clay and sticks may be dignified by such an appellation servants in coats and tunics of fine wool took charge of us and led us to ibouzeros gliabanos khagan of the khazars rather than a throne the khagan used as his high seat a gilded cart ornamented with a clothofgold canopy another remembrance i suppose of the nomadic life most of the khazars lead the khagans servitors spoke to barisbakourios who translated their words into greek we are to prostrate ourselves before the lord of this land he and the rest of my companions went to their bellies without hesitation i remained upright ibouzeros gliabanos spoke barisbakourios and stephen who understood him rose the others soon followed their example he spoke again and again barisbakourios served as interpreter he asks why you did not go down he is the khagan of the khazars i am the emperor of the romans i answered i daresay ibouzeros gliabanos took that to mean i assumed we were equal in rank if he did i did not correct him in fact though i reckoned myself his superior the only equals emperors of the romans have ever acknowledged are the persian kings and their successor to power on our eastern frontier the arabs miscalled commanders of the faithful german kings barbarous khagans they have more pretensions than true quality ibouzeros gliabanos spoke again barisbakourios looked relieved he says you are a man of spirit he says you would not have come to him if you were not a man of spirit tell him i thank him for inviting me to his court i replied studying the khagan as i did so he was younger than i had expected being not far from my own age he had a broad rather swarthy face black hair and a thin straggling black beard his nose was low and flattish not much more impressive than the one auriabedas had restored to me his eyes narrow and dark seemed clever he said you have endured much to claim the rule still henceforth i shall omit mention of barisbakourioss translations which sometimes slowed our speech together to a crawl it is mine i said simply he nodded you speak as one who rules should speak and yeta his voice trailed away he looked sly i understood him well enough i was not the only man to claim the title and the other sat in constantinople while i stood here in atil it is mine i repeated in times gone by the khagan of the khazars aided the emperor of the romans herakleios who was my greatgreatgrandfather against the persians we romans and you khazars have fought together against the arabs we are allies by interest and allies by blood in fact is it not so that my greatgreatgrandfather once sent a portrait of his daughter to the man who was then khagan offering a marriage alliance my opinion at the time was that this spoke more of herakleioss desperation than anything else but i hoped ibouzeros gliabanos would not see it the same way ibouzeros gliabanos turned to a man who stood at the right side of his cart and spoke to him in a low voice although barisbakourios leaned forward as far as he could without falling over he was unable to make out what the khagan said or the counselors reply ibouzeros gliabanos then spoke directly to me this marriage alliance was never made but it was offered which shows how close your people and mine have been i hid my disappointment what a boon for my hopes it would have been had the khagan proved my distant cousin he spoke again to the man beside him who hurried away presently the fellow returned with a square of gilded wood inset with precious stones and pearls in the center of the square was the portrait of a young woman in imperial regalia as an icon of the virgin is labeled mother of god so her image was entitled eudokia daughter of herakleios from the treasury ibouzeros gliabanos said while i stared at the image of my greatgreataunt whom i had never known she was not herakleioss daughter by my greatgreatgrandmother but rather by martina through the incestuous connection he formed with her in his later years i should have disapproved of her for that but here so far from home she did not seem such a distant relation after all the khagan looked from me to her image and back again i thought i remembered we had this old picture it proves what i told you i said boldly yes he said he and his counselor spoke again the counselor left once more returning this time with one of the handful of old men i had seen among the khazars the khagan asked him what he knew of the picture he answered in a quavering voice only a little above a whisper so i had to wait until ibouzeros gliabanos spoke directly to me once more he says the reason there was no marriage is that the khagan of those days was murdered before the maiden arrived we know of such things in my family too i said remembering my grandfathers death in the sicilian bathhouse for the sake of the past then and for the sake of friendship in the future i declare you are my guest here and i will do for you what i can the khagan said though a barbarian he had proved himself a polite man that did not keep me from grasping the intent behind his speech when he said for the sake of friendship in the future what he meant was for the sake of the debt you will owe me i bowed in return accepting that if he did give me the aid i needed to regain my throne i would indeed owe him a great debt and would be honorbound to repay it and if he did nota in that case how would i see constantinople again ibouzeros gliabanos put me up in a tent near the palace this was no insult most folk in atil as i have said inhabiting such dwelling places i was fed well if curiously on rice and fish rice is a grain grown in the moist soil of the delta thereabouts and eaten in porridges and stews and casseroles as it lends itself to being baked in loaves even less well than oats i thought i would despair at having to eat fish again but the smoked tender flesh of the sturgeon bore little resemblance to the dried fish i had for so long endured at kherson the khazars also preserve the eggs of the sturgeon in salt a delicacy for which i was slower to acquire a taste but one of which i eventually grew quite fond the khagan having granted me freedom to travel in the city i crossed the volga to the eastern half where the larger half of the population and most of the merchants dwelt the khazars sell slaves honey wax furs and isinglass all but the last of which are imported into their country from the even more barbarous lands to the north in exchange they buy cloth and finished clothing as well as wine and fine sword blades though their own smiths produce the ordinary sort ibouzeros gliabanos was himself a pagan though among his advisers he numbered pagans of his own erroneous creed followers of the false prophet a handful of christians and some jews as well he was permitted and he made full use of a company of twentyfive wives and more than twice that number of concubines though not providing entertainment on such a lavish scale to his guests he did see to it we lacked no companionship we desired we got on well he and i he invited me to dine with him at the palace more than once at one of these affairs he said i envy you the spirit that lets you go on seeking what was taken from you if that happened to me i hope i would do the same i think you would i told him not altogether insincerely i hope so he repeated frowning into his wine cup i wish i could do all i want to help you the other emperor of the romansa his voice trailed away is a usurper i said he nodded yes but he is also strong and rich the roman empire obeys him if i took the throne from him the roman empire would again obey me i spoke with confidence and why not if the roman empire had bowed to the wishes of leontios it would obey anyone set over it the khagan drank more wine then ran his tongue over his lips once you were in constantinople far from atil you would forget your friendship for the khazars i would have no hold on you but gratitude and gratitude is worth its weight in gold yes he was a ruler of men i will give you any oath you like i promised i would not risk my soul by promising falsely you must believe that why must i he said a question that while imperfectly polite was very much to the point he plucked one of the long hairs from his unkempt beard i need a way to bind you to me you do not trust my oath i did my best to sound injured and offended in ibouzeros gliabanoss place i should have placed no faith in oaths either but i would have let myself be given over to his torturers before admitting as much i drank more wine myself the khagan disdaining the fermented mares milk of his people imported fine vintages from kherson the caucasus and romania he studied me then found another question one i had not expected have you a wife back in constantinople justinian i am a widower i answered poor eudokia was by then sixteen or seventeen years dead almost half my life i had not forgotten her i shall never forget her of course but i did not think of her every day either i know you christians are allowed only one at a time poor fellows ibouzeros gliabanos said but even the rules of your religion let you marry again if that wife dies is it not so certainly it is so why do you ask i think the khagan said slowly i think i may have a way to bind you to me as you should be bound one of my younger sisters you see has not yet been pledged in marriage to any mana my mouth fell open i stared at him he smiled back looking pleased at his own cleverness and indeed from his point of view the ploy was nothing less than brilliant were i to become his brotherinlaw i would be far less likely to go against his interests for in so doing i should be harming my own kin well and good i took another pull at my wine while mulling over the other side of the nomisma could i i asked myself stomach being wed to a barbarian princess i had come to the khazars because they were strong not because they were civilized i had not expected ibouzeros gliabanos he being as i say a barbarian to come up with a scheme an emperor of the romans might have admired i did admire it and should have admired it even more had it not put me in such a predicament i said i will not i cannot marry any woman who is not of my faith this is not only because i am a christian myself but also because the romans would never accept an emperor with a pagan wife the khagan had to know that was true i hoped it would suffice to release me from the trap he had set we have christians and christian priests here in atil he said placidly and you brought one with you even if we did not she will become a christian i see it is needful her name you should know is tzitzak tzitzak i echoed i looked down into my wine cup it still had wine in it i drained it filled it and drained it again the chamber in which ibouzeros gliabanos barisbakourios and i sat began to spin tzitzak i repeated it sounded like the noise a small hungry finch might make i looked over at the khagan who sat waiting courteously to see what i would do despite that courtesy i knew he would not aid me if i said him nay i tried to bow while sitting crosslegged and almost fell forward onto my face having no choice and knowing it i said i am honored to have you for my brotherinlaw his face lit up i think he knowing something of roman pride had expected me to reject the offer even if that meant i should never see constantinople again that i did not gave him some clue as to the depth of my desire to regain what was and is rightfully mine thought to this day i do not think he grasps it in fullness he put both hands to his mouth and shouted for a slave more wine those words of the khazar tongue i learned quite well that night he and i both used them again and again over the next several hours at the end of that time the khagan slumped over sideways and began to snore he and i had had nothing intelligible to say to each other for some little while barisbakourios having passed out before either of us i got to my feet surprised to discover i could do so weaving down the halls from one wall to another like a ship making a series of tacks against the wind i made my stumbling way out of the palace and to my tent barbarians though they were the khazars as a result of their living in nomadic fashion had great skill with tents and the one with which they had furnished me was nearly as luxurious in their fashion as the pavilions in which i dwelt while on campaign at the head of the armies of the roman empire instead of excubitores two khazar guards stood before the entranceway they nodded to me i was their charge if not their sovereign after considerable fumbling i succeeded in lifting the flap and going inside there was an excubitor in there he was snoring as a matter of fact i shook him myakes first move was to grab for the sword lying beside him congratulate me i said causing him to arrest the motion why is that he asked sourly for falling into a wine jar he was always testy on being suddenly awakened no for pledging my troth i answered emperor youre very drunk he said whic h god knows was true tell me about this in the morning if you remember any of it then my bet is you wont he pulled a sheepskin up over his head trying to go back to sleep i shook him again he said something not becoming to my imperial dignity something pungent enough i wish i could have remembered it come morning i said i am going to be wed her name is i hiccuped not actually a bad approximation of tzitzak it might not have been a bad approximation but it was not good enough either her name is what myakes said from under the sheepskin tzitzak i said carefully managing to get it right this time getting it right did me little good sleep it off emperor myakes urged and rolled over onto his side she is the sister of ibouzeros gliabanos khagan of the khazars i said taking some little while to do so being as drunk as i was i spoke at about half ones usual speed to make sure myakes understood me he did he sat up again letting the sheepskin fall where it would youre going to marry the khagans sister emperor he repeated i nodded and wished i had not the motion already being enough to make my head ache myakes whistled softly he could see the implications in that and once you do hell help you so he says i replied if he will not help his brotherinlaw whom will he help myakes might have answered me i do not know the next thing i remember it was morning myakes i dont think ive ever seen anyone so drunk as justinian was that night brother elpidios believe me thats saying something too you make your life as a soldier youll run into a lot of people who can pour down the wine justinian though im just amazed he woke up the next morning to remember anything how did he get from the palace to that tent divine providence you ask me and do you know brother from that day to this ive never figured out whether justinian got that drunk because he was glad hed finally get the help hed wanted for so long or because he was disgusted that hed have to marry a khazar to finally get the help hed wanted for so long matter of fact i was hoping hed tell me but he doesnt not really does he maybe he didnt know himself maybe it was both at once here in the monastery life is simple its not like that out past the walls justinian when i did wake i wished i would die i had not spewed up any of the wine i drank the night before which meant it all remained inside to finish the job of poisoning me i staggered out of the tent in search of cool fresh air in finding it though i also found the sun it sank spears of agony into my head through my eyes a new set of khazar guards stood outside the tent they had no trouble figuring out what was wrong with me and i being merely a visitor and not their emperor they made scant effort to hide their mirth most of the guards ibouzeros gliabanos gave me understood some greek this was for his benefit not mine but i used it then cabbage i croaked piteously can you get me a raw cabbage and pure cold water they found me a cabbage the water came from the nearby river it was not very cold and tasted of mud but it had to do there being no other i methodically devoured the entire cabbage washing it down with long draughts of the water after a while my headache and the remaining symptoms of imminent bodily dissolution receded presently barisbakourios came out of the khagans palace and toward the tents where my companions and i were quartered he looked the way i felt though rather worse seeing me he said emperor do i rightly remember that you do indeed i answered how is the khagan wretched he answered succinctly i smiled in much the same way as i had done on learning of leontioss mutilation misery does indeed love company one of the guards was a decent soul without being asked he fetched the same cure for barisbakourios as he had for me while barisbakourios was imitating a rabbit in a farmers garden cyrus emerged from his tent rubbing his eyes i daresay our chatter had awakened him at the sight of him that part of my hangover the cabbage had not cured did disappear just the man i was looking for i exclaimed which was true even if i had not known it until he came before my eyes ibouzeros gliabanos had said there were christian priests in atil but here was my own loyal follower i shall want you first to save a soul by converting a pagan to christianity and then to yoke the two of us together in marriage cyrus might not have drunk too much wine the night before but he had not been awake long and his wits still moved slowly you want me to what he said and dug a finger in his ear as if certain he could not have heard rightly i explained then i explained again for stephen and theophilos came out of their tens and also had to be brought up to date myakes kept on sleeping but then of course he had already heard the news cyruss eyes glowed emperor this is the best news i have heard for you sincea his voice trailed away in the long years of my exile bits of good news had been few and far between i found one though this is the best news i have had since i got my nose back i touched the member i had named that put into my mind the thought of another member going through with this will be more enjoyable than that was too everyone laughed except cyrus who permitted himself a smile then he said emperor i shall go the the palace now to see what arrangements need be made to bring the young woman to our true and holy orthodox faith i promise i shall be most diligent in instructing her too that the marriage may be celebrated as quickly as possible that is good i told him after you meet her will you do one other thing for me he nodded plainly anxious to please being anxious myself i blurted out my question will you tell me if shes pretty until such time as tzitzak was baptized into the holy and saving christian faith i could not wed her nor by the customs of the khazars which are in this regard even more stringent than our own even set eyes on her i waited with such patience as i could muster more perhaps than i had possessed before my exile but no great amount nonetheless having concluded the bargain with ibouzeros gliabanos i wanted it sealed as he had vowed cyrus did teach tzitzak our beliefs at the best pace he could manage finding her a willing pupil the wife of a roman merchant in atil served as his interpreter as chaperone and also as another witness to the truths inherent in our creed she is ready to be baptized and to take a proper christian name in place of the heathen appellation with which she was born cyrus said after what seemed forever but was in fact a matter of about three weeks have you any suggestions emperor for what that name might be zoe perhaps symbolizing the new life she is beginning or anastasia to honor your mother this question having been in my mind since not long after ibouzeros gliabanos proposed the marriage alliance i had an answer ready neither of those cyrus no if it please her let her be called theodora athe gift of goda cyrus said and nodded in agreement that is indeed a fitting name for a convert to the holy and orthodox faith and he broke off his eyes widening and began again in a new tone of voice and she will bear the name of the first justinians consort just so if i am named for the great emperor let her name recall that of his great empress you are a learned man cyrus speak to her somewhat of the first justinians theodora that she may gain some understanding of the fame and honor accompanying the name i shall do as you say emperor cyrus assured me he looked sly and when news of this wedding and of the name of the bride reaches the roman empire i have no doubt that it will create considerablea excitement there it had better i said i intend that it should i wanted apsimaros to feel himself assailed by great names from out of the roman past and thus to feel himself all the more a parvenu all the more illegitimate all the more a usurper any means i could find to fill him with uncertainty and fear i would use tzitzak accepted the name theodora without hesitation and henceforth i shall refer to her by that name her baptism at a small church used by christian merchants in the khazar capital was by cyruss account and that of ibouzeros gliabanos a splendid affair though not so splendid unfortunately as to tempt the khagan himself toward christianity the khazar custom i have mentioned precluded my presence that accomplished no impediment remained to our marriage by the standards of constantinople it was celebrated with almost indecent haste i however cared little for the standards of constantinople having been away from the imperial city for most of a decade what i cared about was the chance to return to constantinople the marriage seeming necessary for that i allowed no further delays next to the church of the holy wisdom even next to the churches of kherson that in which i was wed was a hovel i think it was a furriers warehouse before acquiring its present purpose the crowns of marriage that went on my head and theodoras were made of tin the marriage belt i slipped round her waist publicly here again yielding to khazar usages of brass and yet somehow none of that mattered with cyrus officiating and the priest whose church it was assisting the ceremony struck me as even more solemn and splendid than it had when i had wed eudokia all those years before i had been but a youth then now half a lifetime later i brought more of myself to the wedding so to speak that may have had something to do with it here too i had caused a new soul to accept our saving christian faith that mattered very much to me i also strongly felt the importance of renewing the alliance with the khazars that had helped save the roman empire in the days of my greatgreatgrandfather and would now god willing help save it from the clutches of the usurper at last came the moment when theodora and i having given each other our vows i could part her veil and see for myself what sort of bargain i had made with her brother the khagan cyrus had told me i would find her acceptable taking another mans word in such matters though and especially the word of a celibate is in itself a sort of act of faith and not one i could easily or casually make and so i examined her with no small curiosity and at first with something approaching dread by the standards of constantinople she was not a beauty she had something of her brothers aspect her face was flat and round with high cheekbones a rather low nose and dark narrow eyes set almost at a slant but having been in atil for some time by then i realized that by the standards of khazaria she was as cyrus had assured me an attractive woman her eyes though narrow were bright and clear and she had a fine pointed chin if ibouzeros gliabanos had the same his beard concealed it she was also studying me as no doubt she had been throughout the ceremony she had not seen me until then either and must have heard of my mutilation and its repair i wondered what she thought she surprised me by speaking in greek obviously memorized and now parroted i shall try to be a good wife for you justinian emperor of the romans i wished i had learned more of the language she spoke i had picked up a few words since arriving at her brothers court but for the most part had relied upon barisbakourios and stephen to interpret for me what point to the emperor of the romans acquiring a barbarous tongue since the bargain with her brother i had seen a point and tried to gain more knowledge of the khazar speech good i said now i too for you thank you it was not a whole sentence as hers was but she understood and nodded and smiled perhaps in some relief women of high blood know they are tokens in a game their menfolk play passing from one house to another as suits the needs of the moment this marriage unusually had been required of me no less than of her we would both have to make the best of it the feast following the ceremony was lavish in the nomad style roast mutton and beef a great plenty of fermented mares milk and wine both and a honeycomb which by their ritual theodora and i shared in the hope that our union would be sweet presently i took my bride to the tent appointed for the first night my companions shouted the usual bawdy advice in greek the khazars were also shouting i had come to understand a couple of those words too from the women ibouzeros gliabanos had furnished me before yoking me to his sister as best i could tell they were saying the same sorts of things as myakes and theophilos and the rest a couple of lamps burning butter lighted the inside of the tent which was piled thick with carpets in the center though lay a square of white cloth about a cubit on a side all nations except the utterly depraved cherish the proof of a brides maidenhead pointing to the lamps i mimed blowing them out and asked yes no in her language with my scarred forehead and flat repaired nose i knew i was no longer handsome the whores at kherson had let me couple with them in the light after auriabedas cut on me but theodora might well have had taste more refined than theirs but she said no in greek and then something in the khazar tongue i did not understand she tried to turn that into greek but could not her face twisted in frustration then she started to laugh so did i we would i was sure face the struggle often in times to come there are though ways of gaining understanding that require no words i set my hand on her shoulder she came to me i held her she felt like a woman in my arms her eyes closed when she kissed me i thought i made myself think nothing of that it being common among women running over her body my hands were pleased with what they found and when i took from her the long coat and tunic she wore my eyes discovered my hands had not been mistaken she was slim with small breasts and nipples surprisingly dark for those of a woman who had not borne a child i would have been more surprised and more suspicious of her virginity had the khazar girls with whom i had amused myself not been similarly made like them too she had only a small thin tuft of dark hair at the joining of her legs having undressed her i undressed myself as well i was ready for her her narrow eyes widened to see how ready for her i was i waved for her to lie down on the square of white cloth still nervously watching me she did so i knelt beside her caressing her bare body as i had done while it was clothed patience came easier than it had on my first wedding night not least because i did not burn so hot as i had in my youth i took my time trying to excite theodora or at least to make her less afraid both of me and of what we were about to do after a while clumsily and in unpracticed fashion her hands began to imitate what mine were doing my mouth eventually went where my hand had gone she sighed women encountering that caress for the first time i have found are astonished at how sweet it can be i thought at first to give her full pleasure that way before taking her maidenhead but then had a different notion bringing her nearly to the brink i kept her there for some little time before entering her she was well and truly ready i slid in with ease until the membrane stopped me i thrust hard then beneath me her face twisted in pain but not for long breaking through i fleshed myself to the root as i drew back and then thrust home once more her face twisted again this time in a way with which i had long been intimately familiar she gasped and quivered her inner muscles squeezed me her eyes which had been closed opened she looked up at me i was intent on my own pleasure then having given her hers but not so intent that i failed to worry whether the sight of my face would curdle her joy perhaps my rhythm faltered she smiled at me and i stopped worrying having completed the act i got up off her and looked at the square of cloth sure enough she had been a virgin she had not bled much but enough to confirm that she burrowed under furs while i put my tunic back on and went out into the night to display the proof of what we had done loud drunken cheers greeted me how many rounds tonight barisbakourios whooped ready to translate my answer for the nomads without greek the khazar language doesnt have numbers so big i boasted he translated that the khagan and the other khazars standing there laughed loud and long that kind of bragging on that kind of night amused them rather than insulting them as it might have done under different circumstances at another time i went back into the tent as i had gone back into the palace bedchamber with eudokia then i had gone several rounds before bothering to come outside and display the bloody trophy of conquest now while confident of a second round i was anything but for the third and beyond thus time robs us of our powers my brash words to the men waiting outside the tent notwithstanding when i returned to her and let the tent flap fall behind me theodora flipped off the furs under which she had hidden i took her willingness to show herself to me naked as a good sign she might easily have retained a larger portion of virginal modesty or indeed she might have been repelled by what we had just done and wanted no part of it thereafter or as little part of it as she could manage that proving not to be the case i wasted no time in divesting myself of the tunic once more i caressed her with hands and mouth as i had done before proving slower to rise than i had then ah the years i taught her what a woman could do with her mouth that was a time when i wished we had more words in common although after some initial hesitation she grasped the principle with pleasing very pleasing speed when i went into her i stroked her tender little button with my finger while thrusting in and out after a very short time she gave a mewling cry so loud i feared the torn edges of her maidenhead pained her it was not pain though but pleasure i spent myself a moment later groaning half with delight half with exhaustion we lay side by side afterwards her skin was slick with sweat as was mine i fell asleep for a while when i woke the lamps were guttering theodoras motion had disturbed me she was pouring wine into two cups i think she would have wakened me once it was poured had i not stirred sooner seeing my eyes open she smiled and handed me one of the cups we managed a third round then with her proving she had not forgotten the lesson i had given her not long before i managed thanks to that coupling with her in the laziest fashion possible her on her side and me taking her from behind i gasped sighed pulled out of her and fell back to sleep she may have tried to waken me again that night if she did she failed we have done well together theodora and i from our wedding night onward she took to lovemaking as if having gone so many years without for i do not think she was far from thirty when we married she intended making up the lost time as quickly as she could with that at bedrock we found we got on well in other ways too out of need we soon learned to speak to each other she picked up greek fast and i learned such khazar words as i could i still found the nomads speech ugly but now i also found it useful which made a great difference now i will give you everything i can ibouzeros gliabanos promised when i spoke to him a couple of weeks after having wed his sister good i said now tell me exactly what that will be hearing that he grew evasive had i been khagan of the khazars i should have grown evasive then too had he led an army down toward constantinople he would have had to fight his way through the country of the bulgars and then through roman territory before reaching the imperial city alternatively he might have gone through the caucasus and into anatolia but that would have weakened the roman empire against the followers of the false prophet and still would have left him on the wrong side of the bosporos to take constantinople as the persians were during the reign of my greatgreatgrandfather i should have thought this through more thoroughly before bearding him to make good on his promise i should for that matter have thought it through more thoroughly before fleeing to his court in the first place but what choice had i i could not stay in kherson nor in doros either ibouzeros gliabanos at least was not actively persecuting me on seeing that he had no intention of furnishing me with an army i said give me gold then with gold i can get warriors how good the warriors would prove was another question i had given neboulos and the sklavenoi gold but so had the accursed arabs but with gold there were things i could do without it my opportunities would be far more limited so much of the wealth of the khazar khaganate depending on trade ibouzeros gliabanos was an able bargainer but i had learned a fair amount in my time of exile and i was desperate where he was not i pressed him hard finally persuading him to part with perhaps more gold than he had intended bah he said and made a sour face now that you have extorted this money from me i ought to send you far away so you do not come to think you can make a habit of it if he was angry at me i did not want to stay close by him lest he choose to vent that wrath i doubted causing his sister unhappiness would stay him and if he was going to give me gold i should have liked to be closer to constantinople than was atil atil so far as i could tell was close to nowhere worth reaching still returning me to doros or kherson would have been a death sentence a polite death sentence but a death sentence nevertheless he might have been thinking along with me for in musing tones he said suppose i send you to phanagoria what do you think of that phanagoria i pursed my lips while thinking the town is situated next to the peninsula on which kherson lies just to the east of the narrow strait joining the black sea and the maiotic bay it has some commerce with constantinople although less than kherson enjoys from it though i should likely have been in a good position to observe events at the queen of cities i could hardly have been in a worse position for observing those events than from atil and no one in phanagoria so far as i knew had any particular interest in killing me i nodded to ibouzeros gliabanos let it be as you say good good the khagan said expansively i shall give you the gold as i said i would he forgot for the moment the difficulty with which he had just been persuaded to say he wouldand you will live like a king no i told him he frowned i explained i will live like an emperor he liked that laughing out loud you have the spirit of an emperor he said i have seen this and seen it clearly and phanagoria is more like a roman town for you you will like living there and my sister will see what living like a roman is like yes i want to show her that i answered though phanagoria would be only a small debased copy of true roman life then he having mentioned theodora i gave him news i might otherwise have held back for a day or two or let her pass on she is with child good good he said again this is why you marry your nephew will be emperor of the romans i said and watched his narrow eyes gleam as he contemplated the possibilities inherent in that i contemplated those possibilities too having the vicegerent of god on earth be of their blood might bring the khazars to christianity wholesale which would solidify their alliance with the roman empire against the deniers of christ for this news ibouzeros gliabanos said i shall give you more gold the news must have pleased him as greatly as appeared to be the case for he kept his promise again we traveled over the vast sea of grass when the wind blew over it it rippled and changed color much as the waves did on the veritable sea our journey here was slower though travel by land is always slower save for couriers and others in a driving hurry who constantly change mounts to speed themselves along theodora rode on horseback astride like a man this would have startled me even had she not been carrying a child but she took it as a matter of course in a mixture of her tongue and mine she said the baby is tiny yet this does not hurt it khazars ride horses i am a khazar i ride a horse she had no need of my old pedagogue to teach her the elements of logic what was i do to beat her make her stop riding and slow us all down i saw no sense in that she kept riding a horse now that i think on it whenever she has set her mind on doing a particular thing she has in the end done it perhaps that is one of the reasons we get on so well phanagoria when we finally reached it proved a town similar to kherson though smaller it boasted several churches better than half its populace being romans as with kherson though it had a khazar tudun or governor a certain balgitzin who also ruled another nearby town but dwelt in phanagoria he dressed in roman fashion in a linen tunic and spoke better greek than his counterpart farther west i am honored to have the emperor of the romans here as a guest in my city he said when i presented myself to him on my arrival and you have wed the daughter of my splendid khagan will wonders never cease he bowed to theodora who had not followed everything he said seeing that he spoke rapidly in the khazar tongue yes we are man and wife she answered in greek i will give you a fine house with many rooms balgitzin promised he was full of promises balgitzin was he was wasted as a tudun he would have been a great success as a constantinopolitan courtier a man who made so many promises though was liable to have trouble keeping them all this first one though he kept a minor noble of the imperial city would not have been ashamed of the house in which he installed us not at least after the aforesaid noble had the house cleaned from top to bottom rats and mice and cockroaches and ants never stopped plaguing us as long as we lived there having lived much harder in kherson i made the best of things here theodora for her part was enchanted as i have previously mentioned most of the dwellings in atil are tents living within real walls and under a true roof made her feel as if she were inhabiting a palace constantinople must be like this she said one evening after we made love i fear i laughed at her she got angry i tried to explain what a small mean dingy town phanagoria was when set alongside the queen of cities she did not believe me having now seen one town she imagined herself an expert on such things and would not believe any city could exceed phanagoria try as i would i could not persuade her she was stubborn in such matters too balgitzin fawned on us we had gold from ibouzeros gliabanos theodora liked salted mackerel to her it was new and exotic and tasty i paid for beef and mutton i had had enough of salt fish and dried fish for a lifetime all my comrades but myakes went back to kherson resuming the lives they had interrupted on my behalf and passing my regards on to moropaulos and my other followers there who had not left once they were gone i settled down to make myself as comfortable as possible in phanagoria and to await any good news that might come from the roman empire waiting came hard curiously all the years i had passed in kherson up until the time when auriabedas gave me back a nose of sorts seemed to go by fast as a blink however much i tried to keep my hopes burning they had faded then now with hope burning bright once more each passing day seemed a wasted opportunity i began spending time by the edge of the black sea once more staring south and west across the water toward the imperial city as if my will could lift me and return me to my proper home stephen having returned to kherson sent me word that all my backers in the town where i had originally been exiled were also alert for any reports coming from constantinople and that they like me had their hopes aroused emperor they cheered loud and long when i told them of your marriage to the daughter of the khazar khagan he wrote i cheered that marriage myself after so much sorrow i was now happy above the mean when ibouzeros gliabanos proposed the marriage to me i had wondered if i could stand being joined to his sister now i wondered how i had lived so long without her her body suited me her temper suited me and the converse also held true we had in short fallen wildly in love with each other something far more likely to spring from the union of a taverners daughter and the young fellow who sells her father olive oil than a mating between emperor and princess arranged not with an y thought for the feelings of the parties most intimately involved but only to secure an alliance call it luck or the will of god either will do whatever the reason i reveled in something i had not known since my brief marriage to eudokia and something which struck me as superior to that spending time with theodora helped me keep my wits about me as day followed day in phanagoria i consoled myself for each day that passed without useful word from romania either in her arms or simply in her company too soon too soon the peaceful rhythms of those few brief weeks passed away never to return i was having bread and wine with theodora one quiet sunny midday when myakes broke in on us no matter how long he and i had been together i looked up at him with some considerable annoyance no man cares to be interrupted while in the company of his wife nor is it proper for even a husbands closest companions to gaze on her overmuch before i could reprove him though he said emperor i was down at the harbor and moropaulos just now sailed in from kherson we called him foolish paul among ourselves too the name fitting like a boot myakes went on ive got him waiting out in the hallway emperor hes carrying important news news you need to hear my annoyance melted like snow in spring bring him in then i said i turned to theodora she made no move to absent herself as a properly modest roman wife would have done being the khagans sister she was accustomed to taking part in such affairs after a moments hesitation i decided not to order her away in came moropaulos twisting slightly to get his great shoulders through the doorway after bowing to me and then shyly to theodora he said emperor that apsimaros he just sent a man to the khagan of the khazars on account of you fellow came up to kherson and then took horse bound for atil did he i turned to myakes you were right i do have to hear this back to moropaulos what does apsimaross man have to say to the khagan pray emperor he says apsimaros will send him many presents if he sends you to constantinople alive if the khagan doesnt fancy that apsimaros says your head will do myakes if it had been leontios still on the throne down in constantinople brother elpidios he would have sat on his backside till justinian came to him that was the way he was apsimaros stayed quiet too long for his own good too but he did finally get moving i never had anything in particular against him up till then he hadnt done anything to justinian except hold onto the throne hed taken from leontios he hadnt ruled too badly either i thanked god we had people back there in kherson they let justinian know what apsimaros was up to and he knew it before ibouzeros gliabanos did too me i couldnt imagine the khagan of the khazars turning against the man hed just married to his own sister justinian hed always had more imagination than me justinian turning to theodora i asked how likely is your brother to betray me i do not know she answered had she indignantly denied the possibility i should have been certain her primary loyalty lay with him not me as things were she went on if apsimaros gives him enough i think he will take it though i wanted to kiss her for that answer but would not because of the presence of myakes and moropaulos i think you are right i said i think your brother would sooner align himself with someone calling himself emperor who is in constantinople than with a true emperor in exile that means trouble myakes said if the khagan tries to seize you or kill you what do we do if that happens we cannot stay any longer in lands the khazars rule i said to which both myakes and theodora nodded i looked toward moropaulos god bless you for bringing this news tell my followers in kherson to be ready for whatever may happen and you be ready there to bring me word if apsimaros sends more envoys to the khagan or the other way round ill do it emperor he promised dipping his head he hurried out of the chamber though as thorough a supporter as anyone could wish he was always shy in my presence if we have to leave where do we go myakes asked straight for constantinople my heart cried yes myakes tone though suggested he did not think that a good idea and the more my head examined the idea my heart loved the more i was reluctantly inclined to agree with him if we show up outside the imperial city with no more force than a handful of men in a fishing boat apsimaros will crush us like a man smashing a cockroach under his heel i said hating what logic and reason told me myakes let out a loud sigh of relief i think thats just right emperor i dont know how to tell you how thankful i am you think the same way you need men with you to strike a blow against this apsimaros theodora said statement not question having followed our greek her frown which i had seldom seen was amazingly like her brothers after spending some little while in thought she said maybe my husband the bulgars they are not friends to the romans and they are not friends to the khazars either as i had started to say yes to myakes notion of sailing straight for the imperial city so i started to say no to theodora having fought against the bulgars i was not inclined to think of them as allies but those wars now were more than a decade behind me asparukh their khagan had died while i was in kherson of his son and successor a certain tervel i knew little glancing over to myakes i saw he liked the idea the more i thought on it the more i liked it too if it proved necessary theou thelontos we are worrying over nothing i said if ibouzeros gliabanos shows proper loyalty to his family i am perfectly safe here yes god willing theodora said making the sign of the cross her acceptance of the true and holy orthodox christian faith had sprung from deep conviction not merely the desire to keep from hindering her brothers scheme is it so in romania that all family is always loyal to all family no it is not so i said remembering my father and my uncle herakleios and my uncle tiberius and before that the struggle between my grandfathers backers and those supporting the descendants of my greatgreatgrandfathers second wife it is not so among the khazars either theodora said i didnt think it was i answered we shall hope everything turns out for the best and if everything does not turn out for the best which god prevent if that happens we shall also be ready there days flowed past one after another having made the journey myself i knew that apsimaross envoy whoever he was would be some time traveling across the plains to atil if he persuaded ibouzeros gliabanos to treachery word that treachery had been ordained would have to make its way back to phanagoria before any move against me could take place in the meanwhile theodoras belly began to bulge with the child she carried she quickly reached the point of surfeit with salt fish and dried fish a development surprising me not at all thanks to the money i had of her brother the khagan we had no trouble affording better the cook balgitzin gave us also went out every so often and bought fresh fish from the men bringing them off the boats theodora stared in some considerable dismay the first time he brought in a squid as long as his forearm you eat that she asked me incredulously it is not a proper fish i do not like the way it stares at me and i do not like all its she wiggled her fingers back and forth lacking the proper word tentacles i did my best to be helpful whatever they are she made as if to push the squid away but when instead of seeing it whole she ate slices of it fried in butter a flavor i tolerated better than she did that of olive oil to which she took years to become accustomed she praised its delicate taste and grumbled only a little at its chewy texture the cook bought more squid after that and she ate them with good appetite she did not however care to look at them before they were cooked nor does she even now here on the day on which i set down these words every time i saw balgitzin after moropaulos came to phanagoria i wondered whether the khazar had yet received orders to make away with me this was at first foolish for i knew more about apsimaross effort against me than he did unless of course the tudun at kherson had sent him word at the same time as the fisherman came to me i doubted that balgitzin remaining for some time cordial to me and not striking me as a man schooled in the art of dissembling and then one evening having drunk myself cheerful if not sozzled at phanagorias finest tavern a dubious commendation in such a limited field along with myakes i discovered a squad of armed men khazars outside the doorway to the house in which i and mine were living they had not been there when the two of us left the place myakes set a hand on my arm to hold me back the khazars having four or five presumably sober men to each of us i shook him off and went straight up to them any of you speak greek i asked when a couple of them nodded i found the next logical question whats going on they might have answered that question by drawing their swords in which case i should not be scribbling now one of the men who had shown he understood greek answered balgitzin say you have romans wanting to kill you is true it was my turn to nod i could hardly deny it the khazar continued we are guards to you for you to be sure no romans kill you oh i said and then thank you very much i could not object if balgitzin set guards on me using such a pretext for that matter it might not have been a pretext if ibouzeros gliabanos had rejected apsimaross request for my person or some significant fraction thereof he would have reason to think the usurper might resort to more direct means of disposing of me but if the khagan had decided to go along with the usurper he gained a plausible excuse for placing warriors near me which was it i did not know i could not know i could only wait i hated waiting i had waited a decade for the slim chance i now had how i hungered to slay them all but they were many and i had only faithful myakes at my side suppose we did slay them balgitzin could summon soldiers without number i could not i walked past them into the house myakes followed the khazars bowed to each of us in turn i barred the door that only made me feel more trapped not more safe however much i desired to do so the guards gave me no excuse to complain of their conduct to balgitzin when i stayed in the house to which the tudun of phanagoria had assigned me they remained outside when i went out one or two of them came along with me i even found myself having trouble disliking them they were but warriors doing as they were ordered and doing it well no murderers with apsimaross gold in their belt pouches sprang out from behind a wall to try to slay me was that because the guards intimidated them or because they were not there again how could i know a couple of weeks after balgitzin gave me my armed guard he invited theodora and me to a feast at his residence that evening i thank you i said what is the occasion a noble has come from the khagans court at atil to phanagoria he answered of course you remember papatzun of course i lied back at atil one barbarian had seemed much like another those who did not speak greek which meant the large majority might as well not have existed as far as i was concerned but as i had expected my wife had no difficulty placing this papatzun on my bringing her word of his arrival she looked serious saying this is a man my brother trusts he has not come to phanagoria now by chance then i said by chance theodora frowned until she understood what i was driving at oh no if anyone brings word from my brother to do this or not to do that papatzun is likely to be the one i will learn from him what i can good i kissed her but then warned dont let him know we suspect amusement glinted in her dark narrow eyes do not fear about this i will not ask him i will not ask his friends if any have come with him i will ask his slaves i know a couple of them well they will tell me the truth i kissed her again i will not give you any more advice you dont need it you are my husband she hesitated long enough to draw in a deep breath before going on you are my love if i can help you i will do it all i knew at that moment was gratitude i may be reckoned unmanly for not disdaining a womans help but considering how easily theodora could have chosen the side of her brother and her tribe rather than mine i knew how lucky i was in her you are my empress my augusta now i said soon you shall be my empress in the queen of cities god willing she said once more making the holy sign of the cross as for the banquet i said we shall see what we shall see on meeting papatzun again i discovered i did remember him after all remember his face at any rate for we had not had much to say to each other being largely without a common language he was not very young not very old not very fat not very thin not very tall not very shorta not very interesting in constantinople i judged he would have been a secretary in charge of some mediumsized bureau a man doing a fairly large job well enough to avoid censure but not so well as to get himself promoted out of it in constantinople such quiet competent men are common enough no doubt being harder to come by in khazaria they must also have seemed more valuable than is the case within the boundaries of the roman empire this rarity i judge accounted for the trust ibouzeros gliabanos reposed in papatzun khazar notions of banqueting require the celebrants to gorge themselves until they cannot move and drink until they cannot see having had my fill of fish i ate beef and mutton perhaps having had his fill of beef and mutton papatzun ate mackerel quite different from the sturgeon of atil he agreed with me in preferring wine to the drink his countrymen make from their mares milk despite balgitzins services as interpreter papatzun and i had little to say to each other he was polite enough to me i could no more fault his behavior than that of the guards with whom balgitzin had saddled me every so often i would glance over at him from the corner of my eye once or twice i saw or thought i saw him glancing over at me in the same way when that happened each of us quickly looked away from the other theodora by contrast enjoyed herself immensely the banquet giving her the chance to speak her own language unmixed with greek she took full advantage of it chatting animatedly with balgitzins wife whose name i learned but have long since forgotten taking part in the conversation of the men more freely than would have been reckoned proper at a roman feast and by all appearances enjoying her conversations with balgitzins and papatzuns slaves as well balgitzin swilled till he began to snore papatzun let out a sniff of contempt i had been to enough khazar banquets to have learned that the one who passes out first is often an object of contempt being reckoned weak if not effeminate in slow bad greek with long pauses for thought between words papatzun said no hold wine no indeed i answered i was by then quite drunk but not so drunk as to let down my guard you now you drink like a man he smiled vaguely understanding enough of the greek to know i had not insulted him i did my best to put the words into the khazar tongue i am a man he said in his native language you are a man i wondered if he would run through the conjugation of the verb to be but he just studied me for a while now making no pretense of doing anything else after a couple of minutes of this intense scrutiny he lifted his goblet in what was half salute half challenge i lifted mine as well we drank at the same time and drank deep presently papatzun slumped over like a tree under the woodsmans ax having won the drinking bout i looked around for theodora she was not there she must have gone off with balgitzins wife one of the khazars slaves came up to me when vaguely surprised that i could i got to my feet take me to my wife i said when he asked what i required instead he brought theodora to me she looked down at balgitzin and papatzun both of whom sprawled snoring on the rugs but for those snores they might as well have been dead men they would lie there unmoving till sunrise or longer after that for some hours they would wish for death rather than imitating it having lain as they lay i knew this well not even the stark shadows of lamplight fully defined the expression on theodoras face which being flatter and smoother than those of roman blood had fewer sharp angles to build shadows her eyes went from the snoring khazars to me can you walk home she asked i can do anything i said grandly which in truth meant i could do very little theodora smiled she knew what kind of talk got poured out of the neck of a wine jar i do remember that we got home and i am too large for her to have carried me all that way so logic compels me to believe i walked logic aside though i have no proof of this thinking on it i suppose the guards balgitzin had given me or had set on me i still did not know how to construe their presence could have done the hauling but theodora would have chaffed me about that had it happened so i still believe i did set one foot in front of the other all the way from balgitzins residence to my own once there i remember asking her what did you learn of papatzuns slaves she seemed impressed at my recalling papatzun had slaves let alone that they might know something important but all she would say was i will tell you in the morning i tried to argue with her she lay down as if for sleep i lay down beside her to go on with the argument and the wine overwhelmed me as she must have known it would devious was theodora i have had thicker heads than the one with which i woke up the next day a few headache or no though i remembered what theodora had said before i passed out we still lay side by side shaking her i asked the same question i had put the night before what did you learn of papatzuns slaves she woke smoothly as was her usual habit nor for that matter had she drunk herself into crapulence you do recall she sounded surprised if i thought you would i would have told you last night papatzun has her face went cold and sadhas brought balgitzin orders to kill you whenever he gets the command from from from your brother i finished for her yes she said and looked away from me i heard tears in her voice as she went on i knew he could do this i did not think he would do this not all the blood pounding in my head sprang from the hangover not now part of that painful drumroll was fury your brother can give orders but he is in atil far away i said his commands will take time to be obeyed i am right here i intend to be ready to move tonight she did not at first fully grasp what i was saying being caught up in the choices she had made he is my brother she whispered probably to hers elf for she used the khazar tongue but you are my husband you are my husband i took her in my arms and very glad of it too i said had it not been for her no doubt ibouzeros gliabanos papatzun and balgitzin should have succeeded in making away with me but that was not what i meant or was at most a tiny part of it i have never heard the act of love praised as a cure for too much wine but it served me admirably much improved and knowing now what lay before me i summoned myakes he and theodora and i spent much of the morning making plans finding holes in them and making new ones at last we had a scheme that satisfied everyone except theodora you will leave me behind she said bitterly i nodded i will if i win after tonight as god is my witness and my judge i will send for you and if i lose you will be able to go home safely to your brother he will treat you well regardless of what happens here you are blood of his blood as i am not and your child will carry my blood as well which may prove useful to him one day that though is only if i lose i kissed her right there in front of myakes and i daresay scandalized him i intend to win the feast i laid on that night rivaled the one balgitzin had given the night before the food in my judgment was better being cooked in the roman fashion rather than that of the khazars papatzun might not have found it better but he found no fault with it either not by how much he ate he drank as heroically as he had the night before too through theodora who was interpreting between us he said you drank me down last night justinian but tonight you are not even in the race do you romans save it up for one night and then give over a true man is ready to drink every night he drained his cup and held it out for more i rose as if to fill it myself carrying the wine jar as i went round behind him but instead of pouring at once i set the jar down on the table papatzun looked back over his shoulder at me drunken puzzlement on his face setting down the jar let me free the braided leather cord i was using as a belt for my tunic his turning his head at just that moment gave me the perfect chance to whip that cord around his thick neck i tightened it with all the strength i had in me papatzun tried to cry out he could not i gave him no air he tried to reach around himself to seize me and throw me aside but could not do that either his feet thumped on the floor they grew still surprisingly fast his face went from the red of drunkenness to a purplish black i had not seen since the sklavinian woman hanged herself in my pavilion not until the stench of loosening bowels proved him dead did i relax my grip then letting him topple over i turned to myakes and theodora belting the leather cord back around my waist as i did so my grin might have been the one on my face after having a woman one traitor dealt with i said now for the other before i could go out the door theodora embraced me saying god with you god with us all i said not knowing whether i would ever see her again when myakes and i burst outside the guards balgitzin set over me who had been drinking wine and shooting dice by torchlight sprang to their feet what is wrong asked the one who spoke the best greek i jerked a thumb back at the house papatzun has been taken ill in there i said that bearing at least some nodding relation to the truth i followed it with a thoroughgoing lie hes asking for balgitzin says its life or death in the excitement of the moment none of the guards asked any questions past that they did what they usually did told off a couple from their number to accompany me wherever i was going one of them carried a torch adding its light to that from the one myakes carried we hurried through the streets of phanagoria to balgitzins residence where arriving we pounded on the door one of balgitzins servitors answering we told him the same tale we had given the guards balgitzin came out a few minutes later whats wrong with papatzun he asked as we started back to the house he had assigned me his belly pains him i answered he has been vomiting and fears he might die he says he needs to tell you something i do not know what it is he sent me a hooded glance wondering no doubt if the message pertained to me then we pressed on as far as he knew i was ignorant of the orders concerning me papatzun had brought from ibouzeros gliabanos i hid a smile not that the torchlight was likely to betray it in any case soon enough i would show him what i knew we passed the black mouth of an alley opening out onto the street along which we traveled i stopped and recoiled whats that i exclaimed pointing down the alley something someone moved in there balgitzin turned toward the alley the khazar guard held his torch higher the better to see down the narrow stinking lane out came myakes sword as if to defend us from footpads while balgitzin stood distracted i undid my braided belt and whipped it around his neck without giving him the chance to cry out strangling is the best way to kill a man when one must be silent doing it balgitzin got out no more than one startled almost inaudible grunt myakes being without a strangling cord did the best he could with his blade using point rather than edge he thrust deep into the guards throat blood thereby drowning whatever outcry the man might have made the khazar dropped the torch and tried to draw his own sword but toppled into unconsciousness and death with a hand still on the hilt i choked the life out of balgitzin when his bowels voided their contents as papatzuns had done i let his corpse lie in the street along with the rest of the offal there ever practical myakes slit his purse and the guards heh he said his whisper loud in the quiet night even a little gold here and they may think for a few minutes they may think somebody else killed these two and kidnapped us the more time we can buy to get away the better off were going to be no arguments i said we hurried off toward the eastern gate of phanagoria the direction opposite that in which we would have been expected to flee our friends dwelling in kherson to the west and i put my head down to make my features harder to recognize reeling along as if drunk here whats this a guard called on our approach got to get my cousin here back to tomin myakes answered sounding drunk himself tavern there werent good enough for him no sir had to come taste the big city the damn fool well hes still got to go out fishing tomorrow morning yes he does no matter how much he had tonight his chuckle was full of malicious pleasure at my fate he sounded absolutely convincing i almost believed him myself and i knew better the guards laughed and stood aside letting us pass out into the night as a town phanagoria had little to recommend it although i lived as well there as anyone was capable of living tomin nowa if anyone who had to live in tomin slew himself to escape i doubt god would reckon his suicide a sin deserving damnation it lay and worse luck lies yet about three miles east of phanagoria a miserable little place without a wall without a church and without a hostel as i discovered on arriving the couple of taverns the place did have were taverns only not places where travelers might put up for the night the publicans apparently never dreamt anyone might want to put up at tomin for the night an attitude for which i confess a certain amount of sympathetic understanding tomin exists for one reason and one reason only a tiny indentation in the seacoast offering ships a little shelter we have gold myakes said as if reminding himself when we lay down against the wall of a building to get out of a chilly breeze and try to rest before dawn we can hire a fishing boat to take us to kherson to somewhere near kherson anyway i said im too easily recognized to go into the city i fear with apsimaros and the rich men there wanting my head but youre right myakes we need to gather my followers now and after we do that emperor he asked shifting around to try to get more comfortable or at least less uncomfortable after that i sighed after that the bulgars theodora was right with ibouzeros gliabanos turned against me i have no better choice as i tried to sleep i also tried not to think about how bad a choice the bulgars were likely to be i do not remember dozing off but i must have for myakes woke me at dawn by pounding on a tavern door when the irate proprietor opened up a show of coins salved his wrath and got us bread and wine which we ate and drank picking our way through tomins muddy alleys to the seaside look i pointed a real merchant ship was beached there dwarfing the little fishing boats to either side of it some considerable trade exists among the cities and towns along the northern coast of the black sea the only surprise was that this ship had put in at tomin rather than the nearby phanagoria caught by darkness perhaps we can get out of here faster with him than with any fisherman if hes westbound aye myakes answered probably will be or wed have seen him in port yesterday only one way to find out i answered and strode down toward the merchantman her captain a roughhewn fellow named peter dickered a fare to symbolon the nearest port to kherson asking no questions once we had paid i had been prepared to introduce myself as john and myakes as myron but he proved interested only in money not in names we sailed shortly thereafter having had little intercourse with the folk of tomin wh en the khazars came after us as i am certain they must have done on discovering both balgitzin and papatzun slain they might well have concluded myakes and i had vanished into thin air whatever they concluded they did not catch up to us before we had quitted that part of the world for good the one bad stretch i had on the threeday voyage to symbolon came very early when peter put into the port of phanagoria to unload wine and load smoked fish myakes and i spent all our time at the stern of the ship staring out to sea but the khazars did not send men aboard to search for us on our sailing out of that harbor myakes and i finished emptying the jar of wine he had bought in tomin apsimaros had captained the last ship upon which i had traveled the one taking me from constantinople into exile in kherson no doubt mercifully i recall next to nothing of that voyage i could here set forth the journey to symbolon in exacting detail but to what purpose only storms make travel by sea anything but dull we had none not on that journey i thanked god not yet aware of his plan for me myakes and i left the merchantman at symbolon a town larger than tomin but smaller than phanagoria lying a few miles south of kherson there i took a room above a tavern the folk at symbolon at least entertaining the possibility of someones wishing to do such a thing and myakes and i divided the money we had with us i told him go into kherson if were heading for the land of the bulgars well need moropauloss boat again anyone else who wants to come is welcome i laughed one thing sure ill know who my true friends are some of them emperor anyhow myakes said ive seen that boat foolish paul sails it wont hold many and thats the truth i waved that away some who said they backed me would find more excuses than moropauloss boat being small to avoid accompanying me on what they reckoned a forlorn hope go on i told myakes ill see you back here tonight or tomorrow morning i expect aye emperor myakes said and slipped away i had no doubt he would slip into kherson as readily he had spent as long in exile there as had i but i would have drawn notice even had i not been mutilated and he i think would have remained inconspicuous even with a cut nose regardless of the setting in which he found himself he had a knack for making himself at home without drawing undue attention waiting came hard as it always does for me i went down into the tavern i drank a good deal of wine i ate saltfish stew although having the money to pay for better i forbore symbolon not being kherson i had some chance of going unrecognized there and meant to foster that chance as much as i could so far as i could tell no one paid me any particular attention i was ugly but not hideous and thereby ideally suited for going unnoticed evening came with no sign of myakes after another bowl of that stew the last praise god i ever tasted i went up to the room i had bought for the night though taking no woman up there with me i did not sleep alone i crushed all the bugs i could but like the spartans at thermopylae was defeated at last by superior numbers eventually later than i would have liked sleep found me i woke before dawn whether from nerves or bedbugs i cannot say going downstairs i discovered myself the only one awake in the place and so less than happy with the world returned to my room once more until i heard someone moving about below i went down again and breakfasted on wine and an egg cooked with cheese that being the only choice besides fish porridge sometime during the second hour of the morning myakes strode into the tavern i did not rise from my stool i sprang from it had he waited any longer before arriving i daresay i should have smashed the top of my head from leaping straight up into the ceiling his smile was impudent he having known the state in which i would be boats at the wharf emperor he said lets go i left the tavern without a backward glance when we were about halfway down to the harbor a short journey symbolon hardly being any sort of metropolis i asked how many companions have i his face clouded me and moropaulos barisbakourios and stephen theophilos i thought hed be up in doros but he was staying with stephen thats it not even cyrus i said in dismay not his fault emperor myakes said i couldnt get word to him in the monastery he got himself in trouble there for gallivanting off the last time without so much as a byyourleave didnt want to wait around spend any more time in kherson than i had to all right i said good enough as for the others who would not come a plague on them more than a few had cheered me in kherson when i declared i would take back the imperial throne cheering was easy when it came to anything more than cheering where were they as if invisible ill have my vengeance on them too by god and his son but first the romans i hurried down toward the fishing boat myakes halftrotting beside me foolish paul waved from the boat i waved back though my first sight of the vessel that would i hoped carry me to the land of the bulgars made me wonder how it had sailed from kherson to symbolon let alone from kherson to phanagoria bringing me news of apsimaross move against me i also cast aside some of my dismay at the failure of more khersonites to rally to my standard moropauloss boat was crowded with him and theophilos stephen and barisbakourios in it adding myakes and me would make it very crowded it did not look as if it had much room for provisions aboard either i shrugged other supplies failing we could i supposed catch fish moropaulos waved again come on emperor he called the sooner we leave the sooner we get there a broad foolish grin spread over his broad foolish face two or three of the dockside loungers any harbor in the civilized world attracts turned curious eyes my way i wished moropaulos had not chosen that exact moment to address me by my imperial title if searchers from kherson or phanagoria came to symbolon they would have no trouble learning i had been there i consoled myself with the thought that they were unlikely to be able to find out whither i was bound stooping on the edge of the pier i scrambled down into moropauloss boat the fisherman steadied first me and then myakes after undoing the lines holding the boat to the pier moropaulos and theophilos plied a couple of long oars to get us out into open water once we were there foolish paul who struck me as being far less foolish now that i encountered him in his proper element raised the sail turned it to the best angle to take advantage of what wind we had and sent us heading northwards when we sailed past the lighthouse with which kherson feebly imitates fabled alexandria i shook my fist at the town may i never see you again i called across the water a wish that has come true and may i punish you as you have tried to punish me i am still fulfilling that wish even as i write these words above kherson the coast of the peninsula on which it lies curves up to the north and west we stayed in sight of land at all times as i had guessed between tacks moropaulos let his nets down into the water the catch was small but enough to keep us fed each of us taking turns roasting his fish above a tiny brazier a bucket of seawater always stood close by lest a sudden great wave overturn the brazier and spill burning coals onto the deck being small and lighter than the dromons in which i had previously traveled the fishing boat had a motion on the water different from theirs i felt every movement of the sea and proved myself a man able to take such motions as they came poor stephen being less fortunate in that regard ate little and spent a lot of time hanging over the leeward rail we traveled past the headland marking the westernmost extension of the peninsula on which kherson lies past the mouth of the danapris and then past that of the danastris most nights we simply beached the fishing boat keeping watch alongside it till dawn a couple of times we put up in little trading towns by the edge of the sea they were to doros as doros is to constantinople having said so much i shall draw a veil of merciful silence over any further description of them from the mouth of the danapris to that of the danube where the bulgars live is not a long voyage and seemed all the shorter in comparison to the distance we had already come up to that time the weather had been good oh the winds for the most part blew from the northwest requiring a good many tedious tacks if we were to beat our way westward but they were not violent and the sea stephens opinion to the contrary notwithstanding remained gentle all that changed two days after our sailing past the mouth of the danapris clouds filled the sky clouds so black and thick and roiling i at first took them for the smoke of a great fire somewhere the wind freshened and began to howl the light chop in which the fishing boat bobbed turned into waves that first buffeted the boat and then began to toss it about the sea the storm blew up almost as fast as i can record its coming less than half an hour after i spied the clouds on the western horizon rain started drenching us the day went black as midnight every so often a lightning bolt split the sky overhead giving us all momentary purpletinged glimpses of the heaving sea the roar of the thunder put me in mind of gods voice summoning us to judgment can you steer for shore i screamed to moropaulos he shook his head no he shouted back i dont even know which way the shore is not for sure seas doing the steering now not me s ea and the wind he brailed up the sail i think the winds still out of the west dont want to get blown too far away from land i shook my fist at the heavens as i had at kherson leontios had not been able to keep me down not for good the rich traders in kherson had not been able to make away with me when apsimaros tried to move against me he could not do so without my learning of it when ibouzeros gliabanos sought to betray me i learned of that too and struck first having escaped so much having achieved so much was i now to perish at gods hands no i shouted loud as i could and shook my fist again the storm grew ever worse despite my defiance the fishing boat spun like a top waves smiting it from every direction the lightning showed those waves tall as hills tall as mountains soon one would surely strike us wrong and capsize us and then everything would be over after we went sliding down from yet another wavecrest deep into the trough behind someone clutched the soaked sleeve of my tunic myakes he had been fearless for so long but now a flash of lightning showed the terror on his face were going to die emperor no i said thinking him right but then the boat wallowing out of the trough my spirits rose with it i raised a defiant shout no a wave broke over the bow drenching both of us and almost sweeping me over the side were going to die myakes insisted spitting out saltwater i beg you emperor on my knees i beg you and he did fall to his kneespromise god that if he spares you here youll have mercy on your enemies what mercy i shook my fist at the heavens for a third time if i have mercy on even one of them may god drown me now and the storm stopped myakes a miracle brother elpidios i dont know if it was a miracle or if wed come out the other side of the squall line or whatever it is sailors call those sudden storms that blow up out of nowhere or what i do know it happened just the way he writes it though hes right i was frightened to death you can fight a man how do you go about fighting the sea one minute i was certain sure we were sunk and drowned and food for the mackerel and the squid and the tunny that had been feeding us for so long up in kherson the next the next minute brother elpidios the clouds were flying away to the east and the rain went from sheets to spatters and then stopped and all at once when we were in the trough of a wave the crest of the next one wasnt higher than the top of our mast and the sun came out and it sounds like a miracle to you if you think im going to argue very hard you can bloody well think again justinian from that moment forward i knew i should prevail god having by sparing me given an indubitable sign he approved of my purposes all of us working with buckets and cups and a small bronze cooking pot bailed as much of the sea as we could from the fishing boat by the time the long weary task was done we stood ankle deep in water having been knee deep before we reckoned that great progress by gods providence the rigging had survived the storm like our tunics it flapped wetly but the sail filled with the gentle breezes following the storm and let us sail slowly toward the west the direction in which the sun was now setting we were out of sight of land and spent a chilly night on the sea making sail again the next morning though we spied the shore no later than the third hour on our sailing closer to that shore we discovered we had reached one of the several mouths of a considerable river does the danube break up before it flows into the sea the way the volga does barisbakourios asked the simple word delta evidently being unfamiliar to him he his brother theophilos and foolish paul all looked toward myakes and me none of them had been in his part of the world before we being romans and this having been roman territory before the bulgars raped it away from my father they expected us to know the answer and myakes who had accompanied my father on his illfated campaign against the bulgars did know aye thats the danube all right he said all we have to do now is sail up it a ways and wait for the bulgars to notice us he shook his head no thats not all we have to hope they feel like talking with us instead of killing us for the fun of it a point i admitted i had been so full of thought for what the bulgars might do for me i had not asked what i might do for the bulgars after a moments doubt though i straightened in the battered fishing boat i do not i will not believe god having spared me from the storm will let me perish at the hands of the barbarians heres hoping youre right myakes was seldom inclined to take on faith the goodwill of potential foes with moropaulos skillfully using the steering oar and turning the sail so as best to catch the wind we made our way up one of the channels of the danube waiting to be noticed i began to wonder whether any bulgars lived in that part of the land until i saw a large herd of cattle grazing in the distance where there were animals there their masters would also be found and before long one of the bulgars riding with the cattle spied the boat on the river and came riding up to the riverbank for a better look at us barisbakourios and stephen called to him in the language of the khazars and he shouted back to them but neither side could understand the other my turn then do you speak greek i called across the water some bulgars did i knew having acquired the tongue either from the luckless romans who had inhabited the land they now ruled or from traders coming up out of the roman empire the good fortune that had smiled on me since the storm abated continued greek yes i speak little greek the horseman answered who you what you want here he leaned forward on his horse like a hound seeking a scent every line of his body seemed to shout are you fair game can i slay you i am justinian emperor of the romans the son of constantine emperor of the romans i answered and had the satisfaction on watching his jaw drop and him go slack with astonishment on the ugly little pony he rode i continued i have come to see your khagan tervel will you take me and my friends to him for all i knew the barbarian might have thought i still sat on the throne in constantinople true i had been cast down ten years before but who can say how swiftly if at all news reaches a bulgar herder maybe he thought i had come to take supper with my fellow sovereign and would then return to the queen of cities on the other hand maybe he merely thought me a liar but if i lied i lied on a scale greater than he had ever imagined you stay he said not go i bring you another man he talk toward you riding away he booted the pony up into a gallop getting a better turn of speed from the animal than i had expected shall we beach the boat emperor moropaulos asked yes do i said weve come to see the khagan if the bulgars fall on us before we can do thata i did not go on but if the bulgars chose to fall on us before i could see the khagan i had no place else to go in any case tervel was and how well i knew it my last hope the fishing boat glided up onto the muddy bank of the danube we all got out of it as fast as we could solid ground however muddy beneath my feet for the first time since escaping the storm felt monstrous fine i walked up from the mud to the grass beyond and lay at full length upon it myakes came over and sat down beside me if i ever go to sea emperor i mean to say if im ever that stupid what you wont even cross from constantinople to asia i teased maybe ill go that far he said maybe and maybe i wont too plucking a blade of grass he set it between his teeth as if to say he was at one with the ground from which it sprang we rested for perhaps two hours before that first bulgar returned not with one but with several of his fellows one of them wore gold hoops in his ears and a gold armlet on his left wrist a chief of sorts unless i missed my guess he did not dismount staring down at me from horseback in better greek than his countryman had used he said i hear justinian had the nose of him cut off when they threw him out of constantinople i did i answered and touched first my repaired nose and then the scar on my forehead above it you see how the surgeon covered the hole with skin so now i have a nose again even if it is not such a good nose as i owned before having studied me he answered why do you want to see the khagan i shall discuss that with the khagan i answered haughtily or is he in the habit of talking over his business with everyone he chances to meet as nothing else had done that show of arrogance went far toward convincing him i was what i said i was like the first bulgar who had found me he said you have to wait here a little while he shouted orders in his own tongue to his men a couple of whom rode away returning to greek he told me they will bring horses for you and your friends to ride while we waited i introduced my companions to him and learned he was called omurtag he paid me the compliment of not asking again what i wanted of tervel but for the bulgar who had found us none of his followers spoke greek seeing that i realized how fortunate i had been on the initial encounter the bulgars he had sent forth returned to the riverbank more quickly than had been the case after the first meeting moropaulos was the only one of us not an experienced horseman he also fretted over his boat saying what shall i do without it if i win i said ill make you rich enough to buy twenty boats a hundred boats if i lose youll die in battle or apsimaros will cut off your head you wont need this boat either way will you but this is my boat moropaulos said showing how hed got his name after a while we cajoled him into leaving it behind he awkwardly scrambled up into the saddle of the horse the bulgars identified as the calmest of those they had bought calmest proved less than identical to calm but foolish paul managed to keep from being pitched off onto his head we rode south and west from where we had come to solid ground the countryside resembled the plain across which i had traveled to reach the court of ibouzeros gliabanos but was not so limitless to the south silhouetted against the sky i could see the mountains separating the land the bulgars had stolen from us from that still under roman rule omurtag being a man of authority in his own right he commandeered the services of a band of bulgars we encountered as evening drew near thus we had plenty to eat plenty to drink even if it was fermented mares milk and tents in which to sleep the accommodations were similar to those we had had of the khazars one band of nomads apparently living as much like another as peasants near thessalonike live like peasants near nikomedeia we rode out again at first light the next morning and after riding all day came to tervel that evening atil where ibouzeros gliabanos dwelt had come more than halfway toward transforming itself from a nomadic encampment to what might one day become a considerable city the camp at which tervel ruled had barely begun the same process the bulgars had built a wooden fence around a good stretch of territory surrounding tervels tent and those of his followers but the khagan and his men still made their living from the herds that fence enclosed a rider went ahead to announce my arrival to tervel the fellow came back with permission for me to go on and meet the khagan omurtag knowing which was tervels tent led me to it a couple of slaves romans by their looks and by the greek they spoke with each other tended to the partys horses perhaps having learned who i was they stared and stared at me i wonder whether tervels curiosity would impel him to come out and greet me but he waited for me to go to him he being after all sovereign in this place the interior of his tent glowed with lamps of glass and silver roman plunder till it was almost bright as day though the lamps burned butter rather than oil as they would have done in romania more plunder golden bowls silver wine pitchers gleamed in the lamplight tervel sitting there crosslegged on the carpet wore plunder too a womans jeweled earring in each ear and a necklace of nomismata since he had succeeded his father not long before i expected him to be hardly more than a youth as had been true for me but he was a man of close to my own age a battle scar seaming his right cheek his face almost as lined and weathered as that of any other nomad my followers prostrated themselves before him i bowed as i had to ibouzeros gliabanos when i straightened he was studying me through narrow eyes like those of the khazar khagan i think you really may be justinian he said in greek as fluent as mine i guessed some mountebank was coming to fool me but you have not only the wound fixed some sort of way i see but also the look of the man i remember seeing have we met i asked were you on an embassy to constantinople i hope you will not be angry if i say i do not remember you there we have met his smile showed excellent teeth he somehow contrived to make them look very sharp it was not in constantinople i have never been inside constantinople but you have come here before i saw you then i fought your men to try to keep them and you from getting back inside the roman empire we failed he shruggedbut not by much no not by much i admitted that was half a lifetime ago for me much of my reign had been half a lifetime ago for me you would have been young to fight then my first battle he agreed you romans should never have got away we should have trapped you and killed every one of you i should be stretching a point if i said i liked tervel from the outset but i could tell at once that he and i agreeing or not would always be able to understand each other we thought alike halfmeasures satisfied neither of us i said when my father came here with his army he should have destroyed every one of you bulgars then my campaign would not have been needed when your father came and all the ships vomited out their soldiers we thought he was the most fearsome man in the world tervel answered smiling that unpleasant smile once more then we found the soldiers only knew how to run away from us they fought better with you leading them i must say why thank you i said in some more than some surprise up till that moment whenever people compared me to my father they always found me the lesser so much had i come to take that for granted the possibility it might not be so smote me with the force of pauls revelation on the road to damascus tervel either did not notice my confusion or controlled himself so well he revealed nothing of his thoughts he said and now you come to me without an army at your back justinian tell me why this is did i not hear you married the daughter of the khazar khagan is he not your friend i married his sister i said he inclined his head accepting the correction i went on i think he would be my friend if he did not think being apsimaross friend counted for more ah tervel said he can afford to be apsimaross friend the khazars have no borders with the roman empire we bulgars do we have never been friends with the emperors of the romans not with constantine not with justinian one eyebrow lifted ironicallynot with leontios not with this apsimaros either he folded his arms across his chest waiting to see what i would say next that will change if an emperor of the romans owes his return to his throne to the khagan of the bulgars i was careful to use the indicative not the subjunctive tervel having shown he grasped subtle shades of meaning taking constantinople would not be easy he used the subjunctive my countrymen who have seen the city do nothing but talk about how strong its walls are apsimaros got into the city i returned i too shall find a way maybe he said maybe he stretched lithe as a wildcat i need not decide this at once drink and eat with me and tell me of how you came here from kherson unless i am wrong this will be worth hearing clapping his hands together he shouted for slaves like the others i saw in the country of the bulgars they were romans poor souls they brought us roast mutton and wine the khagan preferring it to his peoples native strong drink tervel had me speak in some detail on the repair of my nose the bulgars being more ignorant of surgery of any sort than we romans do you think you could teach my people to cut so he asked when i was through i doubt it i answered i paid as little attention as i could to what auriabedas was doing to me myakes here watched hed have a better notion of how the operation was done than i do not good enough to teach it to anybody else myakes said quickly what i was trying to do was not to puke too bad tervel said noses get lopped often enough it would be worth knowing what this foreigner with the name i cannot say did but go on justinian i told of traveling to the court of ibouzeros gliabanos and of my marriage to theodora with which he had shown himself somewhat familiar then i spoke of my journey to phanagoria of the khagans betrayal and of how i had dealt with papatzun and balgitzin tervel and the other bulgars who understood greek clapped their hands at that i also told them of how god had chosen to spare me out on the sea as i was sailing to their land finishing and so you see o khagan i am truly destined to enter the queen of cities and avenge myself on all who wronged me so you say tervel replied voice betraying nothing he was no more a christian than ibouzeros gliabanos less in fact for the khagan of the khazars tolerated all faiths including the true one in the lands he ruled while the bulgars saw christianity as connected with roman rule and so suspect with your help or without it i am going on to constantinople i said i believe you tervel said you are a man who keeps promises i see that if you go without my help though i do not think you will have a glad time of it although thinking him likely to be right i would sooner have had my new nose cut off than admit as much i would like your help i said but i will go on without it this ignored what had to be as evident to tervel as it was to me that should he order i would go nowhere but into whatever grave the bulgars gave me he also ignored the fact perhaps deeming its mention impolite perhaps finding it too obvious to need mention as ibouzeros gliabanos had before him he said if you win you will be inside constantinople and you are liable to forget whatever help you had getting there how do we seal this bargain so i will get the reward id deserve i cannot marry your sister i said nor even your daughter in theory i suppose i might have done that emperors tending to make their own law on such matters but i had no wish to put aside theodora on the contrary and then as i seldom did i remembered epiphaneia i cannot marry your daughter i repeated but i can give you mine i had not seen her of course since my treacherous overthrow and exile before that time i had s een her as little as i could and would have seen her less than that had my mother not continually tried to make me act as a father toward her that i did not wish to do and would not do all i could think of whenever i set eyes on her was that she had caused the death of her mother eudokia whom i had loved a decades separation and near forgetfulness i discovered had not caused this feeling to ease any more than that same decade had slaked my desire for vengeance against leontios and apsimaros nor did my marriage to theodora happy though it was ease the pain of having lost eudokia thus i felt not the slightest hesitation in offering the barbarous bulgar the child of my flesh in its way that too was an act of vengeance tell me of this daughter tervel said his voice so elaborately casual i knew he was interested having given him her name i went on she would be seventeen now i think now i help up a handi have heard nothing of her since i was overthrown it may be she has wed in that time she would have been a small girl then you know it may even be she is no longer among the living though god forbid it i said that i own more for fear of losing the bargain than from concern for her safety but if she lives and if she is not wed or has not accepted the monastic life i swear by my god the one true god to yoke the two of you together in marriage that is not a small promise tervel said slowly he spoke in his own language to enlighten those of his noble company boyars the bulgars call them who spoke no greek i could not understand their startled exclamations but i could not mistake them either myakes leaned toward me whispering emperor the augusta your mother will obey i broke in my mother is not here myakes nor are you she remember it he bowed his head in acquiescence that is not a small promise tervel repeated fortunately having missed myakes comment and my equally softvoiced reply the khagan went on but it is a promise full of conditions maybe these are conditions you cannot speak to now because you do not know enough and maybe too you know more than you say what will you do justinian if you find your daughter is dead or cannot marry me for a moment there i hated him but it was my own weakness i was hating hating cruel necessity that caused me to come before him as i had come before ibouzeros gliabanos as a beggar a beggar i was though and so i would remain until constantinople was mine once more if i could not make tervel sweet that time might never come and so i said khagan if for any reason you cannot marry my daughter i will name you caesar beside me myakes stiffened tervels eyes went so wide they were almost round you would do this he said i would i replied i will but emperor myakes was whispering againcaesar is i know what the title of caesar is i said aloud both to him and to tervel it is the highest title in the roman empire save that of emperor alone the only difference between the emperors crown and the caesars is that a cross surmounts the emperors good tervel said i do not want a cross on my crown i am not a christian i do not wish to become a christian i wished he had not said that the roman empire had not had a pagan caesar since before the days of constantine the great the roman empire so far as i knew had never had a caesar who was at the same time a barbarian none of that mattered longer than a moment if tervel did not aid me i should be in no position to grant titles to anyone and relatively speaking titles are cheap i must think on this after widening tervels eyes narrowed does it mean that if you die i become emperor of the romans his smile said this was not intended to be taken altogether seriously but the hungry expression that followed said he wished it were shaking my head i replied i will not lie to you by which i meant i saw no profit in lying for one thing my wife is with child for another if you are not a christian you will never be emperor of the romans you speak freely he observed i could tell you any number of pretty lies i said they might make you help me now but they would make you hate me later you tempt me justinian tervel said i will not tell you yes now and i will not tell you no either i will think on this as i said i would and i will give you my answer when i decide until then you are my guest you are kind beyond my deserts i replied that was probably a lie but a lie i was obligated to tell tervel gave not a hint of what he would do with me if he decided not to give me the soldiers i had asked of him i did not inquire if he would not aid me i cared little as to what happened next he set me up in a tent surprisingly similar to the one in which i had dwelt by the palace of ibouzeros gliabanos slaves romans tended to my needs after the first couple of nights i took a goodlooking woman named maria into my bed i loved theodora no less but she was far away the slave woman close by maria was resigned rather than eager but one seldom finds more in a slave a week after my first coming before him tervel summoned me to his tent once more i went with outward impassivity as complete as i could muster but with my heart pounding and my stomach knotted within me how strange how grim that my fate should depend on the whim of a barbarian chieftain who was a lifelong enemy of the roman empire i bowed before him as i had bowed before ibouzeros gliabanos he was master here not i more often than not i scorned the nomads for their lack of anything approaching proper ceremonial this once i welcomed their barbaric abruptness for with it i learned more quickly what i wanted to what i had to know without preamble tervel said i will give you soldiers we will go down to constantinople together you and i and see if we can set you back on the throne you lost my heart pounded harder than ever but now from joy rather than concern if i reach constantinople with an army at my back i shall rule again may it be so tervel sounded polite but not altogether sincere a moment later he explained why if you win everything will be as you said either i will have your daughter or i will be caesar and if you lose my armies will still have their chance to plunder the roman lands between here and constantinople that is true i said but if i win as i expect to do your armies will have to come back here without plundering their way home we will be allies then and allies do not ravage each others lands and then unable to contain my eagerness another instant i burst out when shall we move against the queen of cities nomads i knew were always ready to ride out at a moments notice but tervel said in ten days or perhaps half a month i have sent messengers to my cousins to the south and west asking them if their men will ride with us you cannot simply order them to ride i said in some surprise if you romans invaded us we would all stand together he answered but i cannot tell them to take their men to war outside their grazing grounds i hope they will join us though i will reward them if they do i said bowing again i added but not so richly as i will reward you good enough tervel said may it be so again though he sounded less concerned than he might have as ibouzeros gliabanos had before him he purposed using me for his own ends his lands marching with those of the roman empire he could use my cause as a plausible excuse for what would in fact be an invasion i regretted the evils the empire would suffer as a result but saw no alternative i had come too far to go back forward was the only way left when we marched we marched without tervels cousins though my war against them after i had subdued the sklavenoi lay many years in the past the bulgars inhabiting the lands near the former sklavinias still remembered me with something less than fondness we do not trust the emperor with the cutoff nose one of them told tervel if you are wise you will not trust him either under other circumstances i should have been flattered at the bulgars still fearing me after so long as things were i mourned the support i would not have tervel did not fret about trusting me he had no need to fret i was in his power if i displeased him or alarmed him he would put me to death and that would be that the bulgars who did ride with us i am sure had their minds more on loot and rape and murder than on restoring me to the throne of the roman empire any soldiers are more apt to dwell on the pleasures of their trade than on the purposes for which their rulers employ them as we rode south toward the mountains the landscape took on a familiar look or so i thought at any rate although i had seen a great many landscapes since not wanting to put the question to tervel i asked myakes are we not heading toward the pass we used to get back into romania when we were campaigning against the bulgars i think we are he answered ill tell you something else too im bloody glad weve got the bulgars with us this time not trying to keep us here so am i i told him instead of showing proper march discipline the bulgars straggled out across the land as if they were the flocks they tended if one of them spied a rabbit in the grass he would ride off and try to kill it eventually either rejoining his comrades or not as he thought best but the more i associated with the nomads the more i came to respect them as warriors their horses seemed tireless and subsisted on what they pulled from the ground as they traveled the men were no less hardy going on long after romans or arabs would have had to halt having noted this same endurance among the khazars i was pleased to have it at my disposal no i overstate that the bulgars were not at my disposal they were at tervels disposal when we traversed the pass in the haimos mountains and entered roman territory he sent them out broadcast to plunder the countryside he had made no promises to keep them from doing so before i had regained my throne if i had to guess i would say he did not expect me to regain it i did not discuss this with him the event would prove him right or wrong roman frontier guards at the southern end of the pass rode forward to resist what they mistakenly took to be one of the many small bulgar raiding parties that had so troubled the land in the quartercentury since the barbarians as divine punishment for our sins succeeded in establishing themselves south of the danube now though i intended using the bulgars as divine punishment for apsimaross sin of usurpation and for that of leontios as well if he still lived on discovering we were a veritable army rather than a band of bandits the romans rode away far faster than they had ridden forward whooping the bulgars rode after them slaying a few and bringing a few back for questioning most of them were mardaites and other easterners whom i had resettled to hold this frontier i was somewhat irked to see them so incontinently flee but did not blame them overmuch they being so outnumbered justinian it is you one of them exclaimed in greek with a guttural syrian accent years on this chilly frontier had been unable to efface we heard they cut off your nose not that they just smashed it i saw you in sebasteia when you arranged to move us here have you come to take back the throne i have i declared whereupon the mardaite burst into cheers one of his companions however was imprudent enough to shout out tiberius apsimaros emperor of the romans two bulgars were holding the man i glanced at a third nearby who was not at that moment tending to any prisoners the bulgar drew a knife i nodded he plunged it into the frontier guards belly again and again the bulgars holding him let him fall writhing and shrieking to the weeds and dirt with his screams as background the rest of the mardaites wasted no time in acclaiming me some no doubt were satanically dissembling but i let them all go to spread word of my coming and i hoped and expected to bring more roman soldiers over to my side along with the bulgars a few of the barbarians grumbled at watching the prisoners leave their hands still intact and breathing but i said you have just entered the land of the romans do you think you will have no chances for sport later tervel shouted something in his own language the bulgars calmed themselves shifting to greek tervel told me you did right you are right the romans you let go will do us more good alive than they would give us amusement that was also my thought i replied and then pointing southward continued and now shall we ride on tervel dipped his head in agreement and waved to his host we followed the frontier guards into romania the main road running south and west from the pass toward adrianople and away from the queen of cities we abandoned it traveling south along the seacoast toward constantinople instead watching gentle waves slap against the shore i found myself thinking of anything but the gentle waves i had survived out on that same sea as we came down toward mesembria the most northerly of the roman coastal cities we discovered that most of the villages in our path had been abandoned myakes snorted saying those frontier guards you let go emperor they spread the news all right the news the bulgars were coming nobody cared whether you were with em or not people heard that they ran i fear youre right i answered no help for it now a little later tervel rode up to me shall we lay siege to mesembria he asked i shook my head no taking it gets us no closer to seizing the imperial city and besieging it wastes time we do not have this is sense he agreed after a moments thought if you fail we will capture this town on the way north in his mouth if you fail sounded like when you fail as with most men he did what he did primarily for his own purposes not out of any special charity of soul that evening we encamped only a couple of miles outside mesembria some of the bulgars rode out to pillage the suburbs beyond the wall and to my surprise one of the locals rode into our camp he did not come alone either but at the head of a flock of some five hundred sheep chivvied along by a couple of herdsmen who looked as if they wished they were somewhere anywhere else the man on horseback a young fellow probably born about the time i succeeded my father dismounted and prostrated himself before me in a loud voice he said emperor justinian i bring your army these sheep and with them i bring myself his greek had some of the same syrian flavor as that of the frontier guards the bulgars had captured rise i told him and he did with the fluid grace of a welltrained warrior i accept the sheep and i accept you as well i said tell me your name so that i may know whom i thank emperor he said my name is leo myakes yes brother elpidios that leo the one whos emperor now up till then nobody outside of mesembria had ever heard of him nor many folk inside mesembria either but he found himself a way to get noticed that he did when everybody else was running away from justinian he ran toward him what what would he have done if justinian had lost probably gone back to mesembria and tried like the devil to pretend he never had anything to do with him he likely would have got away with it too leo was the sort of fellow who could tell you the sun rose in the west and youd believe him yes youre right brother its just the same way as leo has moved against the holy icons as a matter of fact when he took the throne he swore he wouldnt fool around with the faith didnt he of course he did every emperor does but then a few years later he started going on about whether it was proper to make images at all and what was it last year year before last didnt he toss the patriarch out on his ear and put in his own man what leos chum anastasios isnt limber enough to lick his own privates like a dog so he licks leos instead im going to have to watch out for you brother elpidios every once in a while you can still surprise me yes of course i accept your apology its the christian thing to do after all if you want me to set you a penance why dont you read to me for longer than youd planned justinian well leo when i tell you i am pleased to meet you i want you to know im not saying it just for politeness sake i answered you are the first roman who has not only shown me my proper respect but also helped me toward getting my throne back on account of that i name you my spatharios here and now he bowed low his black eyes glowed in his narrow swarthy face emperor you are generous to me he said youve earned it i told him spatharios is a handy title the spatharios of a petty noble who brags of his authority makes everyone around him laugh an emperors spatharios on the other hand may be a person of considerable importance or he may not he may be a man with no more power than the petty nobles spatharius but one whom the emperor for whatever reason has chosen to honor with the title i had no idea which sort of spatharios leo would make if he proved useful to me i would give him power commensurate with his rank if not no harm done tell me of yourself i said if you say you were born in these parts ill be surprised smiling he shook his head i cannot emperor i spring from germanikeia on the edge of syria i was a little boy when my parents brought me here that would have been at your order wouldnt it so it would i agreed and now youve given me another reason to be glad for that order he bowed once more pleased at the compliment and i i was pleased at the mutton i shall not deny also being pleased at leo who though young seemed both clever and energetic i presented him to tervel as much to see how he would react as to honor him his eyes widened and he said khagan i tried to kill you once i shot an arrow at you when you came down raiding into romania but i missed when justinian came up raiding into the land of the bulgars i tried to kill him tervel returned he tried to kill me too i failed he failed you failed now we are together and now we shall not fail i said tervel and leo both nodded once we get down to constantinople i added the soldiers will abandon apsimaros the usurper returning their allegiance to me my family after all has ruled the empire for almost a hundred years what has this apsimaros done to make him worth keeping nothing i tell you nothing nothing my voice rose to a shout tervel and leo nodded again from mesembria down to the imperial city the army i and tervel led had but little fighting to do the bulgars who spoke greek perhaps one of them in four would smile broadly at me on that journey saying they fear us see how they fear us indeed they do i would answer not wanting to discourage them but while some of it may well have been fear on the part of my foes more i think was strategy constantinople had been attacked before but no foreign enemy had ever taken it in battle my greatgreatgrandfather however had put paid to a vile usurper i expected to do no less fewer roman soldiers than i s hould have liked abandoned apsimaros to come over to me many of those resuming the cause of their rightful master did so at the urging either of myakes whose acquaintance with some of their officers went back to the days before my throne was stolen from me or of leo who demonstrated for the first time but not the last a gift for persuasive speech remarkable in one of his years apsimaross men did not try to hold us at the long wall i thought briefly of philaretos my former fatherinlaw who had commanded the garrison along the wall and wondered if he still lived we reached constantinople on the seventh day after passing mesembria the last glimpse of the city i had had was from the deck of the dromon taking me freshly mutilated and half blind with pain off into exile apsimaros i remembered had captained that dromon one more requital needed coming home emperor myakes said pointing to the walls looming up over the southeastern horizon coming home i agreed ive been away too long we rode closer as the true height and length of constantinoples fortifications became clear to tervel he brought his horse close to mine i have seen roman cities he said men i have sent to the city here have told me of it as i said when you first came before me i always had trouble believing them now i see with my own eyes they were telling less than the truth not more we encamped outside the northern part of the city wall the tents of the bulgars and those romans who had joined us extending from blakhernai hard by the golden horn south and west as far as the kharisian gate about a quarter of the distance down toward the sea of marmara near that gate the aqueduct of valens enters the imperial city it has unfortunately been useless to constantinople since the days of my greatgreatgrandfather when the avars during their siege of the city destroyed almost a mile of it no emperor since had enjoyed the leisure or the resources to make the necessary repairs soldiers on both the outer and inner walls stared out toward us watching our every move mounting one of the ponies on which i had ridden down from the land the bulgars had stolen from us romans i approached the walls so i could speak to the warriors manning them being certain that once they were certain it was indeed i who came before them they would renounce apsimaros the illegitimate and acclaim me once more myakes rode with me offering his usual pragmatic advice dont draw within bowshot of the walls emperor if apsimaros hasnt put a price on your head im a big green sheep we already know he has put a price on my head i said he was willing enough to pay it to my brotherinlaw thats certain and as for the confidence you show in me i do thank you very much myakes blew air out through his lips a snorting sound likelier to come from a horse than a man tervel rode along too a few paces behind me though wishing he had stayed in our camp i could hardly tell him so he having served as my benefactor since i arrived in his country seeking aid but i did not want him to see me fail and feared his presence would make me more likely to do so with no help for it i rode on ignoring him as best i could also ignoring myakes i drew close to the walls close enough to let the soldiers see me to let the veterans among them recognize me and to remind them of where their loyalty should lie they stirred up on the walls waiting for me to speak they could have pincushioned me with arrows but no one shot i took that for a good sign tervel prudently had stopped at the distance myakes had suggested for me myakes himself whatever he thought of my boldness remained at my side i am justinian emperor of the romans i shouted to the soldiers justinian son of constantine son of constans son of herakleios constantine son of herakleios of the house that saved the roman empire from the fireworshiping persians and the followers of the false prophet both i have returned to reclaim the throne rightfully mine for a moment only silence followed my words i quietly sat my horse awaiting the great roar of approbation and delight that would lead to opened gates and to my sweeping back to power from the top of the outer wall a soldier cried hey justinian arent you missing a nose for this kind of duty the wretch the scoffing thersites could not have been above thirty yards from me he and his comrades could see perfectly well that i bore a nose which if perhaps less lovely than the magnificent appendage with which god had graced me was nonetheless adequate for all legitimate purposes including the purpose of establishing my own legitimacy as ruler but caring nothing for whether he lied or spoke the truth he continued to cast scorn on my physiognomy and emboldened by his licentious freedom of speech others showered me with differing sorts of insults how do you like riding the barbarian mare you bought one of them shouted i shook my fist at him that surely being a reference to theodora rather than to the gelding on which i was then mounted you come down here with an army of bulgars and you call yourself emperor of the romans another soldier said if you love them so well why dont you go off and be emperor of the bulgars more abuse and insults rained down from the walls at last a couple of soldiers shot arrows that stood thrilling in the dirt not far from my horses forefeet i rode away believing they would next shoot at me intending to hit not to miss tervels face remained impassive on my coming up to him they did not hail you as you hoped he said a statement of the obvious i could have done without they mocked your men as much as they mocked me i said tervel said nothing and his face continued to reveal nothing myakes suffered one of his unfortunate unbecoming and untimely coughing fits despite that my own words gave me an idea let the romans come forward i told tervel let them and me go up and down the whole length of the wall showing the garrison that romans do support me and persuading the soldiers to abandon the usurper and return to me we will do this tervel said with no hesitation i could discern it is the best hope you have how good a hope it was he did not express an opinion nor did he say what he might do if it failed the next morning small bands of romans rode up and down the length of the wall haranguing the soldiers inside the city and urging them to come over to my cause accompanied by myakes and at his usual discreet interval by tervel i myself traveled down past the kharisian gate the southern limit of the bulgars encampment i spoke as i had on first approaching the city walls now myakes added his voice to mine among others the formidable leo was speaking on my behalf elsewhere along the walls if i could not persuade the soldiers myself i reckoned the two of them most likely to do it for me what sort of promises apsimaros was making inside the imperial city i cannot say with certainty whatever they were they and the familiarity of having been ruled for seven years by the usurper kept the soldiers on the walls from going over to me i judged them to feel a certain amount of sympathy for my cause as none of them no matter how close i approached tried to slay me with an arrow or a stone flung from a catapult but none of them made any move to admit me into constantinople either nor did i note any signs of strife among them implying one faction wished to do so but was prevented by another having shouted myself hoarse to no visible effect i returned dejected to the encampment the bulgars had established shortly thereafter leo also rode into camp what news i called to him this was foolishness on my part for any news he had worth giving would have been sent to me on the instant knowing as much now however did nothing to help me then leo shook his head im sorry emperor he said they seem very stupid and stubborn justinian how are we going to get into the city tervel said by my sword everything i had heard of these walls is only a piece of the truth i would be mad to throw my army at them i did not ask you to do that i answered i had not asked because i did not think he would do it and i did not think an attack would succeed if he did do it i had not adequately considered the walls from outside until then when i was a child the arabs had assailed the queen of cities with siege engines of the sort the bulgars lacked and to no avail they had also challenged us romans on the sea where the bulgars had no ships whatever tervel had that same thought in a different context saying we cannot make this city starve either not when boats bring in food in spite of everything we are able to do on land in truth we could not do that much on land either lacking as we did the manpower to extend a tight siege line along the whole length of the wall i had counted on the soldiers renouncing apsimaros at my return to find that hope mistaken was a bitter blow cant hardly quit now myakes declared weve come too far for that yes tervel said but i liked neither his tone of voice nor the look on his face he could quit our venture without a qualm return to the lands north of the haimos mountains and by means of booty and slaves taken reckon the raid a success he could take me with him to use as pretext whenever he cared to attack romania again only gaining the city now would keep me from that fate but how to gain it well try again tomorrow i said with luck sounding more confident than i felt i went to different parts of the wall that next day traveling past the golden gate down toward the sea of marmara in my effort to persuade the soldiery with in the queen of cities to abandon the usurper and return to their rightful and proper affiliation i had no more success however than i had enjoyed or rather not enjoyed on previous days some soldiers continued to revile me on the grounds that i was noseless despite the refutation of that argument being there before their eyes more cursed me for having come with a host of bulgars at my back to that charge i found myself hardpressed to respond perhaps i should have been received more favorably had i come straight down to constantinople in moropauloss fishing boat at the time i began the journey i had thought it more likely i would be seized and beheaded that still struck me as having been highly likely in any case i had no choice the die as julius caesar said was cast i harangued the soldiers on the walls from first light of dawn till dusk deepened into night they would not open the gates for me more dejected than i had ever been in all my life even in the black days shortly after my mutilation i rode back toward tervels encampment back past the golden gate back past the kharisian gate back past the ruins of the aqueduct of valens my supporters seemed as downhearted as i was the men from kherson had marveled no less than tervel at seeing constantinople now though its splendor took on a sinister meaning for them how are you going to get in there emperor if they wont open up barisbakourios asked gloomily whatever you do emperor its going to take something special leo agreed he had again been unable to persuade the garrison to renounce the usurper tervel stood listening quietly to our conversation eventually the khagan of the bulgars would suggest withdrawing to the lands he ruled the lands north of the mountains i saw no choice ahead but to go with him to pursue my dream even as it receded before me to become the glove inside which rested his hand part of me would die every day but the breathing husk that remained would be enough for him and to spare moropaulos in his earnest dull way ticked off points on his fingers we cant go over the walls were not hawks we cant go under the walls were not moles he knew nothing of mining but the bulgars knew nothing of mining either which made him correct he went on we cant go through the walls were not woodpeckers he laughed but only for a moment then his heavy face curdled to sadness that doesnt leave anything the rest of my followers looked similarly dejected so did tervel although art might have substituted for emotion on his features for one moment downheartedness threatened to overwhelm me too then ever so slowly i straightened where before i had slumped we are not hawks i said in a voice that made my comrades turn toward me and pay my words close heed we are not moles but perhaps by god and his mother we can be woodpeckers only person a wood peckerd do any good is a eunuch myakes said i glared at him so fiercely that he subsided mumbling apologies pointing south toward the aqueduct of valens i said the channel there does not bring water into the imperial city these days nor has it for eighty years or so but it still goes into constantinople god willing so shall we what if they have guards in there emperor stephen exclaimed then well fight them i replied then theyll kill us i thought but i never remember guards being posted in the aqueduct do you myakes where a moment before he had been good for nothing but making crude jokes now he sounded surprisingly thoughtful no emperor i dont not ever nobody thinks about the aqueduct not these days i was thinking about it thinking about the prospect of making my way through several hundred yards of pitchblack pipe i wondered how big around the pipe was would i be able to stand upright in it or would i have to crawl all that way if i did have to crawl finding guards there was less likely but who could guess what might have denned there in the many years since water had stopped flowing whos with me i asked deliberately not thinking of any of these things faithful myakes spoke first i think but he beat out my followers from kherson and also leo by only a fragment of a heartbeat none of the other romans who had joined me since i came down with the bulgars said a word neither did tervel i tried to make out his expression in the fading light tried and failed was he discomfited at seeing what he had reckoned certain failure suddenly sparked with another chance at success if he was he was not so discomfited as to keep me from making the effort on the other hand he did not offer any aid either he simply stood aside and let me and my backers do as we would washed his hands of us so to speak as pilate had done with our lord all the risks were ours and all the planning was ours too not i must say that much planning was involved we had to get up into the opening go through the pipe and get down into the city it would be simple or it would be impossible torches stephen said so we can see what no i cut him off pointing toward the aqueduct once more i continued we have no way to tell whether bricks have fallen out or mortar come loose or whether the pipe itself has cracked if the usurpers soldiers see light in the aqueduct whether everything has been dark and quiet since my greatgreatgrandfathers day theyll be waiting for us inside the city and that will be the end of everything all that way in the dark theophilos shuddered though dreading that myself i told him stay here then my voice i daresay had a lash to it having seen what might be a way into the city i was wild to try it a pry bar myakes exclaimed no telling what well have to move i know where to get one leo said that i confess made me raise my eyebrows this was only the third day on which he had been in the neighborhood of the imperial city but he hurried away with every sign of confidence my new spatharios was proving a man of no small resourcefulness rope too myakes called after him he waved to show he had heard to me myakes said ropell give us a way down where we might not have one otherwise leo came back a few minutes later with a coil of rope around one arm and a stout iron crowbar about a cubit long in his other hand excellent i said and then turned to tervel have we a ladder tall enough to let us climb up into the water channel of that aqueduct i dont know he answered when he seemed inclined to say no more i folded my arms across my chest making it plain i should not be satisfied without his giving me a more responsive reply grudgingly he went on i will see if we do not we can make one by lashing two or three shorter ones together good enough i said now i have one more favor to ask of you what is it he did not sound happy what he sounded like was a man who felt what he had thought to be a puppet jerking his arm when we go up into the pipe i want your men to attack the wall i told him i want them to make an enormous din so any noise from us goes unnoticed when he simply stood there saying neither yes nor no i added by this time tomorrow you will be revealed either as my soninlaw or as a caesar of the roman empire his face did not show what he thought it seldom did up in the country he ruled he had seemed hopeful about my prospects but that hope must have faded when few romans came over to me and faded again when the garrison of the imperial city held it closed against me maybe hope revived in him maybe he simply thought he would be rid of me i shall do it he said the ladders the bulgars had were not long enough when they lashed two of them together the resulting contraption still had a bend in the middle on being forced more or less upright as a mans leg has a bend at the knee my followers examined it with doubts that had they been applied to religion would have amounted to wicked atheism although having those same doubts myself i suppressed them it will serve i insisted it does not have to hold us long only long enough to get us up into the aqueduct i wanted to wait until midnight to enter the aqueduct but was persuaded to begin earlier around the start of the fourth hour of the night because i had no way of knowing how long the journey through the channel would take i hoped to drop down into constantinople while it was still dark so as to be able to pick for myself the way in which i would first confront the soldiers and people of the city several grunting bulgars carried the spliced ladder to the base of the ruined aqueduct and raised it high i wonder if they should have joined three not two together it being barely long enough for its required purpose changing matters at that point though would have taken time i did not wish to spend i started up the ladder it did flex at that joint as a mans knee might have done i climbed as fast as i could if it broke under my weight and sent me tumbling to the ground drama would turn to unseemly farce in the blink of an eye it held gasping i got to the top i reached into the opening of the channel which was something less than a yard wide a tiny thing seemingly to have supplied the imperial city with so much water my fingers closed over sticks and twigs i threw the birds nest away and scrambled up into the pipe it was too narrow for me to turn around in it im in i shouted almost as if i had entered a woman i had to hope they would hear me down below the ladder scraped against the broken end of the aqueduct someone else was on it i scuttled farther down the pipe to give whoever it was room to climb in dont put more than one man on this cursed thing at a time it was myakes voice i might have known he would let no one come between me and him cursing he made it into the pipe in the same ungainly way i had used you there emperor im here his bulky body cut off what little light had come from the opening of the channel well both move down now that came none too soon for someone else was already climbing toward us barisbakourios followed by stephen then leo then moropaulos with theophilos last of all by the time theophilos joined us i was some distance down the pipe moving ahead in utter darkness some men i have heard suffer a deadly fear of being enclosed in a small space had any such sufferer been among us he would without a doubt have gone screaming mad not only were we literally in a space of small compass again and again banging our heads or barking our backs when we rose up more than the pipe would permit but it seemed even smaller than it was because of the utter lightlessness there it would have been easy to imagine the pipe closing in on us until it squeezed us as an aesculapian snake squeezes a rat fortunately none of us was afflicted by this sort of morbid imagining myakes brother elpidios i tell you the truth i never came so close to pissing myself as i did in that damned pipe i was blinder then than i am now i can tell the difference between light and dark to this day i cant see anything mind you but i can tell the difference there wasnt any difference to tell not inside that pipe there wasnt it was all black nothing else but i would have had the screaming hobgoblins in there i think if it hadnt been for justinian what no he didnt pat me on the shoulder and keep me brave or anything like that yes ill tell you what i mean if you let me brother what i mean is if id gone to pieces in there i figured hed tell somebody to cut my throat or knock me over the head and then everybody behind me would have crawled over my body and gone on let me put it like this frightened as i was part of me knew it wasnt a real fear if you know what i mean i was doing it to myself i could feel i was doing it to myself i couldnt stop doing it but i could slow me down a little and i knew being afraid of justinian was a real fear cant think of one any realer not offhand stand between him and getting into the city then and youd end up with footprints up your front and down your back and a knee in the balls for good measure was i more afraid of justinian than my own imagination brother elpidios youd best believe i was you would have been too justinian we were not the only living things in the aqueduct pipeway i have spoken of the nest my hand found when i climbed off the ladder a couple of bats flapped past me too squeaking indignantly at having their seclusion disturbed hitting out at them i succeeded only in barking my knuckles skitterings told me mice or rats had climbed the masonry of the wrecked aqueduct to make their homes in the pipe none of them ran toward me they all fled away sensing that i and the men with me were larger and more dangerous than they i crawled headfirst through spiderwebs beyond number wondering what their patient weavers found to eat in this dark wretched hole more than one spider dropped down onto me and crawled away at first i swatted at them but finding crushing their soft hairy bodies more revolting than letting them run on me i soon desisted soft cries of disgust from my followers said not all the eightlegged creatures were descending on me how far had i come in the stygian darkness i had no sure way to judge something like panic ran through me was it a spearcast a bowshot a mile had we reached the wall had we passed it i stopped myakes promptly ran into me each of the others colliding in turn with the man in front of him wait i said quiet echoing weirdly up the tube through which we crawled came the sounds of battle tervel then had kept his pledge to me but so attenuated were the sounds i could not use them to judge how far or how long we had traveled on asking my companions i discovered that their opinions varied so widely as to be of little value the argument threatened to engulf us as thoroughly as darkness had done wait i said again let us assume weve come about a bowshot say two hundred fifty cubits that was in the middle range of the guesses they had put forth from now on i will keep track of how many times my right leg advances for each of those times i will add one cubit it will not be a perfect reckoning but better than the nothing we have now no one argued with me i was in the lead i had a plan where the rest had none and i was the emperor muttering under my breath to keep the count straight i moved on once more they followed if my beginning guess was right we should have been approaching the outer wall setting my ear against the rough side of the pipe i tried to find out whether i could hear the romans who were resisting the bulgars onslaught all i could make out was my own blood pounding sighing i went on at the count of i believe three hundred seventeen my hand came up against an obstruction a moment later my head ran into it too hold up i said to myakes and the rest behind me i felt of the obstruction it was an iron grate rough and scaly with rust under my fingers at some time after the avars had worked their destruction then roman engineers had done their best to make sure no one could do as i was doing by the feel of the iron though it had been a long time ago and forgotten since explaining what i had found i ordered pass the pry bar up to me leo who was still carrying it handed it to stephen from whom it went to barisbakourios myakes and me the artisans who had installed the grating had cut holes into the channel in which they inserted the ends of the bars of the grill working as they had been doing under cramped difficult circumstances they had not made the fit perfect as they otherwise might have done that carelessness and perhaps the feeling that they were taking needless precautions caused them to leave space into which i could set the pointed beak of the pry bar using it was not easy even after having set it in place if i could have stood on my knees i would have been in excellent position to exert full leverage the pipe was too low and narrow to permit that however i had to lie at full length as both my arms which otherwise would have supported me were engaged in prying with a sharp snapping sound a piece of the grate flew off it hit me in the back and then hit myakes in the head we both cursed there in the cramped blackness i tugged at the grate it still refusing to come free i used the pry bar once more when the next chunk of rusted iron broke away it hit me in the head i felt blood trickling through my scalp i tugged again the grate shifted under my hands but remained in place i had to break off two more pieces of iron before i could wrestle it out of its position even then it being essentially as wide as the channel in which it was set i could not simply put it to one side i and my followers had to scramble over or under it to advance moropaulos the bulkiest of us had a dreadful time i feared he might prove a cork in the bottle for theophilos but at last he made it past the grate then i had to remember the count of cubits in my exertions i had for the moment lost the exact number but i did not admit that to myakes and the rest of them on we went one obstacle overcome fortyseven cubits or rather fortyseven advances of my right leg later i ran headlong into another grate i hissed in pain it having struck close by the place where the chunk from the first grate had hit me this new grate was as scabrous with rust as the first had been since i now carried the pry bar i went straight to work i needed to break the grate at only three places before becoming able to shift it once we had all struggled past i said if my reckoning is true weve passed beyond the inner wall and are now inside the city theophilos started to raise a cheer myakes hissed shut up curse you or were all dead inside the city we crawled on having come so far i began to wonder how i would be able to leave the aqueduct dropping down into a cistern half full of water from other sources although it might clean us of the filth through which we had been traveling struck me as being less than ideal but god who had heard my pledge and saved me from the storm provided for me once more looking ahead i spied on the inside of the pipe a short strip of light in what had been darkness absolute and impenetrable hurrying to it as best i could hurry in that cramped place i discovered a door had been set into the roof of the channel no doubt for the convenience of workmen who might have to enter to clear obstructions like everything else pertaining to the aqueduct the door had not been cared for since my greatgreatgrandfathers day its timbers had shrunk and split allowing a little moonlight to pierce the darkness i wondered if we had crawled past other doors in better repair but then decided i did not wish to know crawling past this door i rolled over onto my back using my legs to push up against the boards had it been latched i would have attacked it with the pry bar but it swung back easily i stood upright savoring that position and looked around to get my bearings considering how far we had come in the blackness my reckoning proved quite good we were about a bowshot inside the inner wall and considerably less than that distance from a large cistern as well i had found the doorway i thought anyone trying to find out what that noise was myakes hissed from inside the pipe i cant see anyone i answered pass me the rope ill make it fast to one of the hinges here and we can all climb down no i have a better idea myakes said moropaulos is a big strong fellow let him hold the rope while the rest of us go down then he can tie it to a hinge and climb down himself that way we only have to trust the old iron once not seven times his plan indeed being better than mine we adopted it forthwith the rest of us crawled up onto the top of the aqueduct moropaulos stood in the doorway the better to brace himself i had intended to be first man down but myakes again took the lead from me i do not know to this day whether he was testing foolish pauls strength or making sure no opposition waited below whichever it was he soon called alls well emperor your citys here waiting for you i went down hand over hand having first wrapped the rope around my leg and over the top of my instep to give myself some additional purchase should a hand slip a minute later i stood in an unpaved alleyway in constantinople a stones throw north of the mese ive returned i whispered as if saying it was what made it true leo descended next then stephen barisbakourios and theophilos foolish pauls feet were a mans height above the ground when the iron hinge to which hed tied the rope tore free of the cement and bricks under his weight he landed with a thud and a shout the rope streaming down after him he scraped one knee through all our knees were already raw from a longer crawl than ever we had done as infants but praise god was otherwise unhurt i looked at all my companions in the moonlight the pale radiance sufficed to show how filthy and tattered they were which doubtless meant i was filthy and tattered as well seven men to overthrow the greatest city in the civilized world one of the pagan dramatists of athens wrote a play about seven men against a city but i recall neither the playwright nor the city the seven men opposed well go to the mese i said well find a fountain on a street corner and clean ourselves as best we can then well go to the grand palace well get inside any way we can and then well slay apsimaros with my rival dead i reasoned no one would oppose my reassuming the throne rightfully mine no one moved i barked at my followers barisbakourios said emperor this is your city we dont know which way to go he kept looking around even here down on the ground i dont think i believed all your stories of the imperial city the ones youd tell back in kherson but you meant them didnt you of course i did i answered setting out for the chief boulevard of the city myakes strode along beside me constantinople also being familiar to him the others even leo followed slowly cautiously as if on the verge of being overwhelmed by the size and magnificence of the city through which they walked they exclaimed in wonder at the length and width and paving of the mese and at so many people being on the street at an hour well past midnight we were a large enough group to deter robbers and also large enough for others to think us robbers and depart in haste grimy as we were a couple of whores came up to us they hissed curses at me when i sent them away we lacked the time for even the most pleasant distractions while we were splashing water on our faces at a fountain a squadron of horse came riding along the mese toward the walls their harness jingling when the light from the torches they carried fell on us their leader called here you men who are you had i listened to reason i should have either fled or lied if reason spoke to me i heard nothing at last back in my beloved city i drew myself up proudly and said i am justinian emperor of the romans the son of constantine son of constans son of herakleios constantine son of herakleios who sir are you the officers chin dropped to his chest so did myakes leo i remember clapped his hands together once twice admiring my audacity had the officer and his soldiers been perfectly loyal to the usurper they could have cut me down where i stood the fellows mouth worked when he spoke though he gave no order to attack instead whispering holy virgin mother of god i have returned to take back my throne i said and drew my sword will you stand by me or will you fight smashing a lump of quicksilver with a hammer could have created no greater scattering than did my words a couple of the riders wheeled their mounts and galloped back toward the palace crying justinian is in the city the emperor is in the city they might have thought they were warning apsimaros but by those cries their hearts knew who their true sovereign was others galloped away down side streets few of those said anything at all my guess was that they aimed to sit out whatever turmoil sprang into being as a result of my sudden and unexpected arrival then obey the orders of whoever finally seized control of the throne still others that astonished officer among them rode forward on the route the whole squadron had been taking they too shouted my name and some of them intending to do so or not also shouted that i was emperor and eight or ten men did not ride off in any direction bowing in the saddle to me one of them exclaimed command us emperor over the long years of exile in kherson myakes had rehearsed for me many times how leontios and his henchmen had seized control of the imperial city the night i was overthrown now i could imitate the blow that had toppled me ride through the streets of the city i told the horsemen shout my name raise a great commotion let everyone know i have returned and i am in the city tell anyone who wants to help to do as you are doing and rouse the people emperor we will they declared as one man and they rode off in all directions shouting my name at the top of their lungs what now emperor myakes asked first the palace i answered once we lay hold of the usurper the game is ours then we seize kallinikos hungry anticipation filled my voice we trotted along the mese toward the palace which lies close by the sea as we moved confusion spread all around us people spilled into the street many of them still in their nightshirts more and more of them began shouting my name some in disbelief others in delight we ran on had the soldiers on the wall united against me i still could have been thwarted but some of them favored me while others did not the result being that no one did anything they did i will say maintain their watch against my bulgar allies that being a matter of most elementary prudence my comrades all save myakes to whom the splendid buildings and plazas and monuments adorning the queen of cities were familiar exclaimed again and again at them they exclaimed at the column of markianos at the church of st polyeuktos on the other side of the street at the praitorion at the round forum of constantine at the church of st euphemia and the bulk of the hippodrome beyond it i exclaimed at the hippodrome too in hatred having last seen it when my blood spilled into the dirt there they were just beginning to exclaim at the milion at the end of the mese and at the church of the holy wisdom not far past when i refusing to be distracted led them south off the mese toward the palace gawk later i said harshly torches and bonfires blazed all around the palace a low rambling building people streamed in and out some soldiers some not i had never seen never dreamed of such activity late at night the palace might have been an anthill stirred by a stick before long thanks to the abundant light someone spied me and my followers and loosed a nervous challenge who comes justinian emperor of the romans i shouted back audacity and only audacity had brought me so far never again would i put my faith in anything else myakes plucked at my torn sleeve emperor they outnumber us a hundred to one if they shut up i snapped for everyone who had heard my voice was staring my way i brandished my sword as if to say i would cut down the first man who dared defy my right to rule still sounding very nervous indeed the fellow who had challenged me said the emperor uh tiberius uh apsimaros uh the usurper hearing you had somehow sneaked into uh come into the imperial he uh well he took flight is what he did half an hour ago cant be more so uh the palace is yours welcome uh welcome home justinian emperor of the romans tu vincas justinian people shouted as if i were being acclaimed for the first time i waved the sword again silence fell i might have slashed at speech i am not becoming emperor of the romans i said i am emperor of the romans i have been emperor of the romans all this is mine by right for ten long lonely dreadful years i had said that in kherson in doros in atil in phanagoria in the land of the bulgars how many had believed me i had half a dozen men at my back here no more but i had been right all along book d justinian as word spread from the palace that apsimaros had run away both those who had thought to stay loyal to him and the cursed lukewarm saw i looked like winning and came over to me by sunrise fighting had ceased by sunrise also i had ordered a housetohouse search for the fugitive usurper alas it did not catch him in its net a naval officer before presuming to advance his station he escaped the city in a small boat i offered a large reward to anyone who would bring him to me alive or if not i said his head will do i laughed how i laughed my mother wept to see me even though by the time she did i had changed from the filthy tunic in which i entered constantinople into a robe suited for the emperor of the romans we embraced as if we had never exchanged harsh words my son she said and then proving herself of my house in spirit if not in blood you are avenged not yet i answered not fully not till apsimaros stands before me loaded with chains but he will i smacked one fist into the other palm and leontios and kallinikos are already in the hollow of my hand i smiled anticipating your face she said sadly your poor face it could be worse i told her leontios is uglier than i am these days by all i hear and hell be uglier yet when im through with him i changed the subject tell me my daughter epiphaneia is she well my mothers face glowed as if a lamp shone through it she is indeed do you know i think this may be the first time you have ever asked after her is she wed i persisted wondering which half of my bargain i would have to keep with tervel no my mother replied neither of the usurpers would permit her betrothal they feared any man who married her would plot against them because of who she was and of course she was still very young while leontios disgraced the throne in fact she good i interrupted her if she is unwed i can marry her off to tervel the bulgar to repay him for the men who helped put me back on the throne without those men i never would have been able to approach the city and enter the pipe that brought me into it tervel might not have been confident of my triumph but had helped make it possible and his army remained encamped just beyond the wall keeping our bargain seemed the better part of wisdom you would give the child of your flesh to minister to the lusts of a barbarian my mother whispered turning pale it cannot be if she is still unmarried it shall be i said its either that or let tervel tear up the countryside and break my oath to him too it cannot be my mother repeated more firmly this time as she judged herself unlikely to be allowed to wed a man she became a bride of christ year before last and dwells in the nunnery dedicated to the mother of god near the forum of arkadios in that case youre right it cannot be i agreed ill have to name the bulgar caesar instead she began to gabble at that too so i left her not even the emperors mother may scold him against his will a telling proof of the power inherent in the imperial dignity on leaving her i intended to go and speak with tervel but leo and some city folk i did not know hailed kallinikos before me emperor cried the patriarch prostrating himself before me when his captives released him so he could do so congratulations on your glorious return to the imperial city i stared at him he was i saw to my astonishment so base of soul as to be absolutely sincere he had abandoned me to consecrate leontios abandoned leontios to crown apsimaros and now stood ready or rather sprawled ready to abandon apsimaros for me once more he had the perfect temperament for a whore a patriarch however needed judging by different standards wretch i shouted and kicked him in the face not hard not even hard enough to break his nose you are the spineless slug who announced leontioss accession with the opening words of the easter service as if he were christ come again and now you think you can serve me once more you have never been so wrong in all your life and that says a great deal mercy he wailed as he should have done from the beginning not that it would have helped him not that anything would have helped him when i was coming down to constantinople i swore a great oath to have mercy on none of my enemies i replied he shrank in on himself like a loaf of bread falling when the oven door opens at the wrong time then thoughtfully i asked has the pope in rome yet accepted the canons of my fifthsixth synod blood dripped down his cheek where i had kicked him though he still groveled on his belly before me his face showed sudden hope no emperor the wicked stubborn fellow has not he still thunders defiance at the synod inspired by the holy spirit only spare me and i shall send anathemas against him that be silent i told him and he was silent after some little while passed in thought i snapped my fingers and smiled i have it the very thing excommunication kallinikos asked a drastic step emperor but should you require it i be silent i said again and then spoke to leo take him to the executioners let him be blinded with redhot irons and then let him be exiled to rome thus i not only punish his betrayal but also warn the pope whatever his name is these days kallinikos did not answer past bleating like a ram as it is made into a wether no one else knew shrugging i went on whoever the pope is he needs to remember i have my eye on him i pointed to kallinikos take this offal away away he went still bleating i never saw him again he never saw anything again leo was laughing as he led him thither youll need a new patriarch now myakes remarked i know i answered i have the man too one who was loyal to me at cost to himself not disloyal at gain for himself myakes looked sly i know what youre going to do youre going to name cyrus thats just what im going to do i said he was loyal to me how can i be anything but loyal to him hes earned the patriarchal throne hell be glad to get out of kherson too what man wouldnt but first things first i started out of the palace on the mission i had begun when the matter of kallinikos interrupted me i have to see tervel looking down from the wall at the khagan of the bulgars i saw him and his army in a light different from that in which i had viewed him when we marched on constantinople together all the gates of the imperial city remained barred against the bulgars as against any other barbarians from a couple of steps beyond the ditch in front of the wall tervel waved to me you are on your throne again well done the words were fulsome enough the tonea the tone was that a man uses when a friend has some unexpected piece of good fortune fall into his lap he is glad for his friend no doubt but cannot help wondering why the good fortune did not come to him instead i am on my throne again i agreed wishing i could repudiate every promise i had made but with apsimaros uncaptured with his brother herakleios an important commander in anatolia i could not afford to affront the bulgars now i can give you what i swore would be yours now he hesitated before speaking he had not thought i should be in a position where i had to make good on my promises in such a position i think i startled him by doing so carefully he said you will give me your daughter to wed no i cannot do that i said i learn that she is a nun and does not wish to come forth from her convent but i told you that if the marriage could not be i would make you caesar and that i will do and gladly come into the city in a weeks time and i will grant you the robe and crown of your office and rich gifts besides my men who have come so far for you would like to see the city before then he said they may i said and he brightened doubtless hoping i would be foolish enough to allow his whole army into constantinople at once thereby giving him the chance to seize it quickly i laid that hope to rest they may enter in parties of a hundred and two hundred may be in the city at any one time i will stock taverns where they may drink their fill for free but if they rob or rape or kill i will punish them as if they were romans agreed agreed he answered i was not lavish but neither was i so niggardly as to rouse wrath and now i held the queen of cities to show him i would abide by my pledge i ordered the kharisian gate opened at once that he might send his first contingent of bulgars into the city the nomads stared in astonishment at constantinople they being even less prepared for its magnificence than my followers from kherson seeing their wonder i smiled and turned to myakes who had accompanied me out to the wall i wonder what theodora will have to say about the imperial city here thinking she knows all about cities because she has seen phanagoria that will be something all right emperor myakes agreed he was watching the bulgars coming into constantinople when he saw roman soldiers accompanying most of them as guides and though it remained unsaid to keep them out of mischief he relaxed in thoughtful tones he asked have you talked to the lady your mother about marrying the khazar not yet i answered then thoughtful myself i went on i think for the time being i shall dwell in the palace at blakhernai here in the northwestern part of the city it will put me close to the encampment of my allies the bulgars uhhuh myakes said a peculiar noise difficult to transcribe in greek letters i took it to mean he was of the opinion i chose that course not because it left me close to the bulgars but because it left me far from my mother such speculation i refused to dignify with a reply when i went to the palace in the blakhernai district i found only a handful of servants and slaves there both leontios and apsimaros having been in the habit of residing in the grand palace but many of the servitors there were men and women and eunuchs i had known before my exile one of the eunuchs explained why that was so if we were thought to be loyal to you emperor but the usurpers could not prove treason against us they sent us away from their presence to a place where nothing was ever likely to happen they did the same to me i exclaimed and the chamberlain bowed low my exile had been harsher than his but not even auriabedas could have repaired his mutilation i discussed with the eunuchs at the blakhernai palace my plan for raising tervel to the rank of caesar the one who had explained why i found so many familiar faces there a certain theophylaktos said where shall we get the proper regalia emperor no one in your house has ever named caesars only junior emperors we have no proper crowns we have no proper robesa besides such concerns that tervel was a barbarous bulgar faded into insignificance for him take one of my uncles crowns and cut off the cross atop it i said tervel knows thats the difference between an emperors crown and a caesars because i told him as much since weve had no caesars for so long no one in the imperial city will know any more than that true theophylaktos said sounding surprised at having the matter so abruptly settled then he looked worried once more but what of the robe this tervel is supposed to wear the moths will surely have had their way with so what i said well put him in an imperial robe no one will know if thats not perfectly proper either and no one will care well say its a caesars robe tervel will be wearing a caesars crown and were proclaiming him caesar that should settle things most irregular the eunuch muttered but he bowed and composed himself to obey my entire return to constantinople had been most irregular but he did not mention that since i was now undisputed master of the imperial city anything i ordered became regular because i ordered it as i had commanded so it was done tervel and his guards quietly came into the city two days before that on which i would fulfill my promise to him during those two days he rode through as much of the city as he could so that i saw little of him i never believed my envoys he said as he had before now i see they said less than they might have done criers had also gone through the city ordering the people to appear before the palace of blakhernai at the start of the fourth hour of the day to see me create the new caesar as my father had crowned me so i intended to crown tervel myself since i was setting the crown on his head in my capacity as emperor the patriarchs presence was superfluous and dispensable as well too for kallinikos having tried and failed to reaccommodate himself to me after acquiescing in my overthrow and mutilation had already sailed off blinded into exile at rome i felt sure the ship bearing him would reach its destination safe with him aboard it would sail before any breeze palace servitors threw coins into the crowd around the rostrum the artisans had hastily erected in front of the blakhernai palace already the engraver cyril had provided coins bearing my image and the number twenty signifying the twentieth year of my reign by my reckoning i had never been rightfully removed and i intended making my reckoning that of the whole empire tu vincas justinian the people shouted as i strode forward to take my place on the platform they had acclaimed leontios and apsimaros as fervently as they now acclaimed me how i longed to turn soldiers romans and bulgars together loose on them to show them playing the prostitute had its price regretfully i set aside the notion having made other plans for the day i have conquered i said the wretch who stole my throne lies in prison while the pirate who robbed him of it in turn has shown his cowardice by fleeing the imperial city the house of herakleios is restored as god ordained they cheered loud and long they dared do nothing less some of them no doubt were examining their memories and their consciences wondering if i could learn they had cheered my overthrow ten years before they had been fools to cheer then but were not so foolish if they wondered thus i intended trying to learn exactly that when vengeance is godordained it must be thorough i have conquered i repeated and then made my voice go hard no thanks to you no thanks to any romans that i have my one true ally was tervel son of asparukh khagan of the bulgars upon him then i confer the rewards you romans might otherwise have claimed attend me tervel clad in a plain white tunic the khagan joined me on the platform he stared out in wonder at the multitude there to witness his aggrandizement in a soft voice he said i have never seen so many people gathered together in one place in all my life how do you feed them all we manage i answered and raised my voice once more people of constantinople i now raise tervel the bulgar to the rank of caesar in recognition of his services to me theophylaktos the eunuch draped an imperial robe glittering with pearls and gems and golden threads around the bulgars shoulders tervel grunted in surprise this thing is as heavy as armor he looked down at himself prettier than armor i will say he smiled with my own hands i set on his head the crossless crown of the caesar behold justinian emperor of the romans and tervel caesar i shouted to the gaping mob we are friends and allies joined against thieves and robbers with one accord the people prostrated themselves before the two of us men women and children alike so that we saw only their backs and the napes of their necks a headsman would have had an easy time of it striding through the crowds lopping heads as a farmer with a scythe cuts down wheat most of them i daresay deserved nothing better arise tervel shouted in a great voice his first and last command as caesar the people hastened to obey some of them shouted the acclamations traditional upon the accession of a caesar wishing him many years and good fortune those acclamations sounded thin though and not only because of going so long unused as to be halfforgotten some constantinopolitans i thought did not care to lavish such praise on a barbarian i had no great delight in doing as i did but having begun it did it as thoroughly as i could when tervel caesar returns to his own country i told the people we shall honor him with many presents gold and scarletdyed skins and pepper such are the presents that have pleased barbarians for hundreds of years tervel proved no exception to the ancient rule puffing out his chest and looking pleased the people cheered which made him even prouder than he had been i hid a smile he thought they were cheering his rank and my munificence knowing the city mob as i do i knew also that what delighted them most was the announcement that he would be leaving constantinople for his homeland that announcement delighted me less than it did the mob tervels having a country of his own a country carved out of roman territory remained galling a quarter of a century after the bulgars humiliating my father established themselves south of the danube to every thing there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven says the book of ecclesiastes for now tervel remained my friend and ally latera later would be a different season a few days later the khagan rode north his saddlebags nicely heavy with gold bulging with skins and packed with pepper the latter he reckoned as much a marvel as anything else he found in constantinople it bites the tongue he exclaimed on my serving him a kid roasted with peppercorns the sharp flavor made him drink immoderately a benefit he also appreciated i having kept my promise he kept his as well and restrained the bulgars from plundering as they rode north and why not he had made more profit dealing with me than he could have got by stealing from me that he kept his pledge by withdrawing peacefully also helped me secure my hold on the heart of the roman empire no small matter with apsimaros still at large rumor said he had sailed up toward thrace but rumor was not enough i wanted the usurper but apsimaros was not the only illegal ruler about whom i concerned myself one of my first actions on returning to the imperial city was to order leontioss guards not to tell him i had reclaimed that which was mine tervel having departed i went in full imperial regalia to the monastery of delmatos and commanded the usurped usurper brought before me down on your belly before the emperor of the romans my excubitores shouted and leontios prostrated himself in his filthy tunic the prison stench came off him in waves rise i said clumsily he got to his feet not only was he covered with dirt but his shaggy unkempt hair and beard which had had only a light frosting of gray ten years before were now snow but lightly dusted with soot in the center of his broad face was a broad hole the executioner had done a more thorough job on him than on me which disheartened me not in the least imprisonment having done nothing to quicken his wits he stared at me some little while before saying youre not apsimaros and following that a moment later with youre someone else finding he remained not only fatuous but also redundant made me laugh out loud a frown turned his features even uglier than they had been before i know your voice dont i i should think you would leontios i replied or shall i call you leo the lion i shook my head no no one else did his eyes went wide but not so wide as the hole where his nose had been justinian he exclaimed and made the sign of the cross as if he had seen a ghost but it isnt you cant you arent youve got i affirmed every one of his incoherent denials it is i i can rule i am emperor ive got a nose i smil ed at him you look remarkably hideous without one kyrie eleison leontios gasped turning pale beneath his grime christe eleison god and christ may have mercy on you i said but i shall have none and since that is at gods command my own guess is that the demons in hell will torment you through all eternity what you deserve for raising your hand against the emperor of the romans i spared your life he said i did not kill you you did not think you needed to kill me i told him the lesson i draw from that is not to make such mistakes myself having lost your nose you shall lose your head as well i gestured to the guards take him back to his cell now instead of every day being the same as the one before and the one after it a condition i knew all too well from my weary years in khersonhe has something to look forward to the guards laughed myakes laughed i laughed leontios the humorless wretch failed to see the joke a few weeks after my return to the imperial city a messenger still stinking of horse sweat dashed into the blakhernai palace shouting emperor emperor we have apsimaros although normally reckoning highly important the dignity of my office on that glad occasion i took no notice of it whatever letting loose a whoop of delight that made the tax official with whom i was talking jump in alarm is he alive or dead i demanded where was he taken up in apollonias on the coast of thrace the messenger answered rumor for once had spoken truly hes alive in chains and on the way down to the imperial city what happened was he paid for lodging up there with a nomisma that had his own face on it the tavern keeper recognized him and gave the word to the city garrison which had already declared for me i interrupted happily which had already declared for you the messenger agreed apsimaros was taken by surprise he never got his sword out of the scabbard a pound of gold for the news i said whereupon the messenger let out a whoop even louder than mine he started dancing where he stood the bureaucrat said emperor this news should also end any difficulties you have with herakleios apsimaross brother by the virgin thats true i exclaimed apsimaros it turned out had summoned herakleios from the military district of the anatolics on receiving word that the bulgars and i were advancing on constantinople intending to use his brother to command an army against me but by the time herakleios got the news and the force he brought with him sailed from southeastern anatolia the imperial city lay in my hands unable to land in the vicinity he had come ashore at abdera about halfway between constantinople and thessalonike i had feared he and the usurper would be able to unite against me but that would not happen now i had given barisbakourios a small army of my own drawn from the city garrison to maneuver against him and keep him from advancing toward the black sea coast the direction in which i believed accurately as it fell out apsimaros had fled when i shouted for couriers they came in exclaiming having heard the news the messenger from the north had brought i told them send word at once to barisbakourios let him make it known to the soldiers following herakleios that the false emperor they supported is now in my hands we shall see how long they go on following the fallen usurpers brother the couriers rode out within the hour i also sent riders to the military districts in anatolia with the same news so that any generals thinking of rising in support of apsimaros would be persuaded to think again i bade those latter riders learn which officers in the military districts were most favorably inclined toward the usurper and so long as they were able to do so without touching off rebellion arrest the traitors and send them back to constantinople for punishment apsimaros came into the city a few days later apollonias lying by the sea i had thought the men of the garrison would put him on board ship so he might get to constantinople faster but the commander of the cavalry company explained why they had not the son of a whore used to be a ship captain emperor who can say whether some of the sailors used to serve with him they might have helped him get loose my boys i know them emperor and i picked the best ones good enough i said on his explaining himself better than good enough in fact i turned to apsimaros have you got anything to say before i give you what you deserve for stealing my throne i did not steal your throne he answered in his peculiar gothic accent i took it from leontios who did not know what to do with it when it was mine i did well with it accent or not he had some courage and more in the way of brains than leontios could ever have aspired to it was not yours any more than it was leontioss i said and while you were on it you tried to get rid of me i wish i would have done it too he replied i should have flung you overboard when i was taking you to kherson worse luck i did not see the need he shook his head the chains with which he was adorned clanked mournfully at the motion take him to the monastery of delmatos i told his captors have them put him in the cell next to leontioss i am sure the two of them will have some interesting things to say to each other i laughed at the thought apsimaros said they cast you down because you were a cruel hard man you have not changed except to grow worse i may not live to see it but they will cast you down again no they wont i answered no one will everyone who is or might be or might become my foe will die before getting the chance to strike he started to speak again i hit him in the face and he fell silent to the soldiers i said take him away i am emperor of the romans the last word is mine when he was gone myakes said hes not like leontios that one im glad he panicked when he heard you were in the city if he hadnt hed have given us a tough fight you ought to take his head now and have done soon i said not yet ill take his head and leontioss at the same time i want to do a proper job of it one that the people who see it will remember for a long time and that will warn everyone who dreams of rebelling all right he said maybe youll have this herakleios in hand by then too that would be very good i agreed and i am certain to have a good many other officers putting all in all i can make a show the people will enjoy and so will i youve waited a long time emperor he said by god i have i burst out but i will make up for that too everyone who crossed me before i was exiled everyone who backed either of the usurpers those people will pay how they will pay if i have mercy on even one of thema you saw the will of god there myakes yes i saw it he said youve kept your promise thats sure enough not being certain of his tone a matter in which he had more license than most in the empire i asked are you arguing against anything ive done oh no emperor he said emphatically after the storm after you got into the city how could i argue with anything youve done a moment later he added more than half to himself what good would it do anyhow none whatever i told him and he nodded having already known that myakes brother elpidios when we rode south with tervels bulgars i figured it was the forlornest forlorn hope you ever did see when we went into the aqueduct i figured apsimaross soldiers would be waiting inside the city to slaughter us when apsimaros ran away when apsimaros ran away brother i figured god really was on justinians side thats one reason i quit arguing with him the other was that justinian decided god was on his side too now justinian had never been much for listening to anybody else he even knew that was so but once he got his crown backa once he got his crown back what he said went and if you didnt like it you went too off to the headsman like as not and if you didnt go to the herdsman you went some other way justinian had had a lot of time to think of interesting ways to get rid of people turned out he hadnt wasted it either not a moments worth yes i kept quiet no it wasnt brave but you dont have the vaguest notion what justinian was like in those days brother you would have kept your mouth shut too believe you me you would justinian herakleios lasted three weeks to the day after his brother apsimaros came into my hands what i had hoped would happen came to pass on learning of the usurpers capture his brothers supporters melted away until he was left with a band any selfrespecting bandit chief could have bested and one of his few remaining followers promptly proceeded to betray him to barisbakourios how are you going to reward him emperor myakes asked with thirty pieces of silver he laughed to show it was a joke it did not strike me funny betraying a usurpers brother is hardly the same as yielding up the son of god i replied ill give this fellow two pounds of gold that made herakleios more expensive than our lord had been but judas of course did not could not get full value for him barisbakourios brought herakleios into the imperial city a few days later i rewarded my old comrade from kherson more substantially than the soldier who had given him herakleios it was then that i named him general of the military district of the opsikion a post that along with being one of the most important commands in the roman empire paid its holder thirty pounds of gold a year at the same time i sent theophilos who to my surpri se had served barisbakourios well as his lieutenant general to head the karbisianoi the aegean fleet a post paying five pounds of gold a year the aegean then being quiet my assumption was that he could do no great harm in the position and might do well as i had been with leontios and apsimaros i was eager to speak with herakleios who had been the last man in arms against me barisbakourios led him before me though not so decked in chains as apsimaros had been on reaching constantinople herakleios wore manacles that clanked when he went down in an awkward prostration you know what i will do with you of course i said as he got to his feet once more youll kill me some kind of way he answered i dont doubt that for a minute he had a guttural accent like his brothers and resembled him in bodily appearance too being tall and slim and lighter in complexion than most romans in a couple of sentences he also proved he had a good understanding of the way the world works youre right i said you deserve nothing less he had courage his shrug made the manacles clank again i hope you have the courtesy to make it quick he said i wasnt the one who overthrew you all i did was try to keep my own brother on the throne i lost and now im in your hands it was not begging it was nothing like begging he might have been reminding me of an appointment i had next week never before never since have i seen a man discuss his fate so dispassionately his calm words swung me toward agreement where tears and histrionics would have earned him an ending opposite that which he craved fair enough i told him youll not suffer for which i thank you he said and then still dispassionately continued i never would have guessed youd pull this off god was on my side i told him to which he had no answer i asked him a question about which i had been wondering since my days up in kherson is your name truly herakleios or did you change it when your brother changed his herakleios is the name my mother gave me he replied had we both changed at the same time he would have become herakleios and i tiberius i was named for your greatgrandfather is it greatgreat i said your greatgreatgrandfather then the famous herakleios who saved the roman empire my brother wanted to do the same thing he raised an eyebrow as i have noted he kept his sangfroid in the face of death remarkably well you will admit the empire needed saving after three years of leontios i shrugged your brother became my enemy the instant he had the crown set on his own head instead of recalling me after he cast down leontios how could he herakleios sounded honestly curious your nose was lopped i see you have had it repaired you must have found a very clever surgeon but i do not think you had done that back in the days when my brother first became emperor of the romans in that he was of course correct but he was also my prisoner under sentence of death and i not his brother emperor of the romans nothing required that i answer him rather than doing so i gestured to barisbakourios who in his turn gestured to the men under his command they led herakleios away to await his fate to his credit he did not tax me about the inconsistency he had exposed news spread rapidly of my return to constantinople and my reassumption of the imperial power stolen from me ten years before in thrace the pursuit first of apsimaros and then of herakleios brought word of my arrival to every town and village in anatolia the officers i sent out to take over for any suspected of retaining their loyalty to the previous usurper let the soldiers and peasants know i was firmly in command in the imperial city i also sent messengers announcing my return to oualid in damascus the new miscalled commander of the faithful having succeeded the accursed abimelekh only a few months before i regained the throne merchant ships took the news to alexandria to the phoenician cities and to kherson and phanagoria not long before autumn storms made travel on the black sea too unsafe to contemplate with equanimity although as i knew from horrifying experience deadly storms could arise on that sea at any time a merchant vessel from phanagoria came down to constantinople its captain a certain makarios sought an immediate audience with me on my servitors learning he bore a message from theodora his request was granted at once after prostrating himself before me he said rejoice emperor for your wife has borne you a son and both were well the latest report i had before sailing by then i had grown accustomed to rewarding men who brought me good news half a pound of gold for makarios here i called out the sea captain bowed himself almost double a eunuch scribbled a note on a waxed tablet thereby insuring the command would be remembered has the boy been baptized i asked makarios yes emperor he has regardless of whether he had just become a richer man makarios suddenly looked apprehensive he coughed a couple of times nerving himself to continue at last he did emperor he was baptized as tiberius the throne room grew very quiet courtiers and excubitores stared at me wondering how i would respond to that well they might have though tiberius was a name my family used it was also that which apsimaros had ruled putting those two facts together i thought i understood how and why the name had been bestowed tell me i said to makarios did ibouzeros gliabanos have a hand in naming the baby why yes emperor he sounded astonished how could you know that because my dearly beloved brotherinlaw the khagan of the khazars was is and always will be a trimmer he could not have known i had beaten the usurper when the boy was born could he i asked makarios shook his head i went on had i lost the name would have pleased apsimaros since he stole it himself and ita suits me well enough i wondered if my uncle tiberius still lived i had not bothered to find out about him and his brother herakleios come to think of it i have not bothered to find out about the two of them to this day makarios said emperor i am to tell you that your wife misses you and longs to come to constantinople and lay your son in your arms i miss her too i answered truthfully her confinement being safely past i shall send a fleet to phanagoria or to kherson if shed rather let the rich men there sweat to see the augusta pass through on the way to the imperial city after they tried to murder me to bring her back to me they can sail tomorrow or i will know the reason why emperor i beg your pardon but youd do better to wait makarios said i count myself lucky to have got here without bad weather its late in the year it truly is if i command the fleet to sail i began makarios dared interrupt me only god commands the weather emperor courtiers gasped since i had already executed a good many who opposed me they thought the sea captain likely to be next and killing him would have saved the fisc half a pound of gold but i refrained the only thing i said was i hope that cyrus has heard of my successful return so he can come to constantinople from kherson this season i dont know the man emperor im sorry makarios said but the ship that brought the news to phanagoria had touched at kherson first so i expect he knows about it whoever he is no one of any particular importance i said hes only the man ive picked as the new patriarch of constantinople if hes no one in particular who knows whether makarios abruptly fell silent hearing all of what id said not the first part alone i dismissed him and then dismissed him from my thoughts that i can dredge his name from my memory as i write these words surprises me cyrus as chance would have it arrived in constantinople a few days later with a harrowing tale of tempest survived on the sea since i had my own story of that sort the two of us traded them that done i summoned him to supper at which time he said emperor you honor me beyond my deserts by raising me to the patriarchal throne nonsense i told him you left a safe and comfortable post in amastris to cross the sea and come to my aid because you saw however you saw i would be emperor again you having had faith in me i now have faith in you loyalty i reward with loyalty just as i reward treason with death he bowed his head may i give you the service you deserve i expect you will i answered and he has no doubt about it he having arrived in constantinople the local synod as was its duty under canon law presented me with his name and those of two nonentities as candidates for the patriarchate knowing in advance what my choice among them would be despite modesty he has i must say made a splendid ecumenical patriarch and as i told him at that supper i was also proceeding with vengeance against those who had overthrown me ten years before and against those who espoused the cause of the usurper apsimaros rather than my own i made no secret of the vengeance i was taking i have never made a secret of the vengeance i still continue to take at my order artisans erected several gibbets atop the inner wall to the city so that i might edify the people by causing them to contemplate the fate of those stupid enough to have opposed me first to be hanged on the gibbets was apsimaross brother herakleios as i had promised him his end was quick and easy while he dangled there i caused apsimaros to be brought out of his cell under heavy guard to view the corpse for the usurpers end i had something more elaborate in mind meanwhile however to keep th e people in a contemplative mood i executed various of the other officers who had been imperfectly loyal to me as makarios had known it would the season of autumn storms soon arrived i was glad cyrus had managed to come into the imperial city before travel became so dangerous only a desperate man would think about it as ecumenical patriarch he celebrated the glorious festival of our lords birth in the church of the holy wisdom a week or so before lent began i chose to put an end at last to leontios and apsimaros thereby giving the city mob of constantinople in a rowdy mood in any case before the onset of the solemn season something out of the ordinary to talk about and celebrate to assure a large crowd in the hippodrome i decreed a day of chariot racing this sport which i am given to understand was a commonplace up to the reign of the emperor whose namesake i am is reserved for special occasions these days partly because the partisans of the rival teams are still given to riot and all manner of unseemly behavior to show their support and partly because the races are ruinously expensive and not even the imperial fisc can afford to offer them frequently along with the horse races i also announced a triumphal procession through the imperial city from the golden gate to the hippodrome people crowded under the colonnades on either side of the mese to watch first came a company of excubitores gorgeous in gilded parade armor with brightdyed cloaks streaming after them behind them walked civilian servitors carrying sacks of silver miliaresia from which they threw coins into the crowd the occasion while auspicious not calling for gold after the men with the money glumly tramped leontios and apsimaros each in the filthy tunic he had worn while imprisoned in the monastery of delmatos each with his hands manacled in front of him so the people could tell which wicked usurper was which a secretary with a large sign bearing each mans name followed him and for the benefit of the many who could not read the secretaries called out the names of leontios and apsimaros in loud voices as well as their crimes these vile worms dared rebel against the vicegerent of god on earth justinian emperor of the romans tu vincas justinian the people shouted for i rode in a chariot drawn by white horses directly behind the overthrown usurpers i waved to the right and then to the left acknowledging the appropriateness of the old salute on this day as on the day when i first reentered the queen of cities at my side marched faithful myakes who of all my guardsmen did by far the most in trying to prevent my ouster and who served me so long and well in my exile not for anything on earth would i have deprived him of the opportunity to share in avenging the outrages leontios and apsimaros had inflicted upon us myakes truth to tell brother elpidios by then i just wanted it over with i would have been every bit as happy if justinian had taken leontioss head and apsimaross too and then gone on with the rest of his business leontios had had his nose sliced after all and hed been locked up for seven years and ive already said i didnt have anything special against apsimaros but nobody was going to change justinians mind hed wanted a show and he was going to have himself a show it was as simple as that whod tell him anything different he was emperor of the romans anybody who didnt like it would end up hanging on the wall same as apsimaross brother herakleios and his chums and the people had themselves a good time same as they do at any parade same as they did when leontios stole the throne out from under justinian come to that they cheered justinian and threw things at leontios and apsimaros if you didnt know better you had to figure theyd stay on justinians side forever if i say if justinian behind me came the stalwart friends id made in exile cyrus first among them in his patriarchal regalia barisbakourios and his brother stephen foolish paul without whose fishing boat we never would have reached the land of the bulgars and theophilos from doros who kept improving with them walked the spatharios leo who had served me so well on my return journey to the imperial city another company of excubitores brought up the rear like that heading the procession this company wore fancy parade armor but the men had everyday weapons at hand lest some readyforaught conspirators attempt a rescue of either usurper although in truth why anyone would have wanted to rescue leontios passes my comprehension eggs and fruit and the occasional stone flew at leontios and apsimaros both without being so ordered the driver of my chariot increased the distance between them and us so we should not be similarly pelted by accident or by malice under cover of accident the stratagem succeeded though i had a surfeit of the gagging stench or rotten eggs by the time we reached the hippodrome but i was not dripping with them as the two usurpers were a great cheer rose from the crowd in the hippodrome on our entering through the gate the chariots normally use the races having been completed the excubitores led the way around the churnedup dirt of the track toward the stands opposite the kathisma to the spot in other words where leontios had had me mutilated a bit more than a decade before now leontios and his fellow usurper apsimaros stumbled after the guards the shackles they wore clanking with each step they took on their nearing the grandstand a chorus posted on the second level of the imperial kathisma burst into the thirteenth verse of psalm thou hast attacked an asp and a basilisk and hast trampled down a lion and a dragon i turned my head to speak to cyrus surely the lord wrote that verse for me and surely he inspired you to recall it emperor it is my duty and pleasure to serve you the patriarch replied modestly casting down his eyes no one will deny the city mob is foolish fickle and ever demanding new amusements but neither will anyone deny that the people of constantinople are the cleverest besteducated folk in all the civilized world understanding at once the verses multifarious aptness they burst into a deafening storm of applause the lion of course signified leontios the asp apsimaros some of the more sophisticated no doubt also took in the double meaning of the basilisk which at the same time implied both reptilian horror and a petty king a true king or emperor being not just basiliskos but basileus this is the day the lord hath made cyrus cried as kallinikos had when i was being deposed then the people had cheered to see me cast down now they applauded as i was raised high were i to be overthrown again they might cheer once more but that shall not come to pass anyone who might dare such an outrage no longer being among the living when i say i was raised high on that day i speak not only metaphorically but also literally myakes stepped forward and pushed leontios and apsimaros down before me they bent their backs almost as if in prostration leontios i saw with no small amusement got horse dung in his bushy beard and i i sprang atop them setting one red imperial boot on leontioss back the other on apsimaross symbolizing in terms the veriest clod might understand my domination over them the chorus sang out the prophetic verse once more and the crowd acclaimed me and derided those who had defiled my throne with their presence on it mercy leontios squealed beneath me i did not slay you have mercy apsimaros more manly or merely without hope kept silent i ground my booted foot into leontioss back he groaned but made no move to try to throw me off excubitores stood round him with swords and spears and bows ready to punish such insolence with bitter torment the leeches in the stands baying laughter at the usurpers humiliation would have laughed even louder to see blood flow however little leontios knew he knew that much having listened to their cheers while my blood spilled for the mobs delight still standing atop the two toppled tyrants i shouted to the crowd as loud as i could let them be taken to the kynegion there to have the sword sever their heads from their bodies most of the people cheered jeering the usurpers and applauding the fate i had decreed for them leontioss shoulders began to heave under me not because he was trying to throw me off but because he was shamelessly weeping up in the grandstand i heard catcalls among the cheers these surely coming from the more bloodthirsty those who would sooner have had the executions carried out before their avid eyes that privilege however i reserved for myself to placate the masses i shouted out another announcement we shall have a second round of races here in the hippodrome tomorrow universal rapture greeted that proclamation my springing down from the backs of leontios and apsimaros signaled to the mob the end of the days festivities i tasted the tone of their voices as they streamed out of the hippodrome despite not having watched the usurpers heads leap from their bodies they seemed well enough pleased with what they had witnessed excubitores stirred leontios and apsimaros to their feet and the two of them rose apsimaros was pale his lips pressed against each other until they almost disappeared but he did his best to show a brave front leontios by contrast presented a disgusting spectacle and would have done so even without the horse dung in his beard not only did his tears of terror cut pale lines down his filthy cheeks but greenish snot flowed out of the hole in his face where his nose had been and trickled through his mustache the sooner the world is rid of you the more pleasant a place it will be i told him an aesthetic judgment as well as a moral one incapable of coherent speech he blubbered at me to the kynegion i told the guardsmen they had to drag leontios to the amphitheater by the sea northeast of the church of the holy wisdom his legs refusing to carry him apsimaros walked i rode in the chariot behind them was the masked executioner waiting there the man who had mutilated me no one had no one to this day has admitted knowing which executioner that had been i remaina most interested in learning but at the time passed lightly over the question other matters being more immediately urgent in the center of the kynegion stood a chopping block like that for poultry but larger the stains on it were old and dried and dark i having been in the habit of hanging rather than beheading the officers who had supported the cause of the two usurpers some fresh stains would go on it now the executioner had a sword on his hip a weapon larger and thickerbladed than a cavalrymans sword one made for chopping bowing to me he asked which of them first emperor having been weighing that very question in my mind as i traveled from the hippodrome i replied without hesitation let it be apsimaros that way leontios can see what lies ahead for him leontios moaned apsimaros nodded to me if i had won you would have ended here he said he walked to the block knelt and laid his head upon it strike hard he told the executioner the fellow looked my way i nodded apsimaros was doing his best to die well i would allow it up went the sword leontioss eyes followed it with horrified fascination though it would not bite his necka yet down it fell anyone who has been in battle or for that matter anyone who has watched and listened to a butcher cutting up a carcass with a cleaver will know the sound it made on striking home apsimaross head sprang from his body a fountain of blood brightest red in the winter sun gushed from the stump of his neck drenching the head the dried grass on the floor of the kynegion and the chopping block his legs kicked wildly but for the manacles his arms would have flailed too he pissed and shit himself the stench plain even through the overwhelming iron smell of blood leontios slumped forward in a faint i walked over and kicked apsimaross head to one side my boots already being crimson contact with the bloodsoaked relic would not mar them to one of the excubitores i said wash this off so people can see who it is was and take it to the milion for display aye emperor he said while his comrades dragged the rest of apsimaross corpse out of the way no doubt wanting to be helpful the executioner told the guardsman i have baskets here you can use one to carry that ah good the soldier said thanks other soldiers hauled leontios over to the chopping block and positioned him so the executioner could do his work but before the man could raise that heavy sword i said wait i want him to know what is happening to him just as he knew when he tormented me obediently the executioner waited leontios remaining limp one of the excubitores stooped and pinched his earlobe between the nails of thumb and forefinger this produced the desired effect leontios writhed and twisted and opened his eyes on doing so he discovered his head lay on the block he let out a hoarse screamno and tried to twist away seize him i cried and several excubitores did exactly that even after they forced him back to the proper posture though he kept shouting and twisting his head from side to side exactly as i had done when the executioner serving him had tried to slit my tongue as the soldiers had done then with me so now one of them seized leontios by the hair and held his head still the wretch tried to bite his teeth clicking together it did him no good even so the executioner did not make a clean job of the kill as he had with apsimaros he had to strike twice the first blow merely spraying blood in all directions and turning leontioss screams to halfdrowned gurgles at the second though the death the usurper so richly deserved was visited upon him at last i do beg your pardon emperor the executioner said as leontioss blood poured out over the ground i should have done better there he sounded professionally embarrassed as a builder might after erecting a house with a leaky roof never mind i told him he earned what you gave him had you taken his head with a carpenters saw i should not have said a word against you a carpenters saw the fellow exclaimed by the way he recoiled from me he found the idea more nearly appalling than appealing executioners are from my dealings with them a conservative lot very much set in their ways leontioss body kept twitching a good deal longer than apsimaross had done whether because the executioner had required two strokes rather than one or simply because he was too stupid to realize he was dead i could not say helpful still the executioner gave the excubitores another one of those baskets in which to carry leontioss head then went off to wash the blood from his blade and examine the edge for nicks to be honed away before his next tour of duty i watched as the excubitores set the heads of leontios and apsimaros on pikes in front of the milion placards proclaimed their crimes to the crowd turning to myakes i said amazing how far two heads go to make up for ten long years of misery so it is emperor he said now that youve avenged avenged i broke in not yet buta myakes hesitated as well he might have before going on youve dealt with the patriarch theres leontios and apsimaros youve already taken care of apsimaross brother there are all those dead officers i interrupted again plenty more where they came from by god and his son and i aim to root out every one of them too ive hardly started sweeping the bureaucracy clean of traitors and you know what i owe the khersonites ill give it to them too see if i dont i am not yet avenged myakes i have barely begun cant you let this be enough what youve already done he said while one who opposed me remains alive it is not enough i replied treason is a wart on the face of the roman empire and i will cut it off hearing the iron in my voice he bowed his head yes emperor he said quietly myakes i did try brother elpidios i thought when he came back to power he would get rid of the two usurpers and the most important people who had backed them and then hed get on with the business of being emperor again it didnt happen i wish it had but hed been thinking about revenge eating revenge drinking revenge breathing revenge dreaming revenge all the time hed been in exile once he got the chance to take it he took and took anda this wasnt the only time i tried to get him to slow down to think about what he was doing to see if maybe hed had enough you just saw how much good it did me as time went on i tried less and less often what brother the sin of despairing well maybe it was the sin of not being listened to thats certain justinian with winter wearing on toward spring the logothete in charge of petitions approached me with a rolledup parchment this was no longer the elderly indeed the ancient sisinniakes who had died during my years in exile but a certain philotheos the successor appointed by one of the usurpers thus far having nothing more against him than that fact i had permitted him to remain in office after prostrating himself and gaining my permission to rise he handed me the parchment saying emperor this petition for return from exile comes to you from an island in the ionian sea kephallenia by name the petitioner is a certain bardanes son of the patrician nikephoros who he writes is also sometimes known as philippikos seeing me stir philotheos said am i to gather that this man is known to you emperor i first met him almost twenty years ago i answered ah i see the logothete coughed delicately are you aware of the crime for which he was sent into exile on this distant inhospitable island yes word of that reached me in the distant inhospitable land to which i was sent into exile i said which served to take philotheoss toploftiness down a peg he dreamt of an eagle and apsimaros heard about it this is correct philotheos licked his lips in anticipation of what would follow do i assume therefore that should you deign to recall him you shall to so to requite him as you did those two whose heads remain on display at the milion his tone said he had confidence in the assumption so much confidence had he indeed that his jaw dropped on my saying no i went on i gave the usurpers what they deserved they were my foes bardanes philippikos always served me well not only do i intend recalling him but i shall restore him to the rank formerly his prepare for my signature the necessary orders for his release and convey them to the governor of kephallenia whoever he may be the island and its affairs such as they were had before that moment not drawn my notice since my return to constantinople looking flabbergasted philotheos went off to do as i had ordered of him from behind me i heard another cough i turned to find myakes face set in disapproving lines as it often was at that time emperor bardanes has done well enough on kephallenia all these years he said why dont you leave him there for the rest of his days now that the whole roman empire recognizes me as emperor once more i can repay all my debts i answered the ones i owe to those who wronged me and the ones i owe to those who served me well when we were campaigning in thrace bardanes might well have saved my life from that sklavinian hidden in the river myakes snorted the only thing that poor barbarian wanted was for the lot of us to go away so he could run without anybody seeing him he was about as dangerous as a weanling calf you were jealous then of the favor i showed him i said are you still after so many years call it whatever you please he stubbornly stuck out his chin i say that anybody who dreams of becoming emperor isnt safe to have around let him stay on his island and imagine hes emperor of that i told philotheos what to do i said he is doing it when bardanes returns i may use him he was a good commander deny it if you can i dont like it as was often true myakes did not know when to yield i did not ask whether you liked it i explained my reasons for doing it which is more than you deserve i have made my will clear and my will shall be done do you understand that myakes he bowed his head at last how could he do otherwise i was i am the emperor myakes he would have done better to listen to me brother elpidios then and some other times too or maybe in the end it wouldnt have mattered anyway no way of telling that not really if you change one thing most of the others stay the same you never can know not for certain but considering how things ended up i wish bardanes had stayed on kephallenia justinian all winter long i had been making plans for theodoras entrance into constantinople and for that of little tiberius too i wanted to see my wifes face as i paraded her down the mese from atil and from phanagoria she imagined she knew what the imperial city was like i smiled whenever i thought of that she was like a man who having seen two copper folleis fancied he could tell his neighbors about a gold nomisma i also wanted to remind her how much i valued her and to show i cared for her still despite my having returned to the heart of the civilized world accordingly as soon as spring approached i sent theophylaktos the eunuch to phanagoria with a goodsized fleet to take my wife from ibouzeros gliabanos and bring her back to the imperial city no one said a word to me about the earliness of the season when i commanded the fleet to sail sail it did having been away from theodora for most of a year i was impatient to have her by my side once more and even more impatient to set eyes on the son i had never seen i knew too that the fleet would have some considerable layover in phanagoria while theodora came thither from whatever part of khazaria to which she had removed herself atil most likely on my departure from phanagoria for the land of the bulgars not to stretch the tale unduly the fleet turned out to have sailed too early in the season for its own safety a storm blew up on the black sea the day before the fleet would have made port at phanagoria theophylaktos survived but several ships went down and more than three hundred sailors drowned this news i gained from makarios the merchant captain who the fall before had brought me news of theodoras confinement and the birth of tiberius he had got to phanagoria ahead of my fleet escaping the storm and set out after the survivors limped into that town after recounting the unfortunate tale he added the tudun of phanagoria also told me to give you a message from ibouzeros gliabanos did he i said amused go ahead i expect it to be a warning against killing any more officials the khazar khagan had sent out to govern the cities he ruled but makarios said he told me to tell you two or three ships would have been plenty to bring your wife back here to constantinople he says you didnt need to throw so many men away doing that did you think you were taking her by force he held up a hasty hand as well he might have these are his words emperor not mine all im doing is delivering them i understand that i said i am not angry at you but the khazars will pay for their insolence all the cities up there will pay for what they did to me if i were you captain makarios id trade along the southern coast of the black sea not the northern one once i am through with those towns they will have little to trade thanks for the warning emperor he said but i could tell by the way he said it that he did not believe i intended my words to be taken literally he having brought me good news i hope his business has not suffered in the subsequent years of my reign two months and more passed by before theophylaktos and the ships of his fleet still floating returned to the imperial city i bore the delay with such patience as i could knowing from my own experience how long news and people took to travel across the tremendous breadth of the steppe at last though a messenger brought word that the fleet was pulling into the golden horn whose harbors were closest to the palace at blakhernai where i still dwelt hurrying up to the roof of the palace i saw the ships with my own eyes on one of them would be my wife and son although they were not so near as to let me make them out i called orders to the servants and departed the fleet was just tying up at the docks when i rode up on a bay gelding a much handsomer piece of horseflesh than the bulgar pony aboard which i had come down to constantinople even if lacking in both intelligence and endurance by comparison as i hurried down the pier toward theodora and tiberius i prayed they had had a smoother voyage on the black sea than my last one justinian a familiar voice made me spot one waving hand among many i waved back to my wife who held up my son for me to see i stared and stared at the child of my flesh he who will succeed me when that flesh is subjected to the common fate of all mankind he was plump and reddish and like his mother had a full head of dark brown hair after noting these characteristics of his i noted one of my own intense surprise that i could view a child of mine without being filled with anger and hatred the only emotions suffusing me whenever i set eyes on my daughter epiphaneia sailors having extended the gangplank from the ship to the wharf theodora left the vessel and entered the imperial city justinian here is your son she said in greek that showed she had been practicing with merchants or priests during her sojourn in khazaria and she handed tiberius to me my hands were unpracticed at holding babies tiberius cared not at all seeing me smile at him he smiled back enormously i laughed and so did he a babys squeal of joy unadulterated whatever his elders might have thought he cared no more about my noses being less that it might have than he did about the unpracticed fingers out of whose grip he tried to squirm his sublime indifference to my features would of itself have sufficed to endear him to me then continuing to hold him in the crook of one arm i turned and used the other to wave out to constantinople imitating my wifes diction as i did so theodora here is your city i could not resist adding is it not almost as grand as phanagoria taking a wifely privilege theodora stuck out her tongue at me you told me stories about constantinople she said i thought you were as big a liar as a bard who sings songs to my brother the khagan now i see you did not tell the truth because you did not say enough tervel the bulgar told me the same thing i answered his ambassadors would come back from the queen of cities and say what they saw and he would not believe them when he saw for himself he too knew they had been keeping much to themselves i want to see all of this city theodora said if it is mine i need to know it soon you will see the most splendid pearl in the necklace when i crown you augusta and tiberius emperor in the church of the holy wisdom i said pointing southeast to show her where in the city the great church lay because of its height the exterior of the huge dome was visible from most of constantinople though no one viewing only the exterior could gain the smallest inkling of the magnificence housed within after we had stood talking for a little while and after theophylaktos had got down on his hands and knees not to prostrate himself before me but to kiss the tarred gulldungsmeared timbers of the harbor belonging to his native city in thanksgiving for having come home safe at last a commotion at the foot of the pier made me look in that direction approaching amidst a considerable retinue was a litter carried by bearers with eagles embroidered on the chests of their silk tunics the walls and even the handles of the chair were gilded silk worked with golden threads curtained the windows theodoras eyes already wide grew wider who rides in this thing she asked her greek though much improved had no words for what she was seeing one of the attendants opened the door to the litter the woman who descended wore robes very much like mine come with me i said to theodora ill introduce you to my mother word of my wifes arrival must have reached the grand palace almost as soon as it got to me my wife inferred a good deal from my tone quietly she asked you and your mother do not like each other not always i answered as quietly god willing you and tiberius will make a difference that after refusing my mothers urging to remarry i had wed a barbarian princess had made a difference and not a good one but a grandson would set no small weight in the other pan of the scale raising my voice i said mother i present to you my wife theodora who shall be augusta and my son tiberius who con tinues our line my wife i present to you my mother the augusta anastasia politely theodora inclined her head i greet you mother of my husband she said the words were greek but i got the idea she was translating them from khazar ceremonial welcome to constantinople my mother said and then more warmly welcome home she held out her arms let me see your son she knew how to hold an infant having gained experience with me with my brother herakleios and now that i think on it with epiphaneia as well she smiled down at tiberius and he up at her he would smile at anyone who smiled his way he made the sort of noises infants make when they are happy and then his grandmother still holding him he pissed himself i thought she would be annoyed she started to laugh these things happen she said and turned a thoughtful eye my way they happened with you to theodora she added he is a handsome boy thank you my wife said she turned and called in the khazar language waving as she did so a slave woman who had accompanied her on the ship from phanagoria came hurrying up theodora took tiberius from my mother and handed him to the woman she spoke some more as well not having used the barbarous jargon of the nomads who dwell north of the black sea since my own departure from phanagoria i understood not a word she said but context made her desire plain that tiberiuss deplorable state be corrected this duly came to pass my mother said i know justinian will have you live with him at the palace he has chosen for his own theodora but you must bring your grandson to me often so i can see him and play with him i will do this theodora replied if she saw anything unusual in the separate households my mother and i maintained she kept quiet about it i do not believe she did it being the custom among the khazars for the khagan to live apart from even his closest family theodora having ridden across the steppe with me from atil to phanagoria i felt certain she would prefer a horse to a litter for the far shorter journey from the harbor to the blakhernai palace a litter waited nonetheless to convey tiberius and incidentally the slave who had charge of him to the palace my mothers eyes grew wide when she saw theodora swing up into the saddle riding astride like a man somewhat to my surprise she said nothing she had made up her mind to be polite to my wife even if more for tiberiuss sake than on account of theodoras own multifarious virtues i rode back to blakhernai alongside theodora a little ahead of her in fact not only because i was emperor but also because i knew the way she exclaimed at everything as any newcomer to this godguarded and imperial city will do but for her everything was more allencompassing than it might have been for say a roman from an anatolian town stones in the roadway she murmured at one point the very idea of paving being exotic to her yes i said happily as if i had invented cobblestones myself she kept craning her neck all the buildings are so high she said we were riding between rows of three and fourstory apartment houses nothing at all out of the ordinary for constantinople people on the balconies overhanging the street peered down at us some of them waved none presumed to empty chamber pots on our heads which has happened before in the history of the city so high she repeated why dont they fall down from time to time in earthquakes they do fall down i forbore to mention that saying instead our builders know what theyre about she accepted it how could she do otherwise this being her first journey through constantinople when we got to the palace wherein i had dwelt since returning to the imperial city and where i dwell yet servants and slaves and eunuchs came out and prostrated themselves before us though the khazars have a somewhat different ritual she grasped what that meant these are all yours she asked in no small astonishment that i understood her brother the khagan though living in great luxury had but a fraction of my retainers these are some of what is mine i answered proudly and truthfully they are also some of what is yours theophylaktos ever so delighted to be back in the imperial city took charge of theodora then conveying her to the chamber off the hall of okeanos that had been readied against her arrival i saw no more of her until we dined together as the sun was setting by then serving woman had plucked her eyebrows powdered and rouged her cheeks painted her lips and curled her hair she would never look like a woman born in the roman empire but she looked more like one than i had ever seen her you are lovely i told her am i she shrugged in khazaria we decorate horses like this not women from that day forth though she voiced no further complaints against roman fashion and she praised the food highly full of roast goat soused with fat myself i said these are the dishes they imagined they could make in phanagoria now you taste them as they should be a servant poured me more wine the vintages are better too yes she said emphatically having also been sampling those vintages presently theophylaktos escorted her to my bedchamber then departed to let us celebrate a mystery in which he had no hope of sharing two or three of the serving women would no doubt be downcast at theodoras return for the attentions i had given them in her absence would cease except perhaps for occasional amusements my wife i said barring the door my husband she answered a proper roman wife would have cast her eyes down to the floor in modesty theodora boldly met my gaze i had not the heart to reprove her not when she had proved herself loyal to me at her brothers expense for treachery the sword for its reverse rewards all at once curious i asked what did ibouzeros gliabanos say when you came back to him and papatzun didnt her smile was exactly that which i should have used had i been in her place he said many many very many very bad things but all the time he said them the way he said them was running out of greek she used a word in the khazar language expecting me to know what it meant and for a wonder it was a word i chanced to recall admiring i said giving it to her in the tongue of the roman empire admiring yes thank you she said like he hated and had pride for you at the same time that probably went a long way toward accounting for the khagans mocking message after my fleet met shipwreck having thrown in his lot with apsimaros he must have hoped i would fail in overthrowing the usurper but on my success and indeed on my successful escape from his trap before that he could not help but show a certain reluctant respect theodora looked from the barred door to the bed in front of which i stood pointedly she said did you call me here to talk about my brother i burst out laughing half scandalized half delighted as i knew theodora had been a maiden the night we wed but on being properly introduced thereto she had come to take no small delight in that which passes between man and woman once i left phanagoria she would have done without of my own amusements in that regard during the time we were apart i said nothing nor did she inquire knowing the mans prerogative in such affairs but we were apart no longer after putting out all the lamps in the bedchamber save one alone i divested her of the robe she wore even by the light of that single lamp i saw how childbirth had changed her body her breasts were larger and softer than i remembered her hips thicker the skin on her belly looser and marked with fine pale tracings it had not held before the child shed carried stretched it as far as fleshly perfection went the serving maids with whom i had been dallying in theodoras absence were without doubt her superiors none of them however had saved me in time of need none of them had stood apart from their brothers to save me none of them had given me a son to be emperor after me and so while they were pleasant and diverting theodora was my wife after i made myself naked she had no cause to complain of the salute i gave her wordless though it was when we embraced standing there by the bed my lance stood between us but only for a moment so warm she said moving it to rub against her belly before long we lay down together each of us knew what pleased the other i had nothing in which to instruct her as i had needed to do when bedding a new serving girl once kisses and caresses had excited us both she rolled onto her back her legs open inviting me to complete the conquest of her secret place that i wasted no time in doing theodoras breath sighed out as i thrust myself deep into her her thighs gripped my flanks i rode her until she gasped and called out my name and what i have always taken to be a string of khazar endearments though i have never asked her the meaning of the words i had not yet spent myself within her as i had usually done at her moment of delight when we enjoyed the marital couch before my enforced departure from phanagoria enormous in the dim lamplight her eyes looked past me through me rather than at me realizing my lance retained its temper she murmured go on oh go on again immodest but in its way immensely flattering on i went again she tensed beneath me again she quivered again she called my name and this time i sent my seed deep into her womb a moment later you are a big man a great man she said admiringly you go on and on you make me crazy for you she mimed clambering atop me and taking me by force i laughed with her a laugh not far from exhaustion the truth of things a truth i kept from her was that i kept on and on because i took less pleasure from each single stroke than i had before tiberius passed out through the way on which i was now going in the sheath into which i thrust my sword now fitting more loosely than had been the case i had to work harder to reach my full pleasure her giving me less satisfaction was precisely and in inverse proportion as those learned in arithmetic are wont to say the occasion for my giving her more having thus labored long and hard i fell asleep awakening sometime later from a vivid erotic dream of the sort commonly sent by satan to tempt us christians away from the paths of virtue this particular erotic dream however was sent not by satan but by theodora who had amused herself by finding a way to revive my manhood while i lay snoring once i was not only revived but awake she impaled herself on me and moving slowly and languorously brought both of us another round of joy though unsure whether i could complete my half of that wordless bargain in the end i managed it we both slept then waking only with the sunrise the bedclothes bore stains from my seed dribbling out of her in the night not the stains of maidenhead overwhelmed as on the first night but those of a deeper longerlasting intimacy i am glad youre with me again i said and despite her bodys being somewhat less enjoyable than before i spoke the truth my having chosen to dwell at the palace in the blakhernai district rather than the grand palace furnished the opportunity for a parade through most of the imperial city when the time came to crown theodora augusta and tiberius junior emperor this met with the raucous approval of the constantinopolitan city mob more of whom were able to gape at the procession that would have been the case had we gone only the short distance from the grand palace up to the church of the holy wisdom it also met with theodoras approval for it allowed her to see the many monuments and churches and splendid buildings lying along the mese we did not solicit tiberiuss opinion as he was still far too small for it to matter in any way from somewhere god only knows where theophylaktos produced an imperial robe of a size appropriate for a baby when dressed therein tiberius looked absurdly majestic and i must say majestically absurd ceremonial required theodora to hold tiberius up for the people of constantinople to see and to admire throughout the entire procession this proved one disadvantage of making the aforesaid procession longer not far past the column of markianos she whispered to me my arms will fall off keep going anyhow i whispered back departing from tradition was dangerous when she looked mutinous i added besides they all love him her face softened for that was obviously true women cooed and men smiled at the spectacle of a plump goodnatured baby which tiberius was decked out in a miniature version of his fathers magnificent robes so sweet a woman exclaimed and heads close by her bobbed up and down in agreement you see i said to theodora i see she replied but never being one to shy from speaking her mind she added i wish you carried him a while then proving how much better her greek had become she made a pun saying i carried him nine months already my turn will come inside the great church i said she subsided recognizing that against necessity one struggled in vain ceremonial and necessity when mentioned in matters pertaining to the emperor of the romans might as well be one and the same we passed through the forum of constantine paraded by the church of st euphemia near the hippodrome and came up to the milion which marks the end of the mese the heads of leontios and apsimaros were still on display in front of it both somewhat the worse for wear but distinguishable one from the other on account of leontioss mutilation deliberately theodora turned her back on the last remains of the two usurpers revenge she said is good truly god was wise when he sent me to your brothers court i told her receiving in return a proud smile not far past the milion stands the church of the holy wisdom it is the biggest building i have ever seen theodora said peering up and up and up at the massive structure of golden sandstone from the outside the massiveness of the church is its most noteworthy feature like an egg it hides its riches within a plain shell when we went into the narthex the outer chamber before the worship area itself theodora exclaimed at the mosaics yes they are fine i agreed but you will find work that comes close to them at the blakhernai palace and work to match them in the grand palace howevera we went on into the naos itself cyrus the ecumenical patriarch waited for us beside the golden altar table and he waited longer than strict ceremonial would have dictated too for theodora having decided to stare up into the great dome stood transfixed apparently unable to go forward following her gaze i also looked up into the dome having come to the great church many times i normally took even such a marvel for granted so familiarity enslaves us all now though i saw as it were with new eyes viewing it thanks to theodora as if for the first time once more the sunbeams streaming through the many windows ringing the base of the dome light striking off the golden tesserae in the dome itself shifting if i moved my head by so much as a digits breadtha it floats in the sky theodora whispered nothing holds it up but the light it is not part of the building none of that of course was literally true and yet every word of it seemed true having once begun to stare up into the dome myself i needed a distinct effort of will to look away i touched theodora on the arm which called her back to herself together we approached the altar now theodora could see and appreciate the marble and precious metal that had been lavished on the great church before the overmastering splendor of the dome commanding her attention no lesser marvel had been able to show itself to her cyrus prayed beseeching gods mercy and lovingkindness for me for my family and for the roman empire when i became emperor of the romans george then ecumenical patriarch had set the crown on my head but it is the emperor who crowns both the junior emperor and the augusta the assembled grandees having added their acclamations to those of cyrus the patriarch handed me the first of the crowns i was to bestow behold the emperor tiberius i cried and set the crown on my sons head i kept hold of the crown as well it being made for a fully grown man on feeling something brush against his hair tiberius whipped his little head around trying to find out what it was when he saw the crown he grabbed for it his hands were beginning to obey his will once he had seized it he tried to bring it down to his mouth so he could chew on it as he did with everything that came within his reach many years to the emperor tiberius the nobles and bureaucrats of constantinople cried the acclamation was more casual than on many such occasions many of the grandees being diverted by the junior very junior emperors antics from the womens gallery came more laughter and sighs of amusement the noblewomen shared affection for a baby with their humble cousins on the street tu vincas was not a shout that went up at the coronation of any junior emperor conquest being the prerogative of the ruling emperor i could not even leave the crown on tiberius as i should have done had he been older once i had satisfied the symbolic requirement of placing it on his head i took it away again tiberius reached for it and howled when he could not get it more laughter rose and echoed from the dome theodora rocked tiberius in her arms till he calmed having waited for that moment i took the second crown from the hands of the ecumenical patriarch the augusta is more often crowned in the augustaion the enclosed open space south of the church of the holy wisdom but i performed the ceremony inside the great church combining it with the coronation of my son theophylaktos had grumbled a little at the proposal but not much and being emperor i had my way at my gesture theodora slightly inclined her head i set the crown on it saying behold the augusta theodora tiberius meanwhile beheld the crown on his mothers head let out a squeal of delight and tried to get it imperially certain it had been placed there for his amusement alone over the echo of that squeal more acclamations rang out most were in latin the ceremony for crowning the augusta having changed less over the years than that for the emperor indeed it was my greatgreatgrandfather who changed the official title of the ruler of the roman empire from augustus to the simple word emperor thank you theodora said when the acclamations had faded god bless you i nodded well pleased having wanted her to use those words to remind the grandees she was of christian faith even if of khazar blood i took the first crown from cyrus once more and accompanied by my wife who still carried our son in her arms and the ecumenical patriarch went out through the narthex to the entranceway to the church of the holy wisdom the crowd out there people lacking the importance to be admitted to the great church to witness the coronation ceremony with their own eyes burst into cheers to see theodora adorned with the augustas crown they cheered even louder when as i had done inside the church i set the junior emperors crown on tiberiuss small head servants flung coins into the crowd from sacks they carried for t he occasion gold and silver both here rather than watching the city mob struggle over the largesse thus distributed i went back into the great church again the nobles and high functionaries shouted out fulsome acclamations for the newly crowned tiberius and theodora they had no doubt acclaimed apsimaros a year before they had no doubt acclaimed leontios as fulsomely ten years before they would no doubt acclaim some other vile worthless usurper as fulsomely should he chance to overthrow me i did not aim to give the whores the chance my mother beamed at me saying i am very glad to see you using the grand palace once more i know your memories of those who dwelt here before you came back are unpl with a sharp chopping gesture of my right hand i cut her off this palace has a larger dining hall than the one at blakhernai reason enough my mother said i am also pleased to see you reconciling yourself with some of the people who remained busy in the imperial city after you were forced to leave that way lies security i made no answer she was in any case not seeking one as she swung all her attention to tiberius how is the littlest emperor she punctuated that by tickling him under the chin by way of reply the littlest emperor squeaked with delight one of the spatharioi i had appointed since returning to the city a certain helias came up to me and said emperor everything is ready good i told him he was about to go when a cook came running out of the kitchen crying who is this black devil who wants to work with us he made the sign of the cross i have never seen such an ugly man in my life oh thats my cook helias answered i call him john because i cant pronounce his real name hes an indian or an ethiopian something like that he is ugly but he can really cook hes put a belly on me since i bought him six months ago ill tell you that when i heard the emperor had a banquet in mind i brought him along to help let me see him i said curious to learn whether he would resemble auriabedas the cook trotted off returning in a little while with a fellow who in fact did not much look like the little man who had restored my nose this man was tall and muscular with skin black rather than brown and hair growing in tight little curls his features were hard and coarse his nose though seeming undamaged even flatter than mine after clumsily prostrating himself he spoke in bad greek emperor you eat my food you like my food all right john i said and diverted by his strange appearance gave him a nomisma which he took with a loud shrill whoop of delight i turned to the cook who had brought him into my presence he may be ugly but he seems to have no harm in him let him cook so long as he does not bother the rest of you bowing the cook led john back into the kitchens that proved well timed for the invited guests began arriving shortly thereafter one by one they prostrated themselves bowed to my mother and to my wife and let eunuchs take them to the places assigned them at the tables having been seated they began drinking wine and talking shop with one another as men of similar trades will do when cast together none of them paid any special attention to the magnificence of the hall in which they were enjoying themselves it was for these functionaries of intermediate to high rank a familiar setting all of them had frequently come to the grand palace while apsimaros and before him leontios had set their fundaments on the throne some of them i remembered from the days before my exile a few i remembered from as far back as the days of my fathers reign i greeted them with the nineteenth verse of the twelfth chapter of the book of luke asoul thou hast much goods laid up for many years take thine ease eat drink and be merrya my mother whose piety always deep had strengthened further in the years of my exile looked sharply at me i returned my blandest stare and she subsided the bureaucrats and courtiers i had assembled they must have numbered about sixty altogether lifted their cups in salutation may you also be merry emperor one of them called whereupon the rest gave forth with loud agreement food began coming out of the kitchen then oysters and spinach octopus and leeks prawns in cheese with garlic i had no idea what share in all this john the black man from india or wherever his homeland lay had had but the dishes were uniformly excellent my guests might have taken the dining hall for granted but good food they appreciated and were loud in its praises after the prawns came roast boar in garum the piquancy of the fish sauce complementing the meats fatty richness again the courtiers lauded the viands to the skies pork is a poor mans meat but the wild boar is of different substance from the humble garbageeating pig and these connoisseurs recognized and appreciated the difference they sighed over geese stuffed with figs and plums and served on a bed of cabbage and moaned almost as they might have done over a beautiful woman when the servants carried from the kitchen lambs glistening with the fat in which they had been baked crushed mint leaves were sprinkled over the carcasses which still smoked from their time in the oven to add flavor to the meat the cooks had also inserted peppercorns and tiny quills of cinnamon into the flesh biting down on one of them prompted a man to reach for his wine goblet as my guests had toasted me before so now i pledged them lifting my cup i waited until i had their attention before saying to the memory of the days that have gone before they drank how could they not drink when the emperor of the romans proposed the toast but they did not understand i could see as much in their faces my mother also looked puzzled i caught theodoras eye she smiled at me i smiled back we all paused a while for another cup of wine before the servants brought in dessert my mother who had been dandling tiberius at every moment in which she was not actually eating now discovered he had fallen asleep in her lap will you excuse me she asked at my nod she rose holding her grandson in her arms to the guests she said i have my sweet here they nodded some no doubt having grandchildren of their own theodora leaned over toward me this will make it easier she said it will i agreed less explaining to do in came the cake full of dates and cherries and sweetened with honey in also came myakes resplendent in the gear of a captain of excubitores knowing him to be my crony the courtiers accepted his presence as nothing out of the ordinary for which i was glad is something wrong i asked he shook his big head his beard shone in the torchlight i was surprised to notice how gray he was getting we were none of us so young as we had been not a thing emperor he said helias sent me to ask you when wed be starting he looked a trifle sour at that but i knew what he could do and so had assigned the chief role here to the spatharios to see what he would make of it i dont think it will be very long i answered in a low voice a few of my guests leaned forward to try to hear what i was saying to myakes but only a few most being less obvious in their inquisitiveness i went on theyll want to be departing soon as they expect to rise with the sun tomorrow i wont delay them is the nomisma ready oh aye emperor he said in a hollow voice heliass little joke he did not approve i did saying i like it he shrugged bowed and departed about half an hour later taking advantage of a lull in the conversation i rose thus formally ending the banquet the functionaries familiar with such ceremonial dicta from the time during which leontios and apsimaros sat on the throne rose as one man and with fulsome praises thanked me for the boon of my company along with theodora i departed by the doorway leading toward my bedchamber the guests left through the other door the hallway outside of which took them straight to the entrance but that was not the only passage in the grand palace leading to the entrance theodora and i doubled back through the maze she following close behind me trusting me to know the way and so i did despite a long absence and visits only rare after my return even before stepping out of the door i heard voices raised in complaint and argument through the complaints helias kept saying this is all at the express order of the emperor well where is he so that we may protest to him one of the functionaries demanded his voice full of indignation here i am i said showing myself armed and armored excubitores surrounded my erstwhile guests on three sides and now that i had appeared moved to cut them off from access to the grand palace as well what is the meaning of this that same loud functionary asked loudly the meaning is simple i replied the lot of you prostituted yourselves with the usurpers for your whoredom you shall pay thou fool this night thy soul shall be required of theea where before i had quoted the nineteenth verse of the twelfth chapter of luke now i used the verse following the twentieth pointing to the bigmouthed wretch i said go up to helias as if in a daze he obeyed my spatharios tossed a nomisma in the air caught it and looked to see whether it showed my image or that of the son of god emperor it is the emperor he told me that is the power of the sword i replied fitting action to word helias drew his own sword which came free from the scabbard with a rasp of metal without a word of warning he drove it deep into the bureaucrats belly twisting his wrist to insure the stroke was mortal the bureaucrat fell with a shriek futilely clutching at his torn flesh the other functionaries shrieked too in horror and anticipation rather than anguish though their anguish would come soon enough i pointed to one of them whom i chose at random you go to helias when he balked i added whatever happens to you afterwards it will be worse if you disobey me now trembling the fellow approached my spatharios helias tossed the coin again he looked at it then toward me emperor it is the face of our lord these days i said we no longer use the cross out of reverence for him who was crucified on it the gibbet serves instead truss up this son of a whore and hang him once youve found out how many of his traitor friends go with him two excubitores seized the functionary thoughtfully helias had made sure he brought plenty of rope even more thoughtfully he had brought gags with which to silence the cries of the men bound and awaiting execution that however lessened the racket only a little for my guests realizing they were all fated for one death or the other howled like dogs crushed under wagon wheels they surged against the excubitores only to be driven back by bared blades one by one with me picking some and theodora the rest the functionaries and bureaucrats weep and bawl and blubber and foul their clothes as they might were compelled to go before helias for the toss of the coin as i recall rather more than half of them were put to the sword the rest bound and gagged and then hauled off to the gibbets to meet the fate fortune had decreed the last few died or were gagged cursing me die they did though when the last one had been cut down i spoke to the excubitores take this carrion and throw it into the cemetery of pelagios with the suicides for these vile beasts brought their deaths upon themselves turning to theodora i added tomorrow morning the servants will have to wash down the walk with buckets of water lest this blood draw flies good she said yes we will do that we went back into the palace we saw no servants as we hurried toward the bedchamber in which i suppose i had been conceived the nights work had put fear in the hearts of everyone who heard it as i had hoped it would once in the bedchamber we coupled like ferrets both of us heated red by the spectacle we had watched theodora bit my shoulder hard enough to draw blood have to get a bucket of water poured on that too i said we laughed loud and long myakes look brother elpidios if justinian felt like getting rid of people who had done something to him i didnt have a word to say against that besides people who had done things to him had done things to me too but hes right i wasnt happy about this it wasnt that i was jealous of helias really it wasnt its just that i didnt see much point to slaughtering the men justinian felt like killing that night the only thing theyd done was theyd kept working while leontios and apsimaros were emperor if they hadnt kept working them and people like them the empire would have started falling apart why did he blame them for that and if he was going to kill them he shouldnt have made a game out of it i was a soldier for a long time brother killing is a serious business or it should be doing it that way makes it cheap degrades it you say yes thanks thats a word i wouldnt have come up with on my own justinian said he wanted the people afraid of him and they were all right but when a ruler is strong and they know hell land on them if they get out of line thats one kind of fear if theyre afraid of him on account of they dont know what the devil hes liable to do next thats fear too but its a different kind justinian either didnt care about the difference or couldnt tell there was one hed sworn he wouldnt spare one of his enemies the way he acted he was making sure hed have plenty of em justinian when morning came my mother raised a fuss as i had known she would they were traitors to our house and so deserved whatever fate i chose to give them i told her she would have kept on complaining but i turned my back on her and walked out of the grand palace outside servants were still busy cleaning up the mess had i had it to do over i would have had the excubitores slay the functionaries farther from the palace something to remember in case i decided to play the same game again instead of inventing a new one having called for a horse i rode west from the palace to the city wall to view the gibbets that had gone up there the night before to accommodate those of my guests to whom chance had given that death a couple of gibbets stood empty as more than half the functionaries had been put to the sword i was sure i could find deserving men for those empty gibbets and vowed to myself they would not stay empty long only a few crows and gulls attended the corpses the meat not yet being ripe down below the inner wall people stared up at the bodies on display but not with such avid curiosity as they had immediately after my return to the capital to the constantinopolitan urban sophisticates mere executions had lost some of their power to entertain if not to edify i also surveyed the dead courtiers with something less than the pleasure i had expected turning to one of the guards i said the trouble with these wretches is they didnt die well once they knew that would be their fate they should have accepted it herakleios the usurpers brother was worth all of them and more besides yes emperor the guard answered what else could he possibly have said if he disagreed with me he might have gone up on one of those empty gibbets himself having viewed all of last nights guests todays executed traitors i rode back to the blakhernai palace to which by that time theodora and tiberius had also returned you go and your mother shouts and shouts at me theodora said i tell her i think they should die too and she shouts louder my mother will speak her mind i said anyone would think i was related to her for a moment theodora looked puzzled at that then understanding spread over her face and she laughed in truth i was not paying full attention to her words or my own ever since my mentioning herakleios up on the wall he had been in my mind as general of the military district of the anatolics he might well have been able to give me a harder fight than he did most of westcentral and southwestern anatolia fell into that military district had he stayed there and resisted with his full power he would have been harder to overcome than he was caught with a scratch force in thrace after i had seized constantinople summoning myakes leo and helias i put my sudden insight to them god did not speak from a burning bush to ordain that the military district of the anatolics should be as it is any general there has to think of becoming a usurper if for no other reason than that he commands such a large army he needs a large army helias said to help fight the arabs not that large i answered and the soldiers would still be there only under two commanders rather than one ah leos eyes lit you want to divide the military district not pension off soldiers yes that is good i think or at least not bad if you do it that way who would the new general be myakes asked barisbakourios writes that a tourmarch of the military district of the opsikion a certain christopher from philippopolis in thrace has done good work and deserves a reward i said do any of you know this man myakes and helias both shook their heads leo however spoke up at once saying yes he is a good fighter he gave the bulgars fits a few years ago when he was still in thrace that leo should have known christopher surprised me not at all by then i had come to suspect that if i asked him about some petty frankish noble in a land no roman has seen for a hundred years he would have furnished accurate particulars without batting an eye what will you call the new military district emperor myakes asked not the military district of the philippopolitans i hope helias said no one could hope to say it he had stumbled over it himself we all laughed leo said how about the military district of the thrakesians after christopher of thrace having savored that i dipped my head in assent like pagan zeus in the iliad let it be so i said and so it was christopher receiving his new appointment worked diligently to separate the men and town under his command from those remaining in the military district of the anatolics he did this of course to enhance his own position but it served my purposes too placing two potential rivals in an area that had formerly known but a single powerful too powerful sometimes leader when i invited a couple of dozen bureaucrats of middling station to a feast at the blakhernai palace only eight of them came to the anastasiakos dining hall the rest were suddenly taken ill with such an astonishing variety of diseases that anyone would have thought a whole wave of plagues had suddenly descended on constantinople which god prevent from ever actually taking place with so few guests attending we all gorged ourselves the cooks having prepared far more than our small party could consume i thought we could have done better still but some of the bureaucrats seemed slightly off their feed for no reason i could fathom here i told them after the servants cleared away what was left i had planned to give each of my friends five nomismata but since so many of your colleagues were taken ill each of you gets t hree purses not one and fifteen nomismata in all i passed out the presents with my own hands god bless you emperor they gasped out almost in unison and on my giving them leave to go all but fled the palace turning to theodora i remarked anyone would think they expected to find soldiers waiting for them out there i do not know why she answered in her slow deliberate greek this is not the grand palace we both found that very funny our guests having departed i summoned myakes before the feast i had taken pains to learn the dwelling places of all the functionaries i would invite at my order theophylaktos brought me this list a pen and a jar of ink i lined through the names of the men who had joined me at supper that done i gave the list to myakes saying gather your men together and arrest everyone whose name you see here i want all of them back at this palace before the sun comes up tomorrow morning yes emperor myakes said ill see to it he had never had my fire and some of what he had had was gone out of him but he would obey even if he persisted in asking questions like what will you do with them wipe their noses i snarled get you gone he bowed and departed myakes yes of course i knew what hed do with them brother elpidios or i had a pretty good idea anyhow no i didnt want to see him do it especially not so soon after the last massacre but he gave the orders if i didnt do what he said i figured id be next up on a gibbet all he could think about near enough was paying back everybody he thought had ever wronged him i took a look at the list divided it into four parts and sent out four troops of excubitores i led one of them i can do my own dirty work i can first door we knocked on the fellow we came for opened it himself you dont look sick says i to him he tried to slam the door but i stuck a foot in it and my boys went in and grabbed him his wife and brats were wailing behind us when he left the other three were just as easy and none of them looked sick either back we went to blakhernai getting all four of them hadnt taken two hours have mercy on us they kept saying over and over in the name of christ have mercy but that wasnt for me to say it was up to justinian i didnt think any of those sixteen poor bastards would get away with his neck turned out i was wrong though justinian all the bureaucrats who had refused my invitation to dine having been assembled i inspected them one a thin pale fellow with shadows under his eyes coughed wetly rackingly thick yellowish mucus kept streaming from his nose which he wiped on the sleeve of his tunic you area john son of eusebios the customs inspector not so i said yes emperor he coughed again i am sorry i could not still more coughsjoin you tonight but may i ask why your men hauled me from my bed no you may not i told him he bowed his head whereupon snot dripped down onto his sandals go home and go about your business i turned to myakes give him an escort so no footpad falls on him in the night to theophylaktos i added see that john is sent fifteen nomismata in the morning yes emperor the eunuch bowed john afflicted or not suddenly walked with longer straighter strides as the excubitores led him out of the palace my giving him presents eased the minds of the other guests brought so late to the dining hall john having departed however i said to those bureaucrats one of your number truly was ill what have the rest of you to say for yourselves when the emperor of the romans summons you to a feast should you not make every effort to attend him they all began talking at once some trying to justify claiming illness while hale others still trying to claim illness despite healthy appearance in the course of a days work the emperor of the romans normally hears a good many lies in the course of a few minutes i heard as many lies as i normally do in a days work enough i said at last whereupon the bureaucrats mercifully fell silent the plain and simple truth is you did not come because you were afraid of what i might do to you after what happened at your last feast emperor one of them blurted can you blame us of course i can blame you i answered he cringed they all cringed the men i had killed after my last feast were every one of them traitors i went on are you traitors do you think i think you are traitors do you think you are traitors is that why you stayed away from me i listened to denials as empty and pointless and useless as their pretenses at sickness had been had i believed them the only course left open to me would have been to promote every one of the rascals making them or perhaps to order cyrus the patriarch to declare them numbered among the saints but i did not believe them their evident good health and their equally evident fear of me convicted them all liars i shouted cutting through their babble by your own actions shall you be judged if you do not trust me how can i be expected to trust you you are all sacked every last one of you this they bore up under with equanimity i heard one of them mutter to another better to lose my position than my neck doing their deceitful best to appear dejected they turned and made for the door of the dining hall where they had not eaten stop i said sharply i did not give you leave to go when i say you are sackeda now i stopped they would find out soon enough meanwhile at my order the excubitores bound their wrists behind them is everything in full readiness i asked myakes oh yes emperor he answered rare in that he was loyal and obedient even when not altogether happy with my purposes what with that john who really was sick we even have one left over fine lets get on with it then i said at swords point the excubitores made the functionaries leave the palace of blakhernai we marched them to a dromon moored on the golden horn not far from the palace not far from the pier at which theodora had reached the imperial city either torches blazed by and on the galley which carried a full crew of oarsmen and sailors two piles of coarse canvas smaller than the sail stood on deck so did stacked stones as if for a catapult one by one the miscreants i had seized stumbled up the gangplank onto the dromon the captain was a young fellow named stephen whom i had recently raised to the dignity of patrician he prostrated himself on the deck as soon as i came aboard rise i said impatiently i want this done shouldnt be too hard emperor he looked at the prisoners nodding on approval on seeing them already in bonds no shouldnt be too hard they arent going anyplace his smile gleamed in the torchlight at his orders the sailors cast off the lines mooring the dromon to the wharf the rowers backed oars then turned and took us out of the golden horn past the lighthouses marking the channel and into the middle of the sea of marmara lamps and torches and candles made constantinople glow and twinkle far more brightly than the starstrewn sky overhead what are you going to do to us emperor asked one of the bureaucrats who had not cared to enjoy my hospitality are you exiling us to anatolia youll know soon enough i answered you before all the others that did little to reassure him but reassuring him was not my object to stephen i said have we gone far enough yet should be fine emperor he answered were about halfway between the city and the other shore he pointed east toward chalcedon whose lights were far fewer and of smaller extent than those of the imperial city well then i said and nodded toward a couple of the excubitores who had boarded the dromon with us deal with the curious one first going over to the piled canvas they picked up one of the sacks there and threw it over the bureaucrats head before he let out more than one startled squawk they knocked him down tying the mouth of the bag securely shut with a length of rope the other end of the rope they tied to one of the stones ignoring the frantic kicks from within the sack they pushed it and the stone into the sea it sank very quickly no emperor the other disloyal bureaucrats shouted not us emperor we didnt do anything were innocent have mercy at my nod the excubitores popped the second one into a sack tied the sack to a stone and shoved sack and stone and all into the water the outcries from within cut off as abruptly as if the fellow had been decapitated bawling like steers the rest of the bureaucrats tried to break away from the guardsmen who hemmed them in one succeeded and being chased by two excubitores leaped into the sea of marmara of his own accord i wondered if he could swim with his hands tied behind his back by his floundering i doubt he could have swum had they been untied he spluttered a couple of unintelligible curses or pleas before his head sank beneath the surface and did not rise again methodically the excubitores threw sacks over the other bureaucrats and flung them into the sea there goes the last of them myakes said when it was done he rubbed at his calf one of the men being sacked had managed to kick him what now a good nights work i answered now we go back to the palace of course unless you know of someone else who needs killing so badly it wont keep till morning he shook his head thats not what i meant emperor what now what comes next youll have people afraid to come to your feasts and even more afraid not to is that what you want of course thats what i want i answered myakes was not usuall y so dim people who fear me will be too afraid to plot against me theyll obey instead unless you make them so afraid they think striking at you is a better bet than waiting to see what you do next myakes said if i kill enough of them once i kill enough of them the rest will be too cowed to let a thought like that enter their minds i said myakes looked as if he wanted to argue further i cut him off by saying to stephen take us back to the harbor were through here yes emperor he said and gave the oarsmen their orders on my return to the blakhernai palace theodora asked all good all good i answered we have a couple of sacks left over as a matter of fact i explained about the bureaucrat who leaped into the sea before the excubitores could give him his new allencircling cloak and wondered whether god would condemn him as a suicide that done i finished if you have anyone in mind for a leftover let me know and ill tend to it i think about it she answered seriously having made it clear to the people and most of all to the people possessed of authority in constantinople that i aimed to rule as king stork rather than king log i was afforded few opportunities over the next couple of years to exhibit storklike behavior as no one dared risk my displeasure in any way life was good this is not to say the executioners spent those two years drowsing in the sun and letting their swords rust traitors kept emerging some being denounced to me while others i ferreted out on my own a few heads were usually on display at the milion but i saw no further need for such salutary and sanguinary lessons as i had administered after my banquets matters touching on the neighbors of the roman empire also remained largely quiet during that time the bulgars came south over the border into romania a couple of times but the raids were no more than nuisances i wondered if they were tervels way of gaining some of the booty my successful return to the throne had cost him whenever i sent complaints the raids stoppeda for a while in the east oualid proved a less aggressive ruler of the deniers of christ than abimelekh had been before him he did despoil the churches of damascus of their wealth and also in his arrogance supplanted greek in his chancery with the arabs own barbarous and guttural tongue the previous miscalled commander of the faithful had attempted the same measure only to abandon it on discovering how illsuited to the task arabic was oualid with barbarous presumption has persisted and persists even as i write here in the imperial city tiberius learned to walk and to talk he soon proved as strongwilled as any member of my house shouting no whenever he found himself checked in any way when shouting failed he screamed or threw things or tried to bite albeit the despair of the servants he made me quite proud the popes of rome still refused to subscribe to the canons of the fifthsixth synod but when sisinnios an ancient monk from syria died a mere twenty days after being selected bishop of rome his successor constantine another syrian proved more reasonable in these matters than several of his predecessors had been and constantine and i discovered a common interest not long after he became bishop of rome the bishop of ravenna having joined the majority constantine ordained a certain felix as his successor it had long been the custom for each new bishop of ravenna to give the pope a written pledge of obedience on assuming office this felix refused to do claiming that ravenna being the capital of roman italy and rome as he put it merely a backwater he would do as he saw fit not as constantine saw fit for him to do in this assertion he had the strong backing of stephen the exarch of ravenna the roman viceroy in italy just as felix presumed upon his dependent relationship with the bishop of rome so stephen presumed on his dependent relationship with me the exarchate of ravenna by its nature gave the holder of the officer considerable autonomy but stephen far more than other exarchs before him forgot he was merely the viceroy of the vicegerent of god on earth had felixs rebellion against constantine succeeded the next rebellion would have been against me still i might have been inclined to sit idly by and let constantine fight his own battles had not leo said emperor if you can rid him of this turbulent priest wont he be more reasonable about your synod a reasonable pope almost i was moved to laughter but constantine had not made himself nearly so hateful to me as some earlier bishops of rome and i had already discovered leos talent for underhanded dealings of all sorts well we shall see ravenna lying as it does in the middle of a swampy bog is as nearly impregnable by land as makes no difference if i was going to bring stephen and felix under my control it would have to be by sea the nearest roman ships were in sicily under the command of the patrician theodore and to him i wrote of my requirements he followed my orders perfectly or better than perfectly sailing up to ravenna with a fleet of dromons he invited stephen felix and other local dignitaries to a feast outside the walls all unsuspecting they came whereupon he seized them got them back to his ship without a man of his being hurt and brought them to constantinople on their reaching the imperial city i had them brought to the throne room in the grand palace which being far more magnificent than any chamber at the blakhernai palace was far more suitable for occasions of solemn grandeur such as this theodore a big bluff man with a bushy black beard led in the captives who were weighted down with chains that clanked at each step they took felix and the other villains threw themselves down on their faces before me grizzling out cries for mercy i descended from the gold and emeraldencrusted throne the pearl prependoulia that dangled from my crown brushing against my cheeks i kicked felix in the ribs as he crouched in the posture of prostration mercy i shouted standing over him i have no mercy on any of my enemies and anyone who rebels against the authority of the roman empire is an enemy of mine look at leontios look at apsimaros look at them and think how easy their ends were next to those you shall have you knew better and flouted my will regardless death for you death for you all my courtiers clapped their hands at the sentence the miscreants from ravenna groaned and trembled theodore sounding interested even eager asked what sort of death emperor ill leave my executioners to please themselves i replied with fire and knives and weights and water they can make each death different and every death take a long time tomorrow is time enough though for tonight let them let everyone think on the fate awaiting them take them away away they went moaning away i went well pleased with the days ceremony they no doubt lay on the filthy straw of their cells their heads full of nightmares over what was to come i lay on soft linen and i also dreamt of what lay ahead for them in my dream i saw bishop felix as an old man which he surely would not become did i slay him his beard being as black as theodores he stumbled toward me hands outstretched groping for me calling my name begging for continued existence he touched me and i awoke theodoras small hand rested on my arm but i lay some time awake pondering the message of the dream and reluctantly concluded i had no choice but to let felix live lest i go against gods will by destroying the possibility of his older self very well i said to myself he shall live but he shall not go unpunished i slept soundly the rest of the night when morning came i made the arrangements necessary for my changed plans then had felix brought to the blakhernai palace the excubitores pushed him down on his face in front of me i have decided to spare your life i said without preamble god bless you emperor he said i pray that i cut him off instead of executing you i shall have you blinded and exiled to the regions of pontos having listened to cyrus i knew how dreary a place it was without his sight felix would find it drearier still he coughed and spluttered i might have let him keep his life but nothing that made it worth living please emperora he managed at last take him to the kitchens i told the excubitores the executioner will be waiting for us the guardsmen hauled felix to his feet and herded him down the passageway i followed curious to witness the process the executioner had described for me earlier in the day in the kitchen the cooks were curious too crowding around the executioner until he had to shoo them back to give himself room to work among the cooks was heliass black slave john who looked like a shadow of the men of normal hue all ready emperor the executioner said on seeing me come in behind the prisoner then go ahead i said he had the excubitores stand felix next to a high table where the cooks did their mixing and kneading while the traitorous bishop of ravenna dolefully waited the executioner picked up a long wooden peel and thrust it into the oven in which my daily bread was baked instead of drawing forth a loaf however he took out a silver bowl that had been heated almost redhot handling the peel as skillfully as any baker he set the bowl in front of felix who tried to recoil from its heat but was prevented by the guards the executioner poured a jar of hot vinegar into the bowl a great cloud of noxious vapor rose from it into this vapor the executioner had the excubitores bend felixs head he himself w ith the skill he had learned as part of his trade forced the recalcitrant bishop to open his eyelids so that the surface of his eyeballs was exposed to the caustic fumes felix howled like a wolf and did his best to twist away he could not after what the executioner judged sufficient time he let felix lift his head from the fumes of the boiling vinegar felixs whole face was red as if scorched his eyes looked as if the executioner had scraped their surface with a file or perhaps as if they had been rubbed with sand as a mason will sand down marble to make it smooth but they were not smooth on the contrary i could tell at a glance felix would not see again well done i told the executioner just as i desired felix would have been weeping i think but no tears flowed from his eyes which were horribly swollen along with being blistered and abraded to the excubitores i said take him to the harbor and put him aboard the ship waiting there to take him to amastris which place from what cyrus had said was as close to living death as made no difference he shall never trouble ravenna again and off into exile felix went myakes and a few years later brother elpidios back from exile felix came once justinian was cast down he got his bishopric back even if he was blind and do you know what brother he spent a few days at this very monastery before he sailed on toward ravenna id only been blind a couple of months myself then we spent a deal of time talking he and i did he told me some useful things because hed had longer to get used to it hed found same as i was finding being in a monastery helps you go to the same places every day do the same things and you dont usually have to fret about where this or that is because you dont own this and you dont own that either no i dont know what sort of bishop he made once he got to ravenna again i never heard a word about it ravennas a long way from here for all i know he might still be bishop but ill tell you brother if ive found anything in all these years its that i dont know much justinian not long after i blinded felix and executed the rest of the rebels from ravenna helias came up to me and said emperor may i talk with you for a little while what is it i asked by his manner i judged it was a matter of some importance and of some delicacy too emperor he said taking a deep breath i dont quite know how to tell you this but i fear leo is plotting to steal your throne from you if he had thought to gain my attention he had succeeded do you i said why do you think that it only stands to reason he answered hes too clever for his own good by half and hes always going around snooping into other peoples affairs i dont like the way he watches me out of the corner of his eye either all that is as may be i answered but i must tell you that i am glad leo is diligent in my behalf i want those who serve me to give me good service if i have only fools to do my bidding i shall be in great danger but a clever man will serve himself while claiming to serve you helias said you have given me no evidence whatever that leo is plotting against me though i told him i cannot condemn him for doing his work too well if you have any evidence i will hear it until then do not trouble me with this charge helias bowed and went away a few days later a patrician who was called mauros on account of his extremely black beard came to me with a similar accusation and with a similar lack of evidence as well on questioning mauros it became clear that he had not plotted his charges along with helias but had made them independently that two men should devise identical indictments of leo neither knowing what the other was doing made me more concerned about the young spatharios from near mesembria than either accusation would have on its own accordingly i summoned myakes and asked him what he thought about leo i had not told him why i sought his opinion after his usual pause for thought he replied emperor if youre asking me whether i like leo the answer is no not very much but if youre asking me whether hes good at what he does why youd have to be blinder than felix to say no yes i know hes good at his job i said is his job the only one with which hes concerned seeing that myakes did not follow i spelled it out alphabetagamma does he want mine ah thats what you want to know he said enlightenment quickening his features he thought some more before going on if he does emperor i havent seen it if i had id tell you in a heartbeat you know that if i had id have told you already you know that too since he was correct i thanked him and sent him on his way no more than two weeks afterwards the patrician stephen warned me leo aspired to my place again i questioned him again he had no solid proof his claim was unconnected to those of helias and mauros as best i could determine i dismissed him as i had dismissed them his words however combined with those of helias and mauros sent me to watching leo more closely than i had before in nothing that i saw in nothing that my privy agents discovered was the slightest hint of disloyalty what those agents did discover however was an enormous gift for dissembling thus while married leo maintained no fewer than three concubines in different quarters of the imperial city each of them convinced he cherished her alone as was his wife a man capable of such deception was also capable of hatching and nursing plots against me plots difficult of detection that he had not done so or that i had not detected him doing so proved little i began to cast about for ways i could be certain his undoubted abilities were used for my benefit rather than to my detriment thanks to the workings of divine providence such an opportunity was not long in coming beyond the northeastern reaches of roman anatolia lie the mountains and valleys of the caucasus some of the peoples of this region favor rome some incline toward the arabs miscalled commander of the faithful while most back whichever side has given them more presents most recently among the most consistently proroman tribes in the caucasus is that of the alans the followers of the false prophet however had recently extended their influence over the alans neighbors the abasgians fearing they would be next the alans sent an envoy to me seeking aid against their neighbors who now had arab soldiers alongside them i know the very man to lead your resistance against the deniers of christ i exclaimed i shall give you my own spatharios leo who by his nature is well suited both to war and to complex bargaining i spoke with vehemence enough to impress the alan greatly nor was i telling him anything less than the truth with him i shall send the sum of five thousand nomismata that he may hire soldiers or make bargains a euphemism for pay bribesas he sees fit god bless you emperor the alan exclaimed you have given me and my prince more than we dared expect leo shall sail for phasis the black sea port onto which your country opens no later than next week i am confident he will do great things for you if leo suspected he was being banished he gave no sign of it ill tie their tails in knots emperor he said send me after them i havent been on that side of the world since i was a little boy and never up in those mountains he smiled i hear the women in the caucasus are pretty too business before pleasure i said sternly oh of course he answered as if surprised i could have thought anything else but if pleasure comes along i wont send it packing given his philanderings here in the imperial city i believed him he sailed for phasis a few days later along with the alan envoy and the gold in due course he reached the town on the eastern shore of the black sea and wrote to me that he was going into the interior of the country there leaving the money behind so that it would remain safe until such time as he decided exactly how it might best be disbursed having heard that much from him i put him out of my mind the caucasus being so remote his success if he found some would be gratifying but not vital while his failure would not send an arab host storming toward constantinople as had happened in the days of my youth i wondered if he would prove as ingenious as he appeared and then a few weeks later helias brought before me a little old wrinkled man who stank of leather emperor this is theodoulos the bootmaker who fashions the imperial footgear tell the emperor what youve told me theodoulos yes yes theodoulos said thickly for he had only a few teeth this leo this spatharios a word on account of which he sprayed me with spittlehe came into my shop and he asked me he did he asked mea what did he ask you i demanded yes yes thats right he did ask me theodoulos said he asked me he did all right the dye helias prompted no no not ready to die yet theodoulos said though at that moment he was closer to dying than he knew but then somewhere in the darkness of his wits a lamp was lighted oh the dye yes yes leo he asked me he did what dye it was i used to get just that shade of shade of shade of of red on the imperial boots did he i said he had no business asking you that that shade of red is reserved for the emperor alone had leo not been interested in becoming emperor it would not have concerned him emperor you should recall him and strike off his disloyal head helias said i should like to recall him and strike off his head i answered but if i should do you think him more likely to come back to the imperial city or go over to the abasgians heliass face told me what he thought thinking the same thing myself i went on in meditative tones a man with his gift for intrigue could severely trouble the roman empire that is so emperor helias admitted but will you let him go free and show others closer to home a man can prosper through treason he shall not prosper i said and then again in an altogether different almost startled tone of voice he shall not prosper what will you do helias asked me that is my affair i answered not wanting him to get a glimpse of the way my mind worked though dispraising leos disloyalty he might have some of his own to theodoulos i said half a pound of gold to you for what you have told me of leo god bless you emperor the bootmaker exclaimed and prostrated himself again dismissing him and helias i called for a secretary the man having arrived i dictated a letter when i had finished i said i shall want a fair copy of that before noon so that i can sign it it must be on a dromon bound for phasis this afternoon yes emperor the scribe replied of course emperor he knew perfectly well what would happen to him did he fail but being employed to write write he did and i affixed my signature in the scarlet ink reserved for the holder of the imperial dignity a courier on a fast horse took the letter to the harbor and stayed there until with his own eyes he had seen the dromon depart it returned to this godguarded city within three days of the time i had reckoned to be the fastest possible its captain a weatherbeaten veteran named agapetos hastened to the blakhernai palace as soon as it tied up at one of the quays along the golden horn on being told he had come i summoned him directly into my presence and even forgave him the timewasting ritual of prostration tell me at once whether you have accomplished the task i set you i said emperor i have agapetos answered the gold the spatharios leo left behind in phasis was still there obedient to your command i took charge of it and have returned it to constantinople even as we speak it is being carried back to the imperial treasury splendid i said and then again splendid pharaoh of egypt set the israelites to making bricks without straw and an ambassador without money is as useless as a brick that has no straw the native tribes of the caucasus will surely complete leos ruination yes emperor agapetos did not ask why i wanted leo ruined that was not his affair and he knew it he made the perfect sort of servant for me he did exactly as he was told he did it well and he never ever asked why i always kept close track of the ships coming to this godguarded and imperial city from kherson phanagoria and the other towns on the northern coast of the black sea i had scores still unsettled with the folk of those regions the more i learned of their doings the better i could prepare my own when that time came not long after i gave leo his comeuppance a ship captain out of phanagoria sought me out coming to the palace at blakhernai when the eunuch theophylaktos learned what message he bore he passed him on to me say on i told the captain after he had prostrated himself thank you emperor he answered as i said to your steward here along with my usual wax and tallow and hides i have a message from the khagan of the khazars for you do you i murmured ibouzeros gliabanos has not had much to say to me since i returned to constantinople i thought he owned a sense of shame maybe i was wrong well what does he say emperor the captain said uncomfortably he asks your leave to come to constantinople himself to visit his sister and you had i been drinking wine i daresay i should have choked as it was i coughed a couple of times before saying he does does he he dares aye the unhappy emissary answered he told me to tell you he didnt kill you when you were in his capital and he thought youd do him the same favor hes camped on the steppe near phanagoria waiting for your word if i tell him you grant him leave hell sail with me my next trip into the city for one of the rare times in my life i was not instantly certain what to do tell ibouzeros gliabanos to stay far away tell him to come and then slay him had he not been my wifes brother i should have done that but he was tell him to come and let him escape i had gone safe out of atil regardless of what happened later but letting anyone escape my vengeance had become bitter as wormwood bitter as myrrh to me instead of giving the fellow his answer on the spot i spoke to theophylaktos put him up for the night here in the palace in the morning i shall tell him what i have decided it shall be as you say emperor if my indecision startled theophylaktos i never knew he prided himself on his imperturbability the only time i saw it breached being when he returned to the imperial city after the illfated journey to get theodora back from her brother as he went off with the ship captain i went back to talk the news over with theodora whom i found spinning flax into thread with three or four of her serving women having dismissed them i told her of ibouzeros gliabanoss desire to visit constantinople my brother to come here she said her narrow eyes widening he puts his head in the mouth of the wolf her greek had grown much more fluent in the time since her arrival in constantinople but she still flavored it as she does to this day with turns of phrase calling to mind the steppe whence she sprang this one struck me as particularly apt yes he does i replied with a certain amount of anticipation how shall we requite him for trying to have me killed in phanagoria theodora looked troubled he let you live before she said he wed me to you when you killed his men and fled to the bulgars he cared for me and for tiberius he has treated you badly but also well and she added he is my brother i sighed for your sake then you want me to let him come and to treat him well i love you but god will turn away from me if i do not avenge myself on all my enemies if my brother were truly your enemy you would be dead now and i would be back at atil theodora looked a challenge at me as if daring me to deny her words seeing i could not she went on and the saddlebags no you would say the scales are even on both sides he has done you well and harm both it is a balance god will forgive you what she was also saying was that she would not forgive me if having invited ibouzeros gliabanos to the imperial city i then turned on him i sighed again having feared that would be her response very well he may come i will remember the good he has done me especially since you are the biggest part of that good thank you she exclaimed and casting her arms around my neck kissed me until i could hardly breathe shortly thereafter we adjourned to the bedchamber where she threw herself on me and rode me as a jockey rides a racehorse such immodest and unfeminine aggression was on occasion extremely enjoyable and even complimentary she having learned from me everything she knew of love between men and women having been thus persuaded both intellectually and lectually i summoned the ship captain when morning came and told him ibouzeros gliabanos was welcome to visit the imperial city and i swear by god and his son that no harm will come to the khagan of the khazars through any action on my part or on the part of my servants i added i shall tell him you have taken this oath emperor the seaman said he did not insist on it as a condition for coming but wanted to learn whether you would offer it of your own free will had i not already known ibouzeros gliabanos was a canny cautious man his behavior in this regard would have instructed me he did not demand the oath which would have implied he failed to trust me he did not even mention it which proved the best way to extract it from me though a pagan and a barbarian the khagan of the khazars was no fool the ship bearing the khagan and his retinue sailed into constantinople a bit more than a month later i greeted him at the golden horn as i had his sister on her arrival and as i had done with her brought a troop of excubitores both to protect myself and for the sake of pomp having made the acquaintance of the khagan in khazaria myakes was the logical choice to head the troop ibouzeros gliabanos strode up the quay toward the excubitores theodora and me a little man i correctly assumed to be an interpreter walked a pace behind him and to his left the rest of the khazars followed all of them the khagan included kept looking this way and that as if having trouble believing what they saw having bowed to me and embraced his sister ibouzeros gliabanos spoke in his own language the interpreter rendering his words into greek for me i thought i knew what a city was but i see i was wrong theodora clapped her hands together i said the same thing when i came here she exclaimed in greek the interpreter having performed his office the khagan spoke with a hint of sadness perceptible even though i did not grasp his words until they were translated you have become a roman my sister i have theodora said in greek and then went on in the khazars tongue she translated for me i told my brother he gave me to a roman as a wife and that i have become of my husbands people as a wife should i knew that already ibouzeros gliabanos answered and theodora nodded proudly had she not warned me against her brothe rs myrmidons i should not have survived to return to this godguarded city the khagan then spoke to me saying now i understand why you wanted so much to come back for the sake of the city do you mean i asked and he nodded i shall henceforth omit mention of the interpreter a man scarcely memorable i said yes i am glad to live here again but i came back because it is mine you are a king he said and it was my turn to nod turning to the excubitores he recognized myakes a king who is a good king will have good subjects is it well with you myakes who traveled with your king when only you thought he was one it is very well with me ibouzeros gliabanos myakes answered with a bow for the khagan do i guess rightly that you had somewhat to do with the passing of balgitzin and papatzun ibouzeros gliabanos asked myakes shrugged his gilded scalemail jingling slightly at the motion they obeyed their rulers i obeyed mine had i known he could give answers as diplomatic as that i might have sent him to damascus to dicker with the miscalled commander of the faithful ibouzeros gliabanos dipped his head also appreciating the reply to me he said while i waited to hear if you would receive me i had word of another of your servants because he knew you and some of your followers had spent time with me the prince of the abasgians sent to me asking if i knew a roman spatharios named leo but he was not with you then no he wasnt i agreed what did the abasgian say of him to my surprise the khazar grinned at me he said you did not have anyone else in the whole empire who was as big a liar as this leo did he by god i said well he wasnt far wrong he said this leo was still leading the alans in war against his people even though he had no money to pay the alans as hed been claiming the prince said hed captured this leo good i exclaimed this seemed to disconcert ibouzeros gliabanos but he went on but the alans rescued him and theyre still fighting the abasgians the princes messenger was confused which means the prince was likely confused too im rather confused myself i told the khagan and then in a low voice i said to theodora it is as well that i sent leo to the edge of the world were he closer to the imperial city he would be too dangerous to trust in the caucasus at least i have some use from him yes she said his eyes look every which way at the same time ibouzeros gliabanos said you must show me this city justinian i have heard so much of it now i see i did not hear enough tervel the bulgar said the same thing i answered so did your sister so does everyone who has heard of the marvels of constantinople without having seen them ah tervel the bulgar the khagan of the khazars said we do not always get on well with the bulgars either those to our north or those to our west how do you like tervel as a neighbor without him id not be here talking with you today i said but that does not mean he has not been difficult sometimes bulgar raiders had begun harassing thrace in larger numbers lately the embassy i sent to tervel to complain of that had for the first time returned without obtaining satisfaction of any sort maybe we could both fight him at the same time ibouzeros gliabanos said and squeeze him between us like a seed between thumb and forefinger maybe i said unenthusiastically having the khazars on the northern border of the roman empire struck me as being no more desirable than having the bulgars there my preference would have been for all the steppe nomads to vanish off the face of the earth and in so doing to take the arabs with them i installed ibouzeros gliabanos and his retinue in the blakhernai palace aside from scandalizing the servants with demands for fermented mares milk and molesting one of the maids they behaved well enough the khagan spent much of his time talking with his sister and making the acquaintance of his nephew having had any number of children by his retinue of wives he knew well how to ingratiate himself with tiberius not caring to be in his company more than necessity demanded i dedicated to others the task of showing him around the imperial city i did have hopes that encountering cyrus whom he had met in atil in the splendid surroundings of the great church might cause him to be persuaded as to the truths of our holy and orthodox christian faith as his sister had been in this however i was disappointed i consoled myself by remembering how richly he deserved to burn in hell for eternity for having tried to slay me gods justice surely would not be denied in the world to come if ibouzeros gliabanos intended any moves in concert with the roman empire as i believe he did he also was disappointed i tolerated him on account of past favors and his relationship to my wife but i would never ever trust him he realized this after a time saying i could give you all the herds and all the gold i have and you would not send me a single soldier in exchange that is true i replied tell me though whom you would rather have for a neighbor a man who will do nothing against his will even in exchange for gold or a man who will do anything at all so long as he is paid for it despite their swarthy cast his cheeks flushed red having taken apsimaross gold in payment for the blood of his own brotherinlaw myself he recognized the point of the gibe perhaps that was what made him decide to take ship once more a few days later but the sailing season was drawing to an end and i can understand his desire not to be away from his barbarous people through the winter season were one of them to prove as devious and disloyal as he was himself he might have found himself in a predicament with which experience had made me entirely too familiar then again too he might have wondered whether if i had him in constantinople the whole winter long i would yield to temptation and arrange for his sudden untimely passing from this life to that of eternity i confess i was wondering the same thing myself had he not been theodoras brothera but he was and so i had to let him go however much i regretted it not even the emperor of the romans realizes every dream in full before boarding the ship that would take him across the black sea he embraced his sister and said to me i thank you for letting me live since he chose not to dissemble hypocritically i followed the same course answering thank your sister not me i have already thanked her i thank you as well all his retinue had gone aboard the ship by then he hurried after the rest of the khazars as if worried yet that i might change my mind with theodora beside me i could not but as i watched his ship sail toward the bosporos i regretted not having had the foresight to post a couple of dromons at the straits outlet to the black sea so they might incinerate the vessel him in it with liquid fire a storm at sea would almost surely have been blamed for his demise the sailors who did the deed would not have blabbed knowing as they must how i requited those betraying me for my wifes sake i let him go such are the follies of uxoriousness he is khagan of the khazars even yet once i settle with kherson and the other cities thereabouts that will be time enough to deal with him the bulgars raids having grown intolerable i resolved to punish them as they deserved despite their being ruled by a man whom i had myself created a caesar of the romans assembling the cavalry forces from the military districts of anatolia i ordered them to cross into thrace so they could teach tervel that his exalted rank did not bring with it the privilege of preying on the roman provinces adjacent to the lands he ruled lands themselves roman by right this was in the twentyfourth year of my reign the fourth since my return from unjust exile when i returned to the imperial city i myakes wait a minute brother elpidios wheres the rest of it what do you mean what do i mean the rest of it the part where justinian talks about the campaign against the bulgars thats what didnt you skip a leaf or two or three in the codex there what you didnt thats all he says well i will be no thats something ive finally learned its better not to say in a monastery but its hard to believe all the same up till now hes pretty much told the whole story even if he and i dont always remember things the same way theres a lot missing here though one devil of a lot what do you mean why didnt he tell it how should i know im not justinian i can think of a couple of reasons off the top of my head though that might have something to do with it for one thing this part would have been written right near the end of his reign revenge was all he had in his mind or pretty close to all anyhow he didnt get much revenge against the bulgars and that ties in with the other reason i can think of justinian botched this campaign every way you can think of he was never a man who was easy to embarrass but when he looked back on things here if he wasnt embarrassed he bloody well should have been was i there brother elpidios oh yes that i was i saw the whole mess right up close i was lucky to get away with my own neck so was justinian all right ill tell you about it since justinian didnt and since most of the people who were there are bound to be dead by now so justinian didnt let out a peep eh isnt that something i can hardly believe it and thats a fact like he says the cavalry from the military districts crossed over from anatolia into thrace they rode up the black sea coast justinian sailed up to ankhialos just south of mesembria to meet them there he brought the excubitores along which was how i got lucky enough to come ankhialos of course means next door to the sea if the place werent next door to the sea thered be no reason for it to exist now that i think about it there isnt much reason for it to exist anyhow why anybody would bother having it and mesembria both is beyond me yes i know nobody asked my advice justinian sure didnt for true anyway there we were waiting for the cavalry from the military districts to come up and join us so we could attack the bulgars you can see the haimos mountains the border between thrace and the bulgars country from ankhialos and you can see ankhialos from the mountains too because they dip south close to the coast the bulgars were watching us though we didnt know it yet ankhialos wasnt what youd call ready to have an army show up on its doorstep god in heaven brother elpidios we excubitores drank the taverns out of wine in three days all by our lonesome justinian had to detach a couple of dromons to go on up to mesembria and bring back more before his guards started fighting each other instead of the bulgars one by one the regiments of cavalry from the military districts trickled up the road to ankhialos justinian wanted to wait till he had everybody there before he hit the bulgars a lick concentration myakes he said to me till i got sick of hearing it one strong blow is better than half a dozen puny ones thats so emperor no doubt about it i finally told him if we wait around too long though the barbarians are going to know were up to something and have a pretty good idea of what weve got a lot of soldiers here already if we take em by surprise concentration he said again and i shut up trying to tell justinian anything he didnt want to hear wasnt easy and wasnt particularly safe even before he got his nose slit afterwards well i could get away with a lot with him because id been through so much with him but i didnt want to push it if you know what i mean concentration he wanted and concentration he got but it wasnt very concentrated concentration what do i mean its like this theres a fairsized plain west of ankhialos thats where the troops from the military districts made their camps but they camped the same way theyd come up from constantinople by regiments one here one there one over yonder yes somebody should have been in overall charge and made them all join together and turn into a proper army but the only somebody who could have done that was justinian and he didnt bother the other thing he didnt do was keep enough sentries out around the camps you worry too much is what he said to me when i complained about that the bulgars will be shaking in their shoes when they find out ive brought a proper roman army against them they wont fight theyll run away thats what your father said almost thirty years ago i answered look what it got him for some reason or other that made him angry and he dismissed me once he had an idea in his head you couldnt knock it out with a hammer i thought about asking him why hed thought the bulgars could fight romans when hed come south with tervel but figured they couldnt when he was coming north against tervel i didnt bother it wouldnt have done any good like i said ankhialos wasnt as ready as it shouldve been to supply that proper roman army justinian was so proud of the granaries emptied out as fast as they would have if locusts had got into them and some of the cavalry regiments hadnt even got there yet some of the people in the town complained to justinian that he was eating them out of house and home what how much good did that do how much do you think brother elpidios he only killed one of them i will say that for him where was i oh yes thats right we were starting to run out of grain we were running low on fodder for the horses too now that i think about it and so what happened was the army started wandering over that plain west of ankhialos trying to keep themselves and their animals fed they might have been a flock of sheep the way they ate everything down to the ground what oh yes brother one of the farmers complained to the emperor he hung him on a gibbet after that the farmers did what farmers always do when soldiers come robbing they ran for the hills and took whatever animals they could with em i wished leo was there instead of off in the caucasus christ i even wished helias was there instead of back in constantinople minding the store for justinian the emperor had made it very clear he wouldnt pay any attention to me both of them were sneaky enough they might have found some way to get him to listen but they werent there justinian didnt listen to anybody hed go from one scattered camp to the next he said he was inspecting the regiments maybe he even thought thats what he was doing it looked like wasting time to me and i was starting to think we didnt have much time left to waste i was right too much good it did me the day im thinking about justinian was visiting the camp of the soldiers from the military district of the opsikion hed gone to them before he trusted them further than he did a lot of the other troops there i suppose because barisbakourios was their commander he wasnt with the army either though which was a cursed shame because he was one more justinian might have heeded barisbakourios had sent his lieutenant general to thrace instead a weedy little fellow named theodotos he wasnt worth much as far as i was concerned some of the men in his regiment had been trained to do acrobatics on horseback he had them showing off for justinian when some sort of commotion started in the camps north of his whats going on justinian asked it was at least the right question theodotos didnt even try to find out probably nothing emperor he said indifferently and then to his pet acrobats keep on boys he turned to justinian again youll like this next bit i promise you but we never got to see the next bit a couple of horsemen who werent acrobats came pelting down toward the camp of the men from the military district of the opsikion they were screaming something it didnt take us long to find out what either the bulgars they shouted the bulgars are attacking alls lost run for your lives brother elpidios you never saw people disappear so fast in all your born days as those cursed acrobats one moment they were there the next they were nothing but little dots on the southern horizon and getting littler faster than youd believe if theodotos had been worth a follis he would have rallied his men and sent them off to drive the bulgars back if hed been worth half a follis he would have rallied them and used them to protect the emperor what he did do was squeak were ruined and then jump on his own horse and gallop off almost as fast as those acrobats well that did it that did it and then some as a matter of fact hold men justinian shouted but the soldiers from the military district of the opsikion werent about to hold theyd seen their friends run away theyd seen their commander run away and the only thing they wanted to do was run away too and thats what they did they figured justinian couldnt stop the lot of them and they were right and they werent the only ones everywhere i looked i saw romans running or riding south fast as they could go tents in some of those other encampments were going up in flames justinian i suppose had been right about concentration after all one strong blow had turned out better than half a dozen weak ones only trouble was the bulgars gave instead of getting a few of the troops from the anatolian military district did put up a fight the battle was lost before it got started though the bulgars just ignored the romans who were fighting back werent very many of em lord knows and went after the ones who were running they killed some of those and plundered what the rest left behind when a mans decided hes going to run hell throw away anything hes got so he can run faster all the bulgars had to do was follow along and pick up the flotsam and jetsam you might call it near as i could see justinian was going to stay there cursing the roman soldiers up down and sideways till the bulgars noticed him and scooped him up i wondered what tervel would do with him if they carried him north of the mountains i wondered but i didnt really want to find out because i figured whatever tervel would do to justinian hed probably do to me too and so when justinian showed no signs of going anywhere on his own i said emperor wed better get back to ankhialos once were inside the walls the bulgars wont be able to do anything to us thats true he said as if it hadnt occurred to him and it hadnt either so off we went heading east and a little north over the plain toward the town i wasnt the only one whod had that same idea the romans who werent fighting and werent running south as fast as they could were making for ankhialos pretty soon we made up a goodsized band the horsemen pulled me and the rest of the excubitores up behind them so we rode double that let everybody move faster which made all of us happier let me tell you the sooner we got some nice tall stonework between the bulgars and us the better wed like it i was riding near justinian a couple of furlongs from ankhialos when his horse quit on him poor beast must have hurt itself lamed itself some kind of way because it just wouldnt go on no matter how he swore at it and no matter how he booted it another traitor he shouted and leaped down out of the saddle his sword was already in his hand if the bulgars had come at him hedve fought hard nothing wrong with his courage if you havent seen that by now brother youre blinder than i am but he would not stand being crossed not for a moment not even by a horse slash slash and he cut both the animals hamstrings beast screamed like a woman as its back legs went out from under it if i cant have you the bulgars will get no joy of you justinian said as if it was a woman he scrambled up onto somebody elses horse and rode pillion the rest of the way to ankhialos the bulgars thank god didnt try storming the town if theyd tried they might have done it the soldiers who were in there i dont think they would have put up much of a fight when you got down to it though it didnt matter much tervel had done what hed set out to do we werent going to invade the bulgars country not after hed stomped the cavalrymen from the military districts we werent more romans got into ankhialos after the band that had formed around ankhialos theyd had to do real fighting to reach the city some of them brought in trophies a few heads bows and arrows a couple of the boiledleather shirts the bulgars wear instead of chainmail justinian ordered the excubitores to confiscate all those prizes what for emperor i asked well display them on the walls of ankhialos to impress the bulgars with our might he answered with anyone else i would have laughed it made a pretty fair joke after what tervel had just done to us but he wasnt joking i could see that he wanted trophies up there just as if wed won the battle maybe he thought we did i tell you brother i didnt have the nerve to ask we stayed in ankhialos till the third day after the fiasco then the roman troops in the city boarded the ships moored in the harbor and sailed back to constantinople we never tried fighting the bulgars again not as long as justinian lived thats the story he didnt want to tell there i guess now you can see why i wouldnt have been very proud of it either now that ive yattered away for a while brother elpidios your voice should be all fresh and rested what did justinian like well enough to admit in writing hed done it justinian i received from cyrus the ecumenical patriarch word i had long been awaiting namely that he and constantine the bishop of rome had at least the beginnings of an understanding concerning constantines acknowledgment and acceptance of the canons of the fifthsixth synod i had summoned before being sent into exile excellent i told cyrus about time we see some sense from a roman pope yes emperor he said nodding i think your treatment of felix made constantine see cooperating with the roman empire is a wiser course than opposing its might a good thing for him he has seen it i answered if i werent busy elsewhere id use him as i used felix or rather id use him as i would have used felix if i hadnt had that dream that told me to spare his useless life a dream may be the voice of god emperor cyrus said you were wise not to risk divine anger i thought the same i said why god thought the rebellious bishop of ravenna deserved to remain among the living was beyond me but no mortal man could oppose his desire and hope to prevail shifting my thoughts from what i had been unable to prevent to what i might be able to accomplish in times to come i asked cyrus how close precisely has pope constantine come to accepting the canons of the fifthsixth synod he does still have reservations on a few of them emperor but expresses those much more temperately than have previous bishops of rome the patriarch replied he may if god be kind accept those canons almost in their entirety almost complete acceptance was indeed more than any previous bishop of rome had shown himself ready to grant but struck me as inadequate nonetheless being a partial rejection of canons inspired by the holy spirit to which of them does he still object i asked in particular the thirteenth and the thirtysixth cyrus said to refresh your memory emperor these are i know what they are i snapped the thirteenth requires a married man ordained a deacon or priest to keep on cohabiting with his wife rather than putting her aside as is the ignorant practice throughout the patriarchate of rome the other states that your rights as patriarch of constantinople are the same as those of the arrogant bishops of rome their primacy to be due solely to seniority how can the popes object to that it having been stated in the acts of the first ecumenical synod of constantinople and in those of the ecumenical synod of chalcedon do not ask me to fathom the western mind cyrus said for i cannot but with the principle already enshrined in the acts of the ecumenical synods as you say and your learning is marvelous marvelous perhaps we need not insist on its formal acknowledgment here perhaps i said grudgingly what of the thirteenth canon then the thirteenth canon does allow clergy in barbarous lands to retain their previous practices where those are not clearly forbidden cyrus said that offer if not grounds for agreement is at least grounds for negotiation very well i said go ahead and negotiate with cyrus since he seems willing to talk yield as little as you can and accept nothing before submitting it to me for approval cyrus bowed it shall be exactly as you say emperor in every particular i was surprised that he needed to reassure me on the point did it prove other than exactly as i said in every particular cyruss tenure as patriarch of constantinople would come to an abrupt end i had raised him to the patriarchal dignity because of his loyalty to me should that loyalty falter kallinikoss fate would also fit him while he and constantine sent letters back and forth a desultory war with the arabs broke out in southeasternmost anatolia the deniers of christ after some months fighting and after roman forces fell into confusion because of quarrels among their generals succeeded in breaking into tyana north of the kilikian gates they were unable to go farther though it gave them a base from which they might later try to effect deeper penetration into romania under other circumstances the fall of tyana would have filled me with fury but i paid little heed to it nor has it much concerned me since for one thing the negotiations with rome at last seemed likely to bear fruit and gaining the popes acceptance of the canons of the fifthsixth synod counted for more with me than losing a dusty anatolian fortress the only remaining sticking point cyrus reported to me after exchanging a couple of letters with constantine is the thirtysixth canon the one proclaiming constantinoples authority equal to that of rome and romes primacy that of honor and seniority alone are you truly certain this point is adequately covered in the canons of the first ecumenical synod at constantinople and that held at chalcedon i said i believe so yes cyrus replied you do not feel the dignity of your see impaired if the bishop of rome rejects this one canon emperor i do not the patriarch said i have seen since naming you that you are zealous in protecting constantinoples ecclesiastical rights and privileges i said whereupon cyrus inclined his head in modest acknowledgment of the praise if this does not trouble you i shall accept it that is splendid news emperor cyrus exclaimed i confess i had looked for you to be more refractory i shall write to bishop constantine at once im certain he will be as delighted as i am go ahead and write i said indulgently let us have this matter settled it having hung over us for almost twenty years under other circumstances constantines preposterous obstinacy would have filled me with fury as things were however it like the faraway trouble in anatolia mattered little to me i was engaged in the work that would be that will be by god and his son the capstone of my revenge against all those who wronged me during the time in which i was denied my godgiven right of sitting on the throne and ruling the roman empire arrogant cowardly little manikins that they were and are the rich men who rule in kherson ruling by their way of thinking being defined as playing roman influence off against the power of the khagan of the khazars as centered in the khazar tudun in the city had presumed to try to take me into custody and deliver me up to apsimaros that the usurper might deprive me of my head and not only shall i avenge myself upon them i intend to remove kherson from the map to wipe it off the face of the world as a man wipes shit from the cleft of his buttocks to leave no single stone no brick standing upon another nine mortal years i passed in that wretched fishstinking town only in the monastery where i dwelt and in the brothel where i took occasional comfort did i find the slightest trace of human kindness for a soul in anguish those i would let stand the rest let fire take it furthermore the khersonites are the only ones who remember seeing me with my mutilation i also intended and yet intend to remove all memory of that from mankind that an emperor of the romans should have suffered the humiliation of being allowed to couple with a whore only in darkness absolute and then for double the going rate shall be as forgotten as the ultimate fate of the ten lost tribes of israel when i fall upon kherson i purpose doing so in force so overwhelming the khersonites shall be able neither to resist nor to summon the khazars to their rescue ibouzeros gliabanos having survived his visit to constantinople might be tempted to thwart me there that i will not allow reasoning thus i began gathering dromons and merchantmen to carry troops and horses not only at the imperial city but also at kyzikos and nikomedeia to command the expeditionary forces i chose my spatharios helias stephen the sailor who had aided me with the bureaucrats reluctant to join my feast and blackbearded mauros reckoning them well suited to my purpose helias i said to the spatharios you shall govern the new kherson when the expedition has succeeded in destroying the old we will settle it by means of merchants and artisans transplanted from elsewhere in the empire yes emperor he said making a show of submissiveness just as you say emperor he coughed a couple of times then went on you are aware of course of the grumbling among the property owners of the city at the taxes they have had to pay for your force theirs is to obey i growled mine is to decide what the empire requires if they grumble their heads will decorate the milion which has looked rather bare of late keep your ear to the ground and bring me the names of those who complain have your friends do likewise we shall nip this in the bud of course emperor bowing deeply helias departed myakes who had stood silent by the throne while helias and i conversed spoke up after the spatharios left thats trouble emperor what helias i said i think hes safe enough myakes shoulders went up and down in a shrug you know i dont much like him so i wont waste your time with what i think there but remember when stephen the persian and theodotos were squeezing constantinople so tight fifteen years ago that got you hated and it helped leontios send you into exile im ready for trouble this time myakes i said let it come ill make a bigger slaughter here in constantinople than i intend to make in kherson thinking about it was plenty to make my member rise in anticipation emperor isnt it better not to have trouble than to smash it when it comes myakes asked i need the great fleet to send against kherson i replied if building it causes no trouble well and good but i shall build it whether it causes trouble or not i folded my arms across my chest i have spoken having spoken i expected no further comments from myakes and in that i was not disappointed he has never failed me through disobedience myakes you see how it was brother elpidios every so often i would try to get him to listen christ on his cross even helias tried to get him to listen he wouldnt do it we might as well have been talking to the city wall justinian was going to do what justinian was going to do and if the world didnt like it he figured that was the worlds hard luck yes he bent a little for pope constantine less than youd think though and hed seen dickering in the church always had a bit of giveandtake to it anything outside the church it was all take and no give and even with constantine justinian wasnt the one who did most of the bending youll see i expect justinian cyrus came to me in a state of high excitement waving a sheet of parchment emperor not only has the bishop of rome agreed to all canons of your fifthsixth synod save only the thirtysixth but he has requested your leave to come to the imperial city so that he might personally show forth his affection for you has he i said well he is welcome here since he accommodated himself to me more than i to him you may write and tell him i shall be pleased to receive him when he comes i shall send the letter this very day cyrus said but emperor he assumed an expression of concernwhat if you are away from the imperial city when the holy bishop of rome arrives you have been traveling a good deal of late and and i aim to go right on traveling i broke in preparations for the expedition against kherson go better when they are under my eye if im away when he comes either ill return or he can come to me but i will not keep myself locked up in constantinople to wait on any man most especially not for a backwoods bishop with a pretentious title is that plain cyruss eyebrows climbed on his hearing my true opinion of the popes view of his own importance it is most plain emperor he answered after a moment but who can receive the bishop of rome in your absence as i say i wont be absent long at any one time surely you can keep constantine happy for a little while i laughed and even if i am in nikomedeia or kyzikos a roman emperor will be residing in constantinople the emperor tiberius by his face cyrus could not decide whether to be dismayed or delighted hes five years old now i said i dont expect him to rule yet i dont expect him to rule for many years but he can serve as my substitute in ceremony i suppose thats so emperor cyrus looked like a man casting about for objections but unable to find any he left the grand palace to compose his reply to pope constantine and extend my invitation to the queen of cities that afternoon i asked my son how would you like to welcome the pope of rome if he happens to come here while im out of the city i dont know he answered can i cut off his head if he doesnt do as i tell him i folded the boy into an embrace by christ and all the saints you are truly my son i ruffled his hair which was almost as dark as theodoras im proud of you can i tiberius asked eagerly im afraid not i said hes supposed to be making a friendly visit so people would be upset if he went back to rome without his head all right he said his voice grudging then he brightened can i put his eyes out the way you did with the bad patriarch and the bishop who was a dirty rebel i dont think well have to do that son i said if he were being disagreeable then we would have to think about it it would make all the churches in the west very upset with us so what tiberius said they were upset with us before when i was a boy and my father went to a lot of trouble to make friends with them again i said i dont want to make them angry now unless i have no other choice i rumpled his hair again but i do like the way you think you wont let me do anything though he complained he sounded very much like my uncles herakleios and my sons seminamesake tiberius how they chafed as junior emperors under my father and how once they grew to manhood they tried to supplant him casting a speculative eye on my tiberius i wondered whether in ten years time he would be tempted to seize the reins of power before having any right to do so if he did he would regret it as much as my uncles had done after their bid for the throne failed kin could prove more deadly than common traitors being liable to retain ones trust too long by virtue of their blood ties myakes as things worked out brother elpidios justinian wasnt in constantinople when pope constantine got close to the city the emperor had gone down to kyzikos to see how the fleet there was doing when messengers got to constantinople saying constantine would be there any day what brother me i was in constantinople no i didnt go to kyzikos with justinian he took along helias and stephen and the other officers whod be heading for kherson as soon as everything was right he knew i didnt much care for his plans and so he just left me out of them wed been together for thirtyfive years and more him and me and now it was like i wasnt there any more it hurt ill tell you cyrus the patriarch forgot justinian wasnt there he came to the blakhernai palace himself instead of sending over a flunky the way he would have done if he knew he couldnt talk to the emperor himself you planned all of this out ahead of time i reminded him when he started having kittens right there in front of me justinian hasnt fallen off the edge of the world hes in kyzikos or nikaia or maybe even nikomedeia by now hell either come back here or see constantine in one of those places tiberius can welcome the pope to constantinople tiberius reminded justinian of himself as a boy eh he reminded me of justinian too back when justinian was little id wondered how hed ever manage to live to grow up without somebody hitting him over the head with a rock first i wondered the same thing about tiberius but justinian doted on him blood calls to blood they say and like to like that was one place where i wasnt ever going to tell the emperor what i thought believe you me i wasnt once cyrus calmed down and stopped running around like a chicken with a fox on its tail he did pretty well we had a few days to get ready for a wonder theophilos who wasnt what youd call bright sent word ahead that the bishop of rome had got to him instead of letting constantine come on to constantinople without any warning those were the kinds of surprises you didnt want to have when constantine finally got there he landed at the seventh milestone outside the imperial city that let cyrus spread himself as the saying goes out he went dressed in his fanciest robe out went tiberius in one of justinians old robes and a crown that must have belonged to one of his greatuncles once upon a time what he looked like was a pretty little ferret in a dolls robe out went theodora who never quite figured out how vicious her son was out went the nobles the new ones justinian had made and the handful of old ones still left alive and out streamed the people in swarms and droves the idea of a pope in the imperial city was a spectacle that ranke d right up there with the hippodrome the last time a pope had come to constantinople was during the reign of constans justinians grandfather the last time a pope had come to constantinople without being in chainsa i dont know how long ago that was a bloody long time ill tell you anyway up came the dromon and beached itself within spitting distance of the seventh milestone what yes i was there guarding tiberiuss nasty little neck we all went out to meet constantine tiberius theodora and cyrus ahead of everybody else everybody but the excubitores that is constantine was out of syria and spoke greek as his native language he wasnt just a barbarian from the west in other words he understood showmanship he waited till the people who counted were close enough to see what he was doing before he let the captain let down the gangplank he must have been saving the robe he had on for just that moment too it outshone cyruss the way a bonfire outshines a lantern despite turning green as an unripe fig when he saw that gorgeous robe cyrus kept his wits on what needed doing he coughed a couple of times till tiberius remembered his line in the name of my father i the emperor tiberius welcome your holiness to the imperial city poor servant of the servants of christ that i am young emperor i thank you for your gracious welcome constantine answered in gutturally accented syrian greek he looked east toward the walls and big buildings of constantinople on the horizon i look forward to seeing your great capital and to meeting your father the grand and glorious emperor of the romans he laid it on with a trowel pope constantine did well he hadnt come all that way to tell justinian what a wicked fellow he was if hed been stupid enough to try that theyd have chosen a new bishop of rome right afterwards because the one they had wouldnt have been worth anything to em any more but thats just chatter brother elpidios we had some fine horses from the imperial stable waiting for constantine and the other churchmen hed brought they were all tricked out fancy with gilded saddles and bridles and with saddlecloths of imperial crimson along with his gaudy robe constantine was wearing a camelhair cap that reminded me of nothing so much as a woven cowflop but he was the pope so who was going to tell him he couldnt cyrus the patriarch rode alongside him as they paraded back toward constantinople they were thick as thieves talking about god and christ and how to deal with recalcitrant bishops and all sorts of other holy things i heard bits and pieces of it because i was marching along by tiberiuss litter which wasnt far away if id known then what i know now id have understood a whole lot more of it we went into constantinople through the golden gate constantine had been staring at what he could see of the city over the top of the wall and at the wall too come to that when he finally got inside he stopped his horse took a long look around and said i wouldnt have believed it no matter how many things ive heard everybody who sees constantinople for the first time says something like that constantine went on rome is a skeleton of what it used to be here at last i see a great city in the flesh just like an anatolian peasant boy whos come to join the army like me say getting close to forty years before then he kept ohing at this and ahing at that as we rode down the mese toward the house of placidia near the church of the holy wisdom where hed stay till justinian got word he was there he wasnt a bad fellow constantine i mean put three or four cups of wine in him and he got friendly same as anybody else put a little more in him and he wanted to wrestle hed been a pretty fine wrestler in his younger days especially i guess if you listened to him tell it only trouble was he hadnt seen his younger days any time lately whats that brother a bishop wrestling well he did and do you know what hed say hed say that if it was good enough for jacob it was good enough for him i couldnt figure out any way to argue against that and ill bet you wont either anyhow constantine and the rest of the churchmen from rome had a fine old time in constantinople theyd visit a new church or two every day and at night ask me no questions and ill tell you no lies brother elpidios some of them were downright disappointed when cyruss messengers finally tracked down justinian sure enough he was in nikaia on his way from kyzikos down to nikomedeia he sent the messenger whod caught up with him back to constantinople with a letter telling pope constantine to meet him in nikomedeia off went the pope off went the bishops and priests whod come along with him they were getting what theyd come all the way from rome for and do you know what most of em really did look as if they could have waited another couple of weeks to have it justinian my expeditionary forces against kherson being nearly ready to sail the arrival of pope constantine in the imperial city proved more nearly a nuisance an interruption to that important business than anything else but having granted him leave to come i could hardly refuse to treat with him once his journey was completed nikomedeia made a good enough place for the two of us to meet although damaged by arab and persian invaders it has been repaired and refortified its hilltop stronghold being especially difficult to capture and the harbor there though not large is well sheltered from the elements constantine however chose to travel by land we met not far outside the wall he dismounted from the posthorse lent him approached me and prostrated himself as any other roman subject would have done emperor i thank you for calling me to the queen of cities he said in a greek rather harsh he being no ordinary roman subject i waited until he had risen and then prostrated myself before him in turn holy bishop of rome i thank you for coming here and restoring perfect peace in the church i replied rising myself we beamed at each other i would have treated felix of ravenna harshly in any case and was glad to see myself reaping such a large profit thereby constantine said even this small city of nikomedeia bustles with such activity as is rarely seen in italy and the other western regions you are in a civilized land now i thought but did not say as much out loud what i did say was i am glad romania pleases the bishop of rome a subtler reminder of the same thing constantine said i for my part am glad we have been able to agree on the canons of the holy synod you summoned twenty years ago and that you recognize the need for abandoning the thirtysixth which is odious in the eyes of the episcopal successors of saint peter few of the bishops under the jurisdiction of the patriarchate of constantinople would have dared be so freespoken with me indeed constantine took his prerogatives as seriously as i took mine i have been persuaded that canons from two previous ecumenical synods cover the same ground yes i replied yielding his immediate point but not the larger issue the immediate point sufficed let us rejoice in our peace and unity constantine said if i celebrate the divine liturgy here emperor will you take of the lords body and blood from my hands i should be honored i replied i should have been slighted had he made no such suggestion the church of the holy wisdom is the finest in nikomedeia constantines face lit up i have seen the church of the holy wisdom in constantinople if this one is anywhere near so fine hardly i said laughing no church i have ever seen comes close to the great church in the queen of cities god forbid that i should disagree constantine exclaimed lest i be revealed in his eyes as a liar the church of the holy wisdom here is no mean hovel i assured him and of course the presence of the pope of rome ornaments any church we smiled at each other both of us intent on wringing maximum advantage from our meeting i went on nikomedeias other accommodations should also suit you even if they prove less splendid than those you enjoyed in constantinople i am sure i shall be contented here he said i have had only comfortable lodgings and courteous dealings with roman officials your governor theophilos was particularly generous of his substance and his time i am glad to hear he gave you the honor you deserve i said theophilos though not the brightest man god ever made had shaped better as the commander of the karabisianoi than i looked for on naming him to the post though relying on his advisers he did not hesitate to overrule them when he judged them mistaken more than that one could hardly ask from any man i quartered the bishop of rome and his followers in a wing of the hilltop stronghold in which i was also residing he grew quite merry over wine i said at the divine liturgy tomorrow i want you to pray for the success of the fleet i am going to send against kherson to avenge myself upon the rich merchants there avengeance is mine saith the lorda he said and then giggled not mine mine but mine the lords you understand like a lot of men with a deal of wine in them he was more precise than he needed to be aan eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth the lord says that also i reminded him he doesnt say anything about a nose for a nose the pope giggled again i let him live he being obviously drunk and i having in any case long since avenged myself upon leontios who wounded my nose constantine held up his hands as if to make scales one passage here one passage there which with more weight he shrugged emperor i did not come here to quarrel with you i shall pray for your fleet good i said for that you and the church can keep all your privileges in italy he was effusively grateful but giving him what he already had cost me nothing whereas extracting more from him would have required troops and poisoned the ecclesiastical peace we were confirming here as the evening wore on constantine not only challenged one of my guardsmen to wrestle he broke the fellows collarbone he was most contrite and prayed over the excubitor afterwards but poor pauls arm is not all it should be even on the day i set down these words the bishop of rome was somewhat the worse for wear the next morning but did nonetheless celebrate the liturgy as we had arranged nor did he use the excuse of the previous nights drunkenness to evade the promise he had made there before everyone in nikomedeias church of the holy wisdom he asked gods favor for my expedition to punish the wicked khersonites for their numerous sins when i came up to take the miraculous bread and wine from him i said pray also that i may be forgiven my sins i shall emperor he answered in the same breath i use to pray for the forgiveness of my own he stayed in nikomedeia another few days then set out for the distant and backwards west once more word recently came to me that he was stricken ill on his journey i do not know whether he has reached rome safely if not i shall have the nuisance of beginning afresh with a new pope once the matter of kherson is settled mauros stephen and helias were all sailing with that portion of the naval expedition departing from constantinople giving me the opportunity of reminding them one last time of their orders when you get to kherson put everyone you can catch there and in the cities nearby to the sword spare no one they had scant mercy on me i have none on them is it understood yes emperor they chorused as you command so shall we do good good i said i have waited six years for this moment you will understand that i want it done perfectly just as i say it must be yes emperor they repeated very well i said when they started to leave my presence i held up a hand wait one thing more they looked most earnest and attentive i continued i have given bardanes philippikos leave to sail with you as an officer in charge of a troop of soldiers watch him closely if he performs his duty well i want to know of it if he performs poorly or shows any sign of disloyalty i want to know that too yes emperor they said yet again knowing they held bardanes life in the hollow of their hands although i had permitted the exile to return from kephallenia after i ousted apsimaros i had heeded myakes to the extent of not entrusting him with any position great or small merely suffering him to live in constantinople as a private citizen he having begged me to let him prove himself i would die for you emperor he wrote in his petition i granted him this small boon if he lied he would indeed die for me at the harbor the next day when the fleet was to sail for kherson bardanes came up and prostrated himself before me emperor by god and his son i swear to you you shall not regret this choice he said words are free i said words are easy show me what you do bardanes deeds mark a man show me what you do not what you say helias and the others proved themselves that way his handsome swarthy face assumed an injured expression did i not prove myself emperor when i saved you from the sklavinian hiding in the stream a lifetime ago i told him adding before you began to dream of eagles swarthy though he was he flushed perhaps that was but happenstance perhaps it was but foolishness i went on thinking as i had always thought that ever mentioning it was certainly foolishness but because of it you shall have to earn your way into my esteem once more emperor i will he cried so fervently that he was either sincere or one of the worst actors ever born and so he accompanies the fleet its commanders having been warned to take careful notice of everything he does if he is indeed as devoted to me as he proclaims he will make a useful servant being a man both clever and daring the only one who i am certain surpasses him in those regards is leo and leo lingers yet in the caucasus if he were here i think i would see how clever he was without a head strange when i took up this writing recording what i recall of my deeds and my life i was chronicling the distant past now at last having spent more than a year and a half on the task i have reached the present day having said everything i have to say i can but set these words aside and await further occurrences and yet having taken up the pen i find myself loath to put it down writing has grown to be a habit as regular as a goblet of wine with my meals and as pleasurable flipping through these leaves i see i have been very frank perhaps too frank i suppose to keep my pen busy i could go through this volume and excise those portions not fully redounding to my credit that too would be writing of a sort but what point to it no ones eyes but mine shall ever see these words i am certain of that theodora and myakes are the only ones who know the nature of this exercise in the great scheme of things myakes is of no consequence however agreeable he has been to me over the years and my wife i am certain will let nothing damaging to me ever see the light of day let the words stand then let them stand now i wait and shall write more as the stream of time brings fresh events to my view i was tempted to record the news from kilikia which is very much of a piece with that of the previous year but the fortresses we romans lost are of such small consequence that i need not waste ink setting down their names in any case i will set all that aright in next years campaigning season or at the latest two years hence kherson and the surrounding towns come first what does prompt me to take up the pen is the first word from the fleet that had crossed the black sea the word is good in high excitement the messenger from the dromon newly tied up at the golden horn told me emperor kherson is ours the folk there werent expecting us and they didnt even try to fight back splendid i told him what went on before you sailed back here he began telling off points on his fingers we have the khazars tudun there and a fellow named zoalos i remember zoalos i said a rascal if ever there was one yes emperor he said we also have forty other prominent men from kherson all of them in bonds the whole way across the black sea good enough good enough i told him the executioners have been pining for want of fresh meat and now they have it well go on when mauros and stephen and helias got kherson in their grasp emperor they took seven other rich men and roasted them on spits over a bonfire the messenger reported i saw that with my own eyes they screamed for a long time and the smell of cooking meat made you hungry till you remembered what it was and they i held up a hand wait i tried to decide whether i wanted the executioners to imitate what my men in kherson had done the savor of roasting meat would be very fine but giving such specific orders was liable to cramp the executioners style depriving them of the opportunity to exercise their ingenuity realizing i did not have to settle such affairs on the instant i waved for the fellow to continue he said emperor then they took twenty more men tied their hands behind them and put them on a ship out past the harbor they cast boulders onto the ship till it sank and drowned the prisoners that sounds like a lot of trouble for a small result i said critically they could have tied each man to a boulder and pushed him off a gangplank to accomplish the same thing if theyd set the boat on fire now but they were using fire for the other torture werent they i sighed well we cant have everything i suppose they thought it made a good spectacle i wouldnt know anything about that the messenger said all right let it go let it go i said inclined to be generous in the general massacre it wouldnt have mattered much anyhow men women children something changed in the messengers face although i doubt he was even aware of it sharply i demanded whats wrong nothing he said but then seeing deception useless he changed his tune emperor not all the children are dead the soldiers and sailors saved some because they were so young you understand to sell into slavery and they did what i said and the messenger turned pale they did what they disobeyed my direct order they ignored the will of the emperor of the romans have they gone mad miserably the man said i dont think so emperor its just that killing children is hard even for soldiers with orders if they were slaves fools i shouted blunderers i bellowed idiots i screamed is it so hard for them to do as they are told no more no less is it so hard i hit the messenger in the face he staggered back clutching at his mouth with both hands answer me i roared i had split his lower lip blood dribbled down his chin and into his beard forforforgive them emperor he stuttered they meant no harm so you say i sneered i shall hear it from the lips of the men i sent to kherson to do a simple job after shouting for a scribe i dictated an order to him mauros stephen and helias are commanded to return to this godguarded and imperial city with the flee t entrusted to them in order that they might attempt to explain to their sovereign the gross dereliction of duty of which they are guilty i shall make a fair copy of that emperor and the scribe began never mind i snatched the papyrus from his hands scrawled my signature below the order and thrust it at the messenger take this back to your ship take it across the black sea deliver it to the officers there it requires immediate obedience even then the scapegrace tried to argue with me emperor its late in the sailing season if a storm comes up on the sea it will drown a lot of whoresons who deserve nothing better i said now get out of my sight while you still have a head on your shoulders he fled so did the scribe dear god how am i to carry out my vow of vengeance for thee if the men through whom i must do my work thwart me at every turn the fleet from kherson is returning emperor the messenger spoke the words then withdrew from my presence as quick as boiled asparagus i terrify everyone these days my power is very great riding out to the harbor to meet the incoming dromons i saw but a remnant of the great expeditionary force i had sent forth i went out to the very end of a pier and shouted a question at the closest ship where is the rest of the fleet sunk or scattered emperor the answer came faint and thin over the sea we fought through a storm and we must have lost thousands i threw back my head and laughed till the tears came just what you deserved i said see how god punished your disobedience to me if youd done as you were told you will still be safe and comfortable in kherson what was left of the expedition against kherson limped into port i confess to exulting on seeing the poor mean state they made a visible exemplification of what fate reserves for those who heed not the commands of the emperor of the romans from one of the battered dromons came mauros seeing me waiting for him on the pier he fell to his knees and then to his belly with his face still pressed to the tarred planks he said forgive us emperor i beg you we did not fully grasp the depth of your wrath against the khersonites instead of giving him leave to rise i kicked him in the ribs as i had with the rebellious bishop flavius lackwit i shouted and kicked him again cretin another kick jackass another all you had to do was do as you were told i wanted everyone in kherson dead every building wrecked now ill have to send out another expedition to do a proper job of smashing things up he did not move as i kicked him had he moved i should have ordered him put to the sword on the spot mercy emperor he gasped on my falling silent mercy i beg of you that depends on whether you deserve it i answered where are helias and stephen did they drown are they here neither one he said theyre still back in kherson when your order to return reached us they didnt dare come back to the queen of cities to face you i dared and here i am for that i let him get to his feet what of bardanes i asked him he is staying in kherson too mauros replied adding and he was the one who kept us from killing the children there as you commanded a rebel in other words i said and mauros nodded and helias and stephen are either rebels too or will be rebels in short order mauros nodded again as if to say he himself was the soul of virtue that i discounted though his presence in constantinople spoke better of him than the others ominous absence the next force i send will bring them all back in chains for my judgment emperor you should know youve frightened all the towns in those regions mauros said the next fleet you send may find nowhere to land and the men may have to fight their way ashore if by some chance it does gain an anchorage the khazars can send soldiers to those parts faster and easier than we can and i let ibouzeros gliabanos live i cried striking my forehead with the heel of my hand in bitter repentance for that folly no doubt you thought it was best at the time mauros said giving me what sympathy he could i would not hear him every curse i had hurled at the army he and helias and stephen commanded i now rained down on my own head slowly and with no small struggle i returned to myself if those traitors refuse to do my will i ground out i shall have to force them to obedience as i aimed to force kherson and the other cities up in the north to obedience what shall i do mauros asked you i withered him with a glare youll stay here in the city thats what and better than you deserve he bowed his head seeing the nape of his neck i nearly ordered his head stricken from his shoulders on the instant he had however returned to constantinople in the face of my known displeasure this bespeaking a certain basic loyalty to my cause on account of it i let him live and am still wondering whether i made the proper choice punishment i said the men whom i had summoned to the blakhernai palace nodded solemnly so much military talent having been invested in the previous expedition against kherson i was reduced to leaders i should not otherwise have chosen christopher the officer whom i had recently sent to command the new military district of the thrakesians chanced to be in the imperial city he at least was certain to know his business with john the city prefect and george the syrian my minister of public finance i fear that their undoubted loyalty counted for more than their military talent george had a guttural accent that put me in mind of pope constantines how are we to bring back helias and stephen and bardanes he asked however seems best once youve crossed the black sea i answered i cant give you a large army i dont have a large army to give you but the rebels will not have any great force behind them either what about the khazars emperor christopher asked a sensible soldier he studied the ground before advancing over it the question was sour as vinegar in my ears and burned my wounded spirit as vinegar burns wounded flesh i will give you the tudun to restore to his place i said and i will even give you that whoreson zoalos to sweeten up the khersonites and help detach them from the rebels i hope that works john said by god i hope that works what sort of shape are the two of them in emperor no one has been carving pieces off them if thats what you mean i told the city prefect by the way he nodded that was exactly what he had meant you are merciful emperor george the syrian exclaimed i am not i said indignantly given my vow on foolish pauls fishing boat out on the black sea was an insult implying as it did that i was failing to fulfill my promise to god i went on its only that the executioners and i have been talking about how to make them last longest and hurt most and havent got round to working on them yet whatever the wherefores theyre here theyre whole and well use them christopher said i was glad to have found him within the queen of cities he showed a quick pragmatism that looked like being very useful if you see ibouzeros gliabanos or treat with an envoy of his i added explain that i do not wish to harm him i could have harmed him here had i had that in my mind my aim is to punish kherson and the other towns in that part of the world for what they did to me when i was exiled to those regions i hope he hears us said john who was something less than filled with optimism as to his prospects for success he will hear you i said he will hear you because you speak for me for justinian emperor of the romans he knows my might when john george and christopher sailed for kherson a few days later i went out to the harbor to watch them depart the men were quieter than i should have liked they arent happy about sailing at this season of the year emperor one of the ship captains said they know how easily it can storm they can risk the oceans storm or they can risk mine i said he bowed his head and went aboard his vessel among those glum soldiers and sailors one fellow stood out a tall gangly man with i believe the longest neck i have ever seen smash them all he said over and over smash them all drawing his sword he slashed at the air who is that i asked pointing his way he is one of mauross spatharioi george the syrian answered his name is john like the city prefects they call him strouthos john the ostrich eh i like that strouthos can mean either ostrich or sparrow since there are many more sparrows than ostriches that is the more common use of the word here though the other plainly applied george said he would make a good hound he always does as he is told now he has been told to kill which he enjoys good i beckoned to the gangly man you john come here he looked up in some surprise having been locked in his own private reverie of death and devastation when he recognized me his eyes pale eyes unusual among us romans went wide he walked over to where i stood and gave me the clumsiest prostration i have ever received in all my years on the throne rise i said and rise he did i am not short but he towered over me i hear youre quite a killer i told him his face lit up as if a beautiful woman had said i hear youre quite a lover emperor i do my best he said i hope your best will be very fine indeed i said kherson has a whole host of men in it who want killing when your officers point you at those men i want you to dispose of them without even the sli ghtest thought of mercy they deserve none they are my enemies and the enemies of the roman empire theyll tell me what to do john the ostrich said working it out in his mind ahead of time so he would know what to do when the moment came had he had to think at the moment of truth likely he would have failed theyll tell me what to do and i ill do it he did not slash the air again with his sword the bodyguard standing behind me wordlessly made it plain to even the dullest individual from which john was not far removed that doing so would prove fatally unwise although he thought slowly he had come up with the right answer here obey your officers they will obey me all will be well johns head bobbed up and down on that long neck like a dandelion puffball in the breeze ill do that emperor he said i hope they give me plenty to kill he prostrated himself again then went back to his dromon you see emperor george the syrian said a hired murderer nothing more nothing less so less as he is my hired murderer i dont care i answered use him with care lest he turn in your hand yes george said heavily too many tools have turned in our hands there on the far shore of the black sea thats why youre going out i told him to turn them back the right way once more he nodded and boarded ship himself seeing him go made me wish he cut a more properly martial figure in the gilded mailshirt that showed he was a commander he looked more like a jumpedup tax collector decked out in armor than a warrior he was a jumpedup tax collector of course but why did he have to look like one betrayed the son of god had only one judas to contend with lord lord dear lord i have worshiped all my life why inflict them on by the scores are my sins so great i do not care it does not matter they may betray me but they cannot beat me stinking flyspecked turds they should know that already if they are too stupid to remember my past i shall remind them oh yes i shall i shall flay them and break their bones and slice their flesh and burn their privates with torches and redhot iron then i will roll their bodies in vinegar and brine and draw out their guts a fingers breadth at a time last of all only when they are at the point of death i shall put out their eyes that they may have seen what comes of disobedience has bardanes a wife and children here has helias myakes ever since justinian came back from kherson brother elpidios id wondered now and whether he was drinking from a full jar of wine if you know what im saying i wondered more when he aimed everything he had at kherson and the other towns on the far side of the black sea aye some of the folks up there had done him wrong but not that wrong the one whod done him real dirt was the khagan of the khazars but he let him live go figure when he got the news of what had gone wrong for the second fleet he sent up to kherson i really do think he went crazy for a while what you were just reading there it sounds like he went crazy doesnt it it happened like this i was whats that brother why did i keep on serving him if i thought hed gone mad no it wasnt on account of i thought hed take my head if i quit i did think that as a matter of fact but it wasnt why i stayed why then you dont understand ill tell you why brother elpidios i guess the easiest way to put it is id been serving him so long it never even occurred to me i could do anything else id been at his side thirtyfive years by then or maybe a bit more than that most marriages dont last so long somebody ups and dies husband or wife and besides every now and then hed listen to me a little bit anyway and what hed do wouldnt be as horrible as what he might have done and so i kept telling myself i was doing some good and i was some good looking back ive got to say it wasnt enough does that answer your question good where was i then oh yes i was heading up the throneroom guards when a messenger came running in poor bastard looked scared to death i found out why a minute later too he was the one who had to break the news from across the sea to justinian ive never seen a man who looked so much like he wanted to stay down there forever once he prostrated himself justinian had to tell him three different times he could get up before he finally went and did it emperor he said once he couldnt keep quiet any more its all gone wrong up in kherson what do you mean its gone wrong justinians voice didnt have any feeling in it anywhere his eyes though his eyes were measuring that messenger for a coffin ive never seen anything like it in all my born days and i never will now thats certain sure its gone wrong the messenger repeated and then the poor sod he had to tell how we landed outside kherson he said and helias and bardanes and the khersonites and the khazars said they wanted a parley so george and john and christopher went into the city with the tudun and zoalos they were going to give them back anyway you know and justinian clapped a hand to his forehead dont tell me they were such imbeciles as to go alone he said like a man in pain emperor they were the messenger said miserably and the khersonites slammed the gates shut on them and there wasnt anything any of us could do about it on account of we were outside and they were inside and they didnt come out and they didnt come out and then the gates opened up again all of a sudden and our people didnt come out buta well they did because the khazars had georges head on a pike and johns on another one and we werent ready to fight them not really so they must have captured a couplethree hundred of us and then what of christopher justinian broke in i dont know emperor the fellow answered i didnt know then either years later cooped up here in the monastery i found out the khersonites and the khazars in kherson sent the tudun and zoalos and all the prisoners off to ibouzeros gliabanos along the way the tudun died they slaughtered christopher and all the captured soldiers i heard three hundred but i dont know if thats right or not to give him slaves in the next world they arent christians the khazars not even close emperor the messenger said after a little while thats not the worst of it god and his son what could be worse justinian said still in that toneless voice like he couldnt take in what he was hearing but he took it in all right he wasnt giving anything back thats what it was nothing at all the messenger licked his lips i remember that i was thinking this is what he really really doesnt want to tell but he didnt have any choice not any more he didnt and so he blurted it out in a rush emperor theyve declared bardanes emperor up there after that nobody said anything for oh i dont know how long if anybody breathed during however long it was it must have been by accident theophylaktos the eunuchs eyes got big as hens eggs if he were here hed probably tell you mine were the same size or maybe not on account of maybe all he was doing was watching justinian that was most of what i was doing too but every now and then my eyes would move away for a heartbeat or two believe me brother elpidios that was most of what everybody in the blakhernai throne room was doing justinian couldnt very well watch himself he watched the messenger instead till the poor son of a whore must have thought his head would be the next one on a speak in front of the milion and then in a quiet even voice justinian said by the time i am through with them bardanes and helias will wish they were leontios and apsimaros i think that was the most frightening thing i ever heard in my life brother elpidios and then just like he wrote it justinian asked does helias have a wife in the city does bardanes he didnt need long to find out justinian ha helias did have a wife in the city a woman named zoe he had a couple of brats too i sent soldiers to fetch them all to the blakhernai palace i sent a man to bring cyrus the ecumenical patriarch here too to pronounce her divorce from her husband conspiracy against the emperor has been a legal ground for dissolving a marriage from very ancient days and then i had another happy thought and made another summons i thought it was particularly fitting one of the traitors children proved to be a nursing babe the other a toddler zoe held them both in her arms while i told her the crime of which her husband was guilty she hung her head false tears streamed from her eyes cyrus droned out the formula of divorcement along with all the whys and wherefores that made it binding straightaway now zoe wept in earnest at being sundered from the man who had betrayed me the patriarch had done his job he left now i said to zoe you are in law free of the man who was your husband your will be done emperor she whispered oh my will shall be done in this matter i said in every way i pointed to the children she still held they are of the traitors blood his line shall not continue zoe began to scream she turned as if to run excubitores blocked her path more excubitores advanced on her seized her and took the infants from her her shrieks grew loud they echoed sweetly from the roof of the the throne room they redoubled yet again when a man dressed all in black and wearing a black hood strode into the chamber zoe saw him going over toward the guardsmen who held her children she screamed no emperor not them kill me instead not them they are of the seed of the traitor and rebel i said you are not now that you are divorced from him you need have no more concern for him and his my babies zoe cried the excubitores held her fast when she tried to break free and run to them i nodded to the executioner he did his job smoothly and with great dispatch he cut the throat of the older child and then a moment later of the baby as well they did not suffer they died almost before they knew they were hurt their blood poured down onto the tesserae of the throneroom floor not nearly so much blood as a fullgrown man holds i noted the servants would have no trouble cleaning up the mess zoes wails went on and on hear me i said sharply for a moment she quietened i went on now that you have no children and are also bereft of your husband you stand in need of consolation surely the love of another man will make up for your small losses here today no she screamed and much abuse of which i took no notice i clapped my hands together once twice three times into the throne room came john heliass ethiopian cook behold i said your new husband john leered at zoe i had not thought she could shriek louder than she already had done but i was wrong a weedy little priest named basil tiptoed in after john he was another of those useful people who did as they were told now as he had been instructed he read the marriage service before john and zoe johns responses were eager nods zoes were screams or noes i told basil the woman is distraught she does not know what she is saying you are to interpret those as affirmatives yes emperor he said dutifully the crowns of marriage cheap copper ones no point wasting better on the likes of them were set upon their heads and basil pronounced them man and wife i nodded to john consummate your marriage his greek was not up to that i simplified the matter now you take her those words he had no trouble understanding i had earlier urged him to seal their union in the throne room itself even though he was only a black barbarian he did not want to do that i had set aside a chamber nearby instead to this he now led dragged his bride while i led the party of wellwishers shouting bawdy advice as they went the door slammed shut presently after some small commotion within zoe began to scream on a note different from the one she had used up until that time the excubitores and courtiers standing in the hall with me took this as a sign the marriage union had been accomplished and so did i we burst into cheers after a while the door opened and john came forth zoe was no virgin i had not given him a square of linen with which to prove he could show he had taken her maidenhead but his smugly satisfied expression proved all that needed proving this despite a couple of clawmarks on one cheek behind him i saw zoe loosely wrapped in the tunic he must have torn off her she sat on the edge of the bed her feet dangled down toward the floor her face was buried in her hands racking sobs shook her body what kind of bridegroom thinks one round is enough i demanded of john remember she is yours go back and do your duty to her properly he was a young man so he needed little urging he looked thoughtful for a moment maybe he wondered whether he was ready to rise again so soon then he grinned he was ready his teeth as always seemed especially white because they were seen against his dark skin he closed the door the wellwishers and i waited until zoe started to scream again then we applauded to drown out her racket after i encouraged john to show his paces he proved a man of formidable stamina no doubt he had suffered long deprivation in such matters because he had been a slave perhaps too he was excited because he got to swive the woman who had ordered him about however that was i decided not to wait around outside the bedchamber until his first night or rather his first day was done let him have his good time i had other things to do and for now helias was punished as well as he could be until he himself fell into my hands now to accomplish that and to deal with bardanes the usurper get up mauros i said roughly he rose from his prostration he was a frightened man i could see white all around the irises of his eyes you summoned me emperor he said i am here to serve you his voice did not waver i give him so much and serve me you shall i said you came back when the others stayed in kherson to betray me i thank you for that now you shall be the instrument through which i chastise them tell me what you require emperor and i shall give it to you you need have no doubt of that again mauros sounded sure of himself i was also sure of myself i shall give you another fleet mauros i told him his eyes kindled i give few men the chance to redeem themselves he knew it full well along with the fleet i shall give you catapults and rams and every sort of siege engine we have stored here in our armories and arsenals you will want me to take kherson then he said not only that i want you to raze the walls to the foundations it will never close itself up against me again i am here to serve you mauros repeated i held up my hand i was not finished i told him he hung his head in sorrow because he interrupted me i gave him time to reflect on his many sins he may have sinned against god he had surely sinned against me i went on i intend for you to slay every man woman and child inside the walls i understand emperor he said you had better i know i sounded angry i was angry mauros cringed that pleased me if you and stephen and helias had done what i ordered you to do in the first place we would not have trouble now the khersonites would be dead they deserve death helias would be my governor in that part of the world any number of unfortunate things would not have happened they would have had no need to happen mauros licked his lips he knew how i had punished helias through his children and through zoe you will have no cause to be disappointed in me emperor he said i expect to be pleased with you mauros not disappointed i replied in fact i can think of only one thing that would disappoint me he licked his lips once more with great care he said since i do not wish to disappoint you in any way emperor please tell me what that one thing is so i may be certain to avoid it failure i said emperor his face went blank artfully blank i do not think so i think he simply did not understand failure i said it again carry out your orders as i have given them to you and all will be well do anything but carry out my orders fail in any particular and by god and his son mauros i swear you will end up envying helias before i am through with you i will slaughter every kinsman of yours no matter how distant i will kill every friend you have i will kill every shopkeeper you ever met every one of them will have a long hard time dying you will watch them with the one eye i leave you after the executioners do their first work then maybe if you are lucky you will eventually die too he quivered emperor i have already told you i will do everything in my power to see your will is done in kherson but but i shall accept no excuses here mauros i broke in none do you hear me succeed and i will reward you richly fail and you pay the price of failure sometimes the world is a very simple place but emperor god is greater than i am he said god is even greater than you emperor it is possible by his will that i fail through no fault of my own what if the khazars come back to kherson how can i fight them and the khersonites at the same time i did not summon you here to listen to excuses i snapped if you do not command this expedition you shall be judged to have have failed in advance everything of which i spoke just now will fall due shall i have the excubitores lay hold of you so i can begin on your relatives have mercy emperor he wailed i shall do as you bid me good as i said it is very simple avenge the roman empire avenge me the emperor of the romans on kherson and the khersonites it should not be difficult in any way the town is small and half barbarous only if you fail me have you any need to fear and you shall not fail me shall you mauros emperor i dare not he said i nodded in approval at last he understood everything he needed to understand mauross fleet is now sailing for kherson i wish it had left a few days sooner loading the necessary siege gear onto the transports did take time if i had only wanted to execute mauros i did not need to send him on an expedition bound to fail to give myself an excuse i could have taken his head and had done i care nothing for mauros one way or the other i want kherson in ruins and its people dead they deserve to be dead with the fleet sail a number of light swift vessels through them i shall learn everything that happens in the northern region the season is late emperor myakes said when he heard me order them along weve already had storms youre liable not to see some of those little fellows again i dont care i answered some will get through they will tell me what i need to know the rest can sink and their sailors drown i glared at him are you a traitor too do you want to keep me in the shadows of ignorance i know there are traitors everywhere myakes but i had not suspected you if you think i am a traitor you know you can take my head myakes said stolidly i wont run away i let him live perhaps it is a mistake so many have betrayed me lately why not myakes as well but i would i think sooner suspect theodora her brother after all being the altogether unreliable ibouzeros gliabanos whose eyes i should have burned from his head when he dared show his altogether despised countenance here in the queen of cities whose skin i should have flayed from his shrieking bleeding carcass in digitwide strips whose life i should have taken from him as he purposed taking mine from me well if i should change my mind and decide the captain of excubitores needs death he was right to remind me i can give it to him at any time i shall sleep on it and see what i decide in the morning myakes so he was thinking of getting rid of me was he brother elpidios it makes me sad i wont say it doesnt but if i told you it surprises me id be lying there at the end nobody and nothing was safe from him his mind must have been slipping do you notice how his writing is different all of a sudden these last few sections the only time he wrote fancy was when he was thinking of how he wanted to torture his brotherinlaw before he killed him remember a lot of people had betrayed him by then of course one of the reasons they betrayed him was that they hadnt done or hadnt been able to do what hed ordered they figured hed kill them if they came home after that so why not rebel instead if they won theyd live and if they didnt he couldnt kill em any deader than he would have otherwise and once the first people started betraying him he thought everybody would that just made things worse he didnt pick what youd call smart ways to stop it either did he that business with mauros now any which way it was going to make mauros hate him if mauros takes kherson and slaughters everybody in it he still comes back hating justinian and if he doesnt take ita hed come back once after things went wrong and look at the thanks he got for it would you call twice tempting fate would mauros how much could justinian expect any man to bear hed borne a lot himself it made him expect a lot too justinian god and his son jesus christ be praised the accursed usurper and traitors and rebels in kherson shall soon receive some of the punishment they deserve even though death in battle is a quicker end than they deserve i trust the lord almighty to make their eternal fate correspondingly more painful as recompense for his mercy in this transient world yesterday one of the courier ships i attached to mauross force returned to the imperial city with word that he had overthrown the kentenaresion gate of kherson by means of a ram and today i have the report from another that the gate of syagros is also down soon i expect the fleet will return with word of a town extinguished and with the persons of bardanes and helias upon which i shall wreak my vengeance and now theophylaktos comes with word that yet another courier is arrived in the imperial city strange to think how kherson must now be days destroyed even if word of its overfall reaches me only at this instance i can i think afford to be generous to the messenger bringing me the news and all the complaints i had over my treatment of mauros are now shown up as the vaporous maunderings they were from the beginning put the fear of god and the emperor in him and he performed well enough treason treachery deceit cheating lies trickery cowardice that poxridden pile on the arse of humanity ibouzeros gliabanos has sent an army to kherson to keep my men from punishing the place as it deserves how are my soldiers to oppose kherson and the barbarous khazars at the same time i should have killed him i should have castrated him i should have slit his tongue i should have slit his nose i should have blinded him come to the queen of cities again ibouzeros gliabanos come i shall coax you with honeyed words once the rebellion is put down come you will like it so well you will never want to leave you will never leave not in one piece myakes after that brother elpidios the couriers stopped coming for a while justinian didnt know exactly what was going on up there by kherson i dont think he ever did know not really i know i didnt not then ive pieced it together bit by bit from things ive heard over the years here in the monastery the khazars hadnt sent enough men to be sure of licking mauros like justinian says he didnt have enough to fight them and the khersonites both they all called a kind of a truce to try and sort things out while the truce was on bardanes got out of kherson and ran off to ibouzeros gliabanos somewhere around then mauros and his soldiers figured out that they werent going to be able to take kherson not with the khazars troops so close mauros knew what would happen to him if he went back to constantinople without taking the place justinian had been very clear about that hadnt he brother not quite so clever as he thought he was eh so mauros declared for bardanes i suppose it would have been about this time that helias heard what justinian had done to his children and to zoe too ibouzeros gliabanos made mauross men swear an oath that they wouldnt hurt bardanes no matter what he also made them pay him a nomisma a man for the privilege of not having to fight his soldiers once theyd done that he gave them bardanes though after that everybody called him philippikos like i told you brother elpidios nobody in constantinople knew all the whys and wherefores all we knew was that mauros wasnt sending back any more reports about how well things were going he wasnt sending back any reports at all justinian what is mauros doing why does he stay silent why do i not hear from him what plots is he hatching if he dare not speak to me of what he purposes does he think me a blind man unable to see these things for myself i know what he has in his mind i know what he must have in his mind he can have only one thing in his mind treason were he loyal i should have heard of him long since since i have not heard he cannot be loyal what is he doing up there in kherson he must have taken bardanes cock up his arse to choose the stinking rebel over me let them come let them all come we shall see how happy they are once they try to take the queen of cities from me bardanes and helias shall have no stinking khazars to bail them out then no one takes me by surprise like hundredeyed argos in the pagan myth i see everything nothing escapes me but i cannot see kherson so well as i should like not from constantinople i cannot i must watch the rebels as close as i can too much can happen in kherson before word of it reaches the imperial city i must be nearer to get news sooner where then where amastris no closer than constantinople but not close enough what of sinope aye sinope nowhere closer to kherson not on this side of the black sea i have men from the military district of the thrakesians here in the capital a couple of regiments have to pick up more troops along the way the men of the military district of the opsikion barisbakourios and his men if they are not loyal no one is and tervel is with me he lent me some soldiers to send to kilikia to fight the arabs i will use them to fight the usurper instead look at this look at these words hardly greek at all where are the balanced clauses the participles the genitive absolutes how my old pedagogue would scorn this style what was his name i still do not remember as for the greek i do not care after bardanes is dead and helias and mauros i will make it worth reading now it sets down my thoughts as i have them it is enough on to sinope no time to lose fight with theodora in the tent here once too often she says you should not have left constantinople i have to see i tell her i must know what bardanes is doing the instant he does it i cannot wait i dare not wait you should have stayed she says again here marching through the countryside you are a turtle out of its shell a turtle that stays in its shell is a turtle that cant see i say i must know what they are doing i must i tell you stupid bitch she cannot see what is in front of her you stick your head out of your shell you see them chop it off she says you stay in where you belong they never get you they never have a chance to get you i cannot go back i must not go back why does she keep trying to put second thoughts in my head does she plot against me too shut up i scream shut up shut up no she shouts too you need to listen to me justinian you are making a mistake you should have stayed back in i hit her then the back of my hand hard across her face her eyes big big red on her cheek her mouth bleeds a little not much only a little i am the man i am the emperor i have the right she is a barbarian she does not understand tries to hit me i am too fast too strong grab her arm throw her down on the folding bed stand over her breathing hard hard yes hard jump down onto her no she screams again i am the man i am the emperor i have the right no is not for me she fights i am too strong take her take that argue with me wonderful best since that yellowhaired sklavinian toy no rape since then long time too long should not have waited she claws my face when i pull out the sklavinian baggage hanged herself this one may stick a knife in me ha let her try i set drawers to rights she starts to cry first kill bardanes kill helias kill mauros kill the khersonites the phanagorians the goths in doros kill them all then theodora will be happy amastris dreadful hole no won der cyrus left makes kherson look like a city christ what a thing to say but true true marched by now halfway to sinope more than halfway faster must push faster myakes whew rest a bit why dont you brother elpidios thats hard stuff to take i knew he was coming apart at the seams while we were marching to sinope yes i think everybody who had anything to do with him knew he was coming apart at the seams but listening to him you wouldnt have thought it was as bad as that not even close hed always wanted to pay back the khersonites and theres never been an emperor who was happy about rebels rising up against him nobody thought it was anything more than that and maybe if things had worked out different it wouldnt have been you may as well go on brother why not cant be much of that left justinian sinope at last god be praised i stand at the end of the land i spit out into the sea almost i can hit kherson phanagoria almost i look across nothing but water the towns just below the horizon so it seems ships go back and forth all the time boats even one must be in port maybe more than one theodora speaks with me again i let her now she knows not to quarrel with the vicegerent of god on earth she will be better for it god would not have led me here but to destroy my foes i will destroy them all no mercy i look to the harbor there must be a ship in port a ship from kherson found sailed for constantinople they sailed for constantinople while i was marching here curse them to hell satan fill their bones with molten lead demons stab them with redhot pitchforks fiends rip their flesh to pieces days ahead of me curse them to hell theodora says not a word myakes me brother elpidios i think theodora was dead right justinian should have stayed in constantinople and made the rebels come to him taking the imperial city is always the hard part in a civil war as long as you hold the center you hold the empire if you leave it youre liable to be in trouble but going to sinope wasnt the worst idea in the whole world either sinope is closer to kherson than constantinople is sinope is also closer to constantinople than kherson is if justinian had heard bardanes and his pals were getting ready to move against the capital he had time to get back or he would have had time bardanes left for constantinople while we were still heading toward sinope and stole a march on us that way he got a bigger start toward the imperial city than justinian thought he could oh yes i was there when he got the news the fellow who brought it just thought he had an interesting bit of gossip he didnt know he couldnt have known justinian was in sinope he turned as many different colors as a mullet being boiled when he got hailed before the emperor he told him the news he didnt have any choice about that we all looked at justinian waiting to see what he would do have you ever heard a lion roar brother you have ah good you know how when you hear it your belly knows you should be afraid before your head does the noise justinian made was like that my hand went halfway to the hilt of my sword before i realized it was just a noise and couldnt hurt me we have to go back justinian said and he was right about that we have to beat the cursed stinking rebels back to the imperial city he was right about that too if he wanted to go on being emperor but bardanes had a good start on us justinian back to the city on the road back to the queen of cities rain turning the road to mud christ why rain now has god turned his face from me is it because i spared ibouzeros gliabanos when i had vowed to kill all who wronged me what else can it be i made the vow i broke it now i am punished lord have mercy christ have mercy rain turning the road to mud christ we crawl we limp with the rain turning the road to mud we lurch on the horses tire they slow we crawl where are bardanes and helias and mauros out on the sea out on the sea god let this storm that slows me drown them do not forsake me sinner that i am blow up a new storm to sink the rebels and ibouzeros gliabanos dies at my hands i know not how not yet but it shall be i will make my word good in the tent the third night out from sinope theodora says once you have killed the rebels do not go out of constantinople again for her sake i let her brother live but that is done i say no we nod at each other wary as a roman soldier and an arab she puts a hand on my shoulder she forgives she forgives lord have mercy on me christ have mercy on me rain turning the road to mud amastris again dull and dead as before the horses half dead too not enough fresh ones rain every day since we left sinope where is bardanes did this storm roar through the black sea did it take the rebels dromons down to ruin god let it be so god make it be so the soldiers slog on they say not a word they know the need but they are as tired as their horses sometimes they cannot ride or the horses sink they march they sink three drown in the mud past amastris where is bardanes every horseman i see fighting his way east going about his business puts me in fear will the rider hail us will he say we are too late will he say we have lost the race is the rebel at constantinople may it not come to pass heaven forbid damatrys ten miles from chalcedon under the shadow of st auxentioss hill beacon fire on top of the hill part of the chain of beacon fires that warns when the arabs invade are there beacon fires for rebels would to god there were to burn them up in another horseman on the road he sees us some of the riders had gone into the fields they feared my soldiers this one rides up emperor he calls justinian my regalia is the color of mud everything is the color of mud he needs a little while to spot me when he does he says emperor philippikos is in the city did anyone fight to hold him out i ask emperor not a soul he answers my hand goes to my ruined nose now i know a worse hurt i look round at my army the word hits the men like an arrow in the guts to come so far to labor so hard to fall so short i see their minds now we are not the emperors soldiers they think now we are rebels and bandits in kherson i was emperor of the romans with one subject i shout faithful myakes steps up and waves good after all i did not kill him two subjects soon barisbakourios says he remembers i gave him his rank i am still emperor now i say i got constantinople back once i will get it back again four men cheer five six worse than none like a dying ghost of what a cheer ought to be hope drips out like blood from a cut vein the rider still sits his horse emperor there is more morning barisbakourios is myakes poor sod he couldnt bear to write it eh brother elpidios god help me if i blame him if you want to know the story though youd better know the whole story the first thing helias did when he got into constantinople and found out what justinian had done to his wife and children was he went after justinian well justinian wasnt there and neither was theodora so the next thing helias did was he went after tiberius tiberius wasnt with us hed stayed back in the city with his grandmother anastasia knew what was liable to happen to him too shed taken him to the church of the mother of god next to the blakhernai palace the way that fellow coming out from constantinople told it she was sitting in front of the church when mauros and john strouthos got there tiberius was inside he was holding onto the altar with one hand and to a piece of the holy and lifegiving wood from the true cross with the other and he had amulets draped round his neck outside anastasia was begging mauros and john the ostrich to let the little monster live she said he was too young to hurt anybody she was right too but if hed had timea anyway it didnt work helias had told john to get rid of tiberius and john wasnt about to change his mind once he got told to kill somebody and mauros hated justinian almost as much as helias did youve seen why he said heliass children were too little to hurt anybody too john the ostrich didnt waste time arguing with anastasia he went into the church broke tiberiuss grip on the altar took the holy wood away from him and tossed it down on the altartop and then put tiberiuss amulets around his own neck i dont know why he bothered they hadnt done tiberius any good he brought out the brat then he and mauros took him over to a little porch close by stripped off his robe stretched him out like a sheep at slaughtering time and cut his throat when the horseman told all this to justinian he just sat there on top of his own horse for the longest time then he said i will kill them all he brought it out flat the way id heard him do before the way that would make you feel like somebody stuffed a handful of snow down the back of your tunic not this time though the words were there but not the fury that made them frightening something had broken inside of justinian i dont know how to put it any better than that for as long as id known him hed always been the one to grab fate by the balls and squeeze till things happened the way he wanted them to happen not any more not after that he wasnt doing the moving he was being moved instead i dont think i was the only one who felt that or who felt something like it i dont know how many men we had when we made camp that night there under st auxentioss hill i do know one thin g though the next morning we had a lot fewer justinian was going to talk about that wasnt he why dont you pick up from where you stopped when i started running my mouth justinian barisbakourios is gone to think i called him loyal many men from the military district of the opsikion with him and some of the thrakesians and some of the bulgars too the ship sinks the rats dive into the sea fools no safe harbor near can the ship float does it matter i am fortytwo i think i am fortytwo my father did not live so long nor my grandfather nor my greatgrandfather i am old i burn hard i burn fast now i burn out theodora beside me she does not weep she cuts her cheeks blood flows not tears nomads mourn so she forgets she is a christian god forgets i am a christian scouts must go forward rebels between us and chalcedon followers of the usurper must know can we get to chalcedon get to boats get to constantinople must try mine scouts back enemy soldiers not far west i call the men together i order the attack the men stare they mutter they do not form by companies not by troops they do not attack i should kill them how they do not seize me they do not give me to bardanes to helias to mauros they stay with me they will not attack maybe they will defend maybe they will defend and win and then attack maybe maybe maybe may morning again more men gone not so many when i come out of my tent myakes orders a cheer the men shout the ones who are here not the others a better cheer than the last one a good cheer a better cheer maybe they will defend the usurpers men do not attack maybe they fear me they should fear me if i can go forward i will beat them i order the men forward they will not go more of the usurpers men about fewer of mine again fewer of mine they forsake me god forsakes me five generations all in ruins the sixth generation cut down in ruins god forsakes me i do not forsake god i pray let me go on i pray let me slay my enemies i pray i have enemies left alive it is not right how can i die with enemies left alive avenge me god if it be thy will that i die without slaying ibouzeros gliabanos avenge me i read once of a bishop who was a heretic who suffered what the physicians called an abdominal obstruction and died vomiting shit out of his own mouth if i must die give the khazar this death i pray thee bardanes men spying on the camp trying to see what i have left my men shoot arrows at them they ride away a cheer almost that sounds like a cheer my men can fight they have fought will they fight for me how to make them dead barisbakourios dead the best of the ones from kherson dead loyal loyal as could be till these last days dead hunted down killed dead do the rebels lie no they shout at our camp they know i have heard lies i have told lies i know lies they tell the truth a staff i hoped to lean on first fled now dead my men melt now like snow in spring they trickle away they dribble away they stream away myakes comes to me emperor he says run away hide somewhere hole yourself up bardanes is nothing much he wont find you i never run away i said i never did i never will what about when the bulgars hit us outside ankhialos he says not the same i answer i never run away from the queen of cities he bows his head never a dull moment around you he says at last go on i clap him on the back save yourself go on no one will look for you i wouldnt know what to do without you he says maybe some kind of way well beat the bastards yet someone stays loyal a small miracle one more miracle god myakes hes probably right brother elpidios i could have gotten away it never would have occurred to me on my own i turned him down without even thinking about it same as i would have if hed told me to worship mouamet i might still have my eyes if id run but i dont suppose id be a holy monk now what it all worked out for the best you say i oh never mind the only time he had any juice in him was when he talked about revenge that was what fed him the last part of his life he never quite figured out it could feed other people too though he got his he made other people want to get theirs when they wanted to pay him back he wondered why but he didnt lay down at the end he fought on i give him that much justinian iwake to more desertions in the morning around the third hour of the day with the sun halfway up the sky a rider comes truce he shouts truce hear me out i hope the bandits have fallen to fighting among themselves if they have i can play them off this one against that go ahead i tell him say your say my commander is helias chief general to the emperor philippikos he says by god and his son he swears that none of the soldiers who leave justinians army will be harmed in any way because they fought for him till now hes lost philippikos has won anyone with eyes in his head can see that anyone who wants to keep eyes in his head had better see that day after tomorrow philippikos overruns this camp anyone whos still fighting for justinian is going to pay helias leads that army i called to the horseman aye he peered in at me you bloodthirsty madman youll pay sure enough when he catches up with you me i cried in a great voice that vile murdering son of a whore you call your master let him come let him come with an army of ten thousand against me alone he wantonly murdered my son and thinks to escape unscathed christ let him come let him not wait so long let him come tomorrow no let him come today i drew my sword and brandished it let him come this minute and i will cleave his filthy head from his shoulders hell come when it suits him not when it suits you the messenger answered a whipworthy rogue if ever there was one its not like youre the emperor any more he doesnt have to do what you say kill him i shouted to my men kill him for the disgusting debased liar that he is a couple of arrows flew out toward heliass toady coward that he was he fled away from the camp back to the savage brutes other diseased arselickers i shouted in triumph to see him run but even then my own men were slipping out of camp morning again i have three hundred left at thermopylai the spartans won glory forever against the persians with no more but the spartan three hundred would not flee would not run would not give up would not abandon would not think of themselves ahead of the cause my menaa evening maybe a hundred remain they eat well why not we have food for an army dozens of times this size these are the last words i shall set down in this book after i write them i shall send for myakes perhaps he will escape perhaps my words will live even if it be gods will that i do not ah ibouzeros gliabanos i should have slain you and kept my vow see what loving your sister brought me i am justinian emperor of the romans the son of constantine emperor of the romans the son of constans emperor of the romans the son of herakleios constantine emperor of the romans the son of herakleios emperor of the romans romania is mine myakes you know brother elpidios when one of justinians slaves maybe the last one who hadnt run away by then brought word that he wanted to see me i wondered if he was going to take my head just to make sure hed done it you might say that was about the only time when i really thought about running off in the end though i didnt id been doing what justinian told me for too long by then to break the habit i expect tomorrow we fight he said when i walked into his tent tomorrow helias dies he killed my son sure as if hed cut his throat with his own hands justinian says we had a hundred men left i dont think so but all right helias had thousands i know that he could squash us like a man squashing a bug and never set eyes on justinian himself whats that brother had justinian forgotten hed killed heliass children or did he think it didnt matter because they deserved what they got and tiberius didnt truth to tell i dont know it amounts to about the same thing either way wouldnt you say he handed me the codex the very one youve got there and he said after i win tomorrow give this back to me all right emperor i told him i understood what he meant even if he couldnt come right out and say it fight hard myakes he said and clapped me on the back like we were talking in a tavern always fight hard he knew all about that nobody can say anything different there i nodded my head and went away the book i stowed it in my own knapsack by the next morning we didnt have a hundred men left i dont think we had fifty to this day brother elpidios i dont know why we had any a few people will stick to any cause i suppose what do i mean me who else would i be talking about we put on our armor and we waited me a couple of other stubborn excubitores a few men from the military district of the opsikion a handful of crazy bulgars and justinian he trotted his horse back and forth in front of us as if we were fifty thousand he looked splendid in his gilded chainmail if only hed had a real army to lead about halfway through the morning up came helias he had a real army i dont know how big it was big enough and then some ill tell you that but now he was as wild for revenge as justinian ever had been when he saw justinian there in front of him at last he forgot about all the soldiers h e was leading murderer he screamed and set spurs to his horse and charged murderer justinian screamed back at him and he charged too we all yelled ourselves hoarse justinians little band if he cut down helias who could say what that army would do his own force had shrunk in a hurry who was to say it couldnt grow again in hurry too over on the other side of the line all those however many thousand men helias had with him went quiet as the tomb they were thinking the same thing we were sure as the devil only our up was their down if justinian nailed helias everything was up for grabs again if if if if we were thinking with our hearts the forlorn little guard justinian had like he said himself he was past forty by then and he hadnt done anything youd call fighting from horseback since before he got exiled hed exercised yes but its not the same thing helias was i dont know fifteen years younger something like that and he really knew what he was doing we didnt need long to see that the first pass they made at each other helias knocked justinians sword out of his hand the next time around justinian went after him with a dagger no quit in justinian never any quit in justinian he didnt try and run away if he didnt have any weapons left hed fight barehanded and hope for a break he didnt get one helias hit him a whack with the flat of his blade that left him swaying in the saddle like he didnt know the difference between stew and easter when helias saw he couldnt fight any more he got an arm around his neck and dragged him out of the saddle then he jumped down himself and drew his dagger justinian tried to kick him it didnt work helias knelt down beside him justinian started to yell something it might have been em maybe not too well never know now whatever it was justinian never finished on account of helias got to work with that knife a minute later he stood up he was holding justinians head by the hair i think it tried to bite him no brother elpidios not really a joke if justinian could have he would have but he was done it was over at last it was over heliass men let out all the cheers theyd been holding back while they waited to see whether hed live they rolled forward over us it wasnt a battle it wasnt anything like a battle only a couple of us fought no not me brother i ran back to my tent and grabbed the knapsack with the codex in it then i tried to run why did i do that if youd asked me then brother elpidios i couldnt have told you i just did it now after all these years the way it looks to me is id been doing what justinian wanted for so long that a little thing like him being dead wasnt going to change the way i acted i dont think it ended up hurting me so i got caught a hundred cubits away from my tent instead of two hundred so what i wasnt going to get away nobody who stayed with justinian till the end got away i dont think theodora now thats a good question i have to tell you i dont know what happened to her from that day till this ive never heard maybe shes in a convent maybe they sent her back to her brother maybe they killed her and kept quiet about it afterwards helias might have maybe shes somebodys concubine or somebodys wife make up your own story i cant help you there me thanks to the fancy armor i was wearing the lugs who had hold of me figured out who i was they dragged me off to helias he already had justinians head mounted on a spear ah myakes he said so it comes to this it comes to this sure enough i answered what am i supposed to do with you he said what are you asking me for i said to him if it had come down the other way idve tried to see that you died faster than justinian would have wanted anyhow yes i believe you would have helias said you never stopped justinian from being vicious but sometimes you stopped him from being as vicious does that make you better for doing something or worse for not doing more hard to say isnt it i looked over toward justinians head his eyes were still open but they were just dull glass a fly was walking on one of them i said he raised you up too helias and you bit his hand he would have taken my head if i hadnt he said you love him too well myakes i dont want you running around loose but i dont quite have the stomach to kill you not when you did do something anyhow to make his evils less ill throw you in a monastery and take your eyes to make sure you dont come out if thats what youve got in mind id sooner you did kill me i told him he didnt listen he didnt have to listen not to the likes of me he gave the orders and his bully boys dragged me off to take care of em it wasnt what youd call a fancy job they didnt bother with silver bowls and boiling vinegar the way the executioner had with felix they hauled me over to a fire and heated up a couple of skewers the kind youd use to roast meat then one of them got a thick leather gauntlet from somewhere grabbed a skewer and burned out my left eye with it he did that one first because it was on his right side i guess what do you mean what did i do i did just what youd think i screamed and did my damnedest to get away only i couldnt did it hurt you bet your balls it hurt it hurt worse than anything else thats ever happened to me then the fellow with the leather glove got the other redhot skewer out of the fire the very last thing i ever saw brother elpidios through the tears that were streaming down my face was that glowing iron coming right at me i heard the fellow whod blinded me throw down the gauntlet off to a monastery with him he said and better than he deserves too ahh myakes wasnt so bad one of the others said like i was dead instead of just wishing i was heres his knapsack let him take it along he must have opened it then i suppose to see if anything in there was worth stealing he saw the codex whats he doing with a book the one whod stuck skewers in my eyes ugly bastard i remember that oh yes i do he laughed like a jackal who cares he can keep it itll give him something to read he thought that was the funniest thing in the world and so did all his stinking chums but thats how justinians book got here brother elpidios in case you ever wondered thats how you finally got to read it even if i never have what can i say the book is done my storys done because i havent had any story to speak of since i came here its been the same thing over and over and over and itll keep on being the same thing till they wrap me in a shroud and lay me in the grave i suppose for a man with no eyes its better that way no story no but no surprises either and justinians done maybe its better that way too i dont know justinian he was nothing but surprises for better and for worse you never knew what hed do next whatever it was he went at it hard as he could if hed been better at choosing ahhh if hed been better at choosing he wouldnt have been justinian and now that youve read the whole book and youve heard everything ive got to say about it i suppose were done too eh brother elpidios brother are you there brother elpidios i elpidios the sinful monk set down these words on the last leaf of the codex in which the emperor justinian recorded the deeds of his life reckoning up and arranging what occurred in each period thereof without confusion so that the reader might at once understand what events whether warlike or ecclesiastical or of any other sort occurred at any time during the emperors life on earth not ignorant of my own lack of knowledge and paucity of expression i hesitate now in the task i had previously set myself of adding the events recounted in this life to the chronicle of the history of the world i have been contemplating i hesitate also because of the multitude and variety of sins justinian showed forth during his lifetime sins of which any reader might better be left unaware for as i think in most circumstances one enjoys no small aid in reading of the deeds of those long ago if i should write such a book and anyone was to find therein anything useful he ought to give the appropriate thanks to god and pray for the lords aid to my lack of knowledge and sinfulness though i may be guilty in this regard of ignorance and of the laziness of a groveling mind i think i shall set aside this life of justinian on the grounds that separating sin from virtue in the said life is beyond my poor talents let this codex go on a shelf in the monastic library in the hope that some day a man with greater talent than mine may find for it a fitting use if i do come to write my chronicle i shall craft it from sources more malleable and more in accordance with my own judgment and understanding the lord will surely forgive my errors for working according to ones ability is pleasing to god amen historical note justinian ii was born in or perhaps he became roman as he styled himself or byzantine as we would be more likely to call him emperor on the death of his father constantine iv in was ousted from the throne by leontios in regained it by overcoming tiberius iii apsimaros in and was again overthrown and this time killed by the forces of bardanes philippikos in along with justinian the following people appearing in justinian are actual historical personages abimelekh abd almalik caliph agathon pope anastasia apsimaros tiberius iii emperor arculf asparukh balgitzin bardanes philippikos emperor

time in which it is set are historical athalaric constans ii emperor constantine i emperor eudokia herakleioss daughter herakleios emperor herakleios constantine emperor heraklonas emperor honorius i pope john bishop of thessalonike justinian i emperor kosmas leontios martin i pope martina maurice emperor maximus the confessor menander protector mouamet muhammad paul ii patriarch l peter patriarch phokas emperor pyrrhos i patriarch septimius severus emperor sergios patriarch all others including brother elpidios are fictitious the two most important sources for the reign of justinian ii are the chronicles of nikephoros and theophanes i have read both in the greek both use some older common source each also offers information the other lacks justinians modern biographer constance head downplays some of the more horrific episodes in the emperors second reign episodes recorded only in the chronicle of theophanes i must respectfully disagree with her interpretation the kinds of things theophanes has justinian doing strike me as consistent with his actions and personality as described in the liber pontificalis and in the syriac chronicle of dionysius of telmahre to which head did not have access although she did use the later syriac chronicle of barhebraeus who draws on dionysiuss work i have for the most part stuck very close to the historical record of justinians career which is quite sufficiently amazing without embellishment i altered the actual events of the sixth ecumenical synod in a couple of ways first by having makarios of antioch present when his fellow monothelite polykhronios tried to raise the dead makarios had actually been condemned and removed from office by then and second by having bishop arculf of gaul take part in the synod arculf was in fact in constantinople at the time but as a pilgrim on the way home from jerusalem his native town here is fictitious and his meeting with justinian ii is conjecture on my part i should note here that theology was so vital to the world of the late seventh and early eighth centuries and so intimately intertwined with politics that a novel of this sort which appears to place undue stress on it in fact severely understates its importance most details of justinians private life are also conjectures it is however worth pointing out that theodora did act in her new husbands interest and against that of her brother on very short acquaintance with justinian which may perhaps speak well for him in that regard i have followed richard delbras conjecture that justinian had his mutilated nose surgically repaired while in exile in fact i dare take the liberty of saying here that i made a similar conjecture myself before learning of delbras which has some iconographic evidence to support it auriabedas is fictitious but indian surgeons at the time were in fact the worlds leaders in what we would call plastic surgery and could and did perform operations such as the one i describe justinian submitting to details of the procedure are from guido majno the healing hand man and wound in the ancient world cambridge massachusetts the only place myakes appears in history is in the melodramatic scene during the storm on the black sea his relationship to justinian and his ultimate fate are novelistic inventions
