robin cook sphinx concerning egypt itself i shall extend my remarks to a great length because there is no country that possesses so many wonders nor any that has such a number of works that defy descriptions herodotus history prologue bc tomb of tutankhamen valley of the kings necropolis of thebes year of his majesty king of upper and lower egypt son of re pharaoh seti i fourth month of season of inundation day emeni thrust his copper chisel through the closely packed limestone chips directly ahead of him and felt it hit against solid masonry he did it again just to be sure without doubt he had reached the inner door beyond lay treasure the likes of which he could hardly fathom beyond was the house of eternity of the young pharaoh tutankhamen buried fiftyone years previously with renewed enthusiasm he dug into the densely packed rubble the dust made breathing difficult sweat dripped from his angular face in a steady stream he was on his stomach in a pitchblack tunnel barely wide enough even for his thin sinewy body cupping his hand he raked the loosened limestone under him until he could get it past his foot then like a burrowing insect he pushed the chips behind him where they were gathered into a reed basket by the water carrier kemese emeni did not feel any pain as his abraded hand groped in the blackness for the plastered wall ahead his fingertips traced the seal of tutankhamen on the blocked door undisturbed since the young pharaoh had been interred resting his head on his left arm emeni let his whole body go limp pain spread through his shoulders and behind him he could hear kemeses labored breathing as he dropped the gravel into the basket we have reached the inner door emeni said with a mixture of fear and excitement more than anything else emeni wanted this night to be over he was not a thief but there he was tunneling into the eternal sanctuary of the hapless tutankhamen have iramen fetch my mallet emeni noticed that his voice had a strange warbling quality within the narrow confines of the tunnel kemese squealed delight at the news and scrambled backward out of the tunnel dragging his reed basket then there was silence emeni felt the walls of the tunnel press in upon him he struggled against his claustrophobic fear remembering how his grandfather amenemheb had supervised the digging of this small tomb emeni wondered if amenemheb had touched the surface directly above him rolling over he put his palms against the solid rock and it reassured him the plans of tutankhamens tomb that amenemheb had given to his son per nefer emenis father who had in turn given them to emeni were accurate emeni had tunneled exactly twelve cubits from the outer door and had hit the inner door beyond lay the antechamber it had taken two nights of backbreaking labor but by morning it would be over emeni planned to remove only four golden statues whose location was also pinpointed in the plans one statue for himself and one for each of his coconspirators then he would reseal the tomb emeni hoped the gods would understand he would not steal for himself the single golden statue was needed to pay for the complete embalming and funerary preparation of his parents kemese reentered the tunnel pushing ahead of him his reed basket containing the mallet and an oil lamp it also contained a bronze dagger with an oxbone handle kemese was a real thief with no scruples to limit his appetite for gold with the mallet and the copper chisel emenis experienced hands made quick work of the mortar holding the stone blocks in front of him he marveled at the insignificance of tutankhamens tomb when compared with the cavernous tomb of pharaoh seti i on which he was currently employed but the insignificance of tutankhamens was a blessing in disguise for otherwise emeni would never have been in a position to enter the tomb pharaoh horemhebs formal edict to erase the memory of tutankhamen had removed the kapriests of amen from standing watch and emeni had only to bribe the night watchman of the workers huts with two measures of grain and beer even that was probably unnecessary since emeni had planned to enter tutankhamens house of eternity during the great feast of ope the entire staff of the necropolis including most of the population of emenis own village the place of truth were all rejoicing in thebes proper on the east side of the great nile yet despite the precautions emeni was still more anxious than hed ever been in his entire life and this anxiety drove him on to frenzied exertion with the mallet and chisel the block in front of him grated forward then thudded onto the floor of the chamber beyond emenis heart stopped as he halfexpected to be set upon by demons of the underworld instead his nostrils picked out the aromatic smell of cedar and incense and his ears recorded the solitude of eternity with a sense of awe he worked his way forward and entered the tomb headfirst the silence was deafening the blackness impenetrable looking back into the tunnel he glimpsed faint attenuated moonlight as kemese worked his way forward groping like a blind man he sought to give emeni the oil lamp can i enter asked kemese to the darkness after handing over the lamp and the tinder not yet answered emeni busy with the light go back and tell iramen and amasis that itll be about a halfhour before we start refilling the tunnel kemese grumbled and like a crab worked his way backward through the tunnel a lone spark leaped from the wheel and caught the tinder deftly emeni applied it to the wick of the oil lamp light sprang up and pierced the darkness like sudden warmth entering a cold room emeni froze his legs almost buckling in the flickering halflight he could make out the face of a god amnut devourer of the dead the oil lamp shook in his trembling hands and he stumbled back against the wall but the god did not advance then as the light played over its golden head revealing its ivory teeth and its slender stylized body emeni realized he was looking at a funerary bed there were two others one with the head of a cow the other a lion to the right against the wall were two lifesize statues of the boy king tutankhamen guarding the entrance to the burial chamber emeni had already seen similar gilded statues of seti i being carved in the house of the sculptors emeni carefully avoided a garland of dried flowers dropped on the threshold he moved quickly isolating two gilded shrines with reverence he unlatched the doors and lifted the golden statues from their pedestals one was an exquisite statue of nekhbet a vulture goddess of upper egypt the other isis neither had the name of tutankhamen that was important taking the mallet and chisel emeni moved under the amnut funerary bed and quickly made an opening into the side chamber according to the plans of amenemheb the other two statues emeni wanted were in a coffer in this smaller room ignoring a strong sense of foreboding emeni entered the room holding the oil lamp in front of him to his relief there were no terrifying objects the walls were roughhewn rock emeni recognized the chest he wanted from the beautiful image on the top there carved in relief was a young queen offering the pharaoh tutankhamen bouquets of lotus papyrus and poppies but there was a problem the lid was locked in some clever way and would not open emeni carefully set down the oil lamp on a reddishbrown cedar cabinet and examined the coffer more closely he was unaware of the activity in the tunnel behind him kemese had already reached its lip with iramen right behind him amasis an enormous nubian having great difficulty pushing his bulk through the narrow passage was farther back but the other two could already see emenis shadow dancing grotesquely on the floor and wall of the antechamber kemese gripped the bronze dagger in his rotting teeth and oozed headfirst from the tunnel onto the floor of the tomb silently he helped iramen to a standing position beside him the two waited scarcely daring to breathe until with a minor clatter of loose gravel amasis finally entered the chamber fear quickly metamorphosed to wildeyed greed as the three peasants eyed the unbelievable treasure spread around them never in their lives had they ever seen such marvelous objects and it was all there for the taking like a pack of starved russian wolves the three launched themselves into the carefully arranged objects densely packed coffers were ripped open and dumped gold attached to furniture and chariots was ripped off emeni heard the first crash and his heart leaped in his chest his first thought was that he was caught then he heard his companions cries of excitement and realized what was happening it was like a nightmare no no he shouted snatching up the oil lamp and pushing himself through the opening into the antechamber stop in the names of all the gods stop the sound reverberated in the small room momentarily startling the three thieves into inaction then kemese snatched up his oxbonehandled dagger seeing the movement amasis smiled it was a cruel smile the light from the oil lamp reflecting from the surface of his huge teeth emeni had no idea how long he was unconscious but when the blackness receded the nightmare returned in a tidal wave at first all he heard were muffled voices a small amount of gilded light issued from a break in the wall and turning his head slowly to ease the pain he stared into the burial chamber squatting down between bituminized statues of tutankhamen emeni could make out kemeses silhouette the peasants were violating the sacred sanctuary the holy of holies silently emeni moved each of his limbs his left arm and hand were numb from being twisted underneath him but otherwise he felt all right he had to find help he gauged the distance to the tunnel opening it was close but it would be difficult to enter it quietly bringing his feet up underneath him emeni crouched waiting for the throbbing in his head to abate suddenly kemese turned holding up a small golden statue of horus he saw emeni and for a moment he was frozen then with a roar he leaped into the center of the anteroom toward the dazed stonecutter ignoring the pain emeni dived into the tunnel scraping his chest and abdomen on the plastered edge but kemese moved swiftly and managed to grab an ankle bracing himself he shouted for amasis emeni rolled over onto his back within the tunnel and kicked viciously with his free foot catching kemese on his cheekbone the grip loosened and emeni was able to scramble forward through the tunnel mindless of innumerable cuts from the limestone chips he reached the dry night air and ran toward the necropolis guard station on the road to thebes behind in tutankhamens tomb panic ensued the three thieves knew that their only chance for escape was to leave immediately even though they had entered only one of the gilded burial shrines amasis reluctantly staggered from the burial chamber with a heavy armload of golden statues kemese tied a group of solid gold rings in a rag only to drop the bundle inadvertently on the debrisstrewn floor feverishly they dumped their spoils into reed baskets iramen put down the oil lamp and pushed his basket into the tunnel climbing in after it kemese and amasis followed dropping a lotiform alabaster cup on the threshold once they were out of the tomb they began to climb south away from the necropolis guard station amasis was overloaded with booty to free his right hand he stashed a blue faience cup under a rock then caught up to the others they passed the route to hatshepsuts temple heading instead for the village of the necropolis workers once out of the valley they turned to the west and entered the vast reaches of the libyan desert they were free and they were rich very rich emeni had never known torture although on occasion he had fantasized whether he could bear it he couldnt the pain ascended with surprising rapidity from being tolerable to unbearable he had been told that he was to be examined with the stick he had had no idea what that meant until four stout guards of the necropolis forced him down on a low table holding each of his extremities a fifth began to beat emeni unmercifully on the soles of his feet stop i will tell all gasped emeni but he had already told everything fifty times he wished he could pass out but he could not he felt as if his feet were in a fire pressed against whitehot glowing coals the agony was intensified by the burning noonday sun emeni shrieked like a butchered dog he tried to bite the arm holding his right wrist but someone pulled him back by his hair when emeni finally was certain of going crazy prince maya chief of police of the necropolis casually waved his manicured hand indicating the beating should stop the guard with the club hit emeni once more before quitting prince maya enjoying the scent from his customary lotus blossom turned to his guests nebmarenahkt mayor of western thebes and nenephta overseer and chief architect for his majesty pharaoh seti i no one spoke so maya turned to emeni who had been released and who was now lying on his back still feeling the fire in his feet tell me again stonecutter how you knew the way into pharaoh tutankhamens tomb emeni was yanked into a sitting position the image of the three noblemen swimming before him gradually his vision cleared he recognized the exalted architect nenephta my grandfather said emeni with difficulty he gave the plans of the tomb to my father who gave them to me your grandfather was a stonecutter for pharaoh tutankhamens tomb yes said emeni he went on to explain again that he had wanted only enough money to embalm his parents he pleaded for mercy emphasizing that he had given himself up when he saw his companions desecrating the tomb nenephta watched a distant falcon effortlessly spiral in the sapphire sky his mind wandered from the interrogation he was troubled by this tomb robber it was a shock to realize how easily all his efforts to secure his majesty seti is house of eternity could be thwarted suddenly he interrupted emeni are you a stonecutter on pharaoh seti is tomb emeni nodded he had stopped his pleading in midsentence he feared nenephta everyone feared nenephta do you think the tomb we are building can be robbed any tomb can be robbed as soon as it is not guarded anger swept over nenephta with great difficulty he refrained from personally thrashing this human hyena who represented everything he hated emeni sensed the animosity and cowered back toward his torturers and how would you suggest we protect the pharaoh and his treasure asked nenephta finally in a voice that quivered with restrained anger emeni did not know what to say he hung his head and endured the heavy silence all he could think of was the truth it is impossible to protect the pharaoh he said finally as it has been in the past so it will be in the future the tombs will be robbed with a speed that defied his corpulent bulk nenephta sprang from his seat and backhanded emeni you filth how dare you speak so insolently of the pharaoh nenephta motioned to hit emeni again but the pain in his hand from the first blow stopped him instead he adjusted his linen robe and then spoke since you are an expert in tomb robbing how is it that your own adventure failed so miserably i am not an expert in tomb robbing if i were i would have anticipated the effect that the treasures of pharaoh tutankhamen would have on my peasant helpers their greed drove them to madness nenephtas pupils suddenly dilated despite the bright sunlight his face went flaccid the change was so apparent that even the somnolent nebmarenahkt took notice stopping a date midway between the bowl and his gaping mouth is your excellency all right nebmarenahkt leaned forward for a better view of nenephtas face but nenephtas racing mind defied his countenance emenis words were a sudden revelation a halfsmile emerged from the creases in his cheeks turning to the table he addressed maya with excitement has pharaoh tutankhamens tomb been resealed of course said maya immediately reopen it said nenephta turning back to emeni reopen it queried a surprised maya nebmarenahkt dropped his date yes i want to enter that pitiful tomb myself the words of this stonecutter have provided me with an inspiration reminiscent of the great imhotep i now know how to guard the treasures of our pharaoh seti i for all eternity i cant believe i never thought of it before for the first time emeni felt a glimmer of hope but nenephtas smile vanished as suddenly he turned back to the prisoner his pupils narrowed and his face darkened like a summer storm your words have been helpful said nenephta but they do not atone for your vile deeds you will be tried but i will be your accuser you will die in the prescribed manner you will be impaled alive in view of your peers and your body will be left for the hyenas motioning his bearers to bring his chair nenephta turned to the other nobles you have served the pharaoh well today that is my fervent wish your excellency answered maya but i do not understand it is not for you to understand the inspiration i have had today shall be the most closely guarded secret in the universe it will last for all eternity november tomb of tutankhamenvalley of the kings necropolis of thebes the excitement was infectious even the sahara sun knifing through the cloudless sky could not diminish the suspense the fellahin quickened their pace as they brought basket after basket of limestone chips from the entrance to tutankhamens tomb they had reached a second door thirty feet down a corridor from the first it too had been sealed for three thousand years what lay beyond would the tomb be empty like all the others robbed in antiquity no one knew sarwat raman the beturbaned foreman climbed the sixteen steps to ground level with a layer of dust clinging to his features like flour clutching his galabia he strode across to the tent marquee which provided the only bit of shade in the remorselessly sunny valley beg to inform your excellency that the entrance corridor has been cleared of rubble said raman bowing slightly the second door is now fully exposed howard carter looked up from his lemonade squinting from under the black homburg he insisted on wearing despite the shimmering heat very good raman we will inspect the door as soon as the dust settles i will await your honorable instructions raman turned and retreated you are a cool one howard said lord carnarvon christened george edward stanhope molyneux herbert how can you sit here and finish your lemonade without knowing what is behind that door carnarvon smiled and winked at his daughter lady evelyn herbert now i can understand why belzoni employed a battering ram when he found seti is tomb my methods are diametrically opposed to those of belzoni said carter defensively and belzonis methods were appropriately rewarded with an empty tomb save for the sarcophagus carters gaze moved involuntarily toward the nearby opening of seti is tomb carnarvon im not really certain what weve found here i dont think we should allow ourselves to get too excited im not even sure its a tomb the design is not typical for an eighteenthdynasty pharaoh it could be just a cache of tutankhamens belongings brought from akhetaten besides tomb robbers have preceded us not once but twice my only hope is that it was robbed in antiquity and someone thought it important enough to reseal the doors so i truly have no idea what we are going to find maintaining his english aplomb carter allowed his eyes to roam about the desolate valley of the kings but his stomach was in knots he had never been so excited in all of his fortynine years in the previous six barren seasons of excavation he had found nothing two hundred thousand tons of gravel and sand had been moved and sifted for absolutely nothing now the suddenness of the find after only five days of excavating was overwhelming swirling his lemonade he tried not to think or hope they waited the whole world waited the larger dust particles settled in a fine layer on the sloping corridor floor the group made an effort not to stir the air as they entered carter was first followed by carnarvon then his daughter and finally a r callender carters assistant raman waited at the entrance after giving carter a crowbar callender carried a large flashlight and candles as i said we are not the first to broach this tomb said carter nervously pointing to the upperlefthand corner the door was entered and then resealed in that small area then he traced a larger circular area in the middle and again in this much larger area here it is very strange lord carnarvon bent over to look at the royal necropolis seal a jackal with nine bound prisoners along the base of the door are examples of the original tutankhamen seal continued carter the beam of the flashlight reflected the fine dust still suspended in the air before illuminating the ancient seals in the plaster now then said carter as coolly as if he were suggesting afternoon tea lets see what is behind this door but his stomach contorted into a tight mass aggravating his ulcer and his hands were damp not so much from the heat as from the unexpressed tension his body quivered as he lifted the crowbar and made a few preliminary cuts into the ancient plaster the bits and pieces rained down about his feet the exertion gave expression to his pentup emotions and each lunge was more vigorous than the last suddenly the crowbar broke through the plaster causing carter to stumble up against the door warm air issued from the tiny hole and carter fumbled with the matches lighting a candle and holding a flame to the opening it was a crude test for the presence of oxygen the candle continued to burn no one dared to speak as carter gave the candle to callender and continued working with the crowbar carefully he enlarged the hole making certain that the plaster and stone blocking fell into the corridor and not into the room beyond taking the candle again carter thrust it through the hole it burned contentedly he then put his head to the hole his eyes straining in the darkness in a moment time stood still as carters eyes adjusted three thousand years disappeared as in a minute out of the blackness emerged a golden head of amnut ivory teeth bared other gilded beasts loomed the flickering candlelight throwing their exotic silhouettes on the wall can you see anything asked carnarvon excitedly yes wonderful things answered carter finally his voice for the first time betraying emotion then he replaced the candle with his flashlight and those behind him could see the chamber filled with unbelievable objects the golden heads were part of three funerary beds moving the light to the left carter gazed at a jumble of gilded and inlaid chariots heaped in the corner tracing back to the right he began to ponder the curiously chaotic state of the room instead of the prescribed stately order objects appeared to have been thrown about without thought immediately to the right were two lifesize statues of tutankhamen each with a kilt of gold wearing gold sandals and armed with mace and staff between the two statues was another sealed door carter left the opening so the others could have a better look like belzoni he was tempted to crash down the wall and dive into the room instead he calmly announced that the rest of the day would be devoted to photographing the sealed door they would not attempt to enter what was obviously an antechamber until morning november it took more than three hours for carter to dismantle the ancient blocking of the door to the antechamber raman and a few other fellahin helped during this stage callender had laid in temporary electric wires so the tunnel was brightly lit lord carnarvon and lady evelyn entered the corridor when the job was almost complete the last baskets of plaster and stone were hauled away the moment of entry had arrived no one spoke outside at the mouth of the tomb hundreds of reporters from newspapers around the world tensely waited their first view for a brief second carter hesitated as a scientist he was interested in the minutest detail inside the tomb as a human being he was embarrassed by his intrusion into the sacred realm of the dead and as an explorer he was experiencing the exhilaration of discovery but british to the core he merely straightened his bow tie and stepped over the threshold keeping his eye on the objects below without a sound he pointed at a beautiful lotiform cup of translucent alabaster on the threshold so carnarvon could avoid it carter then made his way over to the sealed door between the two lifesize statues of tutankhamen carefully he began to examine the seals his heart sank as he realized that this door had also been opened by the ancient tomb robbers and then resealed carnarvon stepped into the antechamber his mind reeling with the beauty of the objects so carelessly scattered around him he turned to take his daughters hand as she prepared to enter and in the process noticed a rolled papyrus leaning against the wall to the right of the alabaster cup to the left was a garland of dead flowers as if tutankhamens funeral had been only yesterday and beside it a blackened oil lamp lady evelyn entered holding her fathers hand followed by callender raman leaned into the antechamber but did not enter for lack of space unfortunately the burial chamber has been entered and resealed said carter pointing toward the door in front of him carefully carnarvon lady evelyn and callender moved over to the archaeologist their eyes following his finger raman stepped into the antechamber curiously though continued carter it has been entered only once instead of twice like the doors into the antechamber so there is hope that the thieves did not reach the mummy carter turned seeing raman for the first time raman i did not give you permission to enter the antechamber i beg your excellencys pardon i thought that i could be of assistance indeed you can be of assistance by making sure no one enters this chamber without my personal approval of course your excellency raman silently slipped from the room howard said carnarvon raman is undoubtedly as enchanted as we with the find perhaps you could be a little more generous the workers will all be allowed to view this room but i will designate the time said carter now as i was saying the reason i feel hopeful about the mummy is that i think the tomb robbers were surprised in the middle of their sacrilege there is something mysterious about the way these priceless objects are haphazardly thrown about it appears as if someone spent a little time rearranging things after the thieves but not enough to put everything back in its original state why carnarvon shrugged look at that beautiful cup on the threshold continued carter why wasnt that replaced and that gilded shrine with its door ajar obviously a statue was stolen but why wasnt the door even closed carter stepped back to the door and this ordinary oil lamp why was it left within the tomb i tell you wed better record the positioning of each object in this room very carefully these clues are trying to tell us something it is very strange indeed sensing carters tension carnarvon tried to look about the tomb through his friends trained eyes indeed leaving an oil lamp within the tomb was surprising and so was the disarray of the objects but carnarvon was so overwhelmed by the beauty of the pieces he could think of nothing else gazing at the translucent alabaster cup abandoned so casually on the threshold he yearned to pick it up and hold it in his hands it was so enticingly beautiful suddenly he noticed a subtle change in its orientation with regard to the garland of dried flowers and the oil lamp he was about to say something when carters excited voice rang out in the chamber theres another room everyone take a look carter was squatting down shining his flashlight beneath one of the funerary beds carnarvon lady evelyn and callender hurried over to him there glittering in the circle of light from the torch another chamber took form filled with gold and jeweled treasure as in the anteroom the precious objects had been chaotically scattered but for the moment the egyptologists were too awed by their find to question what had happened three thousand years in the past later when they would be ready to explore the mystery carnarvon was already fatally ill with blood poisoning at am on april less than twenty weeks after the opening of tutankhamens tomb and during an unexplainable fiveminute power failure throughout cairo lord carnarvon died his illness reputedly was started by the bite of an insect but questions were raised within months four other people associated with the opening of the tomb died under mysterious circumstances one man disappeared from the deck of his own yacht lying at anchor in the placid nile interest in the ancient robbery of the tomb waned and was replaced by a reassertion of the reputation of the ancient egyptians in the occult sciences the specter of the curse of the pharaohs rose from the shadows of the past the new york times was moved to write about the deaths it is a deep mystery which it is all too easy to dismiss by skepticism a fear began to infiltrate the scientific community there were just too many coincidences day cairo pm erica barons reaction was pure reflex the muscles of her back and thighs contracted and she straightened up twirling to face the molester she had bent over to examine an engraved brass bowl when an open hand had thrust between her legs grabbing at her through her cotton slacks although she had been the object of a number of lewd stares and even obviously sexual comments since she had left the hilton hotel she had not expected to be touched it was a shock it would have been a shock anywhere but in cairo on her first day it seemed that much worse her attacker was about fifteen with a jeering smile that exposed straight rows of yellow teeth the offending hand was still extended ignoring her canvas tote bag erica used her left hand to knock the boys arm to the side then surprising herself even more than the boy she clenched her right hand in a tight fist and punched the taunting face throwing all her weight into the blow the effect was astonishing the punch was like a good karate blow hurling the surprised boy back against the rickety tables of the brass vendors shop table legs buckled wares crashed into the cobblestone street another boy carrying coffee and water on a metal tray suspended by a tripod was caught in the avalanche and he too fell adding to the confusion erica was horrified alone in the crowded cairo bazaar she stood clasping her bag unable to comprehend that she had actually hit someone she began to shake certain the crowds would turn on her but uncontrollable laughter erupted around her even the shopkeeper whose wares were still rolling in spirals in the street was chuckling away holding his sides the boy pulled himself from the debris and with his hand to his face managed a smile maareish said the shopkeeper which erica later learned meant it cant be helped or it doesnt matter feigning anger he waved his ballpeen hammer and chased the boy away then after giving erica a warm smile he started retrieving his belongings erica moved on her heart still beating quickly from the experience but realizing that she had a lot to learn about cairo and about modern egypt she was trained as an egyptologist but unfortunately that meant knowledge of the ancient civilization of egypt not the modern one her specialty of new kingdom hieroglyphic writing afforded no preparation for the cairo of ever since her arrival twentyfour hours previously her senses had been assaulted mercilessly first it was the smell a kind of cloying aroma of lamb that seemed to pervade every corner of the city then it was the noise a constant sound of automobile horns mixed with discordant arabic music blaring from innumerable portable radios finally it was the feel of dirt dust and sand which covered the city like the patina of a medieval copper roof accentuating the unremitting poverty the episode with the boy undermined ericas confidence in her mind all the smiles of the men in their skullcaps and flowing galabias began to reflect prurient thoughts it was worse than rome boys not even in their teens followed her giggling and asking her questions in a mixture of english french and arabic cairo was alien more alien than she had expected even the street signs were all written in the decorative but incomprehensible arabic script looking back over her shoulder up shari el muski toward the nile erica thought about returning to the western area of the city perhaps the whole idea of coming to egypt on her own was ridiculous richard harvey her lover for the last three years even her mother janice had said as much she turned again looking into the heart of the medieval city the street narrowed the press of people looked overwhelming baksheesh said a little girl no more than six years old pencils for school the english was crisp and surprisingly clear erica looked down at the child whose hair was hidden by the same dust that covered the street she wore a tattered orange print dress and no shoes erica bent to smile at her and suddenly gasped clustered around the childs eyelashes were numerous iridescent green house flies the little girl made no attempt to shoo them away she just stood there unblinking holding out her hand erica was immobilized safer a whiteuniformed policeman wearing a blue badge that said tourist police in bold authoritative letters pushed his way into the street toward erica the child melted into the crowd the jeering boys vanished may i be of assistance he said with a distinctive english accent you look like you might be lost im looking for the khan el khalili bazaar said erica tout à droite said the policeman gesturing ahead then he thumped his forehead with his palm excuse it is the heat ive been mixing my languages straight ahead as youd say this is el muski street and ahead you will cross the main thoroughfare of shari port said then the khan el khalili bazaar will be on your left i wish you good shopping but remember to bargain here in egypt it is a sport erica thanked him and pushed on through the crowd the minute he was gone the jeering boys miraculously reappeared and the innumerable street vendors accosted her with their wares she passed an openair butcher shop hung with a long row of recently slaughtered lambs flayed except for the heads and covered with splotches of pink ink representing government stamps the carcasses were hung upside down their unseeing eyes making her flinch and the smell of the offal forcing her lunch into her throat the stench quickly merged with the decadent smell of overripe mangoes from a neighboring fruit cart and the odor of fresh donkey dung in the street a few paces beyond there was the reviving sharpness of herbs and spices and the aroma of freshly brewed arabic coffee the dust from the densely packed narrow street rose and filtered the sun bleaching the strip of cloudless sky a faint faraway blue the sandcolored buildings on each side of the street were shuttered against the blanket of afternoon heat as erica advanced deeper into the bazaar listening to the sound of ancient wooden wheels on granite cobblestones she felt herself slipping back in time to medieval cairo she sensed the chaos the poverty and the harshness of life she was simultaneously frightened and excited by the throbbing raw fertility the universal mysteries which are so carefully camouflaged and hidden by western culture it was life stripped naked yet mitigated by human emotion fate was greeted with resignation and even laughter cigarette demanded a boy of about ten he was dressed in a gray shirt and baggy pants one of his friends pushed him from behind so that he stumbled closer to erica cigarette he asked again launching into a kind of arabic jig and pretending to smoke a makebelieve cigarette in exaggerated mime a tailor busy ironing with a charcoalfilled iron grinned and a row of men smoking intricately embossed water pipes stared at erica with piercing unblinking eyes erica was sorry she had worn such obviously foreign clothes her cotton slacks and a simple knit blouse made it clear she was a tourist the other women in western clothes that erica had seen had on dresses not pants and most of the women in the bazaar still wore the traditional black meliyas even ericas body was different from the local womens although she was several pounds heavier than she would have liked she was a good deal slimmer than egyptian women and her face was far more delicate than the round heavy features crowding the bazaar she had wide graygreen eyes luxuriant chestnut hair and a finely sculptured mouth with a full lower lip that gave her a faintly pouting expression she knew she was pretty when she worked at it and when she did men responded now picking her way through the crowded bazaar she regretted she had tried to look attractive her attire advertised that she was not protected by local street morality and even more important she was alone she was the perfect catalyst for the fantasies of all the men who watched her clutching her tote bag closer to her side erica hurried along as the street narrowed again to cluttered byways jammed with people engaged in every conceivable type of manufacture and commerce overhead carpets and cloth stretched between the buildings to cover the market area keeping out the sun but increasing the noise and the dust erica hesitated again watching the widely varied faces the fellahin were heavyboned with wide mouths and thick lips dressed in the traditional galabias and skullcaps the bedouin were the pure arabs with sharp features and slim wiry bodies the nubians were ebony with tremendously powerful and muscular torsos often naked to the waist the surge of the crowds pushed erica forward and carried her deeper into the khan el khalili she found herself pressed up against a wide variety of people someone pinched her backside but when she turned around she couldnt be sure who had done it she had a following now of five or six persistent boys she was being hounded like a rabbit in a hunt ericas goal in the bazaar had been the goldsmith section where she wanted to buy gifts but her resolve waned particularly when someones dirty fingers ran through her hair shed had enough she wanted to return to the hotel her passion for egypt involved the ancient civilization with its art and mysteries modern urban egypt was a little overpowering when taken in all at once erica wanted to get out to the monuments like saqqara and above all she wanted to get to upper egypt to the countryside she knew that was going to be as she dreamed it at the next corner she turned to the right stepping around a donkey that was either dead or dying it didnt move and no one paid the poor beast any attention having studied a map of the city prior to leaving the hilton she guessed she should reach the square in front of the el azhar mosque if she continued heading southeast pushing her way between a clump of shoppers bargaining over scrawny pigeons in reed cages erica broke into a jog she could see a minaret ahead and a sunlit square suddenly erica stopped dead in her tracks the boy who had demanded a cigarette and who was still following her now crashed into her but bounced off unnoticed ericas eyes were riveted to a window display there in front of her was a piece of pottery in the shape of a shallow urn it was a morsel of ancient egypt shining in the middle of modern squalor its lip was slightly chipped but otherwise the pot was unbroken even the clay eyelets apparently made to hang the pot were still intact aware that the bazaar was filled with fakes highly priced to attract tourists erica still was stunned by the bowls apparent authenticity the usual fakes were carved mummiform statues this was a splendid example of predynastic egyptian pottery as good as the best she had seen where she was currently employed the boston museum of fine arts if it were real it would be more than six thousand years old stepping back in the alleyway erica looked at the freshly painted sign over the window above were the curious squiggles of arabic script below was printed antica abdul the doorway to the left of the window was curtained by a dense row of heavily beaded strings a tug on her tote bag by one of her hecklers was all the encouragement erica needed to enter the shop the hundreds of colored beads made sharp crackling noises as they fell back into place behind her the shop was small about ten feet wide and twice that deep and surprisingly cool the walls stuccoed and whitewashed the floor covered with multiple worn oriental carpets an lshaped glasstopped counter dominated most of the room since no one came forward to help her erica hiked up the strap of her bag and bent over to look more closely at the amazing piece of pottery that she had seen through the window it was a light tan with delicately painted decorations in a shade somewhere between brown and magenta crumpled arabic newspaper had been stuffed inside the heavy redbrown curtains in the back of the shop parted and the proprietor abdul hamdi emerged shuffling up to the counter erica glanced at the man and immediately relaxed he was about sixtyfive and had a pleasant gentleness of movement and expression im very interested in this urn she said would it be possible for me to examine it more closely of course said abdul coming out from behind the counter he picked up the pot and unceremoniously put it into ericas trembling hands bring it over to the counter if youd like he switched on an unadorned light bulb erica gingerly put the urn on the counter and removed her tote from her shoulder then she picked up the pot again slowly turning it in her fingertips to examine the decorations besides purely ornamental designs there were dancers antelopes and crude boats how much is this erica looked very carefully at the drawings two hundred pounds said abdul lowering his voice as if it were a secret there was a twinkle in his eye two hundred pounds echoed erica while converting currencies in her mind that was about three hundred dollars she decided to bargain a little while trying to determine if the pot were a fake i can only afford one hundred pounds one hundred eighty is my best offer said abdul as if making a supreme sacrifice i suppose i could go to one hundred twenty said erica continuing to study the markings okay for you he paused and touched her arm she did not mind you are american yes good i like americans much better than russians for you i will do something very special i will take a loss on this piece i need the money because this shop is very new so for you one hundred and sixty pounds abdul reached over and took the pot from erica and placed it on the table a marvelous piece my best it is my last offer erica looked at abdul he had the heavy features of the fellahin she noticed that under the worn jacket of his western suit he was wearing a brown galabia turning the pot over erica looked at the spiral drawing on the bottom and let her slightly moist thumb gently rub over the painted design some of the burntsienna pigment came off at that moment erica knew the pot was a fake it was very cleverly made but definitely not an antique feeling extremely uncomfortable erica put the pot back on the counter and picked up her tote bag well thank you very much she said avoiding looking at abdul i do have others said abdul opening a tall wooden cabinet against the wall his levantine instincts had responded to ericas initial enthusiasm and the same instincts sensed a sudden change he was confused but did not want to lose a customer without a fight perhaps you might like this one he took a similar piece of pottery from the cabinet and placed it on the counter erica did not want to precipitate a confrontation by telling the seemingly kind old man that he was trying to cheat her reluctantly she picked up the second pot it was more oval than the first and sat on a narrower base the designs were all lefthand spirals i have many examples of this kind of pottery continued abdul setting out five other pots while his back was to erica she licked her forefinger and rubbed it across the design on the second pot the pigment did not budge how much is this one asked erica trying to conceal her excitement it was conceivable the pot in her hand was six thousand years old they are all different prices according to the workmanship and the condition said abdul evasively why not look at them all and pick one that you like then we can talk about prices carefully examining each pot in turn erica isolated two probable authentic antiques out of seven i like these two she said her confidence returning for once her egyptology expertise had a practical value she wished richard were there abdul looked at the two pots then at erica these are not the most beautiful why do you prefer them to the others erica looked at abdul and hesitated then she said defiantly because the others are fakes abduls face was expressionless slowly a twinkle appeared in his eyes and a smile lifted the corners of his mouth finally he broke into laughter bringing tears to his eyes erica found herself grinning tell me said abdul with difficulty he had to control his laughter before continuing tell me how you know these are fakes he pointed toward the pots erica had put aside the easiest way possible there is no stability to the pigment of the designs the paint comes off on a wet finger that never happens to an antique wetting his finger abdul tested the pigment his finger was smudged with burnt sienna you are absolutely right he repeated the test on the two antiques the fooler is made the fool such is life how much are these two real antique pots asked erica they are not for sale someday perhaps but not now taped to the underside of the glass countertop was an officiallooking document with government stamps from the department of antiquities antica abdul was a fully licensed antique shop next to the license was a printed paper saying that written guarantees on antiquities would be supplied on request what do you do when a customer wants a guarantee asked erica i give it to them for the tourist it makes no difference they are happy with their souvenir they never check doesnt that bother you no it does not bother me righteousness is a luxury of the wealthy the merchant always tries to get the highest price for his wares for himself and his family the tourists who come in here want souvenirs if they want authentic antiquities they know something about them it is their responsibility how is it that you know about pigment on ancient pottery i am an egyptologist you are an egyptologist allah be praised why would a beautiful woman like yourself want to be an egyptologist ah the world has passed by abdul hamdi i am indeed getting old so you have been to egypt before no this is my first trip i wanted to come before but it was too expensive its been a dream of mine for some time well i pray that you will enjoy it you are planning to go to upper egypt to luxor of course i will give you the address of my sons antique shop so he can sell me some fake pottery said erica with a smile no no but he can show you some nice things i too have some wonderful things what do you think of this abdul lifted a mummiform figure from the cabinet and set it on the counter it was made of wood covered with plaster and exquisitely painted a row of hieroglyphic writing ran down the front it is a fake said erica quickly no said abdul alarmed the hieroglyphics are not real it says nothing it is a meaningless row of signs you can read the mysterious writing as well that is my specialty especially writing from the time of the new kingdom abdul turned the statue around looking at the hieroglyphics i paid plenty for this piece im certain it is real perhaps the statue is real but the writing is not maybe the writing was added in an attempt to make the piece appear even more valuable erica attempted to wipe off some of the black color on the statue the pigment seems stable well let me show you something else abdul reached within the glasstopped cabinet and extracted a small cardboard box removing the top of the box he selected a number of scarabs and placed them in a row on the cabinet with his forefinger he pushed one toward erica she picked it up and examined it it was made of a porous material its top exquisitely carved in the form of the familiar dung beetle revered by the ancient egyptians turning it over erica was surprised to see the cartouche of a pharaoh seti i the hieroglyphic carving was absolutely beautiful it is a spectacular piece said erica replacing it on the counter so you wouldnt mind having that antique not at all how much is it it is yours it is a present i cant accept such a gift why do you want to give me a present it is an arabic custom but let me warn you it is not authentic surprised erica lifted the scarab to the light her initial impression did not change i think it is real no i know it is not real because my son made it its extraordinary said erica looking again at the hieroglyphics my son is very good he copied the hieroglyphics from a real piece what is it made of ancient bone there are enormous caches of brokenup mummies in luxor and aswan in the ancient public catacombs my son uses the bone to carve the scarabs to make the cut surface look old and worn we feed them to our turkeys one pass through a turkey gives it a truly venerable appearance erica swallowed fleetingly sickened by contemplating the scarabs biological journey but intellectual interest quickly overcame her physical response and she turned the scarab over and over in her fingers i admit i was fooled and would be again dont be upset several of these have been taken to paris where the curators think they know everything and they were tested probably carbondated interjected erica whatever anyway they were declared truly ancient well obviously the bone was ancient now my sons scarabs are in museums around the world a cynical laugh escaped from erica she knew she was dealing with an expert my name is abdul hamdi so please call me abdul what is your name oh i beg your pardon erica baron she placed the scarab on the counter erica i would be pleased if you joined me for some mint tea abdul put the other pieces back into their places then drew aside the heavy redbrown drapes erica had enjoyed talking with abdul but she hesitated a moment before picking up her bag and advancing toward the opening the back room was about the same size as the front part of the shop but it appeared to have no doors or windows the walls and floor were covered with oriental carpets giving the area the appearance of a tent in the center of the room were cushions a low table and a water pipe one moment said abdul the curtain fell back into place leaving erica to stare at several large objects that were completely draped with cloth she could hear the crackling noises of the beads in the front entrance and muffled shouts as abdul ordered tea please sit down abdul said when he returned indicating the large cushions on the floor it is not often i have the pleasure of entertaining a lady so beautiful and so knowledgeable tell me my dear where are you from in america originally im from toledo ohio said erica somewhat nervously but i live in boston now or actually cambridge which is right next to boston ericas eyes slowly moved around the small room the single incandescent bulb hanging in the center gave the deep reds of the oriental carpets an incredibly rich softness like red velvet boston yes it must be beautiful in boston i have a friend there we write occasionally actually my son writes i cannot write in english i have a letter from him here abdul rummaged through a small chest by the cushions producing a typed letter addressed to abdul hamdi luxor egypt perhaps you know him boston is a very big city began erica before she caught sight of the return address dr herbert lowery her boss you know dr lowery she asked incredulously ive met him twice and we write occasionally he was very interested in a head of ramses ii that i had about a year ago a wonderful man very clever indeed said erica amazed that abdul would be corresponding with such an eminent figure as dr herbert lowery chairman of the department of near eastern studies at the boston museum of fine arts it made her considerably more at ease as if sensing ericas thoughts abdul fished several other letters from his little cedar chest here are letters from dubois at the louvre and caufield at the british museum the beads clacked in the outer room abdul reached back and drew the curtains aside speaking a few words of arabic a young boy in a oncewhite galabia and bare feet slipped noiselessly into the room he was carrying one of those trays supported by a tripod silently he placed the glasses with metal holders next to the water pipe he did not look up from his task abdul dropped a few coins onto the boys tray and held the curtains back for the boy to leave turning back to erica he smiled and stirred his tea is this safe for me to drink asked erica fingering her glass safe abdul was surprised ive been warned so much about drinking water here in egypt ah you mean for your digestion yes it is completely safe the water boils constantly in the tea shop enjoy this is a hot parched land it is an arabic custom to drink tea or coffee with your friends they sipped in silence erica was pleasantly surprised by the taste and by the tingling freshness the drink left in her mouth tell me erica said abdul breaking the silence he pronounced her name in a strange way placing the accent on the second syllable provided of course you do not object to my asking tell me why you have become an egyptologist erica looked down into her tea the flecks of mint slowly swirled in the warm fluid she was accustomed to the question she had heard it a thousand times especially from her mother who never could understand why a beautiful young jewish girl who had everything would choose to study egyptology and not education her mother had tried to change her mind first by gentle conversation what are my friends going to think then by forcible debate youll never be able to support yourself finally by threatening to withdraw financial support it was all in vain erica continued her studies possibly in part because of her mothers opposition but mostly because she loved everything about the field of egyptology it was true she did not think in practical terms of what kind of job would be waiting for her when she finished and it was also true that she lucked out by being hired by the boston museum of fine arts when most of her fellow students were still unemployed with little immediate hope in sight nonetheless she loved the study of ancient egypt there was something about the remoteness and the mystery combined with incredible wealth and value of the material already discovered that fascinated her she was particularly fond of the love poetry which made the ancient people come alive it was through the poems that erica could feel the emotion spanning the millennia reducing the meaning of time and making her wonder if society had progressed at all looking up at abdul erica finally said i studied egyptology because it fascinated me when i was a little girl and my family took a trip to new york city the only thing i remembered was seeing a mummy at the metropolitan museum then when i was in college i took a course in ancient history i really enjoyed studying about the culture erica shrugged and smiled she knew she could never give a complete explanation very strange said abdul for me it is a job better than breaking my back in the field but for you he shrugged as long as you are happy it is good how old are you my dear twentyeight and your husband where is he erica smiled fully conscious that the old man had no idea why she was smiling the whole complex of problems surrounding richard cascaded out of her unconscious it was like opening a floodgate she was almost tempted to try to explain her problems to this sympathetic stranger but she didnt she had come to egypt to get away and to use her knowledge of egyptology im not yet married she said at length are you interested abdul the smile returned me interested im always interested abdul laughed after all islam lets the faithful have four wives but for me i could not handle four times the joy of my only wife still twentyeight and not married it is a strange world watching abdul drink erica thought about how much she was enjoying this interlude she wanted to remember it abdul would you mind if i took your picture i am pleased while abdul straightened himself on his pillow and smoothed his jacket erica extracted her small polaroid and attached the flash bar a moment after the flash washed the room with unnatural light the camera spit out the undeveloped photo ah if only the russian rockets would have worked as well as your camera said abdul relaxing since you are the most beautiful and the youngest egyptologist i have ever had in my shop i would like to show you something very special abdul slowly got to his feet erica glanced at the photo it was developing nicely you are lucky to see this piece my dear said abdul carefully lifting the cloth cover on an object about six feet tall erica looked up and gasped my god she said in disbelief in front of her was a lifesize statue she scrambled to her feet to look more closely abdul proudly stepped back like an artist unveiling his lifes work the face was made of beaten gold reminiscent of the mask of tutankhamen but more finely crafted it is pharaoh seti i said abdul he put down the cloth cover and sat letting erica enjoy her find this is the most beautiful statue i have ever seen whispered erica gazing into the stately calm face the eyes were made of white alabaster set with green feldspar the eyebrows were made of translucent carnelian the traditional ancient egyptian headdress was made of gold inlaid with bands of lapis lazuli around the neck was an opulent pectoral in the form of the vulture representing the egyptian goddess nekhbet the necklace was made of gold and set with hundreds of pieces of turquoise jasper and lapis lazuli the beak and the eyes were made of obsidian at the girdle was a sheathed gold dagger whose handle was finely crafted and encrusted with precious stones the left hand was extended holding a mace that was also covered with inlaid jewels the total effect was dazzling erica was overwhelmed this statue was no fake and its value was unbelievable indeed any piece of the jewelry was priceless standing amid the warm red glow of the oriental carpets the statue radiated a light as pure and clear as a diamond slowly circling the piece erica finally could speak where on earth did this come from ive never seen anything like it it came from beneath the sands of the libyan desert where all our treasures are hidden said abdul cooing like a proud parent it is only resting here for a few hours before it resumes its journey i thought youd like to see it oh abdul it is so beautiful im speechless truly erica came back around the front of the statue noting for the first time the hieroglyphics cut into the base immediately she recognized the name of pharaoh seti i contained within the enclosure called a cartouche then she saw another cartouche with another name thinking it an alternate name for seti i she began to translate to her astonishment the name was tutankhamen it didnt make sense seti i was an extremely important and powerful pharaoh who had ruled some fifty years after the insignificant boy king tutankhamen the two pharaohs were in different dynasties from totally separate families erica was sure that she must have made a mistake but checking again she realized she had been right the hieroglyphics contained both names the sharp crackling noise from the beads in the outer part of the shop brought abdul instantly to his feet erica please excuse but i must be reasonably careful the dark cloth cover settled back over the fabulous statue for erica it was like being prematurely awakened from a wonderful dream in front of her was a nondescript shapeless mass let me attend to the customers i will be right back enjoy your tea perhaps youd like a little more no thank you said erica who wanted to see the statue again not drink more tea as abdul shuffled over to the curtain and carefully peered out erica picked up the nowdeveloped polaroid picture except for missing part of abduls head the snapshot was fine she thought about taking a shot of the statue if abdul would agree apparently whoever was outside was in no rush because letting the curtains go abdul moved back over to his cedar chest erica sat down on her cushion do you have a guidebook for egypt asked abdul in a quiet voice yes said erica i managed to get a nagels guide i have something better said abdul pulling a small aging book from among his correspondence here is a baedeker edition it is the best for touring the monuments of egypt id be pleased if youd use it during your stay here in my country it is far superior to the nagels you are so kind said erica taking the book ill be very careful with it thank you it pleases me to make your visit more enjoyable said abdul walking back to the curtain where he hesitated again if you have difficulty getting the book to me when you leave egypt return it to the man whose name and address are written in the flyleaf i travel a lot and might not be in cairo at the time he smiled and walked through to the store the heavy drapes snapped back into place erica flipped through the guidebook noting the plethora of drawings and foldout maps the description of the temple of karnak given baedekers highest rating of four stars was almost forty pages it looked superb the next chapter commenced with a series of copper engravings of queen hatshepsuts temple followed by a long description which erica was particularly interested in reading she slipped the snapshot of abdul into the book both to mark the place and to preserve the photograph and put both into her tote bag alone in the room she let her attention wander back to the fabulous statue of seti i she had all she could do to keep herself from reaching over and lifting the veil to look at the curious row of hieroglyphics she wondered if it would really be a violation of trust if she looked at the statue reluctantly she decided it would be and she was about to take out the guidebook when she heard a definite change in the muffled conversation coming from the outer part of the shop the voices werent louder but they sounded angry at first she thought they were merely bargaining then the sound of shattering plate glass cut through the silence of the dimly lit room followed by a scream that was quickly choked off erica felt a sensation of pure panic spread up from her chest and pound in her temples a single voice recommenced lower more threatening as silently as possible erica moved over to the curtain and imitating abdul a few minutes earlier spread the edges to look into the outer part of the shop the first thing she saw was the back of an arab dressed in a ragged dirty galabia holding aside the beaded strings at the entranceway apparently watching for intruders then looking a little to the left erica stifled a scream abdul was pulled backward over the broken glasstopped counter by another arab also dressed in a torn dirty galabia in front of abdul stood a third arab dressed in a clean whiteandbrownstriped robe and a white turban who was brandishing a gleaming scimitar the light from the single overhead bulb reflected its razorsharp edge as it was raised in front of abduls terrified face before erica could allow the curtain to hide the grisly scene abduls head was yanked back and the scimitar was viciously drawn across the base of his neck slicing through the soft tissues to the spine a gasping sound escaped from the severed windpipe before the spurting bright red blood drenched the area ericas legs buckled and she dropped to her knees the heavy drapes masking the sound of her fall terrified she scanned the room for some concealment the cabinets there was no time to try to get inside pulling herself to her feet she pressed into the far corner between the last cabinet and the wall it was hardly a hiding place at best it hid her own view like a child covering his eyes in the dark but the beaknosed face of the man who had held abdul down seemed burned in her mind she kept picturing his cruel black eyes and his snarling mouth under his mustache revealing sharp goldtipped teeth there was more commotion from the outer part of the shop some sounds like the movement of furniture followed by a terrifying silence time passed agonizingly slowly then erica heard voices coming toward her the men were entering the back room she almost stopped breathing her skin crawling with fear the arabic conversation was right behind her she could feel the presence of the people could hear them moving about there were footsteps a thud someone cursed in arabic then the footsteps moved away and erica heard the familiar crackling noises of the beads in the entranceway erica let out her breath but stayed pressed into the corner as if she were poised on a ledge on a thousandfoot precipice time passed but she had no idea if she had waited five minutes or fifteen silently she counted to fifty still no sounds slowly she turned her head and backed slightly away from the corner the room was empty her tote bag undisturbed on the carpet her cup of tea waiting but the magnificent statue of seti i was gone the sound of beads hitting against each other in the entranceway sent a new chill plunging down ericas spine as she turned back toward the corner in a panic her foot hit her unfinished tea the glass fell over and tumbled free from its metal frame the carpet absorbed the fluid and the sound until the glass rolled against the table with a dull thud erica pressed herself against the corner once again she heard the heavy curtain yanked aside even though her eyes were closed the could see the effect of natural light in the room then the light disappeared she was alone with whoever was in the room there were several muted noises and the sound of footsteps coming closer she held her breath again suddenly a hand with an iron grip grabbed her left arm and yanked her from the corner pulling her stumbling into the center of the room boston am the sound of the alarm clock shattered richard harveys dream forcing him to acknowledge the arrival of another day he had tossed and turned fitfully the whole night the last time he remembered looking at the clock it was almost five a m he had twentyseven scheduled patients that day at the office and he felt like hed been run over christ he said angrily as he brought his fist down on the top of the alarm clock the force of the blow not only compressed the snooze button but also popped out the plastic cover over the dial it had happened before and the cover could be easily replaced into its housing but still it tended to symbolize for richard his life of late things were out of control and he was not used to that he swung his legs over the side of the bed and sat up looking at the clock rather than deal with the alarm again he bent over and yanked out the plug the almost imperceptible grinding noise of the electric clock stopped so did the sweep of the second hand next to the clock was a photo of erica on skis instead of smiling she was gazing into the camera with her full lower lip thrust out in that pouting expression that alternately enraged richard and filled him with desire he reached over and turned the picture around breaking the spell how could any girl as beautiful as erica be in love with a civilization that had been dead more than three thousand years still he missed her terribly and shed only been gone for two nights how was he going to deal with four weeks richard got up and padded to the toilet stark naked at age thirtyfour he was in very good shape hed always been athletic even through medical school and now that hed been in private practice for three years he still played tennis and racket ball regularly his sixfoot frame was lean and wellmuscled as erica had told him even his ass had definition from the bathroom he ventured into the kitchen putting on water to boil and pouring a glass of juice in the living room he opened the shutters that gave out onto louisburg square the midoctober sunlight filtered down through the golden leaves of the elms taking the chill off the air richard smiled wearily deepening the lines at the corners of his eyes and accentuating his dimples he was a pleasantly handsome man with a square somewhat impish face under thick honeycolored hair his blue eyes deeply set had a frequent twinkle egypt christ its like going to the moon richard said forlornly to the beautiful morning why the hell did she have to go to egypt he showered shaved dressed and breakfasted in a longestablished efficient pattern the only interruption of the usual routine was his socks he didnt have any clean socks so he was forced to find some in the hamper it was going to be a terrible day meanwhile he could think of nothing but erica finally in desperation he put a call through to ericas mother in toledo with whom he got along splendidly it was eight thirty and he knew hed catch her before she left for work after some small talk richard got to the point have you heard from erica yet my god richard shes only been gone a day true i just thought there was a chance im worried about her i dont understand whats going on everything was fine until we started talking about marriage well you should have done it a year ago i couldnt have done it a year ago my practice was just getting started of course you could have you just didnt want to then its that simple and if youre worried about her now you should have kept her from going to egypt i tried if you had tried richard shed be in boston right now janice i really tried i told her that if she went to egypt i didnt know what would happen to our relationship it was going to be different and what did she say to that she said she was sorry but that it was important for her to go its a stage richard shell get over it youre just going to have to relax im sure youre right janice at least i hope so if you hear from her let me know richard hung up the phone acknowledging that he didnt feel much better in fact he felt a certain panic as if erica was slipping away from him impulsively he called twa and checked on connections to cairo as if the mere act of doing so would make him feel closer it didnt and he was already late for the office thinking of erica enjoying herself while he was suffering a depression made him angry but there was little he could do cairo pm erica had not been able to speak for some time when she had looked up expecting to face the arab killer she had found herself standing in front of a european dressed in an expensive threepiece beige suit they had looked at each other for what seemed like an eternity both confused but erica was also terrified as a result it had taken a quarter of an hour for yvon julien de margeau to convince her that he meant her no harm even then erica had trouble speaking because she was trembling so violently finally and with great difficulty she had communicated to yvon that abdul was in the outer part of the shop either dead or dying yvon who had explained that the shop had been empty when he entered agreed to check after loudly insisting that erica sit down he returned quickly there is no one in the shop said yvon there is broken glass and some blood on the floor but there is no body i want to get away from here said erica it was her first whole sentence of course soothed yvon but first tell me what happened i want to go to the police continued erica the trembling recommenced when she closed her eyes she saw the image of the knife cutting into abduls throat i saw someone killed just a few moments ago it was terrible ive never even seen someone injured please i want to go to the police with her mind beginning to function erica looked at the man in front of her tall and thin he was in his late thirties with a tanned and angular face there was an air of authority about him heightened by the intense blue of his hooded eyes more than anything else after seeing the ragged arabs erica was reassured by his impeccable tailoring i had the misfortune of watching a man murdered she said at length i looked out through the curtain and saw three men one was in the doorway another was holding the old man and the other erica had trouble continuingand the other slit the old mans throat i see said yvon thoughtfully what were these three men wearing im not sure you do see said erica raising her voice what were they wearing im not talking about some pursesnatchers im trying to tell you that i saw a man murdered murdered i believe you but were these men arabic or european they were arab dressed in galabias two of them were filthy the other appeared considerably better off my god to think i came here for a vacation erica shook her head and began to get up could you recognize them asked yvon calmly he put his hand on ericas shoulder both to reassure her and to encourage her to remain seated im not sure it happened so fast maybe i could recognize the man with the knife i dont know i never did see the face of the man by the door raising her hand erica was amazed to see how violently it was trembling im not sure i believe any of this myself i was talking with abdul who owns the store in fact we had been talking for some time drinking tea he was full of wit a real person god erica ran her fingers through her hair and you say theres no body out there erica pointed through the curtain there really was a murder i believe you said yvon his hand still rested on ericas shoulder and she felt curiously comforted but why would they take the body too asked erica what do you mean too they took a statue that was right here said erica pointing it was a fabulous statue of an ancient egyptian pharaoh seti i interjected yvon that crazy old man had the seti statue here yvon rolled his eyes in disbelief you knew about the statue asked erica i did in fact i was coming here specifically to discuss it with hamdi how long ago did all this happen im not sure fifteen twenty minutes when you came in i thought you were the killers returning merde said yvon pulling away from erica to pace the room he took off his beige jacket and dropped it on one of the cushions so close he stopped pacing turning back to erica did you actually see the statue yes i did it was unbelievably beautiful by far the most impressive piece ive ever seen even the finest of tutankhamens treasures could not compare it showed the heights that new kingdom craftsmanship had reached by the nineteenth dynasty nineteenth dynasty how did you know that im an egyptologist said erica regaining some of her composure an egyptologist you do not look like an egyptologist and how is an egyptologist supposed to look asked erica testily okay let us just say that i would not have guessed yvon said was your being an egyptologist the reason hamdi showed you the statue i presume so still it was foolish very foolish i cannot understand why he would be willing to take such risks do you have any idea what the value of that statue is asked yvon almost angrily priceless returned erica it is all the more reason to go to the police that statue is an egyptian national treasure as an egyptologist i am aware of the black market in antiquities but i had no idea that pieces of such value were involved something has to be done something has to be done yvon laughed cynically american selfrighteousness the biggest market for antiquities is america if the objects could not be sold there would be no black market it is the buyer who is ultimately at fault american selfrighteousness said erica indignantly what about the french how can you say something like that knowing that the louvre is brimming with priceless objects essentially stolen like the zodiac from the temple of dendera people travel thousands of miles to come to egypt and end up looking at a plaster cast of the zodiac it was safer for the zodiac stone to remove it said yvon come on yvon you can think of a better excuse than that it had a certain validity in the past but not today erica couldnt believe that she had recovered enough to involve herself in a nonsensical argument she also noticed that yvon was incredibly attractive and that she was baiting him into some kind of emotional response okay said yvon coolly we agree in principle the black market must be controlled but we disagree in method for instance i do not think we should go immediately to the police erica was shocked so you disagree asked yvon im not sure stammered erica frustrated by her own transparency i understand your concern let me explain to you where you are im not trying to be patronizing just realistic this is cairo not new york or paris or even rome i say that because even italy is run incredibly efficiently when compared with egypt which is saying a lot cairo suffers from a gargantuan bureaucracy oriental intrigue and bribery are the rule not the exception if you go to the police with your story you will be the prime suspect consequently you will be jailed or at the very least placed under house arrest six months to a year could go by before even the appropriate papers are filled out your life will be pure hell yvon paused am i making any sense im telling you this for your own protection who are you asked erica reaching for her bag to get a cigarette in truth she did not really smoke richard hated it when she did and shed purchased a carton of cigarettes in the dutyfree shop as a gesture of rebellion but at the moment she wanted to do something with her hands watching her fumble in her bag yvon took out a gold case and held it open erica took a cigarette selfconsciously he lit it with a gold dior lighter then took one for himself they smoked in silence for a few moments erica puffed without inhaling i am what you call in your country a concerned citizen said yvon brushing back his dark brown hair which was already neatly in place i have deplored the destruction of antiquities and archaeological sites and ive decided to do something about it knowledge of this seti i statue was the biggest what do you say yvon searched for a word erica tried to help by suggesting find yvon shook his head but he moved his hand in a circle to encourage erica erica shrugged and suggested break to solve a mystery added yvon you need a clue or lead said erica ah lead yes it was the biggest lead but now i dont know the statue may be gone forever maybe you can help if you could identify the killer but here in cairo it will be difficult and if you go to the police it will be definitely impossible how did you learn about the statue in the first place asked erica from hamdi himself im sure he wrote to a number of people besides me said yvon looking around the room i came here as soon as possible in fact i arrived in cairo only a few hours ago he walked over to one of the large wooden cabinets and pulled open the door it was filled with small artifacts it would be helpful if his correspondence was here said yvon picking up a small wooden mummy figure most of these pieces are fake he added there are letters in that chest said erica pointing yvon followed ericas finger and walked over and opened the chest very good said yvon pleased perhaps there will be something in this material to help us but id like to make certain there isnt more correspondence hidden here he walked to the curtain and pulled it open a small amount of daylight entered the area raoul yvon called loudly the beads in the entranceway clacked yvon held open the curtain and raoul entered he was younger than yvon in his late twenties with olive skin and black hair and a carefree air of selfassured masculinity he reminded erica of jeanpaul belmondo yvon introduced him explaining that he was from the south of france and that though he spoke fluent english his heavy accent made him a little hard to understand raoul shook ericas hand and smiled broadly then ignoring erica the two men conversed rapidly in french before beginning to search the shop to see if there were any more records this will take only a few minutes erica said yvon carefully going through one of the upright cabinets erica sank to one of the large cushions in the center of the room she felt numbed by the whole experience she knew that searching the premises was illegal but she did not protest instead she vacantly watched the two men they had finished with the cabinets and were starting to take down all the carpets hanging on the walls while they worked their differences were apparent it was more than physical appearance it was the way they moved and handled things raoul was blunt and direct often relying on sheer strength yvon was careful and contemplative raoul was in constant motion often bending his head slightly drooped between his powerful shoulders yvon stood erect and he regarded objects from a comfortable distance he had rolled up his sleeves revealing smooth forearms that emphasized his small sculptured hands all at once erica recognized what was so different about yvon he had the sheltered pampered look of a nineteenthcentury aristocrat an air of elegant authority hovered over him like a halo with her pulse still racing erica abruptly found sitting intolerable she stood up and walked over to the heavy drapes she wanted some air but realized she was reluctant to look into the outer part of the shop despite yvons assurance that the body was gone finally she reached out and pulled open the curtain erica screamed only two feet from her was a face that had whirled to look at her when she pulled open the curtain there was a crash of pottery as the figure in the shop dropped his armload obviously as frightened as erica raoul responded instantaneously pushing past erica into the front room yvon followed the thief stumbled over the pottery and tried to reach the doorway but raoul was like a cat and with a sharp karate chop between the shoulders brought the intruder to the floor he rolled over a boy about twelve yvon took one look and walked back to erica are you all right he asked softly erica shook her head im not accustomed to this sort of thing she was still holding onto the drapes her head down take a look at this boy said yvon i want to be sure he wasnt one of the three he put his arm around her but she politely pushed him away im okay she said realizing she had overreacted because she had suppressed her earlier fright and then exploded at this latest happening taking a deep breath she went over and looked down at the cowering child no she said simply yvon spoke sharply in arabic to the boy who responded by scrambling to his feet and bolting through the entranceway leaving the beaded strips dancing behind him the poverty in this place makes some of these people act like vultures they sense when there is trouble i want to leave said erica as calmly as possible im not sure where i want to go but i want to get out of here and i still feel the police should be told yvon reached out and put a hand on ericas shoulder he spoke paternally the police can be informed but without involving yourself the decision is yours to make but believe me i know what im talking about egyptian jails rival those in turkey erica studied yvons steady eyes before looking down at her stilltrembling hands with the poverty and overwhelming disorder shed already seen in cairo yvons comments made sense i want to return to my hotel i understand said yvon but please allow us to accompany you erica just let me get the letters weve found it will only be a moment both men disappeared through the heavy curtains erica stepped over to the broken counter and stared at the mixture of shattered glass and dried blood it was difficult to stifle a feeling of nausea but with luck she quickly found what she was searching forthe fake scarab abdul had given to her the one that had been so exquisitely carved by his son she slipped it into her pocket at the same time gently touching the broken pottery on the floor with her toe the two authentic antiques were among the rubble after lasting six thousand years they were broken needlessly smashed on the floor of this pitiful shop by a twelveyearold thief the waste made her physically ill her gaze went back to the blood and she had to close her eyes to check the tears a sensitive human life snuffed out because of greed erica tried vainly to recall the appearance of the man who had wielded the scimitar his features had been sharp like the typical bedouins his skin the color of burnished bronze but she could not form a definite mental image of the man she opened her eyes again and looked around the shop anger began to supplant the incipient tears she wanted to go to the police for abdul hamdi so that the killer would be brought to justice but yvons admonition about the police in cairo was undoubtedly correct and if she couldnt even be sure shed recognize the killer if she saw him again then the risk of going to the police was not worth it erica bent down and picked up one of the larger shards of pottery her expertise was in the past and with impressive facility her mind conjured up the image of the seti statue with its alabasterandfeldspar eyes there was no doubt in her mind that the statue had to be recovered she had never known that objects of such importance were involved in the black market erica walked over to the curtain and drew it aside yvon and raoul were in the process of rolling up the floor carpets yvon looked up and motioned that it would be only a moment longer erica watched them work yvon was obviously interested in trying to do something about the black market the french had done a great deal to curb looting of egyptian treasures at least the stuff they didnt carry off to the louvre if her not going to the police could help recover the statue then perhaps it was the best thing to do erica decided shed go along with yvon but she knew there was a degree of rationalization in her thinking leaving raoul to replace the carpets yvon guided erica out of antica abdul moving through the khan el khalili with yvon was a totally different experience than trying to walk through it alone no one bothered her as if trying to distract her from the events of the last hour yvon talked continuously about the bazaar and about cairo he was obviously quite familiar with the history of the city he had removed his tie and his shirt was open at the collar how about a bronze head of nefertiti he asked holding up one of the ugly tourist souvenirs he had taken from a vendors cart never said erica horrified she remembered the scene after the molester had attacked her you must have one said yvon beginning to bargain in arabic erica tried to interfere but he bought the statue and gave it to her with great ceremony a souvenir of egypt to cherish the only problem is i believe they are made in czechoslovakia smiling erica took the small statue the charm of cairo began to filter through the heat dirt and poverty and she relaxed a little the narrow alleyway on which they were walking opened up and they stepped into the sunlight of the al azhar square with a cacophony of auto horns traffic had come to a standstill to the right yvon pointed out an exotic building with a square minaret and surmounted by five onionshaped turrets then he turned her around to the left almost concealed by the traffic and an open market was the entrance to the famous al azhar mosque they walked toward the mosque and the closer they got the easier it became to appreciate the elaborate entrance with its two arches and intricate arabesque decorations it was the first example of medieval muslim architecture erica had approached since her arrival in truth she did not know much about islam and the buildings had a particularly exotic feel for her yvon sensed her interest and pointed out the various minarets particularly those with domes and stone filagree he continued a running commentary on the mosques history including which sultans had added to it erica tried to concentrate on yvons monologue but it became impossible the area directly in front of the building served as a busy market and was jammed with people besides her mind kept returning to abdul and the image of his sudden and horrible death when yvon changed the subject erica did not respond he had to say again this is my car may i give you a lift to your hotel it was a black egyptianbuilt fiat relatively new but with a full complement of dents and scrapes it is not a citroën but it is okay erica was momentarily flustered she had not expected a private auto a taxi would have been fine she liked yvon but he was a stranger in a strange land her eyes betrayed her thoughts please understand my position said yvon i feel that you were caught in a very unfortunate circumstance i am glad i happened by wishing only that id been twenty minutes earlier i merely want to help you cairo can be difficult and with the kind of experience youve had it could be overwhelming at this time of day you will not catch a taxi there simply are not enough let me give you a ride to your hotel what about raoul asked erica trying to stall yvon unlocked the passenger door and opened it instead of trying to pressure erica he walked over to a turbaned arab who had been apparently watching the car spoke some words of arabic and dropped a few coins in the mans open palm then he opened the drivers door and got in leaning across to smile up at erica his blue eyes appeared soft in the afternoon sun dont worry about raoul he can take care of himself its you i am worried about if you have the fortitude to wander around cairo by yourself you certainly shouldnt mind riding with me as far as your hotel but if not tell me where you are staying and ill meet you there in the lobby im not ready to give up on this seti i statue and you may be able to help yvon busied himself with his seat belt erica glanced around the square sighed and got into the car the hilton she said the ride was not relaxing prior to pulling away from the curb yvon had donned soft kid driving gloves pulling the leather over each finger with great care when he did put the car in gear it was with a vengeance and the small auto leaped into the traffic with squealing wheels because of the snarled traffic the brakes had to be applied immediately with the result that erica had to brace herself against the dash and so the ride continued in sudden fits and stops throwing erica forward and backward they went from what she thought was one nearaccident to the next often clearing other autos trucks donkey carts and even buildings by millimeters animals and people fled before them as yvon gripping the steering wheel with both hands drove as if he were engaged in a competitive sport he was determined and aggressive although he did not become angry or exasperated at the performance of others if another car or cart snaked in front of him he did not mind he would wait patiently until a slot opened then race forward they headed southwest out of the bustling center passing the remains of the old city walls and the magnificent citadel of saladin within the citadel the domes and minarets of the muhammad ali mosque soared heavenward in a bold affirmation of the worldly power of islam they reached the nile at the level of the northern tip of the island of roda turning to the right they headed up the broad avenue that ran along the east bank of the mighty river the sparkling cool blue of the water reflecting the afternoon sunlight in a million diamonds provided a refreshing contrast to the heat and squalor of downtown cairo when erica had first seen the nile the day before she had been impressed by its history and the fact that its waters came from distant equatorial africa today she could really understand that cairo and all of inhabited egypt could not exist without the river the oppressive dust and heat proclaimed the power and harshness of the desert that pressed constantly at cairo s back door threatening like a plague yvon drove directly to the front entrance of the hilton leaving the keys in the car he managed to beat the turbaned doorman to the passenger side and chivalrously helped erica out of the car erica who had just witnessed the most violent scenes of her life smiled at the unexpected gallantry coming from america she was unaccustomed to seeing such an obviously masculine man concerned with the details of courtesy it was a unique european combination and one which even exhausted as she was erica could not help but find charming i will wait for you if you would like to go to your room and freshen up before we talk said yvon as they entered the busy lobby the afternoon international flights had arrived i think i need a drink first said erica without a moments hesitation the temperature of the airconditioned cocktail lounge was delicious like sliding into a pool of crystal water they sat in a corner booth and ordered when the drinks came erica held the frosted glass of her vodka and tonic to her cheek for a moment to appreciate its coolness looking at yvon calmly sipping his pernod she realized how quickly he could adapt to his environment he was as comfortable within the depths of the khan el khalili as he was in the hilton there was the same confidence the same control looking more carefully at his clothes erica recognized how fastidiously they were tailored to his body comparing their elegance to richards unchanging brooks brothers look made her smile but she knew that richard was not interested in clothes and that the comparison wasnt fair erica took a taste of her drink and began to relax she took another sip a bigger one and breathed in deeply before swallowing god what an experience she said she rested her head in her hand and massaged her temples yvon remained silent after a few minutes she sat up and straightened her shoulders what are you going to do about the seti statue im going to try to find it said yvon i must find it before it gets out of egypt did abdul hamdi say anything to you about where it was going anything only that it was in the shop for a few hours and it would soon resume its journey nothing else about a year ago a similar statue appeared and what do you mean similar asked erica excitedly it was a gilded statue of seti i said yvon did you actually see it yvon no if i had it would not be in houston today it was bought by an oil man through a bank in switzerland i tried to trace it but swiss banks are very uncooperative i got nowhere do you know if the houston statue had hieroglyphics carved in the base asked erica yvon shook his head while lighting a gauloise i havent the slightest idea why do you ask because the statue i saw had hieroglyphics cut into the base said erica warming to the subject and the thing that caught my eye was the fact that there were the names of two pharaohs seti i and tutankhamen inhaling deeply on his cigarette yvon regarded erica questioningly his thin lips pressed together tightly as he blew the smoke from his nostrils hieroglyphics are my specialty said erica defensively its impossible for setis and tutankhamens names to be on the same statue said yvon flatly it is strange continued erica but there is no doubt in my mind unfortunately i did not have time to translate the rest my first thought was that the statue was a fake it was no fake said yvon hamdi would not have been killed for a fake couldnt you have mistaken tutankhamens name for another never said erica she found a pen in her bag drew the coronation name of tutankhamen on her cocktail napkin and pushed it toward yvon defiantly that was carved in the base of the statue i saw looking at the drawing yvon smoked in thoughtful silence erica watched him why was the old man killed she said finally thats what seems so senseless if they wanted the statue they could have taken it hamdi was there by himself i have no idea admitted yvon looking up from the drawing of tutankhamens name perhaps it has something to do with the curse of the pharaohs he smiled about a year ago id traced a route for egyptian antiquities to a middleman in beirut who obtained the pieces from egyptian pilgrims going to mecca no sooner had i made the contact than the gentleman was killed im wondering if it has something to do with me do you think he was killed for the same reasons as abdul hamdi asked erica no actually he was caught between christian and muslim bullets still i was on my way to see him when it happened it is such a senseless tragedy said erica sadly again thinking of abdul it is indeed agreed yvon but remember hamdi was no innocent bystander and he knew the stakes that statue was priceless and in the middle of all this poverty money can move mountains thats the real reason it would be a mistake for you to go to the authorities its hard to find someone you can trust under the best of circumstances and when that kind of money is involved the police themselves may not act with honesty im not sure what i should do said erica but what are your plans yvon taking another draw on his gauloise he let his gaze wander around the tastelessly decorated lounge hopefully there will be some information in hamdis correspondence its not much but its a start ive got to find out who killed him turning back to erica his face took on a more serious expression i very well might need you to make the final identification would you do that of course if i can said erica i really didnt get a very good look at the killers but id really like to help erica thought about what shed said the words sounded so trite but yvon did not seem to notice instead he reached across and gently grasped her wrist i am very pleased he said warmly now i must go im staying at the meridien hotel suite thats on the island of roda yvon paused but his hand still lightly gripped ericas wrist i would be quite happy if you would agree to have dinner with me tonight this day must have given you a terrible impression of cairo and i would like to show you the other side the unexpected offer flattered erica yvon was unreasonably charming and could probably dine with any one of a thousand women his interest was obviously the statue but her own reactions were confusing thank you yvon but im exhausted im still suffering from jet lag and i didnt sleep well yesterday some other night perhaps we could have an early dinner ill have you back here by ten after your experience today i just dont think you should be sitting in your hotel room by yourself looking at her watch erica saw that it was not quite six pm ten would not be too late and she had to eat anyway if it would not be a bother to have me back by ten then id like to have dinner with you yvon tightened his grip on her wrist for an instant then let go entendu he said and motioned for the check boston am richard harvey looked down at the corpulent bulk of henrietta olsons abdomen the upper and lower sheets had been separated to expose the area of the gall bladder the rest of henriettas body was covered to preserve her dignity now mrs olson please point to where you felt the pain said richard a hand snaked out from beneath the sheets with her index finger henrietta indented her belly just under the right rib cage and also back here doctor said henrietta rolling over on her right side and jabbing her finger in the middle of her back right about here said henrietta poking richard with her finger at the level of his kidney richard rolled his eyes so that only nancy jacobs his office nurse could see but she shook her head feeling that richard was being unusually short with his patients richard looked up at the clock he knew he had three more patients to see before lunch although his threeyearold practice of internal medicine was doing amazingly well and he liked his work some days were a little trying problems relating to smoking and obesity comprised ninety percent of his cases it was a far cry from the intellectual intensity of his residency at the general and now on top of this problem was the situation with erica it made concentrating on problems like henriettas gall bladder almost impossible there was a quick knock and sally marinski the receptionist poked her head in doctor your call is on one richards face brightened hed asked sally to ring up janice baron ericas mother excuse me mrs olson said richard i must take this call ill be right back he motioned for nancy to stay closing the door to his office richard picked up the phone and pressed the connecting button hello janice richard erica hasnt written yet thanks a lot i know she hasnt written yet the reason i called is to tell you im really going crazy i want to know what you think i should do i dont think you have a lot of choices right now richard youre just going to have to wait until erica gets back why do you think she went asked richard i havent the faintest idea ive never understood this egypt thing right from the time she announced that she was going to major in it if her father hadnt died he would have been able to talk some sense into her richard paused before speaking i mean im glad she has interests but a hobby should not threaten the rest of your life i agree richard there was another pause and richard absentmindedly toyed with his desk set he had a question for janice but he was afraid to ask what do you think of me going to egypt he said finally there was a silence janice said richard wondering if the connection had been broken egypt richard you cant leave your office like that it would be difficult but if its necessary i can do it i can get coverage well maybe its a good idea but i dont know erica has always had a mind of her own did you talk to her about going no we never discussed it i think she just assumed i couldnt leave right now maybe it would show her that you care said janice thoughtfully know that i care my god she knows i put a down payment on that house in newton well that may not be exactly what erica has in mind richard i do think that the problem is that you dragged your feet too long so maybe going to egypt is a good idea i dont know what ill do but thanks janice richard replaced the receiver and looked on his blotter at the patient list for the afternoon it was going to be a long day cairo pm erica leaned back as the two attentive waiters cleared away their dishes yvon had been so crisp and short with them that erica had almost been embarrassed but it was obvious that yvon was accustomed to efficient servants with whom the less said the better they had dined sumptuously by candlelight on spicy local dishes that yvon had ordered with great authority the restaurant was romantically although inappropriately called the casino de monte bello and it was situated on the crest of the mukattam hills from where erica was sitting on the veranda she could look east into the rugged arabian mountains that ran across the arabian peninsula to china to the north she could see the spreading veins of the delta as the nile fanned out searching for the mediterranean and to the south she could see the river coming from the heart of africa like a flat shiny snake but by far the most impressive vista was to the west where the minarets and domes of cairo thrust their heads through the mist that covered the city stars were emerging in the darkening silver sky just like the lights of the city below erica was obsessed with images of the arabian nights the city projected an exotic sensuous and mysterious quality that forced the sordid events of the day to recede cairo has a very powerful bitter charm said yvon his face was lost in the shadows until the ember of his cigarette became fiery red as he inhaled illuminating his sharply cut features it has such an unbelievable history the corruption the brutalities the continuity of violence are so fantastic so grotesque as to defy comprehension has it changed much asked erica thinking of abdul hamdi less than people think the corruption is a way of life the poverty is the same and bribery asked erica that hasnt changed at all said yvon carefully tapping his cigarette over the ashtray erica took a sip of wine youve convinced me not to go to the police i really have no idea if i could identify the killers of mr hamdi and the last thing i want to do is get caught up in a morass of asian intrigue its the smartest thing you can do believe me but it still bothers me i cant help but feel im shirking my responsibility as a human being i mean to see a murder and then not do anything but you think that my not going to the police will help your crusade against the black market absolutely if the authorities find out about this seti statue before i can locate it then any chance of its helping me penetrate the black market will be lost yvon reached over and reassuringly squeezed her hand while youre trying to find the statue will you try to find out who killed abdul hamdi erica asked of course said yvon but dont misunderstand me my motive is the statue and controlling the black market i dont fool myself into thinking i will be able to influence moral attitudes here in egypt but if i do find the killers i will alert the authorities will that help assuage your conscience it will said erica immediately below lights came on illuminating the citadel the castle fascinated erica evoking images of the crusades one thing you said this afternoon surprised me she said turning to yvon you mentioned the curse of the pharaohs surely you dont believe in such nonsense yvon smiled but allowed the waiter to serve the aromatic arabic coffee before speaking curse of the pharaohs lets say i dont dismiss such ideas totally the ancient egyptians spent great efforts on preserving their dead they were renowned for their interest in the occult and they were experts with all sorts of poisons alors yvon sipped his coffee many of the people dealing with treasures from pharaonic tombs have died mysteriously theres no doubt about that the scientific community has a lot of doubt said erica certainly the press has been quick to exaggerate various stories but there have been some very curious deaths related to tutankhamens tomb starting with lord carnarvon himself there has to be something to it how much i do not know the reason i mentioned the curse was that it seems two merchants who were good leads as you say were killed just prior to my meeting with them coincidence probably after their coffee they strolled along the crest of the mountain to a hauntingly beautiful ruined mosque they didnt speak the beauty cradled and awed them yvon offered his hand as they climbed over some rocks to stand within the towering roofless walls of the onceproud building above the milky way was splattered against the midnightblue sky for erica the magical charm of egypt lay in its past and there in the darkness of the medieval ruins she could feel it on the way back to the car yvon put his arm around her but he continued to talk placidly about the mosque and deposited her at the entrance to the hilton very close to ten oclock as promised still riding up in the elevator erica admitted to herself that she was mildly infatuated yvon was a charming and devilishly attractive man reaching her room she inserted the key opened the door and flipped on the light dropping her tote bag on the luggage rack in the small foyer she closed the door and doublelatched it the airconditioning was on full blast and preferring not to sleep in an artificially cooled room she headed toward the switch near the balcony to turn it off halfway there she stopped and bit back a scream a man was sitting in her easy chair in the corner of the room he did not move or speak he had pure bedouin features but was carefully dressed in a gray silk european suit white shirt and black tie his total immobility and piercing eyes paralyzed her he was like a terrifying sculpture in deep bronze although back home erica had fantasized how violently she would react if she were ever threatened with rape now she did nothing her voice failed her her arms hung limply my name is ahmed khazzan said the figure at last in a voice that was deep and fluid i am the director general of the department of antiquities of the egyptian arab republic i apologize for this intrusion but it is necessary reaching into his jacket pocket he extracted a black leather wallet it fell open in his outstretched hand my official credentials if you wish ericas face blanched she had wanted to go to the police she knew she should have gone to the police now she was in very deep trouble why had she listened to yvon still paralyzed by the mans hypnotic gaze erica could not speak i am afraid you must come along with me erica baron said ahmed standing up and walking over to her erica had never seen such piercing eyes in a face objectively as handsome as omar sharifs they absorbed and terrified her erica stammered incoherently but managed to finally look away beads of cold sweat had appeared on her forehead she could feel her underarms were damp having never been in trouble with any authorities anywhere she was totally unnerved mechanically she put on a sweater and picked up her bag ahmed remained silent as he opened the door into the hallway his expression of intense concentration did not alter erica conjured up images of dank horrible cells as she walked beside him through the lobby boston suddenly seemed very far away ahmed waved at the entrance to the hilton and a black sedan pulled up he opened the rear door and motioned for erica to enter which she did quickly hoping that her cooperation would atone for her having failed to report abduls murder as the car drove off ahmed maintained the oppressive and intimidating silence fixing erica from time to time with his unwavering gaze ericas imagination raced in anxious circles she thought about the united states embassy and the consulate should she demand the opportunity to call and if so what would she say looking out the car window she noticed the city was still very much alive with other vehicles and pedestrians although the great river looked like a pool of stagnant black ink where are you taking me asked erica her voice sounding strange even to herself ahmed did not answer immediately erica was about to ask again when he spoke to my office in the ministry of public works it is a short ride true to his word the black sedan soon pulled off the main street into a semicircle of concrete in front of a pillared government building a night watchman opened the massive entrance door as they mounted the steps then began a walk that seemed as long as the ride from the hilton with only the hollow sounds of their shoes on the stained marble floor they crossed a bewildering number of deserted corridors leading them deeper and deeper into the labyrinthine reaches of a prodigious bureaucracy at last they reached the proper office ahmed unlocked the door and led the way through the anteroom jammed with metal desks and antique typewriters entering a spacious office beyond he indicated a chair for erica it faced an old mahogany desk neatly arranged with carefully sharpened pencils and a new green blotter ahmed maintained his silence as he removed his silk jacket erica felt like a cornered animal she had expected to be taken to a room full of accusing faces where she would be subjected to the usual bureaucratic red tape like fingerprinting she had anticipated trouble over the fact that she did not have her passport which the hotel people had demanded on registration saying that it had to be stamped and would not be back for twentyfour hours but this empty room was proving more frightening who would know where she was she thought of richard and her mother and wondered if she might make a longdistance call she glanced nervously around the office it was spartanly appointed and extremely tidy framed photos of various archaeological monuments adorned the walls along with a modern poster of the funerary mask of tutankhamen two large maps covered the right wall one was of egypt and small redtopped pins had been inserted at various locations the other map was of the necropolis of thebes with the tombs marked with maltese crosses biting her lip to hide her anxiety erica looked back at ahmed to her surprise he was busy with an electric hot plate would you care for some tea he asked turning around no thank you said erica numbed by the weird circumstances gradually her mind began to suggest that she had jumped to conclusions and she thanked heaven that she had not blurted out a confession before hearing what the arab had to say ahmed poured himself a cup of tea and brought it over to the desk slowly stirring in two sugars he once more brought his powerful gaze to bear on erica she quickly lowered her eyes to avoid the impact speaking without looking up i would like to know why i have been brought to this office ahmed didnt answer erica looked up to make sure hed heard her and as their eyes met ahmeds voice lashed out like a whip i want to know what you are doing in egypt he said practically shouting his anger took erica by surprise and she stumbled over her words im im here im an egyptologist and you are jewish arent you snapped ahmed erica was smart enough to realize that ahmed was trying to push her off balance but she wasnt sure she was strong enough to resist his attack yes she said simply i want to know why you are in egypt repeated ahmed raising his voice again i came here said erica defensively i want to know what the purpose of your trip is and who you work for i dont work for anyone and there was no purpose for my trip said erica nervously you expect me to believe there was no purpose for your trip ahmed said cynically come now erica baron he smiled and his swarthy complexion enhanced the whiteness of his teeth of course there was a purpose said erica her voice breaking what i meant was that i didnt come here for some ulterior motive her voice trailed off as she remembered her complicated problems with richard you are not convincing said ahmed not at all im sorry said erica im an egyptologist ive studied about ancient egypt for eight years i work in an egyptology department in a museum ive always wanted to come i had had plans to come years ago but my fathers death made it impossible it wasnt until this year that i could manage it ive made arrangements to do a little work while im here but mostly it is a vacation what kind of work i plan to do some onsite translation of new kingdom hieroglyphics in upper egypt youre not here to buy antiquities heavens no said erica how long have you known yvon julien de margeau he leaned forward his eyes riveted to ericas i met him for the first time today erica blurted how did you meet her pulse quickened and perspiration reappeared on her forehead did ahmed know about the murder after all a moment earlier she would have said no but now she wasnt certain we met in the bazaar stammered erica she held her breath do you know that monsieur de margeau has been known to purchase valuable egyptian national treasures erica was afraid her relief was apparent obviously ahmed did not know about the murder no she said i had no idea do you have any comprehension continued ahmed of the extent of the problem we face trying to stop the black market in antiquities he stood up and walked over to the map of egypt i have some idea said erica confounded by the multiple directions of the conversation she still did not know why she had been brought to ahmeds office the situation is very bad said ahmed take for instance the highly destructive theft in of ten slabs of hieroglyphic relief from the temple of dendera a tragedy a national disgrace ahmeds index finger rested on the redtopped pin stuck in the map at the location of the temple of dendera it had to be an inside job but the case was never broken the poverty works against us here in egypt ahmeds voice trailed off his face reflected strain and commitment carefully his index finger touched the red tops of other pins each one of these indicates a major antiquities theft if i had a reasonablesized staff and if i had some money to pay the guards a decent wage then i could do something about all this ahmed was speaking more to himself than to erica turning he seemed almost surprised to see her in his office what is monsieur de margeau doing in egypt he asked his anger returning i dont know said erica she thought about the seti statue and abdul hamdi she knew if she talked about the statue shed have to talk about the murder how long is he staying i havent the faintest idea i only met the man today but you had dinner with him tonight thats right said erica defensively ahmed walked back toward the desk he leaned forward and looked down threateningly into ericas graygreen eyes she could sense his intensity and tried to return his gaze but without much success she did feel a little more confident realizing that ahmed was interested in yvon not her but she was still afraid besides she had lied she knew yvon was there for the statue what did you learn about monsieur de margeau during your dinner that he is a charming man said erica evasively ahmed slammed his hand down on his desk sending some of the carefully sharpened pencils flying and making erica flinch im not interested in his personality said ahmed slowly i want to know why yvon de margeau is in egypt well why dont you ask him said erica finally all i did was go to dinner with the man do you often go to dinner with men you just meet asked ahmed erica studied ahmeds face very carefully the question surprised her but then almost everything had been surprising his voice suggested a kind of disappointment but erica knew that was absurd i very rarely go to dinner with strangers she said defiantly but i felt immediately comfortable with yvon de margeau and i thought he was charming ahmed walked over to his jacket and carefully put it on taking the last of his tea in a gulp he looked back to erica for your own good i would ask you to keep this conversation confidential now i will take you back to your hotel erica was more confused than ever watching ahmed retrieve the pencils that had fallen from the desk erica suddenly was overcome with guilt the man was obviously sincere in his desire to contain the black market in antiquities and she was withholding information at the same time the experience with ahmed was frightening as yvon had warned her he certainly did not behave like any american officials she had known she decided to let him take her back to the hotel without saying anything after all she could always contact him if she felt she had to cairo pm yvon julien de margeau had on a red silk christian dior robe tied loosely at the waist exposing most of his silverhaired chest the sliding glass doors of suite were all open allowing the cool desert breeze to rustle gently through the room a table had been placed on the wide balcony and from where yvon was sitting he could look north across the nile toward the delta gezira island with its slender phallic observation tower loomed in the middistance on the right bank yvon could see the hilton and his mind kept returning to erica she was very different from any of the women he had known he was both shocked and attracted by her passionate interest in egyptology and was confused by her talk of career after a moment he shrugged considering her in the context with which he was most familiar she was not the most beautiful woman hed been with of late and yet there was something about her that had suggested a subtle yet powerful sensuality on the center of the table yvon had placed his attaché case filled with the voluminous papers he and raoul had found at abdul hamdis raoul was stretched out on the couch doublechecking letters yvon had already perused alors said yvon suddenly slapping the letter he was reading with his free hand stephanos markoulis hamdi corresponded with markoulis the travel agent from athens that could be what we are looking for said raoul expectantly do you think there is a threat involved yvon continued reading the text after a few minutes he looked up cant be sure of any threat all he says is that he is interested in the matter and he would like to come to some sort of a compromise but he doesnt say what the matter is he could have been referring only to the seti statue said raoul possibly but my intuition says no knowing markoulis he would have been more direct if it only concerned the statue it had to be more hamdi must have threatened him if thats the case hamdi was no fool he was the ultimate fool said yvon hes dead markoulis had also been in correspondence with our murdered contact in beirut said raoul yvon looked up he had forgotten about markoulis connection with the beirut contact i think markoulis is where we should start we know he deals in egyptian antiquities see if you can get a call through to athens raoul lifted himself from the couch and gave the orders to the hotel operator after a minute he said telephone traffic is surprisingly light tonight or so the operator says there should be no trouble with the call for egypt that is a miracle good said yvon reaching out to shut his attaché case hamdi corresponded with every major museum in the world but markoulis is still a long shot the only real hope we have is erica baron and i dont see her being much help said raoul i have an idea said yvon lighting a cigarette erica did see the faces of two of the three men involved in the killing that might be so but i doubt if she could recognize them again true but i dont think it matters if the killers think she can im not following you said raoul would it be possible to let the cairo underworld know that erica baron watched the murder and can easily identify the killers ah said raoul his face reflecting sudden understanding i see what you are thinking using erica baron as a decoy to flush the killers into the open precisely theres no way the police are going to do anything about hamdi the department of antiquities wont do anything unless theyve heard of the seti statue so ahmed khazzan wont be involved hes the only official who could make it difficult for us theres one major problem said raoul seriously what is that asked yvon drawing on his cigarette its a very dangerous course it probably means signing a death warrant for mademoiselle erica baron im sure they will kill her could one protect her asked yvon remembering ericas narrow waist her warmth and her appealing earthiness probably if we used the right person are you thinking of khalifa i am hes trouble yes but hes the best if you want to protect the girl plus get the killers you need khalifa the real problem is that hes expensive very expensive that i dont mind i want and need that statue im certain it will be the fulcrum i need in fact at this point i believe its the only way ive been through all of abdul hamdis stuff that we have unfortunately there is almost nothing about the black market did you really think there would be it was a little too much to ask i admit from what hamdi said in his letter to me i thought it was possible but get khalifa i want him to start tailing erica baron in the morning also i think ill even spend some time with her myself im not sure shes told me everything raoul regarded yvon with a disbelieving smile okay said yvon you know me too well theres something i find very attractive about the woman athens pm reaching back over his shoulder stephanos markoulis flipped off the lamp the room was bathed in the soft blue glow of the moon that fell into the room through the french doors leading to the balcony athens is such a romantic city said deborah graham pulling away from stephanos embrace her eyes sparkled in the halflight she was intoxicated by the atmosphere as well as the bottle of demestica wine that lay empty on the nearby table her straight blond hair tumbled over her shoulders and with a coquettish twist of her head she pulled it behind her ears her blouse was unbuttoned and the whiteness of her breasts contrasted sharply with her deep mediterranean tan i agree said stephanos his large hand reached out to massage her breasts thats why i choose to live in athens athens is for lovers stephanos had heard the expression from another girl on another night and had said to himself at the time that he wanted to use the phrase himself stephanos shirt was also open but it was always open he had a broad chest covered with dark hair that served to set off his collection of solid gold chains and medallions stephanos was very eager to get deborah into his bed he had always found australian girls to be uncommonly easy and good lays a number of people had told him that in australia they acted very differently but he did not care he was content to ascribe his luck to the romantic atmosphere and his own prowess but mostly the latter thank you for inviting me here stephanos said deborah sincerely my pleasure said stephanos smiling would you mind if i went out on your balcony for a moment not at all said stephanos silently groaning at the delay holding her blouse together deborah bounced toward the french doors stephanos watched the undulating movement of her buttocks beneath her faded jeans he guessed she was about nineteen dont get lost out there he called stephanos this balcony is only three feet wide i see you pick up quickly on sarcasm said stephanos all at once he felt a flicker of doubt whether deborah was going to come through impatiently he lit a cigarette blowing the smoke forcefully toward the ceiling stephanos come out here and tell me what im looking at christ said stephanos to himself reluctantly he got up and joined her deborah was leaning as far out as possible pointing down ermon street is that constitution square i can just see thats right and thats the corner of the parthenon said deborah pointing in the opposite direction youve got it oh stephanos this is beautiful gazing up at him she put her arms around his neck and looked into his broad face she had been excited by his appearance from the first moment hed stopped her in the plaka he had deep laugh lines which gave his face character and a heavy beard that deborah thought enhanced his masculinity she was still a little afraid of having agreed to come to this strangers apartment yet there was something about being in athens and not sydney that made it all right besides the fear added to the mood and she was already incredibly excited what kind of work do you do stephanos she asked the delay increasing her anticipation does it matter im just interested but you dont have to tell me i own a travel agency aegean holidays and i do some smuggling on the side but mostly i chase women oh stephanos be serious i am i have a comfortable travel business but i also smuggle machine parts into egypt antiquities out but as i said i mostly chase women its the one thing i never get tired of deborah regarded stephanos dark eyes to her surprise the fact that he admitted to being a womanizer enhanced the forbidden exhilaration of the experience she threw herself against him stephanos was good at almost everything he did he could feel her inhibitions relax with a sense of satisfaction he lifted her and carried her into the apartment bypassing the living room he took her directly into the bedroom without resistance he removed her clothes she looked delicious totally naked in the blue room light stepping out of his own trousers stephanos bent down and kissed deborah gently on the lips she reached out wanting him to take her with shattering suddenness the phone next to the bed began to ring stephanos switched on the light to glance at the clock it was almost midnight something was wrong you answer it commanded stephanos deborah looked at him with surprise but quickly picked up the receiver she said hello in english and immediately tried to give the phone to stephanos saying it was an international call stephanos motioned for her to keep the phone and silently told her to find out who was calling deborah obediently listened asked who was calling and then put her hand over the phone its cairo a monsieur yvon julien de margeau stephanos snatched the phone his face reflecting a sudden change from seeming playfulness to calculation deborah shrank back covering her nakedness looking at his face now deborah realized shed made a mistake she tried to gather her clothes but stephanos was sitting on her jeans youre not going to convince me you just wanted to have a friendly conversation in the middle of the night said stephanos with uncamouflaged irritation youre right stephanos said yvon calmly i wanted to ask you about abdul hamdi do you know him of course i know the bastard what about him have you done any business with him thats a pretty personal question yvon what are you driving at hamdi was murdered today thats too bad said stephanos sarcastically but why would that concern me deborah was still trying to rescue her jeans gingerly she put one hand on his back and pulled with the other stephanos was aware of the distraction but not the purpose savagely he lashed out and hit her with the back of his hand knocking her off the other side of the bed with trembling hands she dressed in the clothes she had do you have any idea who killed hamdi asked yvon there are a lot of people who wanted that bastard dead said stephanos angrily myself included did he try to blackmail you listen de margeau i dont think i want to answer any of these questions i mean what is in all this for me im willing to trade you information i know something youd like to find out try me hamdi had a seti i statue like the one in houston stephanos face went bloodred jesus christ he shouted jumping to his feet oblivious of his own nakedness deborah saw her chance and retrieved her jeans finally dressed she cowered on the other side of the bed with her back to the wall how did he get a seti statue asked stephanos controlling his anger i have no idea said yvon has there been any official publicity asked stephanos none i happened on the scene immediately after the murder i got all of hamdis papers and correspondence including your last letter what are you going to do with it nothing for the moment was there anything about the black market in general was he trying some sort of grand exposé um so he did try to blackmail you said yvon triumphantly the answer is no there was no grand exposé did you kill him stephanos if i did do you honestly think id tell you de margeau be realistic just thought id ask actually we have a good lead the murder was seen at close range by an expert witness stephanos stopped by the doorway looking through the living room to the balcony thinking this witness can he identify the killers absolutely and he happens to be a very nicely endowed she who also happens to be an egyptologist her name is erica baron and shes at the hilton pushing the button to disconnect stephanos dialed a local number he tapped on the phone impatiently while the connection went through evangelos pack your bag were going to cairo in the morning he hung up before evangelos could respond shit he shouted to the night at that moment he caught sight of deborah for an instant he was bewildered having forgotten her presence get out of here he yelled deborah scrambled to her feet and rushed from the room freedom in greece appeared to be as dangerous and unpredictable as she had been told back home cairo midnight emerging from the smokefilled taverne cocktail lounge erica blinked in the bright light of the hilton lobby the experience with ahmed and the intimidating feeling of the huge government building had so unnerved her that she had decided to have a drink she had wanted to relax but going into the bar had not been a good idea she had been unable to enjoy her drink in peace several american architects had decided she was just the antidote to a boring evening no one had been willing to believe she wanted to be alone so shed finished her drink and left standing at the periphery of the lobby she could feel the physical effects of the scotch and she stopped for a moment to allow her equilibrium to return to normal unfortunately the alcohol had not affected her anxiety if anything it had increased it and the watchful eyes of the men in the bar had played on her incipient paranoia she wondered if she were being followed slowly she let her eyes roam around the grand foyer on one of the couches a european man was obviously looking at her over the tops of his reading glasses a bearded arab dressed in flowing white robes standing near a jewelry display case was also staring at her with unblinking coalblack eyes an enormous black who looked like idi amin smiled at her from in front of the registration desk erica shook her head she knew her exhaustion was getting the better of her if she were in boston wandering around alone at midnight she would be stared at she took a deep breath and headed for the bank of elevators when she reached her door erica vividly remembered the shock of seeing ahmed in her room her pulse quickened as she pushed open the door gingerly she switched on the light ahmeds chair was empty next she looked in the bathroom it too was empty doublelatching the door she noted an envelope on the floor of the foyer it was hilton stationery walking toward the balcony she opened the envelope and read that monsieur yvon julien de margeau had phoned and that she was to call back regardless of the hour below the message was a printed square followed by the word urgent breathing in the cool night air erica began to relax the spectacular view helped shed never been in the desert before and was astounded to see as many stars at the horizon as directly above immediately in front of her the broad black ribbon of the nile stretched out like the wet black pavement of a huge highway in the distance she could see illuminated the mysterious sphinx silently guarding the riddles of the past next to the mythical creature the fabled pyramids thrust their granular hulks skyward despite their antiquity their crisp geometry suggested something futuristic twisting the context of time around looking to the left erica could see the island of roda which looked like an ocean liner in the nile on its near tip she could see the lights of the hotel meridien and her thoughts returned to yvon she read the message again and wondered if yvon could possibly know about ahmeds visit she also pondered if she should tell him if he didnt already know but she felt a strong urge not to involve herself as far as the authorities were concerned and it seemed to her that telling yvon about ahmed could possibly do just that if there were something between ahmed and yvon it was their business yvon could handle it sitting on the edge of the bed erica asked to be connected with the meridien hotel suite with the receiver held between her head and shoulder erica removed her blouse the cool air felt good it took almost fifteen minutes to establish the connection and erica realized that the egyptian phones were atrocious as she had been warned hello it was raoul hello this is erica baron may i speak with yvon one moment there was a pause and erica removed her shoes there was a line of cairo dust across her instep good evening said yvon cheerfully hello yvon i got a message to call you it said urgent well i wanted to speak to you as soon as possible but there is no emergency i just had a wonderful evening tonight and i wanted to thank you thats very nice of you to say said erica slightly flustered as a matter of fact i thought you looked very beautiful tonight and i am very anxious to see you again you are asked erica before thinking absolutely in fact id be delighted to have breakfast with you in the morning they serve wonderful eggs here at the meridien thank you yvon said erica she had enjoyed yvons company but she had no intention of wasting her time in egypt on a flirtation she had come to see the objects of her years of study firsthand and she did not want to be distracted more important she still had not decided exactly what her responsibility was to the fabulous statue of seti i i can have raoul pick you up whenever you wish yvon said interrupting her thoughts thank you yvon but im exhausted i dont want to get up at a certain time i understand you could just call me when you wake up yvon i enjoyed myself tonight especially after this afternoon but i think i need some time to myself id like to sightsee a little id be glad to show you more of cairo said yvon persistently erica did not want to spend the day with yvon her interest in egypt was too personal to share yvon how about dinner again that would be the best for me dinner would have been included in the day but i understand erica dinner will be fine and i will look forward to it very much but lets set a time say nine oclock after a friendly goodbye erica hung up the phone she was surprised at yvons persistence she had not felt that she looked very good that evening she got up and looked at herself in the bedroom mirror she was twentyeight but some people thought she looked younger she noticed again the minute wrinkles that had miraculously appeared beside her eyes on her last birthday then she noticed a small pimple just forming on her skin damn she said as she tried to squeeze it it wouldnt squeeze erica looked at herself and wondered about men she wondered what it was that they really liked she removed her bra then her skirt waiting for the shower to run hot she stared at the bathroom mirror turning her head to the side she touched the slight bump on her nose and wondered if she should do something about it stepping back to get the whole effect she was reasonably pleased with her body although she thought she needed more exercise suddenly she felt very lonely she thought about the life she had willfully left in boston there were problems but maybe running away to egypt was not the answer she thought about richard with the shower running erica returned to the bedroom and looked at the telephone impulsively she put a call through to richard harvey and was disappointed when the operator told her it would be at least two hours maybe more erica complained and the operator said that she should be happy because the lines were not very busy usually it would take several days to call long distance from cairo it was easier to call into the city erica thanked her and hung up staring at the silent phone she felt a sudden rush of emotion she fought back undirected tears knowing she was too exhausted to think about anything more until she had some sleep cairo am ahmed watched the reflected lights forming patterns on the nile as his car crossed the july bridge to gezira island his driver kept leaning on the horn but ahmed no longer tried to interfere drivers in cairo believed continuous honking was as necessary as steering i will be ready at eight am said ahmed emerging from his car in front of his home on shari ismail muhammad in the district of zamalek the driver nodded made a quick uturn and disappeared into the night ahmeds steps were slow as he entered his empty cairo apartment he much preferred his small house by the nile in his native luxor in upper egypt and he went as often as possible but the burden of office as director of the antiquities service kept him in town more than he liked perhaps more than anyone ahmed was aware of the negative consequences of the huge bureaucracy egypt had created in order to encourage education every graduate of the university was guaranteed a job in the government consequently there were too many people with not enough to do insecurity in such a system was rampant and most individuals spent their time plotting ways of ensuring the perpetuation of their positions if it werent for the subsidy from saudi arabia the entire topheavy mess would crumble overnight such thoughts depressed ahmed who had sacrificed everything in order to rise to his present position he had set out to control the antiquities service and now that he did he had to face the gross inefficiencies of the department and so far his attempts at reorganization had met with fierce opposition he sat on his egyptian rococo couch and pulled some memoranda from his attaché case he read the titles revised security arrangements for the necropolis of luxor including valley of the kings and underground bombproof storage chambers for tutankhamen treasures he opened the first because that was the one he was particularly interested in he had recently totally reorganized the security for the necropolis of luxor it had been his first priority after reaching office ahmed read the first paragraph twice before he acknowledged that his mind was not on the subject he kept remembering erica barons exquisitely molded face he had been startled by her beauty when he first caught sight of her in her room it had been his plan to throw her off balance for the interrogation but it had been he who had been initially thrown there was a similarity not in appearance but in demeanor between erica and a woman ahmed had fallen in love with during his threeyear stay at harvard it had been ahmeds only real love affair and being reminded of it was painful the anguish hed felt when leaving for oxford still haunted him knowing he would never see her again made it the most difficult experience hed ever had and it had affected him greatly from that time he had avoided romance so that he could accomplish the goals his family had set for him leaning his head back against the wall ahmed allowed his memory to conjure up an image of pamela nelson the girl from radcliffe he could see her clearly through the mist of fourteen years instantly he remembered those moments of awakening on a sunday morning the cold of boston effectively screened out by their love he could remember how he enjoyed watching her sleep and how he would ever so carefully stroke her forehead and cheeks with his hand until she stirred and smiled ahmed heaved himself to his feet and walked into the kitchen he busied himself making tea trying to escape from the memories that erica had so effectively awakened it seemed like only yesterday that he had left for america his parents had taken him to the airport full of instructions and encouragement unaware of their sons fears the idea of america had been overwhelmingly exciting for a boy from upper egypt but boston had turned out to be just horribly lonely at least until hed met pamela then it had been enchanting basking in pamelas companionship he had hungrily devoured his studies finishing harvard in three years bringing the tea back into the living room ahmed returned to his rockhard couch the warm fluid soothed his tense stomach after careful thought he understood why erica baron reminded him of pamela nelson he had sensed in erica the same intelligence and personal generosity that pamela had used to veil her sensuous inner self it had been the hidden woman that ahmed had fallen in love with ahmed closed his eyes and remembered pamelas naked body he sat perfectly still the only sound was the ticking of the marble clock on the buffet suddenly he opened his eyes the official portrait of a smiling sadat erased the warm memories the present reasserted itself and ahmed sighed he then laughed at himself indulging in such memories was unusual for him he knew that his responsibilities in the department and within his family offered little room for such sentimental thoughts to get to his present position had been a struggle and now he was very close to his ultimate goal ahmed picked up the memorandum about the valley of the kings and again tried to read but his mind would not cooperate it kept wandering back to erica baron he thought of her transparency during the interrogation he knew that such responses were not weaknesses but rather evidence of sensitivity at the same time he was thoroughly convinced that erica knew nothing of importance suddenly ahmed remembered the words of the assistant who had originally reported that yvon de margeau had dined with erica hed said that de margeau had taken her to the casino de monte bello and that the setting looked very romantic ahmed stood up and paced the room he felt angry without knowing why what was de margeau doing in egypt was he going to buy more antiquities on his previous visits ahmed had not been able to keep him under adequate observation now there was possibly a way if ericas relationship with de margeau grew he could follow the man through erica he picked up the phone and called his second in command zaki riad and ordered him to have erica baron followed twentyfour hours a day starting in the morning he also told riad that he wanted the individual assigned to report directly to him i want to know where she goes and whom she meets everything cairo am it was an unfamiliar jangle that made erica sit bolt upright at first she had no idea where she was there was a sound of water and she was dressed only in her underpants the harsh metallic sound recurred and she realized she was in her hotel and that the phone was ringing the sound of water was the shower still running she had fallen asleep on top of the bedspread with all the lights blazing her mind was still foggy when she picked up the receiver the operator said that her call to america was ready after several distant sounds the phone went dead she shouted hello several times then shrugging her shoulders she hung up and went into the bathroom to turn off the shower a casual glance in the mirror unnerved her she looked terrible her eyes were red her lids puffy and the pimple on her chin had come to a head the phone rang again and she ran back to the bedroom to pick it up im so glad you called dear how was the trip richard sounded pleased on the other end terrible said erica terrible whats wrong richard was instantly alarmed are you all right im fine it just hasnt been what i expected said erica at once sensing richards overprotectiveness she decided that it probably had been a mistake to call him but having already committed herself she told him about the statue and the murder about her terror about yvon and then ahmed my god said richard obviously aghast erica i want you to come home immediately the next flight there was a pause erica did you hear me erica pushed her hair back richards command had a negative effect he was not in a position to give her orders no matter what his motivation im not ready to leave egypt she said evenly look erica youve made your point theres no need to drag it out especially if you are in danger im not in danger erica said flatly and what point are you referring to your independence i understand you dont have to continue your actingout richard i dont think you understand its not that simple im not actingout ancient egypt means a great deal to me ive dreamed of visiting the pyramids since i was a child im here because i want to be here well i think you are being foolish frankly i dont think this is a proper topic for a transatlantic call you keep forgetting that besides being a woman im an egyptologist ive spent eight years of my life studying for my degree and im vitally interested in what im doing its important to me erica could feel herself getting angry all over again more important than our relationship asked richard somewhere between being hurt and being angry as important as your medicine is to you medicine and egyptology are very different of course but what you forget is that people can approach egyptology with the same commitment that you apply to medicine but im not going to talk any more about this now and im not coming back to boston not yet then i will come over to egypt said richard magnanimously no said erica simply no thats what i saidno do not come to egypt please if you want to do something for me phone my boss dr herbert lowery and ask him to call me here as soon as possible apparently it is much easier to call into egypt than out id be happy to call lowery but are you sure you dont want me to join you asked richard amazed at the rebuff im sure said erica before saying goodbye and terminating the conversation when the phone rang again just after four am erica was not jolted as she had been earlier however she was afraid it was richard calling back and she let it ring several times deciding exactly what she would say but it wasnt richard it was dr herbert lowery erica are you all right im fine dr lowery just fine richard seemed very upset when he called about an hour ago he said you wanted me to call thats right dr lowery i can explain said erica sitting up to help herself wake up i wanted to talk to you about something astounding and i was told that it was easier to call into cairo than out did richard tell you anything about my first day here no he said youd had some trouble that was all trouble is hardly the word said erica she quickly sketched the events of the day for dr lowery then with as much detail as she could remember she described the seti i statue unbelievable said dr lowery when erica had finished actually i have seen the houston statue the man who bought it is indecently rich and he had both leonard from the met and me flown down to houston in his to authenticate it we both agreed it was the finest sculpture ever found in egypt i thought it probably came from abydos or luxor its condition was astounding it was hard to believe it had been buried for three thousand years anyway what you describe sounds like a mate did the houston statue have hieroglyphics cut into the base asked erica it did indeed said dr lowery it had some very typical religious exhortation but it also had a very curious bit of hieroglyphics at the base so did the one i saw added erica excitedly it was very difficult to translate said lowery but it said something like eternal peace granted to seti i who ruled after tutankhamen fantastic said erica the one i saw also had the names seti i and tutankhamen i was sure of it but its so weird i agree it doesnt make any sense for tutankhamens name to appear in fact leonard and i wondered about the authenticity of the statue when we saw that but there was no doubt it was real did you notice which of seti is names was used i think it was his name associated with the god osiris said erica wait i can tell you for sure erica suddenly remembered the scarab abdul hamdi had given her she ran over to the pants shed draped over a chair the scarab was still in the pocket yes it was his osiris name said erica i remembered it was the same as ive seen on a clever fake scarab anyway dr lowery could you possibly get a photo of the hieroglyphics on the houston statue and send it to me im sure i can i remember the man a jeffrey rice he will be extremely interested that there is another statue like his and i think hell be cooperative in exchange for the news it is a tragedy said erica that the statue could not be studied at the site it was found indeed said dr lowery thats the real problem with the black market the treasure hunters destroy so much information ive known about the black market but i never realized its true power said erica id really like to do something about it thats a wonderful goal but the stakes are high and as abdul hamdi learned too late it is a deadly game erica thanked dr lowery for calling and told him that she would soon be heading up to luxor to get to work on her translations dr lowery told her to be careful and to enjoy herself hanging up erica relished the feeling of excitement it made her remember why she had studied egypt in the first place settling herself back to sleep she felt all her initial enthusiasm for her trip return day cairo am cairo awakened early from the nearby villages the donkey carts laden with produce had begun their trek into the city before the eastern sky had even bleached from its nighttime blackness the sounds were those of the wooden wheels the jangle of the harness fittings and the bells of the lambs and goats trotting into market as the sun brightened the horizon the animal carts were joined by a medley of petroleumpowered vehicles bakeries stirred and the air was filled with the delicious aroma of baking bread by seven the taxis emerged like insects and the honking began people appeared on the streets and the temperature climbed having left her balcony door ajar erica was soon assaulted by the sounds of the traffic on the el tahrir bridge and on the broad boulevard korneish elnil that ran along the nile in front of the hilton rolling over she looked out at the pale blue of the morning sky she felt much better than she had expected glancing at her watch she was surprised she had not slept longer it wasnt even quite eight oclock erica pushed herself up to a sitting position the fake scarab was lying on the table next to the phone she picked it up and pressed it as if to test its reality after a nights rest the events of the previous day seemed like a dream ordering breakfast in her room erica began to plan her day she decided to visit the egyptian museum and view some of the old kingdom exhibits then head out to saqqara the necropolis of the old kingdom capital of mennofer she would avoid the usual tourist habit of rushing directly to the pyramids of giza breakfast was simple juice melon fresh croissants and honey and sweet arabic coffee it was served elegantly on her splendid balcony with the pyramids reflecting the sun in the distance and the nile silently slipping by erica experienced a sense of euphoria after pouring herself more coffee erica brought out her nagels guide to egypt and turned to the section on saqqara there was much too much to see in any one day and she intended to plan her itinerary carefully suddenly she remembered abdul hamdis guidebook it was still nestled deep within her canvas tote bag gingerly she opened the cover which was no longer securely attached and gazed at the name and address in the flyleaf nasif malmud shari el tahir it made her think of the cruel irony of abdul hamdis last words i travel a lot and might not be in cairo at the time you leave she shook her head realizing that the old man had been right turning to the section on saqqara she began to compare the older baedeker with the newer nagels overhead a black falcon hovered on the wind then plunged down on a rat scuttling through an alley nine floors below khalifa khalil reached over in his rented egyptian fiat and pressed the light button he waited patiently until it popped out leaning back he lit his cigarette with obvious pleasure inhaling deeply he was an angular and muscular man with a large hooked nose that seemed to pull his mouth into a perpetual sneer he moved with restrained grace like a jungle cat glancing up at the balcony of he could make out his quarry with his powerful field glasses he could see erica very well and allowed himself to enjoy the view of her legs very nice he thought congratulating himself on obtaining such a pleasurable assignment erica shifted her legs toward him and he grinned this gave him a distinctively startling appearance because one of his upper front incisors had been broken in such a way that it came to a sharp point in his customary black suit and black tie many people thought he looked like a vampire khalifa was an unusually successful soldier of fortune experiencing no problem with unemployment in the turbulent middle east he had been born in damascus and raised in an orphanage he had been trained as a commando in iraq but had been phased out because he could not work with a team he also lacked a conscience he was a sociopathic killer who could be controlled only by money khalifa laughed happily when he thought that he was being paid the same for babysitting a beautiful american tourist as for running ak assault rifles to the kurds in turkey scanning ericas neighboring balconies khalifa saw nothing suspicious his orders from the frenchman had been simple he was to protect erica baron from a possible murder attempt and catch the perpetrators swinging his binoculars away from the hilton he slowly scanned the people along the banks of the nile he knew it could be difficult to protect against a longdistance shot by a highpowered rifle no one looked suspicious by reflex his hand reassuringly patted the stechkin semiautomatic pistol holstered beneath his left arm it was his prized possession he had taken it from a kgb agent hed murdered in syria for the mossad turning back to erica khalifa had trouble believing someone would want to kill such a freshlooking girl she was like a peach ready for picking and he wondered if yvons motives were strictly business suddenly the girl stood up gathered her books and disappeared within her room khalifa lowered the glasses to view the hilton entrance there was the usual line of taxis and earlymorning activity gamal ibrahim struggled with the el ahram newspaper trying to fold over the first page he was sitting in the rear seat of a taxi hed hired for the day parked in the hilton driveway on the side opposite the entrance the doorman had complained but had relented when he saw gamals department of antiquities identification on the seat next to gamal was a blownup passport photo of erica baron each time a woman emerged from the hotel gamal would compare the face with the photo gamal himself was twentyeight he was a little more than fivefeetfour and slightly overweight married with two children aged one and three he had been hired by the department of antiquities just prior to receiving his doctorate in public administration from the university of cairo that spring he started work in midjuly but things had not gone as smoothly as he would have liked the staff in the department was so large that the only assignments he had been given were odd jobs such as this one following erica baron and reporting where she went gamal picked up ericas photo as two women emerged and entered a taxi gamal had never followed anyone and he felt the job demeaning but he was in no position to refuse especially since he was to report directly to ahmed khazzan the director gamal had lots of ideas for the department and felt that now he might have a chance to be heard dressing sensibly for the heat she expected at saqqara erica put on a light beige cotton blouse with short sleeves and cotton pants of a slightly darker shade cut full with a drawstring waist in her tote bag she deposited her polaroid her flashlight and the baedeker guidebook after careful comparison she had agreed with abdul hamdi the baedeker was far better than nagels at the front desk she was able to retrieve her passport which apparently had been duly recorded she was also introduced to her guide for the day anwar selim erica did not want a guide but the hotel had suggested it and after being tormented by hecklers the day before she had finally relented agreeing to pay seven egyptian pounds for the guide and ten for the taxi and driver anwar selim was a gaunt man in his middle forties who wore a metal pin with the number on the lapel of his gray suit proving he was a governmentlicensed guide i have a wonderful itinerary said selim who had an affectation of smiling in the middle of his sentences first we will visit the great pyramid in the coolness of the morning then thank you said erica interrupting she backed away selims teeth were in sorry shape and his breath was capable of stopping a charging rhinoceros i have already planned the day i want to go to the egyptian museum first for a short visit then go on to saqqara but saqqara will be hot in the middle of the day protested selim his mouth was set in a hardened smile the skin of his face taut from continuous exposure to egyptian sun im sure it will be announced erica trying to cut off this dialogue but it is the itinerary i would like to follow without altering his facial expression selim opened the door of the battered taxi that had been retained for her the driver was young with a threeday stubble on his face as they pulled away for the short hop to the museum khalifa put his field glasses on the floor of the car he allowed ericas taxi to pull out into the street before he started his engine wondering if there was some way he could get some information about the guide and the taxi driver as he put his car into gear he noted another taxi pull out from the hilton directly behind ericas both cars turned right at the first intersection gamal had recognized erica when she had appeared without having to refer to the photo hastily he had written the guides number in the margin of his newspaper before telling his driver to follow ericas taxi when they reached the egyptian museum selim helped erica out of the car and the taxi proceeded to the shade of a sycamore to wait gamal had his driver stop under a nearby tree that afforded a view of ericas taxi opening his newspaper he went back to a long article on sadats proposals for the west bank khalifa parked outside the museum compound and purposely walked past gamals taxi to see if he recognized the man he did not for khalifa gamals movements were already suspicious but following orders he entered the museum behind erica and her guide erica had walked into the famed museum with great enthusiasm but even her knowledge and interest could not overcome the oppressive atmosphere the priceless objects looked as outofplace in the dusty rooms as they did in the boston museum on huntington avenue the mysterious statues and stony faces had the look of death not immortality the guards were dressed in white uniforms and black berets reminiscent of the colonial era sweepers with thatched brooms pushed the dust from room to room without ever carrying it away the only workers who were really busy were the repairmen who stood in small ropedoff areas plastering or doing simple carpentry with tools similar to those pictured in the ancient egyptian murals erica tried to ignore the surroundings and concentrate on the morerenowned pieces in room she was astounded at the lifelike quality of the limestone statues of rahotep brother of khufu and nofritis his wife they had a serene contemporary look erica was content to merely gaze at the faces but her guide felt compelled to offer the full benefit of his knowledge he told erica what rahotep had said to khufu when he had first seen the statue erica knew it was pure fiction politely she told selim to only answer her questions and that she was actually familiar with most of the objects as erica rounded the rahotep statue her eyes wandered across the entranceway of the gallery before returning to the back of the statue an image of a dark man with a tooth that looked like a fang hovered in her mind but when she turned again there was no figure in the doorway it had happened so quickly that it gave her an uneasy feeling the events of the previous day made her wary and as she walked around the rahotep statue she looked at the doorway several times but the dark figure did not reappear instead a very noisy group of french tourists entered the room motioning for selim to leave erica stepped from room into the long gallery that ran along the whole western edge of the building the corridor was empty of people but as she looked through a double arch to the northwest corner erica again saw a fleeting dark figure with selim trying to get her to view various famous objects along the way erica quickly walked down the long gallery toward the spot where it intersected a similar gallery on the north side of the museum exasperated selim doggedly followed the fastpaced american who seemed to want to view the museum at the speed of light she stopped abruptly just short of the intersection selim halted behind her gazing around to see what could have caught her attention she was standing next to a statue of senmut steward of queen hatshepsut but rather than studying it she was carefully looking around the corner into the north gallery if there is something in particular youd like to see said selim please erica angrily motioned for selim to be still stepping out into the middle of the gallery erica searched for the dark figure she saw nothing and felt a little foolish a german couple walked by arm in arm arguing over the floor plan of the museum miss baron said selim obviously struggling to be patient i am very familiar with this museum if there is something youd like to see just ask erica took pity on the man and tried to think of something to ask him so hed feel more useful are there any seti i artifacts in the museum selim put his index finger on his nose thinking then without speaking he lifted the finger in the air and motioned for erica to follow he led her up to the second floor to room over the entrance foyer he stood beside a large piece of exquisitely carved quartzite labeled the lid to seti is sarcophagus he said proudly erica looked at the piece of stone mentally comparing it with the fabulous statue shed seen the day before it wasnt much of a comparison she also remembered that seti is sarcophagus itself had been pirated off to london and rested in a small museum there it was painfully obvious how much the black market shortchanged the egyptian museum selim waited until erica looked up he then pulled her by the hand to the entrance of another room directing her to pay the guard at the door another fifteen plasters so that they could enter once in the room selim navigated between the long low glass cases until he reached one by the wall the mummy of seti i said selim smugly looking down at the driedup face erica felt a little sick it was the kind of image hollywood makeup artists strove to imitate for countless horror movies and she noticed that the ears had fragmented and that the head was no longer attached to the torso instead of ensuring immortality the remains suggested that the horror of death was permanent glancing around at the other royal mummies contained within the room erica thought that instead of making ancient egypt come alive the petrified bodies emphasized the enormous time that had elapsed and the remoteness of ancient egypt she looked back at the face of seti i it looked nothing like the beautiful statue shed seen the day before there was no resemblance whatsoever the statue had had a narrow jaw with a straight nose whereas the mummy had a very wide jaw and a hawklike hooked nose it gave her the creeps and she shivered before turning away motioning to selim to follow she walked out of the room eager to be leaving the dusty museum for the field ericas taxi whisked her out into the egyptian countryside leaving the confusion of cairo behind they drove south on the west bank of the nile selim had tried to continue conversation by telling erica what ramses ii had said to moses but had finally fallen silent erica did not want to hurt selims feelings and had tried to ask him about his family but the guide did not seem to want to talk about that so they drove in silence leaving erica at peace to enjoy the view she loved the color contrast between the sapphire blue of the nile and the brilliant green of the irrigated fields it was time for the date harvest and they passed donkey loads of palm branches festooned with the red fruit opposite the industrial city of hilwan which was on the east side of the nile the asphalt road forked ericas taxi careened to the right its horn honking several times despite the fact that the road ahead was clear gamal was only five or six car lengths behind he was literally on the edge of his seat making small talk with his driver he had removed his gray suit jacket in deference to the heat which he knew was only going to get worse almost a quarter of a mile back khalifa had his radio blaring and the discordant music filled the car he was now convinced that erica was already being followed but the method was peculiar the taxi was much too close at the museum entrance he had gotten a good look at the occupant who appeared to be a university student but khalifa had dealt with student terrorists he knew that their simple appearance was often a cover for ruthlessness and daring ericas taxi entered a grove of palms that grew so close together it gave the appearance of a coniferous forest a cool shade replaced the stark sunlight they came to a halt at a small brick village on one side was a miniature mosque on the other was an open area with an eightyton alabaster sphinx lots of pieces of broken statuary and a huge fallen limestone statue of ramses ii at the edge of the clearing was a small refreshment stand called the sphinx café the fabled city of memphis said selim solemnly you mean mennofer said erica looking out at the meager remains memphis was the greek name mennofer was the ancient egyptian name id like to buy us all a coffee or a tea said erica seeing shed hurt his feelings walking to the refreshment stand erica was glad she had been prepared for pitiful remains of this oncemighty capital of ancient egypt because otherwise she would have been very disappointed a large group of ragged young boys approached with their collections of fake antiquities but were effectively driven off by selim and the taxi driver they mounted a small veranda with round metal tables and ordered drinks the men had coffee erica ordered orangina perspiration running down his face gamal got out of his taxi clutching his el ahram although he had been initially indecisive he finally convinced himself he needed a drink avoiding looking at ericas group he took a table near the kiosk after obtaining a coffee he disappeared behind his newspaper khalifa kept his telescopic sight on gamals chubby torso but he allowed the fingers of his right hand to relax he had stopped seventyfive yards short of the memphis clearing and had quickly unsheathed his israeli fn snipers rifle he was sitting low in the back seat of his car with the rifle barrel resting on the open drivers window from the moment gamal had emerged from his car khalifa had had him squarely in his sights if gamal had made any sudden movement toward erica khalifa would have shot him in the ass it wouldnt have killed him but as khalifa told himself it would have slowed him down considerably erica did not enjoy her drink because of the swarm of flies that inhabited the veranda they were not deflected by a waving hand and on several occasions they had actually landed on her lips she got up told the men not to hurry and wandered in the clearing before getting back in the taxi erica stopped to admire the alabaster sphinx she wondered what kind of mysteries it would tell if it could talk it was very ancient it had been made during the old kingdom back in the car they drove on through the dense palm forest until it thinned cultivated fields reappeared along with irrigation canals choked with algae and water plants suddenly the step pyramid of pharaoh zoser reared its familiar profile above a row of palms erica felt a thrill of excitement she was about to visit the oldest stone structure built by man and for egyptologists the most important site in egypt here the famed architect imhotep had built a celestial stairway of six enormous steps rising to a height of about two hundred feet inaugurating the pyramid age erica felt like an impatient child on her way to the circus she hated the delay of bouncing through a small mudbrick village before crossing a large irrigation canal just beyond the bridge the cultivated land stopped and the arid libyan desert began there was no transition it was like going from noon to midnight without a sunset suddenly on either side of the road erica saw only sand and rock and shimmering heat as the taxi came to a halt in the shade of a large tour bus erica was the first one out selim had to run to keep up with her the driver opened all four doors of his small car to encourage ventilation while he waited khalifa was becoming more and more confused about gamals behavior ignoring erica the man had taken his newspaper into the shade of the pyramids enclosure wall he had not even bothered to follow erica inside khalifa deliberated for a few minutes wondering what would be best for him to do thinking that gamals presence could possibly be some sort of clever ruse he elected to stick close to erica he removed his jacket and shifted his stechkin semiautomatic to his right hand with his jacket draped over it for the next hour erica was intoxicated by the ruins this was the egypt she had dreamed about her knowledge was capable of translating the debris of the necropolis into the prodigious achievement that it had been five thousand years previously she knew she could not see everything in one day and was content to touch the highlights and enjoy the unexpected like the cobra reliefs shed never read about selim finally accepted his role and stayed mostly in the shade he was pleased however when erica motioned about noon that she was ready to move on there is a small caférest house here said selim hopefully im very excited to see some of the nobles tombs said erica she was too excited to stop the rest house is right next to the mastaba of ti and the serapeum said selim ericas eyes brightened the serapeum was one of the most unusual ancient egyptian monuments within the catacombs the mummified remains of apis bulls had been interred with pomp and circumstance befitting kings it had been with enormous effort that the serapeum had been dug by hand into the solid rock erica could understand the effort devoted to construction of human tombs but not for the bulls she was convinced that there was a mystery associated with the tomb of the apis bulls that had yet to be unraveled im ready for the serapeum she said with a smile being overweight gamal did not fare well in the heat rarely even in cairo did he wander outside at midday saqqara at noon was almost beyond his capabilities as his driver followed ericas taxi he tried to think of ways to survive perhaps he could find some shade and have the driver follow erica until she was ready to return to cairo ahead ericas taxi pulled up and parked at the saqqara rest house looking around gamal remembered that when hed visited the area as a child with his parents he had walked through a scary dark subterranean cave for bulls although the cave had frightened him he still remembered that it had been deliciously cool isnt this the site of the serapeum he asked touching his drivers shoulder right over there said the driver pointing toward the beginning of a trench that served as an access ramp gamal looked over at erica who had gotten out of her car and was examining the row of sphinxes leading toward the ramp all at once gamal knew how hed cool off besides he thought it would be fun to see the serapeum again after so many years khalifa was not happy and he ran his hand nervously through his greasy hair hed decided that gamal was not the amateur he pretended to be he was far too nonchalant if he had only been sure of the boys ultimate intention he would have shot and delivered him alive to yvon de margeau but he had to wait for gamal to make a move the situation was more complicated and more dangerous than he had anticipated khalifa screwed the silencer on the barrel of his automatic and was about to get out of the car when he saw gamal entering a trench leading to a subterranean opening he consulted a map it was the serapeum looking back at erica happily photographing a limestone sphinx khalifa knew there was only one reason why gamal would enter the serapeum first in one of the dark vaulted galleries or in one of the narrow passageways gamal was going to wait like a poisonous snake and strike when least expected the serapeum was a perfect assassination spot despite his many years of experience khalifa was unsure of what to do he too could enter before erica baron and try to find gamals hiding place but that could be too risky he decided he had to enter with erica and strike first erica walked down the ramp approaching the entrance she was not fond of caves and in truth did not care for closed spaces even before stepping into the serapeum she could feel the damp coolness and a tingling sensation announced the appearance of gooseflesh on her thighs she had to force herself forward a bedraggled arab with a face like a hatchet took her money the serapeum had an ominous feel once inside the gloomy entrance gallery erica could sense the mysterious grip that aspects of ancient egyptian culture had exerted on people through the ages the darkened passageways looked like tunnels to the netherworld suggesting the eerie power of the occult following selim she walked deeper and deeper into the bizarre environment they went down an unendingly long corridor with irregular and roughhewn walls meagerly illuminated by infrequent lowwattage light bulbs in the areas between the lights dark shadows made vision difficult other tourists had a way of suddenly emerging out of the gloom voices sounded hollow and echoed repeatedly at right angles to the main corridor were separate galleries each containing a mammoth black sarcophagus covered with hieroglyphics very few of the side galleries were illuminated erica quickly felt she had seen enough but selim was insistent saying that the best sarcophagus was at the far end and that a wooden stairway had been built so she could even see the carvings inside reluctantly erica continued behind selim finally they reached the gallery in question and selim stepped aside for erica to pass she reached out to grasp the wooden handrail leading to the viewing platform khalifa was a bundle of raw nerves following close behind erica he had released the safety catch on his semiautomatic and again held it in his right hand beneath his jacket hed come within a hairbreadth of shooting several tourists when they had suddenly appeared out of the darkness as he rounded the corner of the last gallery he was only fifteen feet behind erica the moment he saw gamal he acted by reflex erica was climbing the short wooden stairway built along the side of the highly polished granite sarcophagus gamal was on top of the platform looking down at erica as she climbed he had stepped back from the edge unfortunately for khalifa she was directly between him and gamal shielding his view and making a quick shot impossible in a panic khalifa surged forward thrusting selim to the side he charged up the short stairway knocking erica down on her knees sending her sprawling toward the surprised gamal spurts of fiery light leaped from khalifas covered pistol and the deadly slugs tore into gamals chest piercing his heart his hands started to rise his small features twisted in pain and confusion as he teetered and fell forward on top of erica khalifa vaulted over the wooden banister pulling his knife from his belt selim screamed before trying to run the tourists on the platform still had not comprehended what had happened khalifa dashed across the corridor toward the electric wires responsible for the primitive lights gritting his teeth against a possible shock he sliced through the wire plunging the entire serapeum into utter darkness cairo pm stephanos markoulis ordered another scotch for himself and evangelos papparis both men were dressed in opennecked knit shirts and were sitting in a corner booth of the la parisienne lounge in the meridien hotel stephanos was in a sour nervous mood and evangelos knew his boss well enough to keep still goddamned frenchman said stephanos looking at his watch he said hed be right down and its been twenty minutes evangelos shrugged he didnt say anything because he knew no matter what he said it would only inflame stephanos further instead he reached down and adjusted the small pistol strapped to his leg just within the top of his right boot evangelos was a brawny man with oversized features particularly his brows which made him look a little like a neanderthal except that his head was completely bald just then yvon de margeau appeared in the doorway carrying his attaché case he was dressed in a blue blazer with an ascot and was followed by raoul the two men surveyed the room these rich guys always look like theyre on their way to a polo match said stephanos sarcastically he waved to catch yvons attention evangelos shifted the table slightly to give his right hand free range of motion yvon saw them and walked over he shook hands with stephanos and introduced raoul before sitting down how was your flight asked yvon with restrained cordiality as soon as they had ordered terrible said stephanos where are the old mans papers you dont spare words stephanos said yvon with a smile perhaps it is best in any case i want to know if you killed abdul hamdi if i had killed hamdi do you think id come down here to this hellhole said stephanos with scorn he despised men like yvon who had never had to work a day in their lives believing that silence could be useful with a person like stephanos yvon made a big production out of opening a new pack of gauloises he offered them around but evangelos was the only taker he reached for the cigarette but yvon teased him by keeping the cigarettes just out of his grasp so that he could make out the tattoo on evangelos hairy muscular forearm it was a hula dancer with the word hawaii just below it finally letting evangelos take a cigarette yvon asked do you go to hawaii frequently i worked the freighters when i was a kid said evangelos he lit the gauloise from a small candle on the table and sat back yvon turned to stephanos whose impatience was showing with careful movements yvon lit his cigarette with his gold lighter before speaking no said yvon no i dont think youd come to cairo if youd killed hamdi unless you were worried about something unless something went wrong but to tell you the truth stephanos i dont know what to believe you did come here very quickly thats a little suspicious besides i have learned that hamdis killers were not from cairo ah snapped stephanos exasperated let me see if i get this right you learn the killers werent from cairo from that information you decide that they obviously have to be from athens is that your reasoning stephanos turned toward raoul how can you work for this man he tapped his forehead with his index finger raouls dark eyes did not blink his hands rested on his knees he was prepared to move in a fraction of a second im sorry to disappoint you yvon said stephanos but youll have to look elsewhere for hamdis killer it wasnt me too bad said yvon it would have answered a lot of questions do you have any thoughts as to who might have done it i havent the slightest idea said stephanos but i have a feeling that hamdi made himself a number of enemies how about letting me see hamdis papers yvon lifted his attaché case to the top of the table and put his finger on the latch he paused one other question do you have any idea where the seti i statue is unfortunately no said stephanos looking hungrily at the case i want that statue said yvon if i hear anything about it i will let you know said stephanos you never gave me a chance to see the houston statue said yvon watching stephanos carefully looking up from the case stephanos face gave a hint of surprise what makes you think i was involved with the houston statue lets just say i know said yvon did you learn that from hamdis papers asked stephanos angrily instead of answering yvon flipped the latch of his case and dumped hamdis correspondence onto the table leaning back he casually sipped his pernod as stephanos quickly shuffled through the letters he found his own to abdul hamdi and put it aside is this all he asked that was all we found answered yvon turning his attention back to the group did you search the place well asked stephanos yvon glanced over at raoul who nodded affirmatively very well said raoul there has to have been more said stephanos i cannot imagine the old bastard was bluffing he said he wanted five thousand dollars in cash or he was going to turn the papers over to the authorities stephanos went through the papers again more slowly if you had to guess what would you think happened to the seti statue asked yvon taking another drink of pernod i dont know said stephanos without looking up from a letter addressed to hamdi from a dealer in los angeles but if its any help i can assure you its still here in egypt an awkward silence prevailed stephanos was busy reading raoul and evangelos glared at each other over their drinks yvon looked out the window he too thought the seti statue was still in egypt from where he was sitting he could see the pool area beyond which was the expanse of the nile in the middle of the river the nile fountain was operating sending a stream of water straight into the air multiple miniature rainbows appeared along the sides of the enormous jet of water yvon thought about erica baron and hoped that khalifa khalil was as good as raoul said he was if stephanos had killed hamdi and made a move against erica khalifa was going to earn his pay what about this american woman said stephanos seemingly reading yvons thoughts i want to see her shes staying at the hilton said yvon but shes a bit edgy about the whole affair so treat her gently shes the only connection i have with the seti statue the statue is not my current interest said stephanos pushing the correspondence away but i want to talk to her and i promise ill be my usual tactful self tell me have you learned anything at all about this abdul hamdi not much he was originally from luxor he came to cairo a few months ago to establish a new antiquities shop he had a son who still has an antique business in luxor have you visited this son asked stephanos no said yvon rising hed had enough of stephanos remember to tell me if you learn anything about the statue i can afford it with a slight smile yvon turned raoul stood up and followed do you believe him asked raoul when they were outside i dont know what to think said yvon continuing to walk whether i believe him is one question whether i trust him is another he is the biggest opportunist ive ever met bar none i want khalifa to be briefed that he must be extremely careful when stephanos meets with erica if he tries to hurt her i want him shot saqqara village pm there was one fly in the room that repeatedly flew an erratic course between the two windows it sounded noisy in the otherwise still enclosure especially when it slammed against the glass erica looked around the chamber the walls and ceiling were whitewashed the only decoration was a smiling poster of anwar sadat the single wooden door was closed erica was sitting in a straightbacked chair above her was a light bulb suspended from the ceiling by a frayed black wire near the door was a small metal table and another chair like the one she was sitting on erica looked a mess her pants were torn at the right knee with an abrasion beneath a large stain of dried blood covered the back of her beige blouse holding out her hand she tried to judge whether her trembling was lessening it was hard to say at one point she had thought she was going to throw up but the nausea had passed now she felt intermittent waves of dizziness which she was able to disperse by closing her eyes tightly there was no doubt she was still in a state of shock but she was beginning to think more clearly she knew for example that she had been taken to a police station in the village of saqqara erica rubbed her hands together noticing that they became moist as she remembered the events in the serapeum when gamal first fell on her she had thought she was trapped in a cavein she had made frantic attempts to free herself but it had been impossible because of the narrow confines of the wooden stairway besides the blackness had been so complete she hadnt even been sure she had her eyes open and then she had felt the warm sticky fluid on her back only later did she find out it had been blood from the dying man on top of her erica shook herself past another bout of nausea and looked up as the door opened the same man who earlier had taken thirty minutes to fill out some sort of government form with a broken pencil reappeared he spoke little english but elaborately motioned erica to follow him the aged pistol holstered at his belt did not reassure her she had already experienced the bureaucratic chaos yvon had feared obviously she was being considered a suspect rather than an innocent victim from the moment the authorities had arrived on the scene pandemonium had reigned at one point two policemen had had such an argument over some piece of evidence that they had almost come to blows ericas passport had been taken and she had been driven to saqqara in a locked van that was as hot as an oven she had asked on numerous occasions if she could call the american consulate but had received only shrugs in return as the men continued to argue over what to do with her now erica followed the man with the old gun through the dilapidated police station out to the street the same van that had driven her from the serapeum to the village was waiting its engine idling erica tried to ask for her passport but instead of answering the man hurried her inside the truck the door was closed and locked anwar selim was already crouched on the wooden seat erica had not seen him since the catastrophe in the serapeum and was so pleased to find him again she almost threw her arms around him begging him to tell her everything was going to be all right but as she moved into the van he glowered at her and turned his head i knew you were going to be trouble he said without looking at her me trouble she noticed he was handcuffed and shrank back the van lurched forward and both passengers had to steady themselves erica felt perspiration run down her back you acted strangely from the first moment said selim especially in the museum you were planning something and im going to tell them i began erica but she did not continue fear clouded her brain she should have reported hamdis murder selim looked at her and spit on the floor of the van cairo pm when erica got out of the van she recognized the corner of el tahrir square she knew she was close to the hilton and she wished she could go back to her room to make some calls and find help seeing selim in shackles had increased her anxiety and she wondered if she were under arrest she and selim were hurried inside the general security police building which was jammed with people then they were separated erica was fingerprinted photographed and finally escorted to a windowless room her escort smartly saluted an arab reading a dossier at a plain wooden table without looking up he waved his right hand and ericas escort departed closing the door quietly erica remained standing there was silence except when the man turned a page the fluorescent lights made his bald head shine like a polished apple his lips were thin and moved slightly as he read he was impeccably attired in a white martial uniform with a high collar a black leather strap ran through the epaulet on the left shoulder and was attached to a broader black leather belt that supported a holstered automatic pistol the man turned to the last page and erica caught sight of an american passport clipped to the dossier and hoped that she would be speaking to someone reasonable please sit down miss baron said the policeman still without looking up his voice was crisp emotionless he had a mustache trimmed to a knifelike line his long nose curled under at the tip quickly erica sat in the wooden chair facing the table beneath it she could see next to the policemans polished boots her canvas tote bag shed been worried that shed seen the last of it the policeman put down the dossier then picked up the passport he opened it to the photo of erica and his eyes traveled back and forth between her and the photo several times he then reached out and put the passport on the table next to the telephone i am lieutenant iskander said the policeman clasping his hands together on the table he paused looking intently at erica what happened in the serapeum i dont know stammered erica i was walking up some stairs to view a sarcophagus and then i was knocked down from behind then someone fell on top of me and the lights went out did you see who it was that knocked you down he spoke with a slight english accent no said erica it all happened so quickly the victim was shot didnt you hear shots no not really i heard several sounds like someone beating a rug but no shots lieutenant iskander nodded and wrote something in the dossier then what happened i could not get out from beneath the man who fell on me said erica remembering again the feeling of terror there were some shouts i think but im not really sure i do remember that someone brought candles they helped me up and someone said the man was dead is that all the guards arrived then the police did you look at the man who was shot sort of i had trouble looking at him had you ever seen him before no said erica reaching down and lifting the tote bag iskander pushed it over to erica see if anything is missing erica checked the bag camera guidebook walletall seemed to be untouched she counted her money and checked her travelers checks everything seems to be here then you werent robbed no said erica i suppose not you are trained as an egyptologist is that correct asked lieutenant iskander yes said erica does it surprise you to know that the man who was killed worked for the department of antiquities glancing away from iskanders cold eyes erica looked down at her hands realizing for the first time that they had been busy working at each other she held them still thinking although she felt the urge to answer iskanders questions rapidly she knew that the question hed just asked her was important perhaps the most important of the interview it reminded her of ahmed khazzan hed said he was director of the department of antiquities maybe he could help im not sure how to answer she said finally it doesnt surprise me the man worked for the department of antiquities he could have been anyone i certainly did not know him why did you visit the serapeum asked lieutenant iskander remembering selims accusing comments in the van erica thought carefully about her answer the guide id hired for the day suggested it said erica opening the dossier lieutenant iskander again wrote may i ask a question asked erica in an uncertain voice certainly do you know ahmed khazzan of course said lieutenant iskander do you know mr khazzan yes and id like very much to speak with him said erica lieutenant iskander reached out and picked up the phone he watched erica as he dialed he did not smile cairo pm the walk seemed endless corridors stretched in front of her until perspective reduced them to pinpoints and they were jammed with people egyptians wearing everything from silk suits to ragged galabias were lined up in front of doors or spilling out of offices some were sleeping on the floor so that erica and her escort had to step over them the air was heavy with cigarette smoke garlic and the greasy smell of lamb when erica reached the outer office of the department of antiquities she remembered the multitude of desks and antique typewriters from the night before the difference was that now they were occupied with ostensibly busy civil servants after a short wait erica was shown into the inner office it was airconditioned and the coolness was a welcome relief ahmed was standing behind the desk peering out the window a corner of the nile could be seen between the hilton and the skeleton of the new intercontinental hotel he turned when erica entered she had been prepared to pour out her problems like an overflowing river and plead with ahmed to help her but something in his expression made her hold back there was a sadness about his face his eyes were veiled and his thick dark hair was disheveled as if he had been repeatedly running his fingers over his scalp are you all right asked erica genuinely concerned yes said ahmed slowly his voice was hesitant depressed i never imagined what the strain of running this department was going to be like he flopped down in his chair eyes momentarily closed before erica had only guessed at his sensitivity now she wanted to walk around the desk and comfort the man ahmeds eyes opened im sorry he said please sit down erica complied ive been briefed about what happened at the serapeum but id like to hear the story in your own words erica began at the beginning wanting to tell everything she even mentioned the man in the museum who had made her nervous ahmed listened intently he did not interrupt only after she stopped did he speak the man who was shot was named gamal ibrahim and he worked here at the department of antiquities he was a fine boy ahmeds eyes glistened with tears seeing such an obviously strong man so moved unlike the american men she knew made erica forget her own troubles this ability to reveal emotion was a powerfully attractive quality ahmed looked down and composed himself before he continued had you seen gamal at all during the morning i dont believe so said erica but not convincingly there is a chance i saw him at a refreshment stand in memphis but im not sure ahmed ran his fingers through his thick hair tell me he said gamal was already upon the wooden platform in the serapeum when you started up the stairs thats right said erica i find that curious said ahmed why questioned erica ahmed looked slightly flustered im just thinking he said evasively nothing makes sense i feel the same way mr khazzan and i want to assure you that i had nothing to do with the affair nothing and i think i should be able to call the american embassy you may call the american embassy said ahmed but frankly there is no need to do so i think i need some help miss baron im sorry you were inconvenienced today but actually this is our problem you can call whomever youd like when you get back to your hotel im not going to be detained here asked erica almost afraid to believe what she was hearing of course not said ahmed that is good news said erica but there is one other thing i must tell you about i should have told you last night but i was afraid anyway she breathed in deeply ive had two very strange and upsetting days im not sure which was worse yesterday afternoon i inadvertently witnessed another murder incredible as it may sound erica involuntarily shivered i happened to see an old man by the name of abdul hamdi killed by three men and ahmeds chair thudded to the floor he had been leaning back did you actually see the faces his surprise and concern were apparent two of them yes the third no said erica could you identify those whom you did see asked ahmed possibly im not sure but i do want to apologize about not telling you last night i really was afraid i understand said ahmed dont worry i will take care of that but undoubtedly we will have more questions more questions said erica forlornly actually i would like to leave egypt as soon as possible this trip is nothing like id planned im sorry miss baron said ahmed regaining the composure erica remembered from the night before under the circumstances you will not be allowed to leave until these issues are cleared up or we are sure you cannot contribute any more i really am sorry that you have become involved like this but you may feel free to move about as much as youd likejust let me know if you plan to leave cairo again you should feel free to discuss the problem with the american embassy but remember they have little say over our internal affairs being detained within the country is far better than being in jail said erica smiling weakly how long do you think it will be before i will be allowed to leave its hard to say perhaps a week although it might be difficult i suggest that you try to regard your experiences here as unfortunate coincidences i think you should try to enjoy egypt ahmed toyed with his pencils before continuing as a representative of the government id like to offer you dinner tonight and show you that egypt can be very pleasurable thank you said erica genuinely moved by ahmeds concern but im afraid i already have plans with yvon de margeau oh i see said ahmed looking away well please accept my apologies from my government i will have you driven to your hotel and i promise i will be in touch he stood up and shook hands with erica across his desk his grip was pleasantly strong and firm erica walked from the room surprised that the conversation had ended so abruptly and stunned to be free as soon as she left ahmed summoned zaki riad the assistant director to his office riad had fifteen years seniority in the department but had been passed over during ahmeds meteoric rise to director although he was an intelligent quickwitted man his physical type was the exact opposite of ahmeds he was obese with bloated features and his hair was as dark and tightly curled as a karakul lambs ahmed had walked to the giant map of egypt turning when his assistant had seated himself what do you make of all this zaki i havent the slightest idea answered zaki wiping his brow which sweated despite the air conditioning he enjoyed seeing ahmed under pressure i cannot for the life of me figure out why gamal was shot said ahmed slamming his fist against his open palm god a young man with children do you think his death had anything to do with the fact he was following erica baron i cannot see how said zaki but i guess theres always a chance the last comment was intended to sting zaki stuck an unlit pipe in his mouth mindless of the ashes that drifted down onto his chest ahmed covered his eyes with his hand and massaged his scalp then slowly he let his hand slide down his face to stroke his luxuriant mustache it just doesnt make sense he turned and looked at the large map i wonder if there is something going on in saqqara maybe some new tombs have been illicitly discovered he walked back and sat down behind his desk more disturbing the immigration authorities notified me that stephanos markoulis arrived in cairo today as you know he does not come here often ahmed leaned forward looking directly at zaki riad tell me what have the police reported about abdul hamdi very little said zaki apparently he was robbed the police were able to learn that the old man had recently experienced a marked change in fortune moving his antique business from luxor to cairo at the same time hed been able to purchase more valuable pieces he must have had some money so he was robbed any idea where his money came from asked ahmed no but there is someone who might the old man does have a son in the antique business in luxor have the police spoken to the son asked ahmed not that i know of said zaki that would be too logical for the police actually theyre not all that interested im interested said ahmed arrange air transportation for me to go to luxor tonight i will pay abdul hamdis son a visit in the morning also send several additional guards to the necropolis of saqqara are you sure this is the right time for you to leave cairo asked zaki pointing with the stem of his pipe as you indicated with stephanos markoulis in cairo something is happening perhaps zaki said ahmed but i think i need to get away and spend a day or so in my own house by the nile i cannot help but feel a tremendous responsibility for poor gamal when i feel this depressed luxor is an emotional balm and what about the american woman erica baron zaki lit his pipe with a stainlesssteel lighter shes fine shes scared but she seemed to have pulled herself together by the time she left im not sure how id react if id witnessed two murders in twentyfour hours especially if one of the victims fell on top of me zaki took several thoughtful puffs on his pipe before continuing strange but ahmed when i asked about miss baron i wasnt inquiring about her health i want to know if you want her followed no said ahmed angrily not tonight shes going to be with de margeau almost the instant the words left his mouth ahmed felt embarrassed his emotion was out of place this is not like you ahmed said zaki watching the director very closely hed known ahmed for several years and ahmed had never shown any interest in women now suddenly it seemed that ahmed was jealous finding a potential human weakness in ahmed made zaki feel inwardly pleased hed grown to hate ahmeds perfect record perhaps it is best if you go to luxor for a few days i will certainly be happy to keep things under control here in cairo and i will look into saqqara personally cairo pm as the government car pulled up to the hilton erica still could not quite believe she had been released she opened the door before the vehicle had come to a complete stop and thanked the driver as if hed had something to do with her release entering the hilton was a little like coming home once again the lobby was extremely busy the afternoon international flights had been discharging passengers in a steady stream most of them were waiting perched on their luggage as the inefficient hotel tried to deal with the daily onslaught erica realized how outofplace she must look she was hot sweaty and a mess the large bloodstain was still on her back and her cotton pants were in sorry shape smeared with dirt and torn on her right knee if there had been an alternate route to her room she would have taken it unfortunately she had to walk directly across the large redandblue oriental rug beneath the main crystal chandelier it was like being in a spotlight and people began to stare one of the men at the registration desk caught sight of her and waved with his pen pointing in her direction erica quickened her step gaining on the elevator she pressed the button afraid to look behind her in case someone was coming to stop her she pushed the elevator button several more times while the floor indicator slowly came toward ground the door opened and she entered the car asking the operator for the ninth floor he nodded silently the door began to close but before it sealed a hand wrapped around its lead edge forcing the elevator man to reopen it erica backed against the rear of the car and held her breath hello there said a large man wearing a stetson and cowboy boots are you erica baron ericas mouth opened but no words came out my name is jeffrey john rice from houston you are erica baron the man continued to keep the door from closing the elevator operator stood like a stone statue like a guilty child erica nodded in affirmation so nice to meet you miss baron jeffrey rice held out his hand erica lifted her own like an automaton jeffrey rice pumped it exuberantly its a pleasure miss baron id like you to meet my wife without letting go of her hand jeffrey rice yanked erica from the elevator she stumbled forward rescuing her tote as the strap slipped off her shoulder weve been waiting for you for hours said rice pulling erica toward the lobby after four or five clumsy steps she managed to extract her hand mr rice she said coming to a stop id like to meet your wife but some other time ive had a very strange day you do look a little ragged dear but lets have one drink he reached out again and took ericas wrist mr rice said erica sharply come on honey weve come halfway around the world to see you erica looked into jeffrey rices tanned immaculately barbered face what do you mean mr rice exactly what i said my wife and i have come from houston to see you we flew all night luckily ive my own plane least you can do is have a drink with us suddenly the name registered jeffrey rice had the houston statue of seti i it had been late at night when shed spoken to dr lowery but now she remembered youve come from houston thats right flew over landed a few hours ago now come over and meet my wife priscilla erica allowed herself to be pulled back through the lobby to be introduced to priscilla rice a southern belle with a deep déecolletage and a very large diamond ring that effectively competed for sparkle with the enormous chandelier her southern accent was even more pronounced than her husbands jeffrey rice herded his wife and erica into the taverne lounge his officious manner and loud voice got rapid service especially since he freely passed out egyptian onepound notes as tips within the dim light of the cocktail lounge erica felt a little less conspicuous they sat in a corner booth where ericas torn and soiled clothes could not be seen jeffrey rice ordered straight bourbon for both himself and his wife and a vodka and tonic for erica who found herself relaxing even laughing at the texans tall stories about their experiences at customs erica allowed herself a second vodka and tonic well to business said jeffrey rice lowering his voice i certainly dont want to spoil this party but we have come a long way rumor has it that youve seen a statue of pharaoh seti i erica noticed that rices demeanor changed dramatically she guessed that he was a shrewd businessman beneath the playfultexan guise dr lowery said that you wanted some photos of my statue particularly of the hieroglyphics in the base i have those photos right here jeffrey rice drew an envelope from his jacket pocket and held it straight up in the air now im happy to give these to you provided you tell me where you saw the statue you told dr lowery about you see i was planning on giving my statue to my city of houston but its not going to be so special if theres a whole bunch of them floating around in other words i want to buy that statue you saw i want to buy it bad in fact im willing to give ten thousand dollars to anyone who can just tell me where it is so that i can buy it yourself included putting her drink down erica stared at jeffrey rice having seen cairos unmitigated poverty she knew that ten thousand dollars here would have the same effect as a billion dollars in new york it would create unbelievable pressure in the cairo underworld since abdul hamdis death was doubtless related to the statue the ten thousand dollars offered just for information could cause numerous additional deaths it was a frightening thought erica rapidly described her experience with abdul hamdi and the statue of seti i rice listened intently writing down abdul hamdis name do you know if anyone else has seen the statue he asked tilting back his stetson not that i know of said erica is there anyone else that knows abdul hamdi had the statue yes said erica a monsieur yvon de margeau hes staying at the meridien hotel he indicated that hamdi had corresponded with potential buyers around the world so there are probably a lot of people that knew hamdi had the statue looks like this is going to be more fun than we expected said rice leaning across the table and patting his wifes slim wrist turning back to erica he handed her the envelope of photos do you have any idea where the statue could be erica shook her head no idea whatsoever she said taking the envelope despite the poor light she could not wait to see the pictures so she pulled them out and looked closely at the first one thats some statue isnt it said rice as if he were showing erica pictures of his firstborn child it makes all that tut stuff look like a childs toys jeffrey rice was right looking at the photos erica admitted the statue was stunning but she also noticed something else as far as she could recall the statue was identical with the one shed seen then she hesitated looking at rices statue she saw that the right hand was holding the jewelencrusted mace she remembered that abduls statue held the mace in its left hand the statues were not the same they were mirror images erica shuffled through the rest of the photographs there were pictures of the statue from every angle very good photos obviously professional finally toward the bottom of the stack were the closeups erica felt her pulse quicken when she saw the hieroglyphics it was too dark to see the symbols clearly but by tilting the photo she was able to see the two pharaonic cartouches there were the names seti i and tutankhamen amazing miss baron said jeffrey rice it would be our pleasure to have you join us for dinner priscilla rice smiled warmly as her husband extended the invitation thank you said erica replacing the photos in the envelope unfortunately i already have plans perhaps some other evening if you are staying in egypt of course said jeffrey rice or you and your guests could join us tonight erica thought for a moment then declined jeffrey rice and yvon de margeau would mix like oil and water erica was about to excuse herself when she thought of something else mr rice how did you buy your seti i statue her voice was hesitant since she didnt know the propriety of the question with money my dear jeffrey rice laughed slapping the table with an open hand he obviously thought his joke was hilarious erica smiled weakly and waited hoping there would be more i heard about it from an artdealer friend in new york he called me up and said that there was an amazing piece of egyptian sculpture that was going to be auctioned behind closed doors closed doors yeah no publicity kinda hushhush happens all the time was it here in egypt asked erica nope zurich switzerland said erica incredulously why switzerland jeffrey rice shrugged at that kind of auction you dont ask questions theres a certain etiquette do you know how it got to zurich asked erica no said jeffrey rice as i said you dont ask questions it was arranged by one of the big banks there and they tend to be very closemouthed all they want is the money smiling he got up and offered to escort erica back to the elevator he obviously had no intention of saying more erica entered her room with her head reeling jeffrey rices statements were as much to blame as the two drinks while he had waited with her for the elevator he had casually mentioned that the statue was not the first egyptian antiquity hed purchased in zurich hed gotten several gold statues and a wonderful pectoral necklace all possibly dating from the time of seti i putting the envelope with the photos down on the bureau erica thought about her earlier conception of the black market somebody would find a small artifact in the sand and would sell it to someone who wanted it now she was forced to admit that the final transacting took place in the paneled conference rooms of international banks it was incredible erica removed her blouse looked at the bloodstain and impulsively threw it away her pants followed the blouse to the same wastebasket removing her bra she noticed the blood had even soaked through to the back strap but she could not cavalierly discard her bra bras were difficult for erica to buy and there were only a few brands that were comfortable before doing something rash she opened the top drawer of the bureau to count how many shed brought along but instead of counting she found herself just looking at her underclothes lingerie was an extravagance that erica had allowed herself even during her financially lean years as a fulltime student she enjoyed the reassuring feminine feel of expensive underwear consequently she was careful with them and when she had unpacked she had taken the time to lay things out neatly but now the drawer looked different someone had been in her belongings erica stood up and looked around the room the bed was made so obviously housekeeping had been in but would they go into her clothes it was possible quickly she checked the middle drawer pulling out her levis in the side pocket were her diamond earrings the last gift shed received from her father in the back pocket was her return airline ticket and the bulk of her travelers checks after finding everything in its place she heaved a sigh of relief and returned the jeans looking back into the top drawer she wondered if she could have disturbed her own belongings that morning walking into the bathroom she picked up her plastic makeup bag and examined its contents obviously she did not organize her makeup yet she used the various articles in an orderly fashion dropping each into the bag after using it her moisturizer should have been close to the bottom instead it was on the top also on the top were her birthcontrol pills which she always took in the evening erica looked at herself in the mirror her eyes reflected a feeling of violation similar to that generated by the boy who had felt her up the day before someone had had his hands in her things erica wondered if she should report the incident to the hotel management but what would she say since nothing was taken returning to the foyer erica nervously locked her door with the dead bolt then she walked over and looked out through the sliding glass door where the fiery egyptian sun was reaching for the western horizon the sphinx looked like a hungry lion ready to pounce the pyramids thrust their massive shapes against a bloodred sky erica wished she felt happier to be within their shadow cairo pm dinner with yvon turned out to be a soothingly romantic interlude erica surprised herself with her resilience despite the harrowing day and despite the guilty feeling she had had since her call to richard she was able to enjoy the evening yvon had picked her up at her hotel while the spot where the sun had set still glowed like a dying ember they had driven south along the nile out of the dusty heat of cairo toward the town of maadi as the stars had emerged in the darkening sky ericas tension had evaporated into the cool evening air the restaurant was called the sea horse and it was situated directly on the niles eastern bank taking advantage of the perfect egyptian nighttime climate the dining room was open on all four sides across the river and above a line of palms were the illuminated pyramids of giza they dined on fresh fish and giant prawns from the red sea grilled on an open fire and washed down with a chilled white wine called gianaclis yvon thought it was terrible and cut it with mineral water but erica liked its slightly sweet fruity taste she watched him drink admiring his closely fitted dark blue silk shirt reminding her of her silk tops which she prized and wore on special occasions it should have seemed feminine but it didnt in fact the silvery sheen seemed to emphasize his masculinity erica herself had taken a long time to get ready and the effort had paid off her freshly washed hair was loosely pulled back on the sides and held with tortoiseshell combs she had chosen to wear a onepiece chocolatebrown jersey with a scooped neck cap sleeves and elastic waist beneath she had on hose for the first time since she had gotten off the plane she knew that she looked as good as she could and the whole effect pleased her as the soft nile breeze caressed the nape of her neck their conversation started lightly but soon switched to the murders yvon had been frustrated in his attempts to discover who had killed abdul hamdi he told erica that the only thing hed learned was that the murderers were not from cairo then erica described her harrowing episode in the serapeum and the subsequent experience with the police i wish you had allowed me to accompany you today said yvon shaking his head in wonderment when erica had finished her story he reached across the table and lightly pressed her hand so do i admitted erica looking down at their barely touching fingers i have a confession said yvon softly when i first met you i was only interested in the seti statue but now i find you irresistibly charming his teeth gleamed in the candlelight i dont know you well enough to know when you are teasing said erica acknowledging an adolescent thrill im not teasing erica you are very different from any woman ive ever met erica looked out across the darkened nile faint movement on the near bank caught her eye and she could just make out several fishermen working on a sailboat they were apparently naked and their skin glistened like polished onyx in the darkness with her eyes momentarily captured by the scene erica thought about yvons comment it sounded like such a cliché and in that sense a little demeaning yet it was possible there was some truth in it because yvon was different from any man shed ever met the fact that you are trained as an egyptologist continued yvon i find fascinating becauseand i mean this as a complimentyou have an east european sensuality that i love besides i think you share some of egypts mysterious vibrancy i think im very american said erica ah but americans have ethnic origins and i think yours are apparent i find it very attractive to tell you the truth i am tired of the cold blond nordic look as strange as it seemed to her erica found herself at a loss for words the last thing she expected or wanted was an infatuation making her emotionally vulnerable yvon seemed to sense her discomfort and changed the subject while their dinner dishes were cleared erica could you possibly identify the killer in the serapeum today did you get to see his face no said erica it was as if the sky had fallen in i didnt see anyone god what an awful experience i cant think of anything worse and falling on top of you unbelievable but you know that assassinations of government officials are a daily occurrence in the middle east well at least you werent hurt i know it will be difficult but i wouldnt give it any more thought it was just such a crazy coincidence and coming on top of hamdis death makes it that much worse two murders in two days i dont know if i could take it i know it was probably a coincidence said erica but there is one thing that concerns me the poor man who was shot didnt just work for the government he worked for the department of antiquities so both victims dealt with ancient artifacts but from supposedly opposite sides of the issue still what do i know erica smiled weakly the waiter brought out arabic coffee and served the dessert yvon had ordered a coarse semolina cake coated in sugar and sprinkled with walnuts and raisins one of the amazing aspects of your adventure said yvon was that you were not detained by the police thats not totally correct i was detained for a number of hours and im not permitted to leave the country erica tasted the dessert but decided it wasnt worth the calories thats nothing youre lucky youre not in jail id be willing to wager that your guide still is i think i have ahmed khazzan to thank for my release said erica you know ahmed khazzan asked yvon he stopped eating i dont know how to categorize our relationship said erica after you left me last night ahmed khazzan was waiting for me in my room this is true yvons fork clattered as it hit the table if you think youre surprised try to imagine how i felt i thought i was being arrested for not reporting hamdis murder he took me to his office and questioned me for an hour thats incredible said yvon wiping his mouth with his napkin ahmed khazzan already knew about hamdis murder i dont know if he did or not said erica initially i thought he did why else would he have taken me to his office but he never said anything about it and i was afraid to bring it up then what did he want mostly he wanted to know about you me yvon assumed a playfully innocent expression and poked his chest with his index finger erica you have had a most amazing two days ive never even met ahmed khazzan and ive been coming here to egypt for a number of years what did he ask you about me he wanted to know what you are doing in egypt and what did you tell him that i didnt know you said nothing about the seti statue no i was afraid if i mentioned the statue id be drawn into talking about hamdis murder did he say anything about the seti statue nothing erica you are fantastic suddenly he leaned over the table cradled ericas face in his hands and kissed her on both cheeks the exuberance of the gesture dumbfounded her and she felt herself blushing something she hadnt done in years selfconsciously she took a sip of the sweet coffee i dont think ahmed khazzan believed everything i said what makes you say that asked yvon he went back to his dessert when i returned to my hotel room this afternoon i noticed some very subtle changes in my belongings i think my room was searched after ahmed khazzan had been in there the night before the only thing i can imagine is that the egyptian authorities returned my valuables werent touched i wasnt robbed but i have no idea what they could have been looking for yvon chewed thoughtfully looking directly at erica does your door have an extra night latch he asked yes use it said yvon he took another bite of dessert and swallowed thoughtfully before he spoke again erica when you visited with abdul hamdi did he give you any letters or papers no said erica he gave me a fake scarab which looks real and he did convince me to use his baedeker instead of my own nagels where are these things asked yvon right here said erica she reached into her tote bag and extracted the baedeker without the cover it had finally detached and erica had left it in her room the scarab was in her coin purse yvon picked up the scarab and held it close to the candle are you sure this is a fake looks good doesnt it said erica i thought it was real too but hamdi insisted said his son made it yvon carefully put the scarab down and picked up the guidebook these baedekers are fantastic he said he flipped through the volume carefully viewing each page they are the best guides ever written for the egyptian sites particularly luxor yvon pushed the coverless book back toward erica do you mind if i have this authenticated he asked holding the scarab between his thumb and forefinger you mean carbondated asked erica yes said yvon this looks very good to me and it has the cartouche of seti i i think its bone youre right about the material hamdi said his son carved them of bone from mummies in the ancient public catacombs so it will date properly he also said that they make the cut surfaces look old by feeding them to turkeys yvon laughed the antique industry in egypt is extremely resourceful just the same id like to have this scarab examined its fine with me but i would like to have it back erica took a last sip of coffee but ended up with bitter grounds in her mouth yvon why is ahmed khazzan so interested in your affairs i think i worry him said yvon but why he spoke to you rather than to me i cannot answer he thinks of me as a dangerous collector of antiquities he knows ive made some important acquisitions while trying to unravel the blackmarket routing the fact that i am interested in doing something about the black market has no meaning ahmed khazzan is part of the bureaucracy here rather than accept my help they probably fear for their jobs besides there is the lingering hatred of the british and the french and i am french and a little english you are part english asked erica with disbelief i dont admit it often said yvon with his strong french accent european genealogy is more complicated than most people think my family residence is the château valois near rambouillet which is between paris and chartres my father is the marquis de margeau but my mother was from the english harcourt family sounds a long way from toledo ohio said erica quietly i beg your pardon i said it sounds intriguing said erica smiling as he settled the bill leaving the restaurant yvon slipped his hand around ericas waist it felt good the evening air had cooled considerably and the almost full moon shone between the branches of the eucalyptus trees lining the road a chorus of insects resounded in the darkness reminding erica of august nights as a child in ohio it was a comfortable memory what kind of important egyptian antiquities have you purchased asked erica as they drew near to yvons fiat some wonderful pieces that id love to show you sometime said yvon im particularly fond of several small golden statues one of nekhbet and another of isis have you purchased any seti i pieces asked erica yvon opened the passenger door to the car possibly a necklace most of my pieces are from the new kingdom and a number could be from the time of seti i erica entered the car and yvon told her to use her seat belt ive done a little auto racing said yvon and i always use them i could have guessed said erica remembering the ride the day before yvon laughed everyone says i drive a little fast i enjoy it he reached for his driving gloves on the dash i suppose you know about as much about seti i as i it is curious it is known very accurately when his fabulous rockcut tomb was plundered in ancient times the faithful priests in the twentieth dynasty were able to save his mummy and they documented their efforts very well i saw the mummy of seti i this morning said erica ironic isnt it asked yvon starting the engine the fragile body of seti i comes down to us essentially intact seti i was one of the pharaonic mummies in that fabulous cache illicitly found by the clever rasul family at the end of the nineteenth century yvon turned and leaned over the front seat to back up the car the rasuls slowly exploited that find over a tenyear period before they were caught an amazing story he pulled away from the restaurant and accelerated toward cairo a few people still think there are some seti i belongings to be discovered when you visit his enormous tomb in luxor youll see places where people have obtained permits to cut tunnels during this century trying to find a secret room the stimulus for this has been occasional seti pieces surfacing on the black market but its not surprising to see some seti artifacts he probably was buried with a staggering array of possessions and even if his tomb was stripped they often recycled funerary objects in ancient egypt the stuff was probably buried and robbed over and over again down through the years consequently a lot of it is most likely still under ground very few people have any idea how many peasants currently dig for antiquities in luxor every night they shift the desert sand and occasionally they find something spectacular like the seti i statue said erica looking again at yvons profile he smiled and she could see the whiteness of his teeth against his tanned skin exactly he said but can you imagine what setis unplundered tomb must have looked like my god it must have been fantastic the treasures of tutankhamen dazzle us today but they were insignificant compared to seti is erica knew yvon was right especially after seeing the statue at abdul hamdis seti i had been a major pharaoh who ruled an empire tutankhamen an insignificant boy king who probably never held any real power merde shouted yvon as they hit one of the ubiquitous potholes the car shimmied from the impact as they entered cairo the road deteriorated and they had to slow down the city began as pieces of cardboard propped up with sticks they were the housing of the newly arrived immigrants the cardboard gave way to sheets of metal and cloth and occasional oil barrels finally the shantytown was superseded by crumbly mud brick and eventually the city proper but the feeling of poverty hung in the air like a miasma would you care to come to my suite for an afterdinner brandy asked yvon erica glanced over at him trying to sort out her feelings there was a good chance that yvons offer was not as innocent as it sounded but she was definitely attracted to him and after the appalling day the idea of being close to someone was very appealing still physical attraction was not always a reliable guide to behavior and yvon was almost too good to be true looking at him she admitted that he was beyond her experience it was too much too soon thank you yvon said erica warmly but i think not perhaps youd like to have another drink at the hilton but of course for a moment erica felt a little disappointed yvon wasnt more persistent perhaps she was a victim of her own fantasies reaching the hotel they decided a walk would be better than the smokefilled taverne hand in hand they crossed the busy korneishelnil boulevard to the nile and wandered out onto the el tahrir bridge yvon pointed out the meridien hotel on the tip of roda island a lone felucca silently slipped through the dappled path of moonlight on the water yvon put his arm around erica as they strolled and erica allowed her own hand to cover his again she felt selfconscious it had been a long time since she had been with any man besides richard a greek named stephanos markoulis arrived in cairo today said yvon stopping by the balustrade they gazed at the dancing lights reflected on the waters surface and i believe he will call and try to see you erica looked up questioningly stephanos markoulis deals in egyptian antiquities in athens he rarely comes to egypt i dont know why he is here but i would like to find out ostensibly hes come because of abdul hamdis murder but he might be here because of the seti statue and he wants to see me about the murder yes said yvon he continued to avoid looking at erica i dont know how he is involved but he is yvon i dont think i want to have any more to do with the abdul hamdi affair frankly the whole business frightens me ive told you everything i know i understand said yvon soothingly but unfortunately you are all ive got and what do you mean by that yvon turned to her you are the last connection to the seti statue stephanos markoulis was involved somehow with the sale of the first seti statue to the man in houston im worried hes involved with the present statue you know how important it is to me to stop this rape of antiquities erica looked over toward the gay lights of the hilton the man from houston who bought the first seti statue also arrived today he was waiting for me in the hilton lobby this afternoon his name is jeffrey rice yvons mouth tightened perceptibly he told me continued erica that he was offering ten thousand dollars to anyone who could merely tell him where this second seti statue is so he could buy it christ said yvon thats going to turn cairo into a circus and to think ive been worried whether ahmed khazzan and the antiquities service were going to find out about the existence of this statue well erica this means ive got to work fast i can understand your feelings about involvement but please do me the favor of seeing stephanos markoulis i need to know more about what hes up to and you may be able to help with jeffrey offering that kind of money i think we can be sure the statue is still available and if i dont move quickly it too is going to disappear into some private collection all i ask is that you see stephanos markoulis and then tell me what he says everything he says erica looked at yvons pleading face she could sense his commitment and knew how important it was that the fabulous seti i statue be preserved for the public youre sure it will be safe of course said yvon when he calls arrange to meet in a public place so you dont have to worry all right she said but youll owe me another dinner daccord said yvon kissing ericathis time on the lips erica studied yvons handsome face a warm smile lingered at the corners of his mouth she wondered for a moment if he wasnt using her then she chided herself for her own suspiciousness besides it was possible she was using him returning to her room erica felt better than she had during the whole trip yvon had aroused her in a way that she had not experienced for a long time since even the physical aspect of her relationship with richard had not been totally satisfying for a number of months and yvon was capable of making his sexual desires seem secondary to a meaningful relationship he was willing to wait and that made her feel good outside her room she inserted her key quickly and swung the door open widely everything appeared in its place remembering hundreds of movies shed seen she wished she had made some provision to determine if someone had entered her room turning on the lights she strode into the bedroom it was empty she checked the bathroom smiling at her own sense of melodrama then sighing with relief erica gave her door a shove and it closed with a resounding thud followed by the reassuring click of the americanmade hardware she kicked off her shoes turned off the air conditioning and opened the balcony door the floodlights on the pyramids and sphinx had been turned off returning to her room she took her jersey dress off over her head and hung it up in the distance she could hear the traffic that still plied the korneishelnile despite the hour otherwise the hotel was silent it was while she was removing her eye makeup that she heard the first unmistakable sound at her door she stopped moving staring at her image in the mirror she was dressed in her bra and panties with the eye makeup gone from one eye in the distance the usual auto horns sounded followed by silence she held her breath her ears straining again she heard the muted sound of metal hitting metal erica felt the blood drain from her face someone was pushing a key into the lock of her door the realization made her turn slowly around the night bolt on the hall door was undone erica was paralyzed she couldnt make herself lunge for the dead bolt she was afraid that she would not be able to close it before the door was opened the tumblers in the lock clicked again then as she watched the doorknob began slowly to turn erica looked at the lock on the bathroom door it was a mere button on the handle and the door itself was a thin panel again the isolated sound of the key being forced made her look back at the slowly turning door handle like a frightened animals her eyes raced around the room for escape the balcony could she cross over to the neighboring terrace no shed have to swing out over a ninestory drop then she remembered the telephone she ran across the room on silent feet and yanked the receiver to her ear she heard a distant ring answer she shouted silently please answer there were a few final clicks from the door different from the others heralding the full penetration and rotation of the key the door was unlocked and without another sound it cracked open allowing a strip of harsh light from the hall to knife into the room erica dropped on her knees throwing the phone receiver onto the bed and flattening herself on the floor she wriggled under the bed from beneath the spread she could just see the base of the door as it opened a buzzing sound came from the phone erica knew the phone would give her away a telltale sign she was hiding a man came into the room quietly closing the door behind him as erica watched in an agony of terror he walked toward the bed and out of ericas line of vision she was afraid to move her head above her she heard the receiver replaced the intruder then silently walked back into her line of vision and apparently checked the bathroom cold sweat formed on ericas face as she watched the feet go to the closet he was searching for her the closet door opened then closed coming back to the center of the bedroom the man stopped his shoes no more than five or six feet from ericas head then they come forward step by step stopping by the bed she could have touched himhe was that close suddenly the bedspread was pulled up and erica was looking up into a mans face erica what in the world are you doing under the bed richard erica screamed and burst into tears although erica was still too shaken to move richard pulled her from beneath the bed and dusted her off really he said with a grin what are you doing under the bed oh richard said erica suddenly throwing her arms around his neck im so glad its you i cant tell you how glad i am she pressed herself against him holding him tight i should surprise you more often he said happily putting his arms around her bare back they stood together for a few moments as erica collected herself and dried her tears is it really you she said finally looking up into his face i cant believe it am i dreaming youre not dreaming its me maybe a little exhausted but right here with you in egypt you do look a little tired erica brushed his hair off his forehead are you all right yeah im okay just tired trouble with equipment they said we were delayed almost four hours in rome but it was worth it you look wonderful when did you start putting makeup on only one eye erica smiled and hugged him gently i would have looked better if youd given me a little more notice how could you get the time off she leaned back in his arms her hands pressed up against his chest i had covered for someone a few months ago when his father died he owed me a favor hell see all the emergencies and inhouse patients the office will just have to wait im afraid i wasnt very effective anyway ive missed you terribly ive missed you too i guess thats why i telephoned i was glad you did said richard kissing her forehead when i asked you a year ago about possibly coming to egypt you said there was no way you could take the time well said richard i didnt feel as confident about the practice then but that was a year ago and now im here with you in egypt i have trouble believing it myself but erica what were you doing under the bed a smile formed in the corners of his mouth did i scare you i didnt mean to and im sorry if i did i thought youd be sleeping and i wanted to come in quietly and awaken you as i used to do at home did you scare me questioned erica she laughed sarcastically she pushed herself away to get her white eyelet robe from the closet i still feel weak i mean you terrified me im sorry said richard how did you get a key erica sat on the edge of the bed her hands in her lap richard shrugged i just walked in and asked for a key to and they just gave it to you they didnt ask any questions nope its not unusual in hotels i was hoping they would so i could really surprise you i wanted to see your face when you first learned i was in cairo richard with what ive been through during the last few days it was probably the worst possible thing you could have done her voice took on an edge in fact it was pretty stupid okay okay said richard lifting his hands in mock defense im sorry if i frightened you i didnt mean to didnt you think id be scared if you snuck into my room at midnight really richard thats not too much to ask even in boston that would not be wise i dont think you thought about my feelings at all well i was excited to see you i mean ive come nineteen zillion miles richards smile began to fade his sandy hair was tousled and his eyes were lined with dark shadows the more i think about it the more idiotic it sounds god i could have had a heart attack you scared me to death im sorry i said i was sorry im sorry repeated erica testily i suppose saying im sorry is supposed to make it all okay well it doesnt it was bad enough to witness two murders in two days but then to be subjected to an adolescent prank enough is enough i thought you were glad to see me said richard defensively you said you were glad to see me i was glad you werent a wouldbe rapist or murderer well that certainly makes a fellow feel welcome richard what in heavens name are you doing here im here to see you i came halfway around the world to this dusty hot city because i wanted to show you how much i care erica opened her mouth but she didnt speak right away her irritation softened slightly but i specifically asked you not to come she said as if speaking to a naughty child i know that but i talked it over with your mother richard sat down on the bed and tried to take ericas hand what she questioned eluding his grasp tell me that again tell you what asked richard confused he sensed her renewed anger but did not understand you and my mother conspired i wouldnt use that word we discussed whether i should come wonderful scoffed erica and ill bet it was decided that erica the little girl she is is just going through a difficult stage and that shell grow out of it she just needs to be treated like a child and tolerated for the time being look erica for your information your mother has your best interests at heart im not so sure about that said erica getting off the bed my mother cannot distinguish between her life and mine anymore shes too close and i feel as if shes sucking the life right out of me can you understand that no i cant said richard his own irritation beginning to surface i didnt think you could im beginning to think it has something to do with being jewish my mother is so intent on my following in her footsteps that she doesnt bother to find out who i really am maybe she does want whats best for me but i also think she wants to justify her own life through mine the trouble is that my mother and i are very different weve grown up in different worlds the only time i think of you as a child is when you talk like this i dont think you understand at all richard not at all you dont even know why im here in egypt no matter how many times ive explained it you refuse to comprehend i disagree i think i know why youre here youre afraid of a commitment its as simple as that you want to demonstrate your independence richard dont you dare turn this around you were the one who was afraid of a commitment a year ago you would not even discuss marriage now suddenly you want a wife a house and a dog and i dont think the order makes much difference well im not a possession not for you not for my mother im not here in egypt to act out my independence if thats what i wanted i would have fled to one of those canned vacation spots like the club med where you dont have to think ive come to egypt because ive spent eight years studying ancient egypt and its my lifes work its part of me as much as medicine is a part of you so youre trying to tell me that love and family are secondary to your career erica closed her eyes and sighed no not secondary its just that your current conception of marriage would mean a type of intellectual abdication you have always viewed my work as a kind of elaborate hobby you dont take it seriously richard tried to disagree but erica continued im not saying you did not like the fact that i was getting an exotic doctorate but it wasnt because you were happy for me it just happened to fit some grand design you had for yourself i think it made you feel more liberal more intellectual erica i dont think this is fair dont misunderstand me richard i know im partly to blame i never really made a point of communicating my enthusiasm for my work if anything i camouflaged it for fear that it would frighten you away but its different now i recognize who i am and it doesnt mean i dont want marriage it means that i dont want the wifely role that you have in mind and ive come here to egypt to do something that involves my professional expertise richard sagged under the weight of ericas argument he was too tired to fight if youre so intent on being useful why did you choose such an obscure field i mean really erica egyptology new kingdom hieroglyphics richard fell back on the bed his feet still touching the floor egyptian antiquities generate a lot more action than youd ever imagine said erica walking over to the bureau she picked up the envelope containing the photos jeffrey john rice had given to her ive been painfully learning that fact during the last two days take a look at these erica tossed the envelope onto richards chest richard sat up with obvious effort and took out the photos he looked at them rapidly then replaced them nice statue he said noncommittally falling back onto the bed nice statue said erica cynically that could be the finest ancient egyptian statue ever found and ive witnessed two murders at least one of which i believe involved that statue and you just say nice richard opened one eye and looked at erica who was defiantly leaning against the bureau the tops of her breasts were visible through the eyelet embroidery of her robe without sitting up again richard took the photos back out of the envelope and looked at them more carefully all right he said at length a nice deadly statue but what do you mean two murders you didnt see another today did you richard pushed himself up to a halfsitting position his eyes were only halfopen not only did i see it but the victim fell on top of me it would be difficult to be any closer and not be involved richard stared at erica for several minutes i think you better come back to boston he said with as much authority as he could muster im going to stay here said erica flatly in fact i think im going to do something about the antiquities black market i think i can help and id like to keep that seti statue from being smuggled out of egypt immersed in deep concentration erica was oblivious of the passage of time looking at her watch she was surprised to see it was twothirty in the morning she had been sitting on her balcony at the small round table shed dragged from inside shed also carried out the bedsidetable lamp which cast a bright puddle of light on the table illuminating the photos of the houston statue richard was lying on the bed in a deep sleep still fully clothed erica had insisted on trying to get him a separate room but the hotel was full so were the sheraton shepheards and the meridien while erica was trying to call a hotel on gezira island his breathing became stertorous and she realized he had passed out erica relented she had not wanted him to spend the night with her because she did not want to risk making love to him but since he was already asleep she decided he could find himself a room in the morning too overwrought to sleep herself she had decided to work on the hieroglyphics in the photos she was particularly interested in the short inscription containing the two pharaonic cartouches hieroglyphics were always difficult since there were no vowels and directives had to be interpreted correctly but this inscription on the seti statue seemed more obtuse than usual as if the original designer wanted to encode his message erica wasnt even positive in which direction the inscription should be read no matter what she did nothing made much sense why would the name of the boy king tutankhamen be carved on the effigy of a mighty pharaoh the best interpretation of the phrase she could make was eternal rest or peace given or awarded to his majesty king of upper and lower egypt son of amonre beloved of osiris pharaoh seti i who rules or governs or resides after or behind or under tutankhamen as far as she could remember that was reasonably close to what dr lowery had said on the phone but she wasnt satisfied it seemed too simple certainly seti i ruled or lived after tutankhamen by fifty years or so but of all the pharaohs why hadnt they picked thutmose iv or one of the other great empirebuilders also the final preposition bothered her she rejected under because there was no dynastic connection between seti i and tutankhamen there were no family ties whatsoever in fact before setis time she was reasonably sure tutankhamens names had been obliterated by the usurper general pharaoh horemheb she rejected behind because of the insignificance of tutankhamen that left after erica read the phrase out loud again it sounded too simple and for that reason mysteriously complicated but it excited her trying to pierce a human mind that had functioned three thousand years previously looking back ino the room at richards sleeping form erica realized more than ever the gulf that separated them richard would never comprehend her fascination with egypt and the fact that such intellectual excitement was an important part of her identity she got up from the table and carried the lamp and the photos back into the room as the light fell on richards face with his lips parted ever so slightly he suddenly appeared very young like a boy erica remembered the beginning of their relationship and she longed for that simpler time she really did care for him but it was hard to face reality richard was always going to be richard his medical career kept him from viewing himself with any kind of perspective and erica had to face the fact that he was not going to change she switched off the lamp and stretched out beside him he groaned and turned over putting his hand on ericas chest gently she replaced it at his side she wanted to maintain her distance and she did not want to be touched she thought about yvon who she believed treated her as an intellectual equal and a woman at the same time looking at richard in the dim light erica realized she was going to have to tell him about the frenchman and richard would be hurt she stared up at the dark ceiling anticipating his jealous reaction hed say that all erica wanted was to run off and find a lover he would never understand the strength of her commitment to keep the second statue of seti i from being spirited out of the country youll see she whispered to richard in the darkness im going to find that statue richard groaned in his sleep and turned away day cairo am when erica awoke the next morning she thought she had again left the shower running but she soon remembered richards unexpected arrival and realized that he had turned on the water pushing a stray wisp of hair off her forehead erica let her head flop over on the pillow so she could see out the open balcony door the noise of the steady traffic below blended with the sound of the shower and was as soothing as a distant waterfall her eyes restfully closed again while she recalled her resolves the night before then the sound of the shower stopped abruptly erica did not move presently richard came padding into the room vigorously drying his sandy hair carefully turning yet pretending to be asleep erica looked out of halfopen eyes and was surprised to see him stark naked she watched as he finished with the towel advanced to the open balcony door and began studying the great pyramids and the guardian sphinx in the distance he did have a handsome body she looked at the graceful curve of the small of his back she felt the suggestion of power in his welldefined legs erica closed her eyes afraid that familiarity and the sexiness of richards body would prove too much for her the next thing erica knew she was being gently shaken awake opening her eyes she looked directly into the faraway blue of richards he was smiling impishly dressed in jeans and a fitted navyblue knit shirt his hair was combed as much as the natural curls would allow lets go sleeping beauty said richard kissing her forehead breakfast will be here in five minutes while she was taking a shower erica debated how she could be firm without sounding insensitive she hoped yvon would not call and thinking of him reminded her of the seti i statue it was one thing to declare a crusade in the middle of the night it was quite another actually to begin she knew she had to have a plan of some kind if she hoped to find the sculpture lathering up with the harshsmelling egyptian soap erica considered for the first time the continued danger of having witnessed abduls murder wondering why she had not considered this aspect of her position before she rinsed off quickly and stepped out of the shower of course she said out loud any danger would depend on the killers knowing that i had been a witness and they did not see me erica ran a comb through her damp hair to remove the tangles and looked in the mirror the pimple on her chin had involuted to a red blemish and already the egyptian sun had given her complexion an attractive glow putting on her makeup erica tried to recall her conversation with abdul hamdi hed said the statue was resting before resuming its journey presumably out of egypt erica hoped the murder of abdul hamdi meant it had not left the country her supposition was supported by the fact that yvon jeffrey rice or the greek whom yvon had talked about would have heard if the statue had resurfaced in some neutral country like switzerland all in all she felt reasonably certain the statue was not only still in egypt but also still in cairo erica inspected her makeup it would do shed used just a small amount of mascara there was something romantic about the fact that egyptian women four thousand years ago had darkened their lashes in a similar fashion richard knocked on the door breakfast is being served on the veranda he said assuming an english accent he sounded too happy thought erica it was going to be harder to talk with him erica called through the door that shed be out in a few minutes and then began to dress she missed her drawstring cotton pants she knew her jeans would be much warmer in the hot climate struggling with the tight legs she thought about the greek she had no idea what he wanted from her but maybe he could be a source of information perhaps she could exchange whatever he wanted for some inside information about how the black market worked it was a long shot but at least a place to begin tucking in her blouse erica wondered if the greekor anyone else for that matterwould understand the significance of the hieroglyphics shed tried to translate the evening before overshadowing the missing statue was the mystery of seti i himself three thousand years had passed since this ancient egyptian had lived and breathed aside from conducting a very successful military campaign into the middle east and libya during the first decade of his reign all erica could remember about the mighty pharaoh was that he built an extensive temple complex at abydos added to the temple of karnak and built the most spectacular cave tomb in the valley of the kings recognizing that more significant information was available erica decided to return to the egyptian museum and use her professional letters of introduction it would give her something to do while waiting for the greek to contact her the other person who might have information for her was the son abdul hamdi had mentioned who had an antique business in luxor as erica opened the bathroom door she made up her mind as soon as possible she was going to head up the nile to luxor to abdul hamdis son she was convinced it was the best idea shed had richard had taken it upon himself to order a large breakfast like the previous morning it had been served on the balcony beneath silver warmers were eggs bacon and fresh egyptian bread slices of papaya nestled in ice chips the coffee was waiting to be poured richard hovered over the table like a nervous waiter adjusting the position of the flatware and napkins ah your highness said richard still in an english accent your table is ready holding back one of the chairs he beckoned for erica to sit after you he said holding up each of the platters in turn erica was genuinely touched richard had none of yvons sophistication but his behavior was appealing as tough as he liked to act under most circumstances erica knew he was rather vulnerable and she knew what she was going to tell him could hurt him she started i dont know how much you remember from our conversation last night everything said richard holding up his fork in fact before you go any further id like to make a suggestion i think we should march right over to the american embassy and tell them exactly what has happened to you richard said erica knowing that she was being sidetracked the american embassy wouldnt be able to do anything be realistic nothing really has happened to me just around me no im not going to the american embassy all right said richard if thats the way you feel then fine now about the other things you said about us richard paused and fingered his coffee cup i admit theres some truth in what you say about my attitude concerning your work well id like to ask you to do something for me he raised his eyes to meet ericas lets just have a day together here in egypt on your turf so to speak give me a chance to see what its all about but richard began erica she wanted to talk about yvon and her feelings please erica youve got to admit we havent discussed this before give me a little time well talk tonight i promise after all i did come all the way here that should count for something it counts for something said erica tiredly such emotional moments were draining for her but even that kind of a decision was something we should have made together i appreciate your effort but i still dont think you understand why i came here we seem to view the future of our relationship very differently thats what we will discuss said richard but not now tonight all im asking is to spend a pleasant day together so i can see something of egypt and get a feeling for egyptology i think i deserve that much consideration all right said erica reluctantly but we will talk tonight phew said richard with that decided lets discuss our plans id really like to see those babies richard pointed with a piece of toast toward the sphinx and the pyramids of giza sorry said erica the day is already booked we are going to the egyptian museum this morning to see what is known about seti i and this afternoon we are going to return to the scene of the first murder antica abdul the pyramids will have to wait erica tried to speed up their breakfast and leave the room before the inevitable phone call but she didnt make it richard was busy putting film into his nikon as she picked up the receiver hello she said quietly as shed feared it was yvon she knew she should not feel guilty but she did just the same she had wanted to tell richard about the frenchman but he had cut her off yvon was cheerful and full of warm words about the previous evening erica acquiesced at appropriate junctures but she knew she sounded stilted erica are you all right yvon finally asked yes yes im just fine erica tried to think of a way to end the conversation you would tell me if something was wrong he asked sounding alarmed of course said erica quickly there was a pause yvon knew something was wrong we both agreed last night said yvon that we should have spent yesterday together so how about today let me take you to some of the sights no thank you said erica i have a surprise guest who arrived last night from the states no matter said yvon your guest is welcome the guest happens to be erica hesitated boyfriend seemed so immature a lover asked yvon hesitantly a boyfriend said erica she couldnt think of anything more sophisticated yvon slammed the phone down women he said with anger pressing his lips together raoul looked up from his weekold paris match trying not to smile the american girl is giving you some trouble shut up said yvon with uncharacteristic irritation he lit a cigarette and blew smoke up at the ceiling in turbulent blue billows he thought it was entirely possible that ericas guest had arrived unexpectedly yet there was a lingering doubt that she had purposely not told him to lead him on he stubbed out his cigarette and walked over to the balcony he was not accustomed to being upset about women if they proved troublesome he left it was as simple as that the world was full of women he stared down at a dozen feluccas heading south before the wind the placid view made him feel better raoul i want erica baron tailed again he called fine said raoul i have khalifa on hold at the scheherazade hotel try to tell him to be conservative said yvon i dont want any more unnecessary bloodshed khalifa insists the man he shot had been stalking erica the man was working for the department of antiquities its inconceivable that he was stalking erica well i assure you khalifa is firstclass i know said raoul hed better be said yvon stephanos expects to meet with the girl today warn khalifa there might be trouble dr sarwat fakhry can see you now said a robust secretary with a bulging bosom she was about twenty and brimming with health and enthusiasm a relief from the otherwise oppressive atmosphere of the egyptian museum the curators office was like a dim cave with shuttered windows a rattling air conditioner kept the room cool it was paneled in dark wood like a victorian study one wall was dressed with a fake fireplace certainly out of place in cairo the others completely covered with bookshelves in the middle of the room was a large desk stacked with books journals and papers behind the desk sat dr fakhry who looked up over the tops of his glasses as erica and richard entered he was a small nervous man about sixty with pointed features and wiry gray hair welcome dr baron he said without getting up ericas letters of introduction trembled slightly in his hand im always happy to welcome someone from the boston museum of fine arts we are indebted to reisner for his excellent work dr fakhry was looking directly at richard im not dr baron said richard smiling erica took another step forward im dr baron and thank you for your hospitality dr fakhrys look of confusion gave way to embarrassed understanding excuse me he said simply from your letter of introduction i see that you are planning to do some onsite translations of new kingdom monuments i am pleased there is much to be done if i can be of any assistance i am at your service thank you said erica actually i did want to ask a favor i am interested in some background information of seti i would it be possible for me to review the museums material certainly said dr fakhry his voice changed slightly it was more questioning as if ericas request surprised him unfortunately we dont know very much about seti i as you are undoubtedly aware in addition to the translations we have of the inscriptions on his monuments we do have some of seti is correspondence from his early campaigns in palestine but thats about all im certain that you can add to our knowledge with your onsite translations those we have are quite old and much has been learned since they were made what about his mummy asked erica dr fakhry handed ericas letters back to her the tremor increased as he extended his arm yes we do have his mummy it was part of the deir elbahri cache illicitly found and plundered by the rasul family it is on display upstairs he glanced at richard who smiled again was the mummy ever closely examined asked erica indeed said dr fakhry it was autopsied autopsied asked richard with disbelief how do you autopsy a mummy erica grasped richards arm above the elbow he got the message and remained silent dr fakhry continued as if he had not heard the query and it was recently xrayed by an american team i will gladly have all the material made available to you in our library dr fakhry got to his feet and opened the office door he walked partially bent over giving the impression of a hunchback with his hands curled at his sides one other request said erica do you have much material on the opening of tutankhamens tomb richard passed erica and checked out the secretary with a sly sideways glance she was busy leaning over her typewriter ah there we can help you said dr fakhry as they emerged in the marbled hall as you know we are planning to use some of the funds generated by the world tour of the treasures of tutankhamen to build a special museum to house his artifacts we now have a full set of carters notes from what he called his journal of entry on microfilm as well as a significant collection of correspondence among carter carnarvon and others associated with the discovery of the tomb dr fakhry deposited erica and richard in the hands of a silent young man whom he introduced as talat talat listened carefully to the doctors complicated instructions then bowed and disappeared through a side door he will bring the material we have on seti i said dr fakhry thank you for coming in and if i can be of further assistance please let me know he shook hands with erica keying off an involuntary facial spasm that pulled his mouth into a sneer he left his hands drawn up and his fingers rhythmically clutching at nothing god what a place said richard when the curator had left charming fellow dr fakhry happens to have done some fine work his specialty is ancient egyptian religion funerary practices and mummification methods mummification methods i could have guessed i know a big church in paris whod hire him in a minute try to be serious richard said erica smiling despite herself they took seats at one of the long battered oak tables that dotted the large room everything was covered with a fine layer of cairo dust tiny footprints crossed the floor beneath ericas chair richard told her it had been a rat talat brought back two large red paper envelopes each tied with a string he gave them to richard who smiled scornfully and gave them to erica the first was marked seti i a erica opened it and spread the contents on the table they were reprints of articles about the pharaoh a number of them were in french a couple in german but most were in english pssst talat touched richards arm richard turned surprised at the noise you want scarabs from the ancient mummies very cheap talat extended a closed hand palm up while he glanced over his shoulder like a pornography peddler in the fifties his fingers slowly opened to reveal two slightly damp scarabs is this guy serious asked richard he wants to sell some scarabs undoubtedly they are fake said erica not pausing from her work to look up richard picked one of the scarabs from talats open palm one pound said talat he was getting nervous erica take a look at this its a goodlooking little scarab this guys got balls carrying on business here richard you can buy scarabs all over the place maybe you should wander around the museum while i get this work done she looked up at him to see how hed taken her suggestion but he wasnt listening hed taken the other scarab from talat richard said erica dont get fooled by the first peddler you meet let me see one she took one of the artifacts and turned it over to read the hieroglyphics on the underside my god she said do you think its real queried richard no its not real but its a clever fake too clever it has the cartouche of tutankhamen i think i know who made it abdul hamdis son amazing erica bought the scarab from talat for twentyfive piasters and then sent the boy away i already have one made by hamdis son with seti is name on it erica made a mental note to get the fake scarab back from yvon i wonder what other pharaohs names he uses on ericas insistence they went back to the articles richard picked up several reprints there was silence for a halfhour this is the driest stuff ive ever read said richard finally tossing an article onto the table and i thought that pathology was dull god it has to be put into context said erica condescendingly what youre looking at are bits and pieces that are being assembled about a powerful person who lived three thousand years ago well if there was a little more action in these articles it would be a lot easier richard laughed seti i reigned soon after the pharaoh who tried to change the egyptian religion to monotheism erica said ignoring richards comment his name was akhenaten the country had been plunged into chaos seti changed that he was a strong ruler who managed to restore stability at home and through most of the empire he assumed power around age thirty and ruled for approximately fifteen years except for some of his battles in palestine and libya very few details are known about him which is unfortunate because he reigned during a very interesting time in egyptian history im talking about a period a little over fifty years long from akhenaten through seti i it must have been a fascinating era full of turmoil upheaval and emotion its just so frustrating that we dont know more erica tapped the stacks of reprints it was during that time that tutankhamen ruled and strangely enough there was one huge disappointment in the discovery of tutankhamens magnificent tomb despite all the treasures that were found there were no historical documents not a single papyrus was found not one richard shrugged erica realized he was trying but he couldnt share her excitement she turned back to the table lets see whats in the other folder she said and slid the contents of seti i b onto the table richard perked up there were dozens of photographs of the mummy of seti i including photos of x rays a modified autopsy report and several more reprinted articles god said richard feigning a horrified expression he picked up a photo of the face of seti i this looks as bad as my cadaver in firstyear anatomy it does horrify at first but the longer you look at it the more serene it seems come on erica it looks like a ghoul serene give me a break richard picked up the autopsy report and started reading erica found a fullbody x ray it looked like a halloween skeleton with the arms crossed on the chest but she studied it just the same suddenly she realized that something was strange the arms were crossed like all the mummies of the pharaohs but the hands were open not clenched the fingers were extended the other pharaohs had all been buried clutching the flail and the scepter the insignia of office but not seti i erica tried to understand why this is not an autopsy said richard interrupting her thoughts i mean they had no internal organs just a shell of a body when a post is done the shell is only cursorily examined unless there is some specific indication the autopsy is really the microscopic examination of the internal organs here all they did was take a little bit of muscle and skin he took the xray photo from erica and held it at arms length to examine it lungs are clear said richard laughing erica didnt get it so richard explained that since the lungs had been removed in antiquity the x ray showed the chest clear it didnt sound so funny when he explained and his laughter trailed off erica looked over richards arm at the photo seti is open hands still bothered her something told her they were significant there were two printed cards in the large glass case to pass the time khalifa bent down to read them one card was old and said gold throne of tutankhamen circa bc the other card was new and said temporarily removed as part of world tour of tutankhamens treasures from where khalifa was standing he had a full view of erica and richard through the empty display case normally he would never approach a quarry so closely but he was now intrigued hed never been on such an assignment the day before hed felt that he saved erica from certain destruction only to be lambasted by yvon de margeau de margeau had told him hed nailed a measly civil servant but khalifa knew better the civil servant had been stalking erica and there was something about this fresh american woman that intrigued khalifa he sensed big money if de margeau had been as mad as he sounded he would have fired him but hed kept him on the twohundreddollaraday payroll and stashed him at the scheherazade hotel and now there was a new development that complicated the scene a boyfriend named richard khalifa knew that the boyfriend did not please yvon although the frenchman had told him he did not believe richard was a threat to erica but yvon did tell khalifa to be on guard and khalifa wondered if he should take it upon himself to get rid of richard as erica and richard moved to the next exhibit khalifa stepped behind another empty case with a temporarily removed card hiding behind his open guidebook he tried to catch the conversation all he got was something about the wealth of one of the great pharaohs but that also sounded like money talk to khalifa and he pressed closer he liked the feeling of excitement and danger the proximity afforded even though it was only imaginary danger there was no way these people were an actual threat to him he could kill them both in two seconds in fact the idea turned him on most of the really exquisite pieces are on exhibit in new york said erica but look at that pendant there she pointed and richard yawned all this was buried with insignificant tutankhamen try to imagine what was buried with seti i i cant said richard shifting his weight onto his other foot erica looked up sensing his boredom okay she said consolingly youve been pretty good lets head back to the hotel for a bite of lunch and see if ive gotten any messages then well walk into the bazaar khalifa watched erica walk away enjoying the tight curve of her jeans his thoughts of violence merged with others more intimate and salacious there was a message and a number for erica to call when they got back to the hotel there was also a vacant room available for richard he hesitated and gave erica a pleading look before going over to the registration desk to make the arrangements erica retired to one of the pay telephones but had no luck with the complicated machine she told richard that shed make her call from her room the message had been simple i would like the pleasure of seeing you at your earliest convenience stephanos markoulis erica shivered at the prospect of meeting with someone actually involved in the black market and possibly a murder but he had sold the first seti i statue and he could be important if she wanted to find its mate she remembered yvons admonition to choose a public place and for the first time she was actually glad that richard was with her the hotel operator was infinitely more capable than the mechanical device in the lobby the call went through quickly hello hello stephanos voice had a commanding quality this is erica baron ah yes thank you for calling i am looking forward to meeting you we have a mutual friend yvon de margeau charming fellow i believe he told you that i would call and that id like to get together for a chat can we meet this afternoon say around twothirty where do you have in mind said erica mindful of yvons warning she heard a deep rumbling sound in the distance its up to you dear said stephanos speaking louder over the background noise erica bristled at the familiarity of the word i dont know she said looking at her watch it was eleventhirty richard and she would probably be in the bazaar at twothirty how about right there in the hilton suggested stephanos i will be in the khan el khalili bazaar this afternoon said erica she thought about mentioning richard but she decided against it it seemed a good idea to retain some element of surprise just a minute said stephanos erica could hear a muffled conversation stephanos had put his hand over the receiver sorry to have kept you waiting he said in a voice that conveyed he was not sorry do you know the al azhar mosque next to the khan el khalili yes said erica she remembered yvon pointing it out to her well meet there said stephanos its easy to find twothirty im really looking forward to seeing you dear yvon de margeau had some nice things to say about you erica said goodbye and hung up she felt distinctly uneasy and even a little afraid but she had made up her mind to go through with it because of yvon she was certain he would never allow her to meet with stephanos if there was real danger involved nonetheless she wished it was over luxor am dressed in loosefitting white cotton shirt and slacks ahmed khazzan felt reasonably relaxed he still was perplexed about gamal ibrahims violent death but was able to ascribe the event to the inscrutable workings of allah and his sense of guilt abated as a leader he knew he had to face such episodes during the previous evening hed made his obligatory visit to the home of his parents he loved his mother deeply but disapproved of her decision to stay at home to care for his invalid father his mother had been one of the first women in egypt to obtain a university degree and ahmed would have preferred it if she had used her education she was a highly intelligent woman and could have been a great help to ahmed his father had been critically injured in the war the same war that had taken ahmeds older brother ahmed did not know a family in egypt that had not been touched with tragedy from the many wars and when he thought about it it made him tremble with anger after his visit to his parents ahmed had slept long and well in his own rambling mudbrick home in luxor his housekeeper had prepared a wonderful breakfast of fresh bread and coffee and zaki had called reporting that two special plainclothes agents had been dispatched to saqqara everything seemed quiet in cairo and perhaps most important he had successfully handled a potential family crisis a cousin whom he had promoted to chief guard of the necropolis of luxor had become restive and wanted to move to cairo ahmed had tried to reason with him but when that did not work he had dispensed with diplomacy and becoming angry had ordered him to stay the cousins father ahmeds uncleinlaw had tried to intervene ahmed had to remind the older man that his permit to run the concession stand in the valley of the kings could easily be revoked that being settled ahmed had been able to sit down to some paperwork so the world seemed better and more organized than the day before placing the last of the memoranda he had brought to read in his briefcase ahmed had a sense of accomplishment it would have taken him twice as long to go through the same material in cairo it was luxor he loved luxor ancient thebes for ahmed there was magic in the air that made him feel happy and at ease he stood up from his chair in the large living room his home was dazzling white stucco outside and although rustic inside it was spotlessly clean the building had been made by connecting a series of existing mudbrick structures the result was a narrow house only twenty feet wide but very deep with a long hall running on the left side a series of guestrooms opened on the right the kitchen was in the back of the house and was quite crude without running water behind the kitchen was a small courtyard bounded by a stable for his prized possession a threeyearold black arabian stallion he called sawda ahmed had ordered his houseman to have sawda saddled and ready by eleventhirty he planned to interrogate tewfik hamdi abdul hamdis son at his antique shop before lunch ahmed felt it was important to do this himself then after the midday heat had abated he planned to cross the nile and ride unannounced to the valley of the kings to inspect the new security system hed put into effect there would be time to return to cairo in the evening sawda pawed the ground impatiently when ahmed appeared the young stallion was like a renaissance study with each muscle defined in flawless black marble his face was sharply chiseled with flaring nostrils his eyes rivaled ahmeds for their black watery depth once en route ahmed sensed the sheer power and life force in the exuberant animal beneath him it was with difficulty that he kept the horse from exploding in a burst of thunderous speed ahmed knew that sawdas unpredictable personality mirrored his own volatile passions because of their similarities sharp words spoken in arabic and forceful use of the reins were needed to control the stallion so that rider and horse could move as one in the sunspeckled shade of the palms along the banks of the nile tewfik hamdis antique shop was one of many nestled within a series of dusty crooked streets behind the ancient temple of luxor they were all close to the major hotels and depended on the unsuspecting tourists for their continued existence most of the artifacts they sold were fakes manufactured on the west bank ahmed did not know the exact location of tewfik hamdis shop so once he got in the area he asked he was told the street and the number and he found the shop without difficulty but it was locked it wasnt just closed for lunch it was boarded up for the night with sawda hitched in a patch of shade ahmed inquired about tewfik in the neighboring shops the answers were consistent tewfiks shop had not been open all day and yes it was strange because tewfik hamdi had not missed a day in years one proprietor added that tewfiks absence might have something to do with his fathers recent death in cairo heading back toward sawda ahmed passed directly in front of the shop the boarded door caught his attention looking more closely ahmed found a long fresh crack in one of the boards it appeared as if a portion had been torn off and then replaced ahmed inserted his fingers between the boards and pulled there was no movement whatsoever looking up at the top of the crude shutter ahmed noticed that the boards were nailed to the doorjamb instead of being hooked from inside he decided that tewfik hamdi must have left with the expectation of being gone for some time ahmed stepped back from the building stroking his mustache then he shrugged his shoulders and walked back toward sawda he thought that it probably was true that tewfik hamdi had gone to cairo ahmed wondered how he could find out where tewfik hamdi lived en route to his horse ahmed met an old family friend and stopped to chat his thoughts however strayed beyond the exchanged pleasantries there was something particularly unsettling about tewfik nailing his door shut as soon as he could ahmed excused himself skirted the commercial block and entered the maze of open passageways that led into the area behind the shops the noontime sun beat down and reflected off the stuccoed walls bringing perspiration to his forehead he felt a rivulet of sweat trickle down the small of his back directly behind the antique shops ahmed found himself in a warren of hastily made shelters as he continued chickens scattered and naked young children paused in their play to stare at him after some difficulty and several false turns ahmed arrived at the rear door of tewfik hamdis antique shop through the slats of the door he could see a small brick courtyard while several threeyearold boys watched ahmed put his shoulder against the wooden door and forced it open far enough to enter the courtyard was about fifteen feet long with another wooden door at the far end an open doorway was on the left as ahmed returned the wooden door to its original position he saw a dark brown rat dash from the open doorway across the courtyard into a clay drainage pipe the air was heavy hot and still the open doorway led into a small room where tewfik apparently lived ahmed stepped over the threshold on a simple wooden table a rotting mango and a wedge of goat cheese lay covered with flies everything else in the room had been opened and dumped a cabinet in the corner had its door torn off papers were indiscriminately thrown about several holes had been dug in the mudbrick walls ahmed surveyed the scene with mounting anxiety trying to comprehend what had happened quickly he moved from the apartment to the door into the shop it was unlocked and swung open with an agonized rasp inside it was dark only small pencils of light penetrated the slats of the boarded front doorway and ahmed paused while his eyes adjusted from the harsh sunlight he heard the scurrying of tiny feet more rats the disarray in the shop was much greater than in the sleeping room huge cabinets lining the walls had been pulled down splintered and thrown into a large pile in the center of the room their contents had been smashed and scattered it was as if a cyclone had hit the shop ahmed had to lift portions of the broken furniture to enter he picked his way to the center of the shop then he froze hed found tewfik hamdi tortured dead tewfik had been pulled over the wooden counter which was stained with dried blood each hand had been nailed palm down to the counter with a single spike his arms spread apart almost all tewfiks fingernails had been pulled out then his wrists had been cut he had been forced to watch himself bleed to death his bloodless face was ghostly pale and a filthy rag had been stuffed in his mouth to silence his screams making his cheeks bulge grotesquely ahmed shooed away the flies he noticed the rats had been feasting on the corpse the bestiality of the scene revolted him and the fact that it had occurred in his beloved luxor enraged him with the rage came a fear that the sicknesses and sins of urban cairo would spread like a plague ahmed knew he had to contain the infestation he bent down and looked into the vacant eyes of tewfik hamdi they mirrored the horror they had witnessed as their own life had ebbed but why ahmed stood up the stench of death was overwhelming carefully he picked his way back across the debrisstrewn floor to the small courtyard the sunlight fell warm on his face and he stood there for a moment breathing deeply he knew he could not return to cairo until he knew more his thoughts turned to yvon de margeau whenever he was around there was trouble ahmed squeezed out through the door to the alley and pulled it shut behind him hed decided to go directly to the main police station near the luxor railway depot then hed call cairo mounting sawda he wondered what tewfik hamdi had done or what hed known to warrant such a fate cairo pm wonderful shop said richard as he entered from the busy alleyway good selection of merchandise i can do all my christmas shopping here erica could not believe the emptiness of the room nothing remained of antica abdul except for some bits of broken pottery it was as if the shop had never existed even the front window glass had been removed there were no beads in the entranceway no rugs or curtains not a piece of cloth or cabinetry remained i cant believe this said erica walking over to where the glass topped counter had been bending down she picked up a potsherd across here hung a heavy drape dividing the room she walked back to the rear and turned to face richard i was in here when the murder happened god it was so awful the killer was standing right where you are richard richard looked down at his feet and stepped away from the guilty spot looks like the thieves stole everything he said with the poverty here i suppose everything has a value youre undoubtedly right said erica taking a flashlight from her tote bag but the place looks more than just burglarized these holes in the wallsthey werent here before she flipped on the light and looked into the depths of some of the holes a flashlight said richard youre really prepared anyone who comes to egypt without a flashlight is making a mistake richard walked over to one of the fresh niches and scraped some of the loose dried mud onto the floor cairo vandalism i guess erica shook her head i think this place has been searched very carefully richard looked around noting how the floor had been dug up in places maybe but so what i mean what could they have been looking for erica nibbled the inside of her cheek a habit she had when concentrating richards question was reasonable perhaps cairenes regularly hid money or valuables in walls or under the floor but the violation reminded her of her own room being searched on impulse she mounted the flash attachment on her polaroid and took a photo of the interior of the shop richard sensed ericas uneasiness does it bother you to return here no said erica she did not want to stimulate richards overprotectiveness but in fact she did feel extremely uneasy within the remains of antica abdul it emphasized the reality of abdul hamdis murder weve got ten minutes to get to the al azhar mosque i want to be on time for mr stephanos markoulis she hurried out of the shop glad to leave as they entered the crowded alleyway khalifa pushed off the wall hed been leaning on his jacket was draped again over his right hand concealing the stechkin semiautomatic it was cocked raoul had told him that erica was meeting stephanos sometime during the afternoon and he did not want to lose her in the confusion of the bazaar the greek was known for his ruthless violence and khalifa was being wellpaid not to take chances erica and richard emerged from the khan el khalili at the west end of the crowded but sunfilled al azhar square its dusty heat made them appreciate the relative coolness of the bazaar they headed across the square toward the ancient mosque admiring the three needlelike minarets that rose into the pale blue sky but the going became difficult in the milling crowds they had to hold onto each other tightly to keep from being separated the area directly in front of the mosque reminded erica of haymarket in boston with hundreds of vegetable and fruit vendors with their pushcarts haggling with their customers over the price of the produce erica felt definite relief when she and richard reached the mosque and slipped through the main entrance known as the gate of the barbers the environment changed immediately the sounds from the busy square did not penetrate the stone building it was cool and somber like a mausoleum this reminds me of dressing for surgery said richard with a smile as he slipped paper covers over his shoes they walked through the entrance vestibule peering into the open doorways leading into darkened rooms the walls were constructed of large limestone blocks giving the appearance of a dungeon not a house of god i think said erica i should have been a bit more specific about where in this mosque we were going to meet passing under a series of archways she and richard were surprised to find themselves back in bright sunlight they were standing at the edge of a vast rectangular colonnaded court surrounded on all four sides by arcades with pointed persian arches it was a strange sight because the courtyard was in the heart of cairo yet was empty and almost totally silent erica and richard stood in the shade and speechlessly surveyed the scene of exotic keelshaped archways with scalloped parapets topped by arabesque crenellations erica was uneasy she was nervous about meeting stephanos markoulis and now the alien surroundings increased her fears richard took her hand and led her across the rectangular court toward an archway slightly higher than the others topped by its own dome as they crossed the court erica tried to peer into the violet shade of the surrounding porticoes there were a few whiterobed figures reclining on the limestone floor evangelos papparis moved around the marble column very slowly keeping erica and richard in view his sixth sense warned him to expect trouble he was in the northern corner of the courtyard deep within the shade of the arcade erica and richard were now heading diagonally away from him evangelos was not sure that erica was the woman he was awaiting mostly because she was accompanied but the description seemed to fit so when the couple reached the entrance arch to the mihrab he stepped back to the center of the arcade and waved his arm in a slow circular fashion then held up two fingers stephanos markoulis standing deep in the vast columned prayer room about two hundred feet away waved back from their previous plans stephanos now knew that erica had come with another person with this information he stepped around the column in front of him then leaned against it waiting to his left was a group of islamic students grouped around their teacher who was reading from the koran in a singsong evangelos papparis was about to walk down to the main entrance when he caught a glimpse of khalifa he pulled back into the shadows struggling to place the profile when he looked again the figure was already gone and richard and erica had entered the prayer area then evangelos remembered the man with the jacket suspiciously draped over his arm was khalifa khalil the assassin evangelos returned to the center of the arcade but he could not see stephanos he was confused turning he decided to see if khalil was still in the building erica had read about the al azhar mosque in the baedeker and she knew that they were looking at the original mihrab or prayer niche it was intricately constructed of minute pieces of marble and alabaster forming complicated geometric patterns this alcove faces toward mecca whispered erica this place is awesome said richard quietly in the dim light as far as he could see to the left or right was a forest of marble columns his eyes wandered to the floor around the prayer niche noticing it was covered with overlapping oriental carpets what is it that i smell he asked sniffing incense said erica listen there was a constant sound of muted voices and from where they were standing they could see numerous groups of students sitting at the feet of their teachers the mosque is not a university any longer whispered erica but it is still used for koranic studies i like the way he studies said richard pointing toward a sleeping figure curled up on an oriental rug erica turned and looked back through the series of arches to the sunlit courtyard she wanted to leave the mosque had a sinister sepulchral atmosphere and she decided it was an inappropriate spot to meet someone come on richard she took his hand but richard interested in going deeper into the pillared hall pulled back lets check out that tomb of sultan rahman you read about he said halting ericas progress toward the sunlight erica looked around at richard id prefer she didnt finish over richards shoulder she saw a man walking toward them from between the columns she knew it was stephanos markoulis noticing her expression and following her line of vision richard turned toward the approaching figure he could feel the tension in her hand knowing she wanted to meet with the man he wondered why she was agitated erica baron said stephanos with a broad smile id recognize you in a crowd of a thousand you are far more beautiful than yvon suggested stephanos did not try to conceal his appreciation mr markoulis questioned erica although there was no doubt in her mind his unctuous manner and greasy appearance coincided with her expectations what she didnt expect was the large gold christian cross around his neck within the mosque its sheen seemed provocative of violence stephanos christos markoulis said the greek proudly this is richard harvey said erica pulling richard forward stephanos glanced at richard then ignored him i would like to speak to you alone erica he extended his hand ignoring stephanos gesture erica grasped richards hand more firmly id prefer richard to stay as you wish this is a rather melodramatic spot said erica stephanos laughed and the sound echoed between the columns indeed but remember it was your idea not to meet at the hilton i think wed better make this short said richard he had no idea what was going on but he did not like to see erica upset stephanos smile faded he was not used to being opposed what do you want to speak to me about said erica abdul hamdi said stephanos matteroffactly remember him erica wanted to give as little information as possible yes she said well tell me what you know about him did he tell you anything out of the ordinary did he give you any letters or papers why said erica defiantly why should i tell you what i know perhaps we can help each other said stephanos are you interested in antiquities yes said erica well then i can help you what are you interested in a large lifesize seti i statue said erica leaning forward to gauge her words effect on stephanos if he were surprised he did not show it youre speaking about very serious business he said finally have you any idea of the sums involved yes said erica actually she had no idea it was hard to even guess did hamdi talk to you about such a statue asked stephanos his voice had a new seriousness he did said erica the fact that she knew so little made her feel particularly vulnerable did hamdi say from whom hed obtained the statue or where it was going stephanos face was deadly serious and erica shivered a little despite the heat she tried to decide what stephanos hoped to learn from her it had to be where the statue was going before the murder it must have been on its way to athens without looking up erica spoke softly he didnt tell me who sold him the statue she deliberately left the second part of stephanos question unanswered she knew she was gambling but if it worked then stephanos would think she had been told some secrets then perhaps she could get something out of him but the conversation was cut short suddenly a massive figure materialized from the shadows behind stephanos erica saw a huge bald head with a gaping knife wound that ran from the crown down over the bridge of the nose onto the right cheek the wound looked like it had been made with a razor despite its depth it was barely bleeding the mans hand reached for stephanos and erica gasped digging her nails into richards hand with surprising agility stephanos reacted to ericas warning he spun falling to the right his right leg cocked for what would have been a karate kick at the last moment he checked himself recognizing evangelos what happened asked stephanos with alarm regaining his feet khalifa rasped evangelos khalifa is in the mosque stephanos pushed the weakened evangelos against a column for support and rapidly looked around from beneath his left arm he extracted a tiny but lethallooking beretta automatic and snapped off the safety at the sight of the gun erica and richard shrank against each other in total disbelief before they could respond a bloodcurdling scream reverberated through the vast prayer hall because of the echoes it was difficult to determine where it had come from as it trailed off the koranic murmuring stopped there was a dreadful silence like the calm before a holocaust no one moved from where erica and richard were huddled they could see several groups of students with their teachers they too reflected confusion and mounting fear what was happening suddenly shots rang out and the deadly sound of ricocheting bullets echoed through the marbled enclosure erica and richard as well as stephanos and evangelos ducked down not even knowing in which direction the danger lay khalifa rasped evangelos other screams penetrated the prayer room followed by a kind of vibration all at once erica realized it was the sound of running feet the groups of students had stood up and were facing north suddenly they turned and ran bearing down on her was a crowd of panicked people fleeing through the forest of columns there were more shots the crowd became a stampede ignoring the two greeks erica and richard jumped to their feet and fled southward racing hand in hand around the columns trying to stay ahead of the panicky horde that pressed behind them they ran blindly until they reached the end of the hall a few of the students passed them wideeyed with terror as if the building were on fire erica and richard followed them as they ducked through a low door and ran down a stone passageway it opened into a mausoleum beyond was an opening where a heavy wooden door was ajar leading to the outside they ran out into the dusty street where an excited crowd had already gathered erica and richard did not join it but slowed to a fast walk and left the area this place is insane said richard his voice more angry than relieved what the hell was going on in there he didnt expect an answer and erica did not respond for three days in a row she had been forced to witness unexpected violence and on each occasion the attack had seemed more closely associated with her coincidence was no longer a viable explanation richard gripped her hand pulling her behind him through the crowded streets he wanted to put as much distance as possible between them and the al azhar mosque richard said erica finally holding her side richard lets slow down they stopped in front of a tailor shop richards mouth was set in anger this stephanos did you have any idea hed be armed i was somewhat concerned about meeting him but i just answer the question erica did you think he would be armed i did not even consider it she did not like richards tone of voice obviously it was something you should have considered anyway who is this stephanos markoulis he is an antiquities dealer from athens apparently hes involved in the black market and how was the meeting if you can call it that arranged a friend asked me if id see stephanos and who is this wonderful friend who sends you into the hands of a gangster his name is yvon de margeau hes french and what kind of friend is he erica looked at richards face now flushed with anger still trembling from their experience erica did not know how to cope with his emotion im sorry about what happened she said with mixed feelings about apologizing well said richard crossly i could repeat what you said last night when i tried to apologize about scaring you saying sorry is supposed to make everything okay but it doesnt you could have gotten us killed i think your escapade has gone far enough were going to the american embassy and youre coming back to boston if i have to drag you on the plane by your hair richard said erica shaking her head an empty taxi was slowly picking its way along the crowded streets richard saw the car over ericas shoulder and hailed it as the crowds reluctantly parted they climbed into the back seat without speaking and richard told the driver to go to the hilton hotel erica felt a combination of anger and despair if richard had taken it upon himself to direct the driver to the american embassy she would have gotten out of the car after ten minutes of silence richard finally spoke his voice had mellowed slightly the fact is that you are not equipped for this kind of affair you have to recognize that with my background in egyptology snapped erica i think im superbly equipped locked in traffic the taxi inched past one of cairos huge medieval gates and erica studied it first through the side then the rear window egyptology is the study of a dead civilization said richard lifting his hand in the air as if to pat her knee it has no relevance to the current problem erica looked over at richard dead civilization no relevance the words confirmed richards concept of her work it was belittling and infuriating you are trained as an academician continued richard and i think you should accept that fact this cloakanddagger routine is childish and dangerous its a ridiculous risk for a statue any statue this isnt just any statue said erica angrily besides the issue is much more involved than you are willing to comprehend i think its all too obvious a statue worth a lot of money is unearthed such sums can explain all sorts of behavior but its a problem for the authorities not tourists erica clenched her teeth bristling at the label tourist as the taxi started to move more quickly she tried to understand why yvon had allowed her to meet with stephanos nothing seemed to make any sense and she tried to decide what to do next she had no intention of giving up no matter what richard said abdul hamdi seemed to be the pivot then she remembered his son and her earlier resolve to visit his antique shop in luxor richard leaned forward and tapped the driver on the shoulder do you speak english the driver nodded a little do you know where the american embassy is yes said the driver he looked at richard in the rearview mirror we are not going to the american embassy said erica pronouncing each word carefully and loudly enough for the driver to hear im afraid im going to insist said richard he turned to speak to the driver you can insist on whatever you want erica said evenly but thats not where im going driver stop the car she moved forward on the seat pulling her tote bag onto her shoulder keep driving richard instructed trying to pull erica back into her seat stop the taxi erica shouted the driver complied pulling over to the side erica had the door open before the car reached a standstill and leaped to the sidewalk richard followed leaving the taxi unpaid the irate driver drove slowly alongside as richard overtook erica and caught her arm it is time to stop this adolescent behavior he shouted as if threatening an errant child we are going to the american embassy youre over your head youre going to get hurt richard said erica tapping his chin with her index finger you go to the american embassy if you want im going to luxor believe me the embassy can do nothing at all about this even if they were so inclined im going to go to upper egypt and do what i came here for erica if you persist im going to leave ill go back to boston i mean it ive come all the way over here and it doesnt seem to matter to you i just cannot believe it erica didnt say anything she just wanted him to leave and if i do leave i dont know what will happen to our relationship richard said erica quietly i am going to upper egypt with the afternoon sun low in the sky the nile appeared like a flat ribbon of silver sudden highlights sparkled from the surface where gusts of wind stirred the water erica had to shield her eyes from the sun to distinguish the timeless form of the pyramids the sphinx looked as if it were made of gold she was standing on the balcony of her room at the hilton it was almost time to leave the management had been overjoyed at her decision to vacate her room because as usual they had overbooked erica had packed and her single suitcase was ready the travel desk in the lobby had arranged a booking for her on the seventhirty sleeper south the thought of the trip managed to dull the fear of the last few days and alleviate her feelings about fighting with richard the temple of karnak the valley of the kings abu simbel denderathese were the reasons she had come to egypt she would go south see abduls son but concentrate on viewing the fabled monuments at first hand she was glad richard had decided to leave she would not think about their relationship until she returned home then they would see checking the bathroom for the final time erica was rewarded by finding her cream rinse behind the shower curtain she shoved it in her bag and checked the time it was a quarter to six she was about to leave for the train station when the phone rang it was yvon did you see stephanos he asked cheerfully i did said erica she allowed an awkward pause she had not called because she was angry he had subjected her to such danger well what did he say asked yvon very little it was what he did that was important he had a gun we had just met at the al azhar mosque when a huge bald man appeared who looked like hed been beaten he told stephanos that someone named khalifa was there then all hell broke loose yvon how could you have asked me to meet such a man my god said yvon erica i want you to stay in your room until i call back im sorry yvon but i was just leaving in fact im leaving cairo leaving i thought you were officially detained said yvon with surprise im not supposed to leave the country said erica i called ahmed khazzans office and informed them i was going to luxor it was fine with them erica stay until i call back is your boyfriend planning on going with you hes returning to the states he was as upset about meeting stephanos as i was thanks for calling yvon keep in touch erica hung up the phone very deliberately she knew yvon had used her as bait in some way although she believed in yvons crusade against the antiquities black market she did not like being used the phone rang again but she ignored it it took over an hour for the taxi to go from the hilton to the central railway station although erica had carefully showered for the trip within fifteen minutes her blouse was soaked with perspiration and her back stuck to the hot vinyl seat cover the railway station stood in a busy square behind an ancient statue of ramses ii whose timeless appearance was in sharp contrast to the mad rushhour commotion the inside of the station was jammed with people ranging from businessmen in western clothes to farmers carrying empty produce containers although erica was aware of some stares no one tried to accost her and she moved easily through the crowds there was a short line in front of the sleepingcar window and erica had no trouble purchasing her ticket she planned to break her trip at a small village called balianeh and do a little sightseeing at the large kiosk she bought a twodayold herald tribune an italian fashion magazine and several popular books on the discovery of tutankhamens tomb she even bought another copy of carters book even though shed read it many times the time passed quickly and she heard her train announced a nubian porter with a wonderful smile took her bag and stowed it at the foot of her berth the porter told her that they did not expect the car to be full so she could spread her things out over two seats she put her tote on the floor and leaned back with the herald tribune hello said a pleasant voice slightly startling her yvon she said truly surprised hello erica im amazed i found you may i sit down erica picked up her reading material from the seat next to her i took a chance you were going south by train all the flights had been booked for some time erica gave a halfsmile although she was still angry she couldnt help but be a little flattered that yvon had followed her obviously with some effort his hair was disheveled as if he had been running erica i want to apologize for whatever happened when you met stephanos nothing really happened what bothered me was what could have happened you must have had some idea because you said to meet him in a public place indeed i did but i was only concerned because of stephanos reputation with women i didnt want you to be subjected to any uncomfortable overtures the train lurched slightly and yvon stood looking up and down the aisle satisfied that the train was not pulling out he sat back down i still owe you a dinner said yvon that was our deal please stay in cairo i have learned some things about the killers of abdul hamdi what asked erica that they were not from cairo i have some photos id like you to see perhaps you could recognize one did you bring them no they are at the hotel there wasnt time yvon im leaving for luxor ive made up my mind erica you can go to luxor whenever you wish i have a plane i can fly you there tomorrow erica looked down at her hands despite her anger despite her misgivings she could feel her resolve weakening at the same time she was tired of being protected taken care of thank you for the offer yvon but i think ill go by train ill call you from luxor there was the sound of a whistle it was seventhirty erica said yvon but the train began to move forward all right call from luxor perhaps ill see you there he dashed down the aisle and jumped from the train which was now picking up speed damn said yvon as he watched the train slide from the station he turned into the busy waiting room by the exit he met khalifa why arent you on that train snapped yvon khalifa smiled slyly i was told to follow the girl in cairo nothing was said about taking a train to the south christ said yvon walking toward a side door follow me raoul was waiting in the car he started the engine when he saw yvon yvon held open a rear door for khalifa then climbed in after him what happened in the mosque asked yvon as they pulled out into the traffic trouble said khalifa the girl met stephanos but stephanos had posted a guard in order to protect her i had to break up the meeting i had no choice it was a bad location almost as bad as the serapeum yesterday but in deference to your sensibilities there was no killing i shouted a few times and fired off a couple of shots and cleared out the whole mosque khalifa laughed contemptuously thank you for considering my sensibilities but tell me did stephanos threaten or make any move against erica baron i dont know said khalifa but that was what you were supposed to find out said yvon i was supposed to protect the girl then learn what i could said khalifa under the circumstances protecting the girl took all my attention yvon turned his head and watched a bicyclist go by balancing a large tray of bread on his head and making better time than they were in the car yvon felt frustrated things were going poorly and now erica baron his last hope for the seti statue had left cairo he looked at khalifa i hope youre ready to travel because youre going to luxor tonight by air whatever you say said khalifa this job is getting interesting day balianeh am balianeh in one hour said the porter through the curtain of her berth thank you said erica sitting up and pulling back the drape covering a small window outside it was very early daybreak the sky was a light purple and she could see low desert mountains in the distance the train was moving rapidly with slight toandfro movements the tracks ran right along the edge of the libyan desert erica washed at her small sink and put on a bit of makeup the night before shed tried to read one of the books on tutankhamen that shed purchased at the station but the trains movements had cradled her instantly asleep it was some time in the middle of the night that she had awakened long enough to turn off the reading light they served an english breakfast in the dining car as the first tentative rays of sunlight cleared the eastern horizon as she watched the sky changed from purple to a clear light blue it was incredibly beautiful sipping her coffee erica felt as if a burden had lifted from her shoulders in its place was a euphoric sense of freedom she felt as if the train were hurtling her back in time back to ancient egypt and the land of the pharaohs it was a little after six when she detrained at balianeh very few passengers got off and the train departed as soon as the last foot touched the platform with some difficulty erica checked her suitcase at a baggage window then walked out of the station into the bright bustle of the small rural town there was a gaiety in the air the people seemed much happier than the oppressive crowds of cairo but it was hotter even this early in the morning erica could feel the difference there were a number of old taxis waiting in the shade of the station most of the drivers were asleep their mouths gaping but when one spotted erica they all got up and began chattering finally a slender fellow was pushed forward he had a large untrimmed mustache and a ragged beard but he seemed pleased with his luck and made a bow in front of erica before opening the door to his ish taxi he knew a few words of english including cigarette erica gave him a few and he immediately agreed to serve as her driver promising to return her to the station to catch the fivepm connection to luxor the cost was five egyptian pounds they headed north out of the town then turned away from the nile to the west with his portable radio lashed to the dash so that its aerial could stick out of the missing window on the right the driver smiled his contentment on either side of the road stretched a sea of sugarcane broken by an occasional oasis of palm trees they crossed a foulsmelling irrigation ditch and passed through the village of el araba el mudfuna it was a sorry collection of mudbrick huts built just beyond the reach of the cultivated fields there were few people in evidence except for a group of women dressed in black carrying large water jars on their heads erica looked at them again they were wearing veils a few hundred yards beyond the village the driver halted and pointed ahead seti he said without taking the cigarette from his mouth erica climbed out of the car so here it was abydos the place seti i chose to build his magnificent temple just as erica started to get out her guidebook she was set upon by a group of youths selling scarabs she was the first tourist of the day and only by paying her fiftypiaster entrance fee and advancing into the temple proper could she free herself from their insistent chatter with the baedeker in hand she sat on a limestone block and read the section on abydos she was familiar with the site but wanted to be certain which sections had been decorated with hieroglyphics during the reign of seti i the temple had been finished by setis son and successor ramses ii unaware of ericas plans to visit abydos khalifa stood on the platform at luxor waiting for the passengers to disembark the train had pulled in on time and was greeted by a huge throng who eagerly pressed in on the train there was a lot of commotion and shouting particularly by the hawkers selling fruit and cold drinks through the windowless openings of the thirdclass coaches to the passengers continuing on to aswan those people detraining and those boarding jostled each other in a mounting frenzy because whistles began to blow egyptian trains ran on time khalifa lit one cigarette and then another allowing the smoke to snake up past his hooked nose he was standing apart from the chaos at a place where he could view the entire platform as well as the main exit a few late passengers scurried to catch the train as it began to pull out of the station there was no sign of erica when he finished his cigarette khalifa left the building by the main entrance he headed for the central post office to make a call to cairo something was wrong abydos am erica walked from one incredible room to the next as she explored the temple of seti i at last she could experience all the electrifying mystery of egypt the relief work was magnificent she planned to return to abydos in several days to do some serious translation work on the wealth of hieroglyphic inscription that covered the walls of the temple complex for the moment she just scanned the texts to see if the name tutankhamen ever appeared among setis inscriptions it didnt except in the room called the gallery of kings where almost all the ancient egyptian pharaohs were listed in chronological order as she walked through the inner chambers where the roofing slabs were still in place she used her flashlight to view the hieroglyphics silently erica repeated an abbreviated translation of the phrase on the seti i statue eternal rest granted to seti i who rules after tutankhamen she admitted the phrase did not make any more sense to her standing in seti is temple than it did on the balcony of the room in the hilton rummaging in her bag erica pulled out the photo of the hieroglyphic inscription on the statue she looked about the temple for any similar combination of signs it was a slow process and ultimately unrewarding at first she couldnt even find setis name written in the same way as it was on the statue linked to the god osiris in the temple it usually identified him with the god horus morning melted happily into afternoon leaving erica oblivious of the heat and of her appetite it was after three when she passed through the chapel of osiris into the gods inner sanctuary it had once been a splendid hall whose roof had been supported by ten columns now sun drenched the room with light illuminating the magnificent reliefs associated with the cult of osiris the god of the dead there were no other tourists in the ruined hall and erica moved slowly undisturbed in her appreciation of the craftsmanship of the sculptured murals at the far end of the empty hall she came to a low doorway inside it was dark consulting her baedeker she found the room beyond was described simply as a chamber with four columns scoffing at her own misgivings erica took out her flashlight and ducked under the low door slowly she let the beam of light play upon the walls columns and ceiling of the deathly silent room with great care she picked her way over the irregular floor and moved around the heavy columns against the far wall were the openings to the three chapels of isis seti i and horus eagerly erica entered the chapel of seti i its location within the sanctuary of osiris was encouraging no daylight penetrated the small chapel ericas flashlight illuminated only a small area the rest of the room was lost in darkness she started to run the light around the room but almost immediately glimpsed amid the hieroglyphics a cartouche of seti i exactly as it had been written on the statue it was seti identified with osiris erica scanned the hieroglyphics in the neighborhood of the cartouche guessing the text ran vertically from left to right without translating word for word she quickly understood that the small chapel had been completed after setis death and had been used in the osiris ritual then she came to something strange it appeared to be a proper name incredible proper names did not appear on pharaonic monuments erica pieced together the sounds nenephta erica moved the beam of light to the floor preparing to put her bag down she wanted a photo of the curious name she started to bend over but then froze within the circle of light was a cobra its head raised and body arched its forked tongue lashing out like a miniature whip its yellow eyes with black slitlike pupils staring at her with deadly concentration erica was paralyzed with fear it wasnt until the snake moved by lowering its head and sliding off its perch that erica was able to look behind her toward the low door of the chapel after another glance at the retiring snake she fled out into the sunlight and returned to the ticket booth on shaky legs the guard thanked erica for the information and told her that theyd been trying to kill that cobra for many years the sanctuary of osiris was then closed temporarily despite the episode with the snake it was with reluctance that she left the site for the drive back to balianeh it had been a wonderful day her only disappointment was that shed have to wait for a photograph of the name nenephta erica intended to crossreference that name and wondered if it was one of seti is viziers the train for luxor departed only five minutes late erica settled into her seat with the tutankhamen books but her attention was drawn to the scenery outside the nile valley began to narrow so that in places it was easy to see from one side of the area of cultivated fields to the other as the sun neared the western horizon erica began to notice the people returning to their homes children riding on water buffalo men leading donkeys straining beneath their burdens erica could see into courtyards and wondered if the people in their mudbrick houses felt security and love like in the pastoral mythsor were they continuously aware of their precarious hold on life in a sense their lives were timeless a borrowed moment of time at nag hammadi the train crossed the nile from the west bank to the east bank and entered a long stretch of sugarcane that blocked any view of the countryside erica returned to her books picking up the discovery of the tomb of tutankhamen by howard carter and a c mace she began reading and despite her familiarity with the book was immediately entranced it was a recurrent surprise that the dry and meticulous carter wrote with a genuine flair the excitement of the discovery was communicated from every page and erica found herself reading faster and faster as if it were a thriller as they occurred in the book erica studied the superb collection of photos taken by harry burton she found the plate showing two lifesize bituminized statues of tutankhamen that guarded the sealed entrance to the burial chamber particularly interesting comparing them to the seti statue she comprehended for the first time that she was one of the few people who knew the seti statues were a matched pair that was very significant because the probability of finding two such statues was very small while the chance of other artifacts now being unearthed in the same location was very great suddenly erica recognized that the site where the seti statues had been found could be as important archaeologically as the statues themselves perhaps locating the site was a more reasonable goal than finding the statue erica looked out the window at the blur of the sugarcane thinking probably the best way of learning where the statues had been discovered was for her to pose as a serious antiquities buyer for the museum of fine arts if she could convince people she was willing to pay top dollar she might be shown some valuable pieces if more seti material appeared perhaps she could learn the source there were a lot of ifs but it was a plan particularly if abdul hamdis son could not provide further information the conductor came through the train announcing luxor erica felt a thrill of anticipation she knew that luxor is to egypt what florence is to italy the jewel outside the station there was another surprise the only taxis left were horsedrawn carriages smiling with pleasure erica already loved luxor when she arrived at the winter palace hotel she discovered why it had been so easy to get a reservation despite the number of tourists the hotel was being renovated and to get to her room she had to walk down a carpetless hall on the second floor covered with piles of building blocks sand and plaster only a few of the rooms were being used but the renovation did not dampen her spirits she loved the hotel it had an elegant victorian charm across the formal garden was the new winter palace hotel in contrast to the building she was in it was a modern highrise structure with little character she was pleased to be where she was instead of air conditioning ericas room had an extraordinarily high ceiling complete with a slowmoving largebladed fan a pair of french doors opened onto a graceful wroughtiron balcony that looked over the nile there was no shower the tiled bathroom was dominated by a huge porcelain bathtub that erica immediately filled to the top she had just managed to step into the refreshing water when the antique phone jangled in the other room for a moment she debated not answering it then curiosity overcame inconvenience and grabbing a towel from the rack she walked into the bedroom and picked up the receiver welcome to luxor miss baron it was ahmed khazzan for a moment his voice brought back all her fears even though she had decided to pursue the statue of seti she felt she had left the violence and dangers behind in cairo now the authorities seemed to have already tracked her down still his tone was friendly i hope you enjoy your stay he said im sure i will answered erica i did notify your office yes i got the message thats why im calling i asked the hotel to tell me when you arrived so that i could welcome you you see miss baron i have a home in luxor i come here as frequently as possible i see said erica wondering where the conversation was leading ahmed cleared his throat well miss baron i was wondering if you would care to have dinner with me tonight is this an official or social invitation mr khazzan purely social i can have a carriage pick you up at seven thirty erica debated rapidly it seemed quite innocuous all right id be delighted wonderful said ahmed obviously pleased tell me miss baron do you like to ride erica shrugged in truth she hadnt ridden a horse for a number of years but as a child she had loved it and the idea of seeing the ancient city on horseback appealed to her yes she said tentatively even better said ahmed wear something you can ride in and ill show you a little of luxor holding on for her life erica let the black stallion have his head as they reached the edge of the desert the animal responded with a surge of speed and thundered up the small sand hill galloping along the crest of the ridge for almost a mile finally erica reined him in to wait for ahmed the sun had just set but it was light and erica could look down onto the ruins of the temple of karnak across the river the mountains of thebes rose sharply beyond the irrigated fields she could even make out some of the entranceways to the tombs of the nobles erica was hypnotized by the scene and the heaving animal between her legs made her feel as if she had been transported into the past ahmed rode up beside her but did not speak he sensed her thoughts and did not want to interrupt erica stole a quick glance at his sharp profile in the soft light he was dressed in loosefitting white cotton with the shirt open to midchest and the sleeves rolled to the elbows his black shining hair was tousled by the wind and tiny drops of perspiration lined his forehead erica was still surprised by his invitation and unable to forget his official capacity he had been cordial since her arrival but not communicative she wondered if his intent still lay with yvon de margeau beautiful here isnt it he said at last gorgeous said erica she struggled with the stallion now eager to move on i love luxor he turned to erica his face serious yet puzzled erica was certain he was going to say something more but he just looked at her for several minutes and then turned back to the vista over the nile as they watched in silence the shadows within the ruins deepened heralding the coming night im sorry he said finally you must be starved lets have our dinner they rode back toward ahmeds rustic house skirting the temple of karnak and riding along the nile they passed a felucca landing where the men were singing softly while furling their sails for the night when they arrived at ahmeds house erica helped with the horses then they both washed their hands in a wooden tub in the courtyard before going inside ahmeds housekeeper had prepared a feast and served it in the living room ericas favorite was ful a dip made of beans lentils and eggplant it was covered with sesame oil and subtly seasoned with garlic peanuts and caraway ahmed was surprised shed not had it before the main course was fowl which erica thought was cornish hen ahmed explained it was hamama or pigeon it had been grilled over charcoal within his home ahmed relaxed and conversation became easy he asked erica hundreds of questions about growing up in ohio she felt a little selfconscious when she described her jewish background and was surprised that it made no difference to ahmed he explained that in egypt the confrontation was a political issue and involved israel not jews people did not think of them as synonymous ahmed was particularly interested in ericas apartment in cambridge and he had her describe all sorts of trivial details only when she had finished did he tell her he had gone to harvard as the meal progressed she found him reserved but not secretive he was willing to talk about himself if asked he had a wonderful way of speaking with a slight english accent from his days at oxford where he had gotten his doctorate he was a sensitive man and after erica asked if he had dated any american girls he told her about pamela with such feeling that erica felt tears welling in her eyes then he shocked her with the ending he had left boston for england and just cut off the relationship you mean you never corresponded asked erica with disbelief never said ahmed quietly but why pleaded erica she loved happy endings and abhorred unhappy ones i knew that i had to come back here to my country said ahmed looking away i was needed here i was expected to run the antiquities service at that time there was no room for romance have you ever seen pamela again no erica took a sip of her tea the story about pamela awakened uncomfortable feelings about men and abandonment ahmed did not seem the type she wanted to change the subject did any of your family visit you in massachusetts no ahmed paused then added actually my uncle did come to the states just before i left no one visited and you didnt go home for three years thats right its a bit far going from egypt to boston werent you lonely and homesick terribly until pamela did your uncle meet pamela ahmed exploded he threw his teacup against the wall and it shattered in a hundred pieces erica was stunned the arab dropped his head in his hands and she could hear his heavy breathing an awkward silence prevailed as erica sat torn between fear and empathy she wondered about pamela and the uncle what had happened that could still evoke such passion forgive me ahmed said his head still bowed im sorry if i said something wrong said erica putting down her teacup perhaps id better return to my hotel no dont go please said ahmed lifting his head his face was flushed it isnt your fault its just that ive been under a certain strain dont go please ahmed jumped up to refresh ericas tea and got another cup for himself then in an attempt to lighten the atmosphere he brought out some antiquities that the department had recently confiscated erica admired them especially a beautifully carved wooden figure she began to feel more comfortable have any articles from seti i been confiscated from the black market she carefully put the pieces on a nearby table ahmed looked at her for several minutes thinking no i dont think so why do you ask oh no real reason except that i visited setis temple at abydos today by the way are you familiar with a problem they have there with a cobra cobras are a potential problem at all the sites especially in aswan i suppose we really should warn the tourists but it isnt a problem at the more popular sites it cant compare with our difficulties with the black market only four years ago there was a major looting of carved blocks from the temple of hathor at dendera in broad daylight erica nodded her understanding if nothing else this trip has underlined for me the destructive power of the black market in fact along with my translation work ive decided to try to do something about it ahmed looked up suddenly its a dangerous business i dont recommend it at all to give you an idea about two years ago a young idealistic american fellow came over here from yale with similar goals he disappeared without a trace well said erica im no hero i just have some very tame ideas i wanted to ask if you knew the location of abdul hamdis sons antique shop here in luxor ahmed averted his face the spectacle of tewfik hamdis tortured body flashed in his mind when he turned back to erica his face was strained tewfik hamdi like his father has recently been murdered there is some trouble going on which i do not understand but which my department and the police are investigating you have already had your share of difficulties so i implore you to concentrate on your translation work erica was stunned by the news of tewfik hamdi another murder she tried to think of what that could mean but by now her long day had begun to take its toll ahmed noticed her fatigue and offered to accompany her to her hotel to which erica readily agreed they reached the hotel before eleven and after thanking ahmed for his hospitality erica retired carefully locking herself within her room she undressed slowly anticipating bed while removing her makeup she thought about ahmed his intensity impressed her and despite his outburst shed thoroughly enjoyed the evening with her bedtime ritual accomplished she crawled beneath the sheets just before sleep overcame her she thought about ahmed and pamela she wondered but her last thought was a name from the ancient past nenephta day luxor am the excitement of being in luxor woke erica before sunrise she ordered breakfast from room service and had it served on the balcony with the breakfast came a telegram from yvon arriving new winter palace hotel today stop would love to see you tonight erica was surprised she had been so sure the telegram was going to be from richard and after spending the evening with ahmed she was confused it was incredible to think that only last year she had been anxiously hoping richard would propose now she found herself attracted to three very different men at the same time although it was reassuring for erica that she could be responsive which had been a worry when her relationship with richard began to crack the present situation was also unnerving she drank the rest of her coffee in one gulp and decided to put all emotional issues out of her head pushing back from the table she returned to her room and prepared for the day emptying her tote bag she repacked it with the box lunch shed ordered at the suggestion of the hotel the flashlight the matches and cigarettes and abdul hamdis baedeker the loose cover and other assorted papers were put on the bureau before she turned away erica again saw the name on the cover nasef malmud shari el tahrir cairo her connection with abdul hamdi had not been completely severed by tewfiks murder she would look up nasef malmud when she returned to cairo carefully she put the cover in her bag it was a short walk from the winter palace hotel to the antiquities shops on shari lukanda some were still not open despite the fact that there already were a number of brightly clad tourists in evidence erica chose one randomly and entered the shop was reminiscent of antica abdul but with significantly more artifacts erica went over the more impressive specimens isolating the real from the fake the proprietor a heavyset man named david jouran initially hovered over her but then retreated behind his counter out of dozens of allegedly prehistoric pots erica found only two she thought were real and they were ordinary she held one up how much fifty pounds said jouran the one next to that is ten pounds erica looked at the other pot it had beautiful decorations too beautiful they were spirals but going in the wrong direction erica knew that predynastic pottery frequently had spirals but they were all counterclockwise spirals the spirals on the present pot were all clockwise im only interested in antiques actually i find very few genuine pieces in here im hoping to find something special she put down the fake pot and walked over to the counter ive been sent here to buy some particularly good antiques preferably from the new kingdom im prepared to pay do you have anything to show me david jouran regarded erica for a few moments without answering then he bent over opened a small cabinet and heaved a scarred granite head of ramses ii onto the counter the nose was gone and the chin was cracked erica shook her head no she said looking around is that the best you have for now jouran put the broken statue away well let me leave my name said erica writing on a slip of paper im staying at the winter palace if you hear of any special pieces get in touch with me she paused halfexpecting the man to show her something else but he just shrugged and after an awkward silence she left it was a similar story in the next five shops she entered no one showed her anything extraordinary the best piece she saw was a glazed ushabti figurine from the time of queen hatshepsut in each shop she left her name but she didnt feel very hopeful finally she gave up and walked to the ferry landing it cost only a few cents to cross to the west bank on the old boat which was crowded with cameratoting tourists as soon as they landed the group was set upon by an enormous band of taxi drivers wouldbe guides and scarab salesmen erica boarded a dilapidated bus with a valley of the kings painted haphazardly on a piece of cardboard when all the ferry passengers had been absorbed in one way or another the bus left the landing erica was beside herself with excitement beyond the flat green cultivated fields which ended abruptly at the deserts edge stood the stark theban cliffs at their base erica could see some of the famous monuments like the graceful temple of hatshepsut at deir elbahri immediately to the right of hatshepsuts temple was a small village called qurna built into the sloping hillside the mudbrick buildings were set in the desert beyond the irrigated fields most were a light tan not too dissimilar from the color of the sandstone cliffs a few buildings were whitewashed and stood out sharply particularly a small mosque with a stubby minaret in among the buildings were openings cut into the bedrock these were doorways into the myriad of ancient crypts the people of qurna lived among the tombs of the nobles many attempts had been made to relocate the villagers but the people had tenaciously resisted the bus careened around a sharp turn and then bore right at a fork erica caught a fleeting glimpse of the mortuary temple of seti i there was so much to see the desert began with a remarkably sharp demarcation line desolate rock and sand without a single growing plant replaced the verdant sugarcane fields the road ran straight until it reached the mountains then it became serpentine leading into a progressively narrow valley the ovenlike heat was intense and there was no wind to relieve the feeling of oppression after passing a tiny rock guard station the bus pulled up in a large parking area already filled with other buses and taxis despite the plus temperature the area was dense with tourists on a small rise to the left a concession stand was doing swift business erica donned a khakicolored hat shed bought as protection against the sun it was hard for her to believe that she had finally arrived in the valley of the kings the site of the discovery of the tomb of tutankhamen the valley was hemmed in by jagged mountains and dominated by a sharp triangular peak that looked like a natural pyramid sheer rock faces of brown limestone dropped down into the valley and met the neat tracks lined with little stones that radiated from the parking area at the juncture of the cliffs and the paths were the black openings of the tombs of the kings although most of the passengers on the bus had repaired to the concession stand for cool drinks erica hurried to the entrance of seti is tomb she knew that it was the largest and most spectacular in the valley and she wanted to visit it first to see if she could find the name nenephta catching her breath she stepped over the threshold into the past although she had known the decorations were wellpreserved once she saw them herself their pristine hues surprised her the paint looked as freshly applied as yesterday she walked slowly through the entrance corridor then down another stairway her eyes glued to the wall decorations there were images of seti in the company of the entire pantheon of egyptian deities on the ceiling were huge vultures with stylistically outstretched wings voluminous hieroglyphic texts of the book of the dead separated the images erica had to wait for a large tour group before she could pass a wooden bridge spanning a deep shaft looking into the depths of the well erica wondered if it had been constructed to thwart tomb robbers beyond it was a gallery supported by four robust pillars then there was another stairway which had been sealed and carefully hidden in ancient times as she had descended ever deeper into the tomb erica marveled at the herculean effort it had taken to handcarve the rock by the time she had descended the fourth stairway and was several hundred yards into the mountain she noticed that the air was considerably harder to breathe she wondered what it had been like for the struggling ancient workmen there was no ventilation despite the continuous stream of gawking visitors and the low oxygen gave erica a feeling of suffocation she did not suffer from claustrophobia but was not fond of being closed in and had to consciously suppress her misgivings once in the burial chamber erica tried to ignore her labored breathing and craned her neck to admire the astronomical motifs on the vaulted ceiling she also noted one of the tunnels dug in relatively recent times by an individual who was certain he knew the location of additional secret rooms nothing had been found although she was growing more and more anxious in the confines of the tomb she convinced herself she should visit a small side room where there was a wellknown representation of the sky goddess nut in the form of a cow she navigated through the tourists to the doorway but looking into the room she could see that it was practically filled with people and decided to forgo seeing nut turning suddenly she bumped into a man entering the room behind her i beg your pardon said erica the man flashed a smile before turning and walking back into the burial chamber another group of tourists entered and erica found herself forced against her will into the small room desperately she tried to calm herself but the man who had blocked her way unnerved her shed seen him beforeblack hair black suit and a crooked smile revealing a pointed front tooth that she remembered from the egyptian museum in cairo knowing that tourists frequent the same places erica wondered why the man made her feel alarmed she knew she was acting absurdly and that her fear was just a combination of the weird events of the last few days plus the hot stuffy atmosphere of the tomb hiking her tote strap higher on her shoulder erica forced herself out into the burial chamber the man was not in sight a small flight of steps rose to the upper part of the room leading to the exit erica started up the steps her eyes scanning the area she had to keep herself from running then she stopped moving quickly behind one of the square pillars on her left was the same man it was just a fleeting glimpse but now erica was convinced she was not imagining things that the man was acting strangely he was stalking her impulsively she mounted the remaining steps and slipped behind a column the room contained four pillars each facade decorated with a colored lifesize relief of seti i before one of the egyptian gods erica waited her heart pounding unwillingly remembering the way violence had been exploding around her during the last few days she did not know what to expect then the man appeared again he walked around the pillar in front of her looking at the giant mural on the wall even though his lips were only slightly parted erica could see that the rightfront incisor came to a sharp point he passed without looking at her as soon as her legs would move erica first walked then ran retracing her steps through corridors and up the stairways until she emerged into the shocking bright sunlight once in the open her panic evaporated and she felt foolish her certainty of the mans evil intentions seemed like pure paranoia she glanced back but did not return to setis tomb shed look for the name nenephta on another day it was after noon and the concession stand and rest house were jammed as a consequence tutankhamens comparatively meager tomb was almost empty earlier there had been a line to get in erica took advantage of the lull in the crowds and descended the famous sixteen steps to the entrance just before going in she looked back toward setis tomb she saw no one while walking down the passageway she considered the irony that the smallest tomb of the most insignificant pharaoh of the new kingdom was the only one found reasonably intact and even tutankhamens tomb had been broken into twice in antiquity as she crossed the threshold into the antechamber she tried to recreate in her mind that wonderful day in november when the tomb was opened how exciting it must have been when howard carter and his party stepped into the most dazzling archaeological treasure ever uncovered with her knowledge of the discovery erica could mentally place most of the objects found in the tomb she knew that the lifesize statues of tutankhamen stood on either side of the burialchamber entrance and that the three funerary beds stood against the wall then she remembered the strange disarray that carter had found in the tomb that was a mystery that never was explained presumably the chaos was from the tomb robbers but why hadnt the funerary objects been put back to their original state stepping out of the way of an exiting french tour group erica had to wait to enter the burial chamber while she stood there the man in the black suit who had frightened her in setis tomb entered carrying an open guidebook involuntarily erica stiffened but she successfully fought her fear convinced that she was just imagining things besides the man did not seem to notice her as he passed she got a good look at the hooked nose that gave him the appearance of a bird of prey mustering her fortitude she forced herself to enter the crowded burial chamber the room was divided by a banister and the only free spot at the railing was next to the man in the black suit she hesitated for a moment but then walked up to the banister and looked over at tutankhamens magnificent pink sarcophagus the wall paintings in the room were insignificant when compared with the stylistic perfection of those in setis tomb as her eyes roamed the room erica happened to see the open page in the mans guidebook it was the floor plan of the temple of karnak it had nothing to do with the valley of the kings and all ericas fears returned with a rush quickly stepping away from the railing erica hurried out again she felt better in the sunlight and fresh air but now she was convinced she was not paranoid there were no tables available in the concession stand which stood a mere thirty feet from the entrance to tutankhamens tomb but erica was thankful for the crowd it made her feel safe she sat on the low stone wall of the veranda with a cold can of juice shed purchased and her box lunch from the hotel shed kept her eye on the opening of tutankhamens tomb and now as she watched the man emerged and walked across the parking area to a small black car he sat on the seat leaving the door ajar his feet on the ground she wondered what his presence meant if his intention had been to harm her hed had multiple opportunities she concluded that he must be merely following her perhaps working for the authorities erica took a deep breath and tried to ignore him but she also decided to stay in the company of other tourists her lunch consisted of several sliced lamb sandwiches which she chewed thoughtfully while looking across the path to the nearby opening of tutankhamens tomb it helped her to relax to think of the thousands of victorian visitors to the valley of the kings who had unknowingly sipped their cool lemonade ten yards from the hidden entrance to the worlds greatest buried treasure the seti i tomb was also reasonably close to the concession stand biting into the second sandwich she pondered the proximity of ramses vis tomb to tutankhamens it was just above and slightly to the left erica remembered that it had been the workers huts built during the construction of ramses vis tomb over the entrance to tutankhamens which had delayed carters discovery it hadnt been until hed thrown a trench right into the area that he had found the sixteen descending steps erica stopped eating drawing the information together she knew that the ancient plunderers had entered tutankhamens tomb through the original entrance because carter had described the breaks in the door but because of the location of the workers huts the entrance to tutankhamens tomb had to have been covered and forgotten by the time the construction began on ramses vis tomb this meant that tutankhamens tomb had to have been plundered in the early twentieth or perhaps the nineteenth dynasty what if tutankhamens tomb had been plundered during the reign of seti i erica allowed herself to swallow could there be some connection between the defilement of tutankhamens tomb and the fact that tutankhamens name appeared on the seti statue while her mind wandered over these thoughts erica looked up and watched a lone hawk spiral on still wings she began putting her sandwich papers back into the box the man in the car had not moved a nearby table vacated and erica carried her belongings over to it putting her tote bag on the ground despite the heavy heat hanging over the valley like a thick blanket ericas mind kept racing what if the seti statues had been placed inside tutankhamens tomb after the tomb robbers had been caught she immediately dismissed the idea as preposterous it made no sense besides if the statues had been in the tomb they would have been cataloged by carter who had a reputation for being uncompromisingly meticulous no erica knew she was on the wrong track but she realized that the whole issue of robbers in tutankhamens tomb had been given short shrift because of the enormity of carters find the fact that the boy kings tomb had been defiled might have significance and the idea that the tomb had been entered during the reign of seti i was intriguing suddenly erica wished she were back at the egyptian museum she decided she wanted to go over carters notes which dr fakhry said were on microfilm in the archives even if she did not learn anything astounding it would be the subject of a good journal article she also wondered if any of the people present during the initial opening of tutankhamens tomb were still alive she knew carnarvon and carter had died and thinking of carnarvons death she remembered the curse of the pharaohs and smiled at the resourcefulness of the media and the gullibility of the public with her lunch finished erica opened the baedeker to decide which of the many tombs she wanted to visit next a german tour group went by and she hurried to join above her the spiraling sparrow hawk abruptly dived to pounce on some unsuspecting prey khalifa reached over and turned off the radio in the rented car as he watched erica trudge deeper into the whitehot valley karrah he cursed as he heaved himself from the shade of the auto he could not fathom why anyone would voluntarily subject herself to such merciless heat luxor pm as erica crossed the extensive gardens that separated the old winter palace from the new hotel she could understand why so many wealthy victorians had chosen to winter in upper egypt although the day had been hot once the sun had set the temperature cooled gracefully as she skirted the swimming pool she noticed it was still being enjoyed by a bevy of american children it had been a wonderful day the ancient paintings shed seen in the tombs had been outstanding incredible then when she had returned to the hotel from the west bank she had found two notes both invitations one from yvon and one from ahmed the decision had been difficult but she had agreed to see yvon hoping he might have discovered new information about the statue on the phone he had told her that they would eat in the dining room of the new winter palace and that he would come by for her at eight on an impulse she had told him that shed rather meet him there in the lobby yvon was dressed in a dark blue doublebreasted blazer and white slacks his fine brown hair carefully combed he offered erica his arm as they entered the dining room the restaurant was not old but it appeared decadent its unharmonious decor suggesting a failed attempt at a gracious continental dining room but erica soon forgot her surroundings as yvon entertained her with stories of his european childhood the way he described his formal and very cold relationship with his parents made it sound more funny than deplorable and what about you asked yvon searching for his cigarettes in his jacket i come from another world erica looked down and swirled her wine i grew up in a house in a small city in the midwest we had a small but very close family erica pressed her lips together and shrugged ah theres more than that said yvon with a smile but dont let me be rude and dont feel obligated to tell me erica was not being secretive she just didnt think that yvon would be interested in hearing about toledo ohio and she didnt want to talk about her fathers death in an air crash or the fact that she had trouble getting along with her mother because they were too similar anyway she preferred hearing yvon talk have you ever been married asked erica yvon laughed and then studied ericas face i am married he said casually erica averted her eyes certain that her instantaneous disappointment would be mirrored in her pupils she should have known i even have two wonderful children continued yvon jean claude and michelle i just never see them never the idea of not seeing ones own children was incomprehensible erica lifted her gaze she was under control i visit them rarely my wife chooses to live in st tropez she likes to shop and sun both of which i find limiting the children are at boarding school and they like st tropez in the summer so so you live in your château by yourself said erica lightening the mood no its a dreary place i have a nice apartment on the rue verneuil in paris it was only when they were drinking coffee that yvon was willing to discuss the statue of seti i or abduls death i brought these photos for you to look at he said taking five pictures from his pocket and placing them in front of erica i know you saw the men who killed abdul hamdi for only a second but do you recognize any of these faces taking each in turn erica studied the pictures no she said at length but that doesnt mean they werent there i understand said yvon picking up the photographs it was just a possibility tell me erica have you had any problems since youve come to upper egypt no except im quite sure im being followed followed said yvon thats the only explanation i can think of today in the valley of the kings i saw a man i believe i first saw in the egyptian museum hes an arab with a large hooked nose a sneering grin and one front tooth that comes to a point erica bared her lips and pointed to her right incisor the gesture brought a smile to yvons face although he was not pleased that she had spotted khalifa this is not funny continued erica he scared me today pretending to be a tourist but reading the wrong page in his guidebook yvon she said changing the subject what about this plane of yours do you have it here in luxor yvon shook his head confused yes of course the plane is here in luxor why do you ask because i want to go back to cairo i have some work that will take about half a day when asked yvon the sooner the better said erica what about tonight he wanted erica back in the city erica was surprised at the offer but she trusted yvon especially now that she knew he was married why not she said although she had never been in a small jet before she had imagined there would be a lot more room than there was she was strapped into one of the four large leather seats in the chair next to erica was raoul trying to carry on a conversation with her but erica was more interested in what was happening and whether they were going to get off the ground she didnt believe in the principles of aerodynamics in big planes it didnt worry her because the concept of the huge hulk ever flying was so preposterous that she refused to think about it the smaller the plane the more the issue was unwelcomely thrust into her awareness yvon employed a pilot but since he had trained to fly himself he usually preferred to be at the controls there was no air traffic and they were cleared immediately the knifelike little jet thundered down the runway and leaped into the air as ericas fingers blanched once they were under way yvon relinquished the controls and came back to talk with erica beginning to relax she said you mentioned that your mother was from england do you think she might have known the carnarvons why yes ive met the present earl said yvon why do you ask actually im interested to know if lord carnarvons daughter is still alive her name is evelyn i believe i havent the slightest idea said yvon but i could find out why do you ask have you become interested in the curse of the pharaohs he grinned in the halflight of the cabin maybe answered erica teasingly i have a theory about tutankhamens tomb that i want to investigate ill tell you about it when i get some more information but if you could find out about carnarvons daughter for me id really appreciate it oh one other thing have you ever heard the name nenephta in what context in relation to seti i yvon thought then shook his head never they had to fly a complicated pattern over cairo before they were allowed to land but formalities were brief since the plane had already been cleared it was just after one am when they arrived at the meridien hotel the management was extremely cordial to yvon and although they were supposedly full they somehow managed to find an extra room for erica next to his penthouse suite yvon invited her over for a nightcap after she had settled herself erica had brought only her canvas tote bag packing a minimum of clothing her makeup and reading material shed left the guidebooks and flashlight in her room in luxor so there was little to do by way of settling herself and she walked through the connecting door into the main room of yvons suite he had removed his jacket and rolled up his sleeves and was just opening a bottle of dom perignon when erica entered she took the glass of champagne and for a moment their hands touched erica was suddenly conscious of his extraordinary good looks she felt as if they had been moving toward this night since they first met he was married he obviously wasnt serious but then neither was she she decided to relax and let the evening take its own course but an excited pulse began between her thighs and to distract herself she felt impelled to talk what makes you so interested in archaeology it started when i was still a student in paris some of my friends talked me into going to the école de lange oriental i was fascinated and worked like crazy for the first time id never been much of a student i studied arabic and coptic it was egypt that interested me i guess thats more of an explanation than a reason would you like to see the view from the terrace he held out his hand to her id love to said erica the pulse quickening she wanted this she didnt care if he was using her if he was simply compelled to take to bed any attractive woman he met for the first time in her life she let herself be swept along by desire yvon slid open the door and erica walked out under the trellis she could smell the fragrant roses as she stared down at the whole city of cairo spread out against the canopy of stars the citadel with its bold minarets was still illuminated directly before them was the island of gezira surrounded by the dark nile erica could sense yvons presence behind her when she looked up at his angular face he was studying her slowly he reached out and drew the tips of his fingers through her hair then cupped the back of her head and pulled her to him he kissed her tentatively sensitive to her emotions then more fully and finally with true passion erica was amazed at the intensity of her response yvon was the first man she had been with since knowing richard and she was not certain how her body would react but now she opened her arms to yvon matching his excitement with her own their clothes fell naturally as their bodies slowly sank to the oriental carpet and in the soft silent light of the egyptian night they made love with intense abandon the sprawling throbbing city serving as mute witness to their passion day cairo am erica awoke in her own bed she dimly remembered yvon saying that he preferred to sleep alone turning over thinking of the evening she was amazed to find she felt no guilt when she emerged from her room it was about nine yvon was sitting on the balcony dressed in a blueandwhitestriped robe reading the el ahram newspaper in arabic the rays of the morning sun were broken into pieces by the trellis splattering the area with bits of bright color like an impressionist painting breakfast lay waiting under silver serving dishes he got up when he saw her and embraced her warmly im very glad we came to cairo he said holding out her chair so am i said erica it was a pleasant meal yvon had a subtle humor that erica enjoyed immensely but after the last piece of toast she was impatient to continue her investigation well im off to the museum she said folding her napkin would you care for some company asked yvon erica looked across at him remembering richards impatience she did not want to feel rushed it was better to go alone to be truthful the kind of work i want to do is going to be a bit boring unless you want to spend the morning in the archives i prefer to go by myself erica reached across the table and touched yvons arm fine he said but ill have raoul give you a ride its not necessary she protested compliments of the french said yvon cheerfully dr fakhry led erica into a small stuffy cubicle off the main room of the library on a single table against the wall was a microfilm reader talat will bring the film you desire said dr fakhry i appreciate your help very much erica told him what is it you are looking for queried dr fakhry his right hand suddenly shook spasmodically im interested in the robbers who broke into tutankhamens tomb in ancient times i dont think that aspect of the discovery has been given the attention it deserves tomb robbers he questioned then shuffled from the room erica sat down in front of the microfilm reader and drummed her fingers on the table she hoped that the egyptian museum had as much material as possible talat appeared and gave erica a shoe box full of film you buy scarab lady he whispered without even answering erica began to look through the microfilm canisters conveniently labeled in english with cards from the ashmolean museum which houses the original documents she was genuinely surprised at the wealth of the material and made herself comfortable since she was clearly going to be there for a while flipping on the reader erica inserted the first roll of film fortunately carter had written his journal in a compulsively neat script erica skimmed to the section describing the stonecutters huts there was no doubt that they had been built directly over the entranceway to tutankhamens tomb erica was now positive that the robbers had to have plundered tutankhamens tomb before the reign of ramses vi she continued skimming until she came to the section where carter listed the reasons he was sure before he discovered tutankhamens tomb that it existed the piece of evidence that erica found the most fascinating was a blue faience cup with the cartouche of tutankhamen found by theodore davis no one had ever wondered why the little cup was found hidden under a rock on the hillside when the first spool was finished erica put on the next she was now reading about the discovery itself carter described at length the way the outer and inner doors of the tomb had been closed again in antiquity with a seal of the necropolis the original tutankhamen seal could only be found at the base of each door carter explained in detail why he was certain the doors had been breached and resealed twice but offered no explanation why closing her eyes erica rested for a few moments her imagination took her back to the solemn ceremony when the young pharaoh was interred then her mind tried to conjure up the tomb robbers had they been confident during their robbery or had they been terrified at the possibility of angering the guardians of the netherworld then she thought about carter what was it like when he entered the tomb for the first time from the notes erica confirmed that he had been accompanied by his assistant callender lord carnarvon carnarvons daughter and one of the foremen named sarwat raman for the next several hours erica scarcely moved she could sense carters feeling of awe and mystery with painstaking detail he described the location of each object the alabaster lotiform cup and a nearby oil lamp took several pages as she studied the material on the cup and the lamp erica remembered something shed read elsewhere on his lecture tour after the discovery carter had mentioned that the curious orientation of these two objects led him to conjecture that they were clues to some greater mystery that he hoped would be unraveled following a complete examination of the tomb hed gone on to say that the group of gold rings he had found discarded in cavalier manner suggested that the intruders were surprised in the middle of their brigandage looking up from the machine erica realized that carter assumed that the tomb had been burglarized twice since it had been opened twice but that was indeed an assumption and there might be another equally plausible explanation after an initial reading of carters field notes erica put into the microfilm reader a roll of film labeled lord carnarvon papers and correspondence what she found was mostly business letters concerning his support of the archaeological endeavors she advanced the film rapidly until the dates coincided with the discovery of the tomb itself as she expected the volume of carnarvons correspondence increased once carter had reported finding the entrance stairway erica stopped at a long letter carnarvon had written to sir wallis budge of the british museum on december in order to get the entire letter in one frame it had been reduced considerably in size erica had to strain to read the script the handwriting also wasnt as neat as carters in the letter carnarvon had excitedly described the find and listed many of the famous pieces erica had seen in the traveling tutankhamen exhibit she read along quickly until a sentence leaped out at her i have not opened the boxes and dont know what is in them but there are some papyrus letters faience jewelry bouquets candles on ankh candlesticks erica looked at the word papyrus as far as she knew no papyrus had been found in tutankhamens tomb in fact that had been one of the disappointments it had been hoped that tutankhamens tomb would have afforded some insight into the troubled era in which he lived but without documents that hope had been destroyed but here carnarvon was describing a papyrus to sir wallis budge erica went back to carters notes she reread all the entries made the day the tomb was opened and for the following two days carter did not mention any papyrus in fact he alluded to his disappointment that there were no documents strange going back to carnarvons letter to budge erica was able to crossreference with carters notes every other article he mentioned the single discrepancy was the papyrus when erica finally emerged from the dreary museum it was early afternoon she walked slowly toward the busy tahrir square although her stomach was empty she wanted to accomplish one more errand before returning to the meridien hotel from her tote bag she withdrew the cover of the baedeker and read the name and address nasef malmud shari el tahrir crossing the massive square was an accomplishment in itself since it was filled with dusty buses and crowds of people at the corner of shari el tahrir she turned left nasef malmud she said to herself she did not know what to expect shari el tahrir was one of the more fashionable boulevards with smart europeanstyle shops and office buildings was a modern marbleandglass highrise nasef malmuds office was on the eighth floor riding in an empty elevator erica remembered the long midday break and was afraid she would not be able to see nasef malmud until later in the afternoon but his office door was ajar and she walked in noting the sign that said nasef malmud international law importexport division the reception area of the office was deserted smart olivetti typewriters on mahogany desks proclaimed a flourishing business hello called erica a stocky man appeared in a doorway dressed in a carefully tailored threepiece suit he was about fifty and would not have looked out of place strolling in the financial section of boston can i help you he asked in a businesslike voice im looking for mr nasef malmud answered erica i am nasef malmud would you have a few moments to talk with me asked erica nasef looked back into his office pursing his lips he had a pen in his right hand and it was obvious he was in the middle of something turning back to erica he spoke as if hed not quite made up his mind well for a few minutes erica entered the spacious corner office with a view up shari el tahrir to the square and the nile beyond nasef eased himself into his highbacked desk chair and waved erica to a seat nearby what can i do for you young lady he asked putting the tips of his fingers together i wanted to inquire about a man named abdul hamdi erica stopped to see if there was any response there wasnt malmud waited thinking there was more but when erica did not continue he said the name is not familiar in which context might i know this individual i was wondering if by chance abdul hamdi was a client of yours said erica malmud removed his reading glasses and put them on his desk if he were a client im not sure why i would be willing to disclose such information he said without malice he was a lawyer and as such was more interested in receiving information than giving it i have some news about the man that would interest you if he was a client erica tried to be equally evasive how did you get my name he asked from abdul hamdi said erica knowing that it was a slight permutation of the truth malmud studied erica for a moment went into the outer office then returned with a manila file sitting behind the desk he replaced his reading glasses and opened the file it contained a single sheet of paper which he took a minute to scan yes it seems that i do represent abdul hamdi he looked expectantly across at erica over his glasses well abdul hamdi is dead erica decided not to use the word murdered malmud thoughtfully regarded erica then reread the paper in his hand thank you for the information i will have to investigate my responsibilities to his estate he stood up and extended his hand forcing a rapid conclusion to the interview while walking to the door erica spoke do you know what a baedeker is no he said hurrying her through the outer office have you ever owned a baedeker guidebook erica paused at the doorway never yvon was waiting when she returned to the hotel he had another series of photos for erica to examine one man looked vaguely familiar but she could not be sure she felt the chances of her being able to recognize the killers were pretty slim and tried to say as much to yvon but he just insisted id prefer if youd try to cooperate rather than telling me how to proceed walking out onto the beautiful balcony erica remembered the night before yvons interest now seemed strictly business and she was glad she had at least gone into the affair with her eyes open his desires had been momentarily satisfied and his attention had reverted to the seti statue erica accepted the reality with equanimity but it made her want to leave cairo and return to luxor she walked back into the suite and told yvon her plans initially he complained but she derived a certain pleasure in denying him his way he was obviously unaccustomed to such treatment but in the end he relented even offering erica the use of his plane he would follow her he said as soon as he could returning to luxor was a joy despite the memory of the man with the sharp tooth erica felt infinitely more comfortable in upper egypt than she did in the raw brutality of cairo when she arrived at the hotel she found a number of messages from ahmed asking her to call she put them by the phone walking over to the french doors to the balcony she threw them open it was just after five and the afternoon sun had lost most of its heat erica drew a bath to rinse off the dust and fatigue of travel although the plane trip had been comfortingly short when she got out of the tub she called ahmed who seemed both relieved and happy to hear from her i was very worried said ahmed especially when the hotel said you had not been seen i went to cairo overnight yvon de margeau took me by plane i see said ahmed there was an awkward pause as erica remembered that he had acted strangely about yvon since their first conversation well said ahmed finally im calling to see if youd enjoy visiting the temple of karnak tonight there is a full moon and the temple will be open until midnight it is worth seeing id like that very much said erica they made arrangements for ahmed to pick her up at nine oclock theyd visit the temple of karnak then eat ahmed said he knew a small restaurant on the nile that was owned by a friend he promised her that shed like it then hung up erica dressed in her brown scoopnecked jersey dress with her deepening tan and the light streaks in her hair it made her feel very feminine she ordered a glass of wine from room service and sat down on the balcony with the baedeker holding the torn cover in front of her the name carefully written on the inside of the separated cover of abdul hamdis guidebook was nasef malmud there had been no mistake why had malmud lied she picked up the book and examined it carefully it was a wellconstructed volume actually sewn not just glued it had many diagrams and line drawings of the various monuments erica flipped through the pages stopping frequently to look at an illustration or read a short section there were also a few foldout maps one of egypt one of saqqara and one of the necropolis of luxor she examined them in turn when she tried to refold the map of luxor she had difficulty returning it to its previous shape then she noticed the paper felt different from the other maps looking more closely she saw it was printed on two sheets laminated together erica held the book up so that the map was between her eye and the setting sun some sort of document was fused to the back of the map of the necropolis of luxor going back inside the room erica closed one of the doors to the balcony and placing the map against the glass allowed the sun to backlight it she could make out the letter sealed inside the print was faint and small but in english and legible it was addressed to nasef malmud dear mr malmud this letter is written by my son who expresses my words i cannot write i am an old man so if you read this letter do not grieve my fate instead use the information enclosed against those individuals who have decided to silence me rather than pay the following routing is the way in recent years that all the most valuable ancient treasures have been removed from our country i had been hired by a foreign agent whose name i choose to withhold to infiltrate the routing in order to allow him to obtain the treasures for himself once a valuable piece has been found lahib zayed and his son fathi of the curio antique shop send photos to prospective buyers those interested come to luxor and view the pieces once a deal is made the buyer must place the money on account with the zurich credit bank the piece is then routed north by small boats and delivered to the office of aegean holidays ltd in cairo proprietor stephanos markoulis the antiquities are there placed within the luggage of unsuspecting tour groups large pieces disassembled and flown with the tour group to athens by jugoslwenski airlines airline personnel are paid to leave specific luggage on the aircraft for continuation to belgrade and ljubjana pieces are sent overland to switzerland for transfer a newer route has recently been established via alexandria the cotton export firm futures ltd controlled by zayed naquib packs antiquities in bales and sends them to pierce fauve galleries marseilles this route is untested as of the writing of this letter your faithful servant abdul hamdi erica folded the map back into the baedeker she was stunned without doubt the seti statue jeffrey rice had purchased had gone through the athens connection as she had guessed when she met with stephanos markoulis it was clever because tourgroup luggage was never subjected to the same examination as the baggage of an individual traveler whod guess that a sixtythreeyearold lady from joliet would be carrying priceless egyptian antiquities in her pink samsonite suitcase walking back onto the balcony erica leaned on the railing the sun had reluctantly dipped behind the distant mountains in the middle of the irrigated fields on the west bank stood the colossi of memnon veiled in lavender shadow she wondered what she should do she thought about giving the book to either ahmed or yvonprobably ahmed but maybe she should wait until she was ready to leave egypt that would be the safest important as exposing the blackmarket routing was erica was also interested in the seti i statue itself and the location in which it had been dug up with excitement she dreamed of what else could be found at such a site she did not want her own investigations cut off by the police erica tried to be realistic about the danger of keeping the book it was obvious now that the old man had been a blackmailer and things had closed in on him it was equally obvious that erica had been a lastminute addition to his plans no one actually knew she had any information and until a few minutes earlier neither had she she resolved again to ignore the information until she was ready to leave the country while evening crept slowly over the nile valley erica reviewed her plans she would continue her role as museum buyer and visit the curio antique shop which for all she knew she had already seen since she did not remember the various names then she would try to find out if sarwat raman carters foreman was still alive hed have to be at least in his late seventies she wanted to talk with someone who had entered tutankhamens tomb on that first day and ask about the papyrus carnarvon had described in his letter to sir wallis budge in the meantime she hoped yvon would make the promised inquiries about lord carnarvons daughter thats the chicago house said ahmed pointing to an impressive structure on the right their carriage was taking them peacefully up shari el bahr along the treelined edge of the nile the rhythmic sound of the horses hooves was comforting like the fall of waves on a stone beach it was very dark because the full moon had not yet crested the palms and desert ridges the slight wind that blew from the north was not enough to disturb the mirrorlike surface of the nile ahmed was again impeccably dressed in white cotton when erica looked at his deeply tanned face she could see only his brilliant eyes and white teeth the more time she spent with ahmed the more confused she became about his reasons for seeing her he was friendly and warm and yet he maintained a sharp distance the only time he had touched her was to help her climb into the carriage holding her hand and giving the small of her back a very slight push have you ever been married asked erica hoping to learn something about the man no never said ahmed curtly im sorry said erica i suppose it isnt any of my business ahmed lifted his arm and put it behind erica on the top of the seat its all right theres no secret his voice was fluid again ive not had time for romance and i suppose i became spoiled when i was in america things are not quite the same here in egypt but thats probably just an excuse they passed a group of fancy western houses built on the nile bank surrounded by high whitewashed walls in front of each gate was a soldier in battle uniform with a machine pistol but the soldiers were not attentive one had even put his weapon on top of the wall to talk with a passerby what are these buildings asked erica they are the houses of some ministers said ahmed why are they guarded being a minister can be dangerous in this country you cant please everyone youre a minister said erica concerned yes but the people unfortunately dont care so much about my department they rode in silence as the first rays of moonlight fell through the rustling palms thats the department of antiquities office for karnak said ahmed pointing to a waterfront building directly ahead erica could see the massive first pylons of the great temple of amon lit by the rising moon they rode up to the entrance and climbed from the carriage walking up the short processional way lined with ramheaded sphinxes erica was spellbound the halflight created by the rising moon hid the ruined aspect of the temple making it appear still in use they had to walk carefully through the deep purple shadows of the entranceway to gain the main courtyard abruptly ahmed took ericas hand as they crossed the broad courtyard and passed into the great hypostyle hall it was like being transported into the past the hall was a forest of massive stone columns that soared into the night sky most of the ceiling was gone and shafts of moonlight plunged down washing the pillars and their extensive hieroglyphic texts and bold reliefs with silver light they didnt talk they just wandered hand in hand after a halfhour ahmed pulled erica out through a side entrance and walked her back to the first pylon on the north side was a brick stairway that took them the feet to the top of the temple from there erica could see the entire milesquare area of karnak it was aweinspiring erica she turned ahmeds head was tilted to the side his eyes enjoying her erica i find you very beautiful she liked compliments but they always made her feel a little selfconscious she averted her eyes as ahmed reached out and gently ran the tips of his fingers over her forehead thank you ahmed she said simply looking up she noticed ahmed was still studying her she could sense some kind of conflict you remind me of pamela he said finally oh said erica reminding him of a former girlfriend was not what she wanted to hear about but she could tell that ahmed meant it as a compliment she smiled weakly and looked off into the moonlit distance perhaps her similarity to pamela was the reason ahmed was seeing her you are more beautiful but it is not your appearance that reminds me of her it is your openness and warmth look ahmed im not sure i understand last time we were together i asked some innocent question about pamela and whether your uncle had met her and you blew up now you insist on talking about her i dont think thats very fair they stood in silence for a while ahmeds intensity was intriguing but also a little frightening and the memory of the shattered teacup was sharp do you think you could ever live in a place like luxor asked ahmed without taking his eyes from the nile i dont know said erica the thought never occurred to me it is very beautiful its more than beautiful its timeless id miss harvard square ahmed laughed relieving the tension harvard square what a crazy place by the way erica i have thought about your decision to try to do something about the black market im not sure my warning was strong enough it really frightens me to think of your becoming involved please dont i cannot bear the idea of anything happening to you he leaned forward and gently kissed her on the temple come you must see hatshepsuts obelisk in the moonlight and taking her hand he led her back down the brick stairway dinner was marvelous having walked for over an hour within the splendor of karnak they did not start their meal until after eleven the small nileside restaurant was built under an umbrella of tall date palms the dates were almost ready for picking and the globular red fruit was held up in the trees by pouches of netting the specialty of the restaurant was kebabs made with green peppers onion and lamb marinated in garlic parsley and mint the dish was garnished with peeled tomatoes and artichokes and served on a bed of rice it was an openair restaurant and obviously popular with the emergent middle class of luxor whose conversations were accompanied by hand gestures and laughter no tourists were in evidence ahmed had become considerably more relaxed since their conversation on the pylon he stroked his mustache thoughtfully when erica told him about her recently completed phd dissertation on the syntactical evolution of new kingdom hieroglyphics he laughed with pleasure when she told him that she used ancient egyptian love poetry as her primary source using love poetry as the basis for such an esoteric thesis was wonderfully ironic erica asked ahmed about his childhood he told her he had been very happy growing up in luxor that was why he liked to return it wasnt until he had been sent to cairo that his life had become complicated he told her that his father had been wounded and his older brother killed in the war his mother had been one of the first women from the area to obtain both a highschool and college degree she had tried to work in the department of antiquities but at that time she couldnt because of her sex now she lived in luxor and worked parttime for a foreign bank ahmed said he had a younger sister who was trained as a lawyer and worked for the department of the interior in the customs division after dinner they had small cups of arabic coffee there was a natural lull in the conversation as erica decided to ask a question is there any central registry here in luxor so that if someone tried to find another individual theyd know where to look ahmed did not answer immediately we did try to have a census a few years ago but im afraid it was not very successful the information they obtained would be available in the government building next to the central post office otherwise there is the police why do you ask just curious said erica evasively she debated telling ahmed about her interest in the ancient tomb robbers of tutankhamen but she was afraid he might try to stop her or worse laugh at her if she told him she was looking for sarwat raman when she thought about it it did seem a bit farfetched the last reference she had for the man was fiftyseven years ago it was at that moment that erica saw the man in the dark suit she could not see his face because his back was to her but the way he sat hunched over his food was familiar he was one of the few people not in arabic clothing ahmed sensed her reaction and asked whats the matter oh nothing said erica coming out of her trance really nothing but it was disturbing being with ahmed cast grave doubts on her explanation that the man in the dark suit worked for the authorities who was he day luxor am the sound of the recorded voice coming from the small mosque built against the temple of luxor awoke erica from a troubled dream she had been running from some unseen but terrifying creature through a medium that progressively resisted her movement when she awoke she was tangled in the bedcovers and realized she must have been tossing and turning she pulled herself up from the bed and opened the windows to the morning freshness with the crisp air on her face her nightmare vanished she took a quick sponge bath standing in the large tub for some reason there was no hot water and she was actually shivering when she was through after breakfast erica left the hotel to find the curio antique shop she had her tote bag with her flashlight polaroid camera and guidebooks she was comfortably dressed in new cotton slacks shed purchased in cairo to replace those that shed ripped in the serapeum she strolled down shari lukanda and noted the names of the shops shed already visited curio antique shop was not among them one of the proprietors she recognized told her that the curio antique shop was on shari el muntazah near the hotel savoy erica found the area and the shop very easily next to the curio shop was a store that was crudely boarded up although she could not read its full name she saw the word hamdi and knew what she was looking at clutching her bag tightly she entered the curio shop there was a good selection of antiquities although on closer examination she could tell they were mostly fakes a french couple was already in the shop and bargaining fiercely for a small bronze figure the most interesting piece erica saw was a black mummiform ushabti figure with a delicately painted face its plinth was gone so the statue was leaning against the corner of the shelf as soon as the french couple departed without buying the bronze the proprietor approached erica he was a distinguishedlooking arab with silvergrey hair and a neat mustache i am lahib zayed may i help you he said switching from french to english erica wondered what made him guess her nationality yes said erica id like to look at that black osiriform figure ah yes one of my best pieces from the tombs of the nobles he lifted the figure ever so gently with the tips of his fingers while his back was turned erica licked the tip of her finger when he handed her the statue she was ready be very careful it is a delicate piece said zayed erica nodded and wiped her finger back and forth the tip of her finger was clean the pigment was stable she looked more closely at the carving and the manner in which the eyes were painted that was the critical area she was satisfied the statue was an antique new kingdom said zayed holding the statue away from erica so she could appreciate it at a distance i get something like this only once or twice a year how much fifty pounds normally id ask more but you are so beautiful erica smiled ill give you forty she said knowing full well that he did not expect to get his initial price she also knew it was a little more than she should be spending but she thought it was important to prove that she was serious besides she liked the statue even if it later proved to be a very clever fake it was still decorative they concluded the deal at fortyone pounds actually im here representing a large group said erica and im interested in something very special do you have anything i might have a few things youd like perhaps i could show you in a more suitable place would you care for some mint tea erica felt a surge of anxiety as she stepped into the back room of the curio antique shop she had to suppress the image of abdul hamdis throat being slit fortunately the curio antique shop was constructed differently opening onto a courtyard with bright sunlight it did not have the confining feeling of antica abdul zayed called his son a darkhaired lanky facsimile of his father and told him to order some mint tea for their guest settling back in his chair zayed asked erica the usual questions if she liked luxor if shed been to karnak what did she think of the valley of the kings he told her how much he loved americans he said they were so friendly erica added to herself and so gullible the tea came and zayed produced some interesting pieces including several small bronze figurines a battered but recognizable head of amenhotep iii and a series of wooden statues the most beautiful statue was a young woman with hieroglyphics down the front of her skirt and a tranquil face that defied time she was priced at four hundred pounds after carefully examining the artifact erica was quite sure it was authentic im interested in the wooden statue and possibly the stone head said erica in a businesslike tone zayed rubbed his palms together with great excitement ill be checking with the people i represent said erica but i know there is something they would want me to buy immediately if i were to see it what is that asked zayed there was a lifesize statue of seti i bought a year ago by a man in houston my clients have heard that a similar statue has been found i have nothing like that said zayed evenly well if you happen to hear about such a piece ill be staying at the winter palace hotel erica wrote her name on a small piece of paper and gave it to him and what about these pieces as i said ill contact my clients i do like the wooden statue but i must check erica picked up her purchase which had been wrapped in arabic newspaper and walked back to the front part of the shop she felt confident she had played her role very well as she left she noticed zayeds son bargaining with a man it was the arab who had been following her without breaking her stride or looking in his direction erica left the shop but a shiver went up her spine as soon as his son finished with his customer lahib zayed closed the front door to the shop and bolted it come into the back he commanded his son that was the woman stephanos markoulis warned us about when he was here the other day he said once they were in the security of the back room he had even closed the old wooden door to the courtyard i want you to go to the central post office and call markoulis and tell him that the american woman came into the shop and specifically asked about the seti statue ill go to muhammad and tell him to warn the others what is going to happen to the woman asked fathi i think thats rather obvious it reminds me of that young man from yale about two years ago will they do the same to the woman undoubtedly said his father erica was appalled by the chaos in the luxor administration building some of the people had been waiting so long that they were sleeping on the floor in the corner of one hall she saw a whole family camped out as if theyd been there for days behind the counters the civil servants ignored the crowds and casually talked among themselves every desk was a heap of completed forms awaiting some impossible signature it was awful by the time erica found someone who spoke english she learned that luxor was not even an administration center the muhāfazah for the area was located in aswan and all the census data were stored there erica told the woman that she wanted to trace a man who lived on the west bank fifty years ago the woman looked at erica as if she were crazy and told her it was impossible though she might check with the police there was always the possibility the person she sought could have had trouble with the authorities the police were easier to deal with than the civil servants at least they were friendly and attentive in fact most of the uniformed officers in the main room were watching her by the time she got to the counter all the signs were in arabic so erica just went to a location where no one else was waiting a handsome young fellow in a white uniform came from behind one of the desks to help her unfortunately he did not speak english but he found a man with the tourist police who did what can i do for you he said with a smile im trying to find out if one of howard carters foremen by the name of sarwat raman is still alive he lived on the west bank what said the policeman with disbelief he chuckled ive had some strange requests but this is certainly one of the more interesting are you talking about the howard carter who discovered tutankhamens tomb thats right said erica that was over fifty years ago i understand that said erica id like to find out if hes still alive madam said the policeman no one even knows how many people live on the west bank much less how to find a specific family but ill tell you what id do if i were you go over to the west bank and visit the small mosque in the village of qurna the imam is an old man and he speaks english maybe he could help but i doubt it the government has been trying to relocate the village of qurna and get those people out of the ancient tombs but its been a fight and theres been some antagonism theyre not a friendly group so be careful lahib zayed looked both ways to make sure he was not seen before entering the whitewashed alleyway he scurried down it and pounded on a stout wooden door he knew muhammad abdulal was at home it was the noon hour and muhammad always napped lahib pounded again he was afraid he might be seen by some stranger before hed have a chance to enter the house a small peephole opened and a bloodshot sleepy eye looked out then the latch was lifted and the door opened lahib stepped over the threshold and the door was slammed behind him muhammad abdulal was clad in a rumpled robe he was a large man with heavy full features his nostrils were flared and highly arched i told you never to come to this house youd better have a good reason for taking this risk lahib greeted muhammad formally before speaking i would not have come if i did not believe it was important erica baron the american woman came into the curio antique shop this morning saying that she represented a group of buyers she is very sharp she knows antiquities and actually bought a small statue then she specifically asked for the seti i statue was she alone asked muhammad alert now rather than angry i believe so said lahib and she asked specifically for the seti statue exactly well that leaves us very little choice ill make the arrangements you inform her that she can see the statue tomorrow night on the condition that she come alone and that she is not followed tell her to come to the qurna mosque at dusk we should have gotten rid of her earlier as i wanted lahib waited to be sure muhammad was finished before he spoke ive also had fathi contact stephanos markoulis and give him the news muhammads hand struck out like a snake cuffing the side of lahibs head karrah why did you take it upon yourself to inform stephanos lahib cowered expecting another blow he asked me to let him know if the woman appeared hes as concerned as we are you do not take orders from stephanos shouted muhammad you take orders from me that must be understood now get out of here and deliver the message the american woman must be taken care of necropolis of luxor village of qurna pm the policeman had been right qurna was not a friendly place as erica trudged up the hill separating the village from the asphalt road she did not have the feeling of welcome that was apparent in the other towns shed visited she saw few people and those she did pass glared shrinking back into the shadows even the dogs were mangy snarling curs she had begun feeling uncomfortable in the taxi when the driver objected to going to qurna instead of the valley of the kings or some other more distant destination he had dropped her off at the base of a dirtandsand hill saying that his car could not make it to the village itself it was blazingly hot well over one hundred degrees and without shade the egyptian sun poured down scorching the rock and reflecting brilliantly from the light sand color of the earth not a blade of grass or a single weed survived the onslaught yet the people of qurna refused to move they wanted to live as their grandfathers and their greatgrandfathers had down through the centuries erica thought that if dante had seen qurna he would have included it in the circles of hell the houses were made of mud brick either left their natural color or whitewashed as erica climbed higher onto the hill she could see occasional hewn openings into outcroppings of rock among the houses these were entrances to some of the ancient tombs a number of houses had courtyards with curious structures in themsixfootlong platforms supported about four feet from the ground by a narrow column they were made of dried mud and straw similar to the mud bricks erica had no idea what they were the mosque was a onestory whitewashed building with a fat minaret erica had noticed the building the first time shed seen qurna like the village it was constructed of mud brick and erica wondered if the whole thing would wash away like a sand castle with one good rain she entered through a low wooden door and found herself in a small courtyard facing a shallow portico supported by three columns to the right of the building was a plain wooden door unsure of the propriety of her entering erica waited at the entrance to the mosque until her eyes adjusted to the relative darkness the interior walls were whitewashed and then painted with complicated geometric patterns the floor was covered with lavish oriental carpets kneeling in front of an alcove pointing toward mecca was an old bearded man in flowing black robes his hands were open and held alongside his cheeks as he chanted although the old man had not turned he must have sensed ericas presence because he soon bent over kissed the page and got up to face her she had no idea how to greet a holy man of islam so she improvised she bowed her head slightly then spoke i would like to ask you about a man an old man the imam studied erica with dark sunken eyes then motioned her to follow they crossed the small courtyard and entered the doorway erica had seen it led to a small austere room with a pallet in one end and a small table at the other he indicated a chair for erica and sat down himself why do you want to locate someone in qurna asked the imam we are suspicious of strangers here im an egyptologist and i wanted to find one of howard carters foremen to see if he were still alive his name was sarwat raman he lived in qurna yes i know said the imam erica felt a twinge of hope until the imam went on he died some twenty years ago he was one of the faithful the carpets in this mosque came from his generosity i see said erica with obvious disappointment she stood up well it was a good idea thank you for your help he was a good man said the imam erica nodded and walked back out into the blinding sunlight wondering how she was going to get a taxi back to the ferry landing as she was about to leave the courtyard the imam called out erica turned he was standing in the doorway to his room ramans widow is still alive would you care to speak with her would she be willing to talk with me asked erica im sure of it called the imam she worked as carters housekeeper and speaks better english than i do as erica followed the imam higher up the hillside she wondered how anyone could wear such heavy robes in the heat even as lightly dressed as she was the small of her back was damp with perspiration the imam led her to a whitewashed house set higher than the others in the southwestern part of the village immediately behind the house the cliffs rose up dramatically to the right of the house erica could see the beginning of a trail etched from the face of the cliff which she guessed led to the valley of the kings the whitewashed facade of the house was covered with faded childlike paintings of railroad cars boats and camels raman recorded his pilgrimage to mecca explained the imam knocking on the door in the courtyard next to the house was one of the platforms erica had seen earlier she asked the imam what it was people sometimes sleep outside in the summer months they use these platforms to avoid scorpions and cobras erica felt gooseflesh rise on her back a very old woman opened the door recognizing the imam she smiled they spoke in arabic when the conversation concluded she turned her heavily lined face to erica welcome she said with a strong english accent opening the door wider for erica to enter the imam excused himself and left like the small mosque the house was surprisingly cool belying the crude exterior the interior was charming there was a wood floor covered with a bright oriental carpet the furniture was simple but well made the walls plastered and painted on three walls there were numerous framed photographs on the fourth a longhandled shovel with an engraved blade the old woman introduced herself as aida raman she told erica proudly that she was going to be eighty years old come april with true arabic hospitality she brought out a cool fruit drink explaining that it had been made from boiled water so that erica need not fear germs erica liked the woman she had sparse dark hair brushed back from her round face and was cheerfully attired in a loosefitting cotton dress printed with brightly colored feathers around her left wrist she wore an orange plastic bracelet she smiled frequently revealing that she had only two teeth both on the bottom erica explained that she was an egyptologist and aida was obviously pleased to talk about howard carter she told erica how she had adored the man even though he was a little strange and very lonely she recalled how much howard carter loved his canary and how sad he was when it had been eaten by a cobra as erica sipped her drink she found herself enthralled by the stories it was obvious that aida was enjoying their meeting just as much as she was do you remember the day when tutankhamens tomb was opened asked erica oh yes said aida that was the most wonderful day my husband became a happy man very soon after that carter agreed to help sarwat obtain the right to run the concession stand in the valley my husband had guessed that the tourists would soon come by the millions to see the tomb howard carter had found and he was right he continued to help with the tomb but he spent most of his effort on building the rest house in fact he built it almost all by himself even though he had to work at night erica allowed aida to ramble on for a moment then asked do you remember everything that happened the day the tomb was opened of course said aida a little surprised at the interruption did your husband ever say anything about a papyrus the old womans eyes instantly clouded her mouth moved but there was no sound erica felt a surge of excitement she held her breath watching the old womans strange response finally aida spoke are you from the government no answered erica what makes you ask such a question everyone knows what was found there are books putting her drink down on the table erica explained to aida the curious discrepancy between carnarvons letter to sir wallis budge and the fact that carters notes listed no papyrus she was not from the government she added reassuringly her interest was purely academic no said aida after an uncomfortable pause there was no papyrus my husband would never take a papyrus from the tomb aida said erica softly i never said your husband took a papyrus you did you said my husband no i just asked if he ever said anything about a papyrus im not accusing him my husband was a good man he had a good name indeed carter was a demanding individual your husband had to be the best no one is challenging your husbands good name there was another long pause finally aida turned back to erica my husband has been dead for over twenty years he told me never to mention the papyrus and i havent even after he died but no one has mentioned it to me either thats why it shocked me so much when you said it in a way its a relief to tell someone you wont tell the authorities no i wont said erica it is up to you so there was a papyrus and your husband took it from the tomb yes said aida many years ago erica now had an idea what had happened raman had gotten the papyrus and sold it it was going to be hard to trace how did your husband get the papyrus out of the tomb he told me he picked it up that first day when he saw it in the tomb everyone was so excited about the treasures he thought it was some kind of curse and he was afraid that they would stop the project if anyone knew lord carnarvon was very interested in the occult erica tried to imagine the events of that hectic day carter must have initially missed seeing the papyrus in his haste to check the integrity of the wall into the burial chamber and the others had been dazzled by the splendor of the artifacts was the papyrus a curse asked erica no my husband said it wasnt he never showed it to any of the egyptologists instead he copied small sections and asked the experts to translate them finally he put it all together but he said it wasnt a curse did he say what it was asked erica no he just said it was written in the days of the pharaohs by a clever man who wanted to record that tutankhamen had helped seti i ericas heart leaped the papyrus associated tutankhamen with seti i as had the inscription on the statue do you have any idea what happened to the papyrus did your husband sell it no he didnt sell it said aida i have it the blood drained from ericas face while she sat immobilized aida shuffled over to the shovel mounted on the wall howard carter presented this shovel to my husband said aida she pulled the wooden shaft from the engraved metal blade there was a hollow in the end of the handle this papyrus has not been touched for fifty years continued aida as she struggled to extract the crumbling document she unrolled it on the table using the two pieces of the shovel as paperweights slowly rising to her feet erica let her eyes feast on the hieroglyphic text it was an official document with seals of state immediately erica could pick out the cartouches of seti i and tutankhamen may i photograph it asked erica almost afraid to breathe as long as my husbands name is not blackened said aida i can promise you that said erica fumbling with her polaroid i wont do anything without your permission she took several photos and made sure they were good enough to work from thank you she said when she was finished now lets put the papyrus back but please be careful this might be very valuable and it could make the raman name famous im more concerned about my husbands reputation said aida besides the family name dies with me we had two sons but both were killed in the wars did your husband have anything else from tutankhamens tomb asked erica oh no said aida okay said erica i will translate the papyrus and tell you what it says so you can decide what you want to do with it i wont say anything to the authorities that will be up to you but for now dont show it to anyone else erica was already jealous of her discovery emerging from aida ramans house she debated on how best to return to the hotel the thought of walking five miles to the ferry landing oppressed her and she decided to risk the trail behind aida ramans house and walk to the valley of the kings there she could surely get a taxi although it was a hot and tiring climb to the ridge the view was spectacular the village of qurna was directly below her just beyond the village was the stately ruin of queen hatshepsuts temple nestled against the mountains erica continued to the crest and looked down the entire green valley was spread out in front of her with the nile snaking its way through the center shielding her eyes from the sun erica turned to the west directly ahead was the valley of the kings from her vantage point erica could look beyond the valley at the endless rustred peaks of the theban mountains as they merged with the mighty sahara she had a feeling of overwhelming loneliness descending into the valley was comparatively easy though erica had to be careful about the loose ground on the steeper parts of the trail the route merged with another path coming from the ruined village of truth where erica knew the ancient necropolis workers had lived by the time she reached the floor of the valley she was very warm and tremendously thirsty despite her wish to return to the hotel and get to work translating the papyrus she walked toward the crowded concession stand for a drink climbing the steps of the building she couldnt help but think of sarwat raman it was an amazing story indeed the arab had stolen a papyrus because he was afraid it would spell out an ancient curse he had been worried that such a curse would stop the excavation erica purchased a pepsicola and found an empty chair on the veranda she glanced around the structure of the rest house it was made of local stone erica marveled that raman had built it she wished she could have met the man there was one question in particular she would have liked to ask why hadnt raman found some way to return the papyrus after he learned it did not represent a curse obviously he did not want to sell it the only explanation erica could think of was that he had been afraid of the consequences she took a large swallow of the pepsi and pulled out one of the precious photos of the papyrus the directives suggested it was to be read in the usual fashion from lower right upward she stumbled over a proper name at the beginning almost not believing her eyes slowly she pronounced it to herself nenephta my god noticing a group of tourists boarding a bus erica thought that perhaps she could get a ride to the ferry landing with them she put the photos back into her tote bag and quickly looked for the ladies room a waiter told her the rest rooms were under the concession stand but after finding the entrance she was discouraged by the acrid smell of urine she decided she could wait until she got back to the hotel she ran down to the bus as the last passengers were getting on luxor pm standing at the edge of her balcony erica stretched her arms over her head and sighed with relief she had finished translating the papyrus it had not been difficult although she was not sure she understood the meaning looking out over the nile she watched a large luxury liner glide by after her immersion in antiquity with the papyrus the modern vessel looked out of place it was like having a flying saucer land in the boston commons erica went back to the glasstopped table shed been working at picked up the translation and read it over i nenephta chief architect for the living god may he live forever pharaoh king of our two lands the great seti i do reverently atone for the disturbance of the eternal rest of the boy king tutankhamen within these humble walls and with these scant provisions for all eternity the unspeakable sacrilege of the attempted plunder of pharaoh tutankhamens tomb by the stonecutter emeni whom we have rightfully impaled and whose remains we have scattered on the western desert for the jackals has served a noble end the stonecutter emeni has opened my eyes to understand the ways of the greedy and unjust thus i chief architect now know the way to ensure eternal safety of the living god may he live forever pharaoh king of our two lands the great seti i imhotep architect for the living god zoser and builder of the step pyramid and neferhotep architect for the living god khufu and builder of the great pyramid used the way in their monuments but without full understanding accordingly the eternal rest of the living god zoser and the living god khufu was disturbed and destroyed in the first dark period but i nenephta chief architect understand the way and the greed of the tomb robber so it will be done and the boy king pharaoh tutankhamens tomb is resealed on this day year of son of re pharaoh seti i second month of germination day erica put the page down on the table the word shed had the most problem with was way the hieroglyphic signs had suggested method or pattern or even trick but the word way made the most sense syntactically but what it meant eluded her translating the papyrus gave erica a great feeling of accomplishment it also made the life of ancient egypt come amazingly alive and she smiled at nenephtas arrogance despite his supposed understanding of the greed of the tomb robber and the way setis magnificent tomb had been plundered within a hundred years of its closure while the humble tomb of tutankhamen had remained undisturbed for another three thousand years picking up the translation again erica reread the section mentioning zoser and khufu suddenly she was sorry shed not visited the great pyramid at the time shed felt comfortably abstemious not rushing to the pyramids of giza like all the other tourists now she wished she had how could neferhotep have used the way in constructing the great pyramid but without full understanding erica stared off at the distant mountains with all the mysterious meanings attributed to the shape and size of the great pyramid erica had uncovered another more ancient one even in nenephtas time the great pyramid was an ancient structure in fact thought erica nenephta probably did not know much more about the great pyramid than she did she decided to visit it perhaps by standing in its shadow or by walking within its depths she might comprehend what nenephta meant by the word way erica checked the time she could easily make the seventhirty sleeper to cairo with feverish excitement she packed her canvas tote bag with her polaroid the baedeker the flashlight jeans and clean underwear then she took a quick bath before leaving the hotel she called ahmed and told him she was going back to cairo for a day or so because she had an insatiable desire to see the great pyramid of khufu ahmed was instantly suspicious there is so much to see here in luxor cant it wait no all of a sudden i have to see it are you going to see yvon de margeau maybe said erica evasively she wondered if ahmed could be jealous is there something youd like me to tell him she knew she was baiting him no of course not dont even mention my name give me a call when you return ahmed hung up before she could say goodbye as erica boarded the train for cairo lahib zayed entered the winter palace hotel he had a confidential message for erica saying that she would be shown a seti i statue the following night provided she followed certain directions but erica was not in her room and he decided hed return later afraid of what muhammad would do to him if he failed to give her the message after the train to cairo departed khalifa entered the main post office and cabled yvon de margeau that erica baron was on her way to cairo he added that shed been acting very strangely and hed await further instructions at the savoy hotel day cairo am the grounds of the pyramids of giza opened at eight a m with thirty minutes to wait erica entered the mena house hotel for a second breakfast a darkhaired hostess showed her to a table on the terrace erica ordered coffee and melon there were only a few other people eating and the pool was empty of bathers directly in front of her above a line of palms and eucalyptus trees was the great pyramid of khufu with an elemental simplicity its triangular form soared upward against the morning sky since erica had heard about the great pyramid since she was a child she had prepared herself to be a little disappointed when she finally confronted the monument but such was not the case she was already moved and awed by its majesty and symmetry it wasnt so much the size although that contributed as it was the fact that the structure represented an attempt by man to make an imprint on the implacable face of time removing the baedeker from her bag erica found the great pyramid and studied the schematic for the interior she tried to think of nenephta and how hed look at the design she realized that she probably knew something that nenephta didnt careful investigation had shown that the great pyramid like most of the other pyramids had undergone significant modification in the course of construction in fact it had been hypothesized that the great pyramid had passed through three distinct stages in the first stage when a much smaller structure was planned the burial chamber was to be underground and it had been carved from the bedrock then when the structure was enlarged a new burial chamber within the building was planned erica looked at this room in the diagram it was erroneously labeled the queens chamber erica knew she could not visit the underground crypt unless she got special permission from the department of antiquities but the queens chamber was open to the public she checked her watch it was almost eight erica wanted to be one of the first to enter the pyramid once the busloads of tourists arrived she knew it would be unpleasant in the narrow passageways turning down persistent offers of donkey and camel rides erica walked up the road to the plateau on which the pyramid stood the closer she got to the structure the more monumental it became although she could quote statistics on the millions of tons of limestone used in building it such statistics had never moved her but now that she was within its shadow she walked as if she were in a trance even without its original facing of white limestone the effect of the sun on the surface of the pyramid was painfully intense erica approached the cave that had been enlarged from the opening caliph mamum had ordered dug in ad there were no other people in the entryway and she went in quickly the glaring whiteness of the day was replaced by dim shadows and weak incandescent light the caliphs tunnel joined the narrow ascending passageway just beyond the granite plugs that had sealed it in antiquity and which were still in place the ceiling of this ascending corridor was little more than four feet high and erica had to bend over to walk up it in order to facilitate climbing horizontal ribs had been set in the slippery paving the passageway was about a hundred feet long and when erica emerged at the base of the grand gallery she was relieved to be able to stand upright the grand gallery sloped upward at the same ratio as the ascending passage with its corbeled ceiling over twenty feet high it was pleasantly spacious after the narrow confines of the corridor to ericas right a grating covered the entrance to the descending shaft which connected to the underground burial chamber ahead of her was the opening she wanted erica bent over again and entered the long horizontal corridor leading to the queens chamber once there she was again able to stand upright the air was stuffy and erica remembered her uncomfortable feelings in seti is tomb she closed her eyes and tried to collect her thoughts the room was without decoration as were all the interior walls of the pyramid she took out her flashlight and ran it around the room the ceiling was vaulted in a chevron formation with huge slabs of limestone erica opened her baedeker to the schematic of the pyramid she tried again to imagine what an architect like nenephta would think if he were within the great pyramid keeping in mind that even in his day the structure was over a thousand years old from the diagram she knew that standing in the queens chamber she was directly above the original burial chamber and below the kings chamber it was during the third and final modification of the pyramid that the burial chamber was designed higher in the structure the new room was labeled kings chamber and erica decided it was time to visit it bending over to enter the low passage back to the grand gallery erica saw that a figure was coming toward her passing someone in the narrow corridor would have been difficult so she waited with the exit momentarily blocked she felt a rush of claustrophobia suddenly she was aware of the thousands of tons of rock above her she closed her eyes breathing deeply the air was heavy christ its just an empty room complained a blond american tourist he wore a tshirt that said black holes are out of sight erica nodded then started down the tunnel when she reached the grand gallery it was already crowded she climbed to the top behind an obese german man and mounted the wooden steps to get to the level of the kings chamber passage then she had to duck under a low wall the grooves for huge sealing portcullises were visible on the sides erica found herself in a pink granite room about fifteen by thirty feet the ceiling was made from nine slabs laid horizontally in one corner was a badly damaged sarcophagus there were about twenty people in the room and the air was oppressive again erica tried to imagine how the structure would suggest a way to thwart tomb robbers she examined the area of the portcullises perhaps that was what nenephta meant granite closure of the tomb but portcullises had been used in many of the pyramids there was nothing unique about those in the great pyramid besides they had not been used in the step pyramid and nenephta said that the way had been used in both although the kings chamber was a goodsized room it was certainly not large enough to store all the funerary possessions of a pharaoh of the importance of khufu erica reasoned that the other chambers had probably been used for the pharaohs treasures particularly the queens chamber which was below her and perhaps even the grand gallery although many egyptologists suggested that the grand gallery was constructed to store the sealing blocks for the ascending passage erica had no idea how to explain nenephtas comments as with all its other mysteries the great pyramid remained mute more and more people pressed into the kings chamber erica decided she needed some air she put away her guidebook but before leaving the chamber she wanted to see the sarcophagus gently pushing her way across the room she peered into the granite box she knew there was a good deal of controversy about its origin age and purpose it was quite small to accommodate the royal coffin and a number of egyptologists doubted that it was a sarcophagus at all miss baron a highpitched but resonant voice said softly erica turned stunned to hear her name she scanned the people nearest her no one seemed to be looking at her then she glanced down an angeliclooking boy of about ten wearing a soiled galabia was smiling at her miss baron yes said erica hesitantly you must go to the curio shop to see the statue you must go today you must go alone the boy turned and disappeared into the crowd of people wait called erica she pushed her way through the crowd and looked down the sloping grand gallery the boy was already threequarters of the way down erica began the descent but the wooded ribs were more difficult to handle going down than coming up the boy seemed to have no trouble and quickly disappeared into the opening of the ascending passageway erica slowed to a safe speed she knew shed never catch him she thought about his message and felt a rush of excitement the curio shop her ruse had succeeded shed found the statue luxor pm with a violent tug lahib zayed felt himself pulled to his feet evangelos had an iron grip on the front part of his galabia where is she he growled into the arabs frightened face stephanos markoulis dressed casually in an opennecked shirt put down the small bronze figure hed been examining and turned to the two men lahib i cannot understand why after letting me know erica baron came into your shop asking for the seti statue you hesitate to tell me where she is lahib was terrified uncertain who scared him the most muhammad or stephanos but feeling evangelos fingers tighten on his galabia he decided it was stephanos all right ill tell you let him go evangelos the greek released his grip abruptly so that lahib staggered backward before regaining his balance well asked stephanos i dont know where she is at the moment but i know where she is staying she has a room at the winter palace hotel but mr markoulis the woman will be taken care of we have made arrangements i would like to take care of her myself said stephanos to be sure but dont worry well be back to say goodbye thanks for all your help stephanos motioned to evangelos and the two men walked out of the shop lahib did not move until they had gone from view then he ran to the door and watched them until they had disappeared there is going to be big trouble here in luxor said lahib to his son when the two greeks were out of sight i want you to take your mother and sister to aswan this afternoon as soon as the american woman appears and i give her the message ill join you i want you to go now stephanos markoulis had evangelos wait in the outer lobby of the winter palace hotel while he approached the registration desk the clerk was a handsome nubian with ebony skin is there an erica baron staying here stephanos asked the clerk turned to the daily ledger running his finger down the names yes sir good id like to leave a message do you have a pen and paper of course sir the clerk graciously gave stephanos a piece of stationery an envelope and a pen stephanos pretended to write a message instead he just scribbled on the paper and sealed it in the envelope he gave it to the clerk who turned and put it into box stephanos thanked him and went to get evangelos together they walked upstairs there was no answer when they knocked on the door to so stephanos had evangelos work on the lock while he stood guard the victorian hardware was easy to manipulate and they were inside the room almost as fast as if theyd had the correct key stephanos closed the door behind him and eyed the room lets search it he said then well wait here until she comes back am i going to kill her immediately asked evangelos stephanos smiled no well talk to her for a little while only i get to talk with her first evangelos laughed and pulled open the top drawer of the bureau there in neat stacks were ericas nylon panties cairo pm are you certain asked yvon in disbelief raoul looked up from his magazine almost positive said erica enjoying yvons surprise after receiving the message in the great pyramid erica had decided to see yvon she knew hed be pleased about the statue and she was quite sure hed be willing to take her to luxor it is almost unbelievable said yvon his blue eyes shining how do you know they plan to show you the seti statue because thats what i asked to see you are incredible said yvon i have been doing everything possible to find that statue and you locate it just like that he waved his hand in an easy gesture well i havent seen the statue yet said erica i must get to the curio shop this afternoon and i must go alone we can leave within the hour yvon reached for the phone he was surprised the statue was back in luxor in fact it made him a little suspicious erica stood up and stretched ive just spent the night on the train and id love to shower if you dont mind yvon gestured toward the adjoining room erica took her tote bag and went into the bathroom while yvon was talking with his pilot yvon completed the plans for transportation then checked the sound of the shower before turning to raoul this possibly could be the opportunity weve been hoping for but we need to be extremely careful now is when we must rely on khalifa get in touch with him and let him know well be arriving around sixthirty tell him that erica will be meeting tonight with the people we want tell him that there will undoubtedly be trouble and that he should be prepared and tell him that if the girl is killed hes finished the small jet rolled slightly to the right then banked gracefully passing over the nile valley in a wide curve about five miles north of luxor it passed through one thousand feet then straightened on a heading due north at the correct moment yvon cut the air speed pulled up the nose and landed smoothly over a cushion of air the reverse thrust of the engines shook the plane and brought it down to taxi speed in a very short distance yvon left the controls to come back to talk with erica while the pilot taxied toward the terminal now lets go over this once more he said turning one of the lounge seats around to face erica his voice was serious making her uncomfortably anxious in cairo the idea of being taken to see the seti statue had been exciting but here in luxor she felt the rumblings of fear as soon as we arrive yvon continued i want you to take a separate taxi and go directly to the curio antique shop raoul and i will wait at the new winter palace hotel suite im positive though that the statue will not be at the shop erica looked up sharply what do you mean it wont be there it would be too dangerous no the statue will be somewhere else they will take you to it its the way its done but it will be all right the statue had been at antica abdul protested erica that was a fluke said yvon the statue was in transit this time im sure that they will take you somewhere else to see the statue try to remember exactly where so youll be able to return then when you are shown the statue i want you to bargain with them if you dont they will be suspicious but remember im willing to pay what they ask provided they can guarantee delivery outside egypt like via the zurich credit bank said erica how did you know that asked yvon same way i knew to go to the curio antique shop said erica and how is that asked yvon im not going to tell you said erica not yet anyway erica this is not a game i know its not a game she said heatedly yvon had been making her more and more anxious thats exactly why im not going to tell you not yet yvon studied her perplexed all right he said at length but i want you to come back to my hotel as soon as possible we cant allow the statue to go underground again tell them that the money can be on account within twentyfour hours erica nodded and looked out the window even though it was after six shimmering heat still radiated from the tarmac the plane came to a stop and the engines died she took a deep breath and unhooked her seat belt from an observation post near the commercial terminal khalifa watched the door to the small jet swing open as soon as he saw erica he turned and walked quickly to a waiting car checking his automatic before climbing into the drivers seat certain that tonight he was going to earn his twohundreddollaraday salary he put the car in gear and drove toward luxor inside ericas room at the winter palace evangelos drew his beretta from beneath his left arm and fingered the ivory handle put that thing away snapped stephanos from the bed it makes me nervous for you to be fumbling with it just relax for christs sake the girl will show up all her stuff is here driving in town erica considered stopping at her hotel there was no use carting around her camera and extra clothes but worrying that lahib zayed might close his shop before she got there she decided to go directly there as yvon had suggested she had the driver stop at one end of the crowded shari el muntazah the curio antique shop was a halfblock away erica was nervous yvon had unknowingly magnified her misgivings about the affair she could not help remembering that she had seen a man murdered because of this statue what was she doing going to see it as she drew nearer she could see that the shop was filled with tourists so she walked past a few shops down she stopped and turned watching the entrance soon a group of germans emerged joking loudly among themselves as they joined the lateafternoon shoppers and strollers it was now or never erica breathed out through pursed lips then strode toward the shop after all her worry she was surprised to find lahib zayed ebullient instead of furtive or surreptitious he came out from behind the counter as if erica were a longlost friend im so happy to see you again miss baron i cannot tell you how happy i am erica was initially wary but lahibs sincerity was apparent and she allowed herself to be gently hugged would you care for some tea thank you but no i came as quickly as possible after i got the message ah yes said lahib he clapped his hands with excitement the statue you are indeed very lucky because you are to be shown a marvelous piece a statue of seti i as tall as yourself lahib closed an eye estimating her height erica couldnt believe he was so blasé it made her fears seem melodramatic and childish is the statue here asked erica oh no my dear we are showing it to you without the knowledge of the department of antiquities he winked so we must be reasonably careful and since it is such a large and marvelous piece we dont dare have it here in luxor it is on the west bank but we can deliver it wherever your people wish how do i get to see it asked erica very simple but first you must understand that you have to go alone we cannot show this type of piece to many people for obvious reasons if you are accompanied or even followed you will lose your chance to view it is that clear it is said erica very well all you have to do is cross the nile and take a taxi to a small village called qurna which is located i know the village said erica that makes it easier lahib laughed there is a small mosque in the village i know it said erica ah marvelous then you should have no trouble at all arrive at the mosque tonight at dusk one of the dealers like myself will meet you there and show you the statue its as simple as that all right said erica one other thing said lahib when you reach the west bank its best to hire a taxi that will wait for you below the village offer him an extra pound otherwise youll have trouble later getting one back to the ferry landing thank you very much said erica lahibs concern pleased her lahib watched erica walk down shari el muntazah toward the winter palace hotel she turned once and he waved then he quickly closed the door to the shop and secured it with a wooden beam in a recess below one of the floorboards he hid his best antiques and ancient pottery then he locked the back door and left for the station he was certain hed make the sevenoclock train for aswan as erica walked along the waterfront toward her hotel she felt significantly better than she had before visiting the curio antique shop her cloakanddagger expectations were unfounded lahib zayed had been open friendly and thoughtful her only disappointment was that she couldnt see the statue until evening erica looked up at the sky estimating the time until sunset she had another hour plenty of time to return to the hotel to change into jeans for the journey to qurna approaching the majestic temple of luxor which was now surrounded by the modern town erica suddenly stopped she had not given any thought to her being followed if she were it would ruin the whole plan turning around quickly she scanned the street for her shadow shed completely forgotten the man there were many pedestrians in sight but no hookednose man in a dark suit erica checked her watch again she had to know if she was being followed turning back to the temple she quickly bought a ticket and walked through the passageway between the towers of the front pylon entering the court of ramses ii majestically surrounded by a double row of papyrus columns she turned immediately to the right and stepped into a small chapel for the god amon from here erica could see the entrance as well as the courtyard there were about twenty people milling around photographing the statues of ramses ii erica decided to wait fifteen minutes if no one appeared she would forget her shadow she peered into the chapel to look at the reliefs they had been carved during the time of ramses ii and lacked the quality of the work shed seen at abydos she recognized the images of amon mut and khonsu when erica turned her attention back to the courtyard she was startled khalifa had rounded the edge of the pylon no more than five feet from where she was standing he was equally surprised he shot a hand into his jacket to grasp his pistol but caught himself and withdrew his hand as his face contorted into a halfsmile then he was gone erica blinked when she had recovered from the shock she ran from the chapel and looked down the corridor behind the double row of columns khalifa had disappeared pulling the strap of her bag up onto her shoulder erica hurried from the temple grounds she knew she was in trouble that her pursuer could ruin everything she reached the esplanade along the nile and looked both ways she had to lose him and checking her watch she realized she was running out of time the only time khalifa had not followed was when she had visited the village of qurna and hiked over a desert ridge to the valley of the kings erica thought that she could use the route in reverse she could go to the valley of the kings now then use the trail to visit qurna telling her taxi to wait for her at the base of the village then she realized the plan was ridiculous probably the only reason khalifa had not followed her to the valley of the kings was that he knew where she was going and did not want to subject himself to the heat and effort hed not been fooled if she were to really lose khalifa it would have to be in a crowd of people checking her watch again she had an idea it was now almost seven there was a seventhirty express train to cairo the same train shed taken the previous night the station and the platform had been jammed it was the best idea shed had the only trouble was that it would keep her from seeing yvon perhaps she could call from the station erica hailed a carriage as she had expected the station was swarming with travelers and she moved with difficulty to the ticket windows she passed an enormous stack of reed cages filled with clucking chickens a small herd of goats and sheep were tethered to a column and their plaintive bleating merged with the cacophony of voices that echoed in the dusty hall erica bought a oneway firstclass ticket to nag hamdi it was sevenseventeen it was even more difficult to walk down the platform than it had been to get to the ticket window erica did not look behind her she pushed and squeezed past crying relatives until she reached the comparative quiet alongside the firstclass coaches she climbed aboard coach two flashing her ticket to the conductor it was seventwentythree erica went directly to the toilet it was closed and locked so was the one opposite without hesitation she turned into coach three and hurried down the central aisle a toilet was free and she entered locking the door and trying to breathe as little of the stench as possible erica undid her cotton slacks and pulled them off then she pulled on her jeans banging her elbow on the sink as she wriggled into them it was seventwentynine she heard a whistle almost in a panic she changed into a blue blouse hastily pushed up her luxurious hair and pulled her khaki sun hat over her head glancing into the mirror she hoped her appearance had changed enough then she left the toilet and literally ran down the aisle to the next coach it was secondclass and more crowded most of the occupants had not taken their seats yet and were busy placing their belongings in the overhead racks erica continued from coach to coach when she reached thirdclass she found the chickens and cattle had been loaded between the coaches and progress became impossible looking out she assessed the milling crowd it was seventhirtytwo the train lurched and began to move as she climbed down to the platform there was a sudden increase in the murmur of voices and several people shouted and waved erica worked her way from the platform into the station and for the first time looked for khalifa the crowd began to disperse erica allowed the press of people to sweep her to the street once outside she hurried across to a small café and took a table with a view of the station ordering a small coffee she kept her eyes on the entrance she did not have to wait long pushing people rudely aside khalifa stormed from the station even from where erica was sitting she could sense his anger as he leaped into a taxi and headed down shari el mahatta toward the nile erica gulped down her coffee the sun had set and dusk was falling she was late picking up her bag she hurried from the café christ almighty yelled yvon why am i paying you two hundred dollars a day can you tell me that khalifa frowned and examined the fingernails of his left hand he knew he really did not have to suffer this tirade but his assignment fascinated him erica baron had tricked him and he was not accustomed to losing if he were he would have been dead a long time ago all right said yvon with a disgusted tone what are we going to do raoul having suggested khalifa felt more responsible than khalifa himself you should have someone meet the train said khalifa she bought a ticket to nag hamdi but i dont think she actually left i think it was all a trick to get away from me all right raoul have the train met said yvon decisively raoul went to the phone glad to have something to do listen khalifa said yvon losing erica has put this whole operation in jeopardy she got her instructions from the curio antique shop get over there and find out where shes been sent i dont care how you do it just do it without saying a word khalifa pushed off the bureau on which hed been leaning and left the hotel knowing that there was no way the shop owner was going to keep information from him unless he was willing to die under the towering sandstone cliffs the village of qurna was already shrouded in darkness when erica climbed the long hill from the road the taxi she had hired for the evening waited below its door ajar she trudged past the somber mudbrick houses cooking fires of dried dung could be seen in the courtyards illuminating the sharply grotesque summer sleeping platforms erica remembered the reason they were builtcobras and scorpionsand shivered despite the warmth of the night the darkened mosque with its whitewashed minaret looked silver it was about a hundred yards ahead erica paused to catch her breath looking back at the valley she could see the lights of luxor particularly the highrise new winter palace hotel a string of colored lights like christmas decorations marked the area of the abul haggag mosque erica was about to continue walking when there was a sudden movement in the darkness near her feet uttering a cry of fright she leaped back almost falling in the sand she was about to run when a bark followed by an angry growl pierced the air a small pack of snarling dogs suddenly surrounded her she bent down and picked up a rock it must have been a familiar gesture because the dogs scattered before she could throw a stone about a dozen people walked by erica as she passed through the village they were all dressed in black gowns and black shawls silent and faceless in the darkness erica realized that had she not passed through qurna during the day she probably would have been unable to find her way at night a sudden raucous cry of a donkey shattered the silence then stopped as abruptly as it had begun from where she was walking erica could see the outline of aida ramans house high up against the hillside the faint glow of an oil lamp shone from her windows rising behind the house erica could see the trail to the valley of the kings etched against the mountains she was now within fifty feet of the mosque there were no lights her steps slowed she knew she was late for the rendezvous it was not dusk it was night perhaps they had decided she was not coming maybe she should turn and go back to her hotel or visit with aida raman and tell her what she had learned from the papyrus erica stopped and looked at the building it appeared deserted then remembering lahib zayed and his casual attitude she shrugged her shoulders and started toward the door it opened slowly affording a view of the courtyard the facade of the mosque seemed to attract and reflect the starlight and the courtyard was brighter than the street she saw no one silently erica stepped inside closing the door behind her there was no sound or motion from the mosque all she could hear was an occasional dog barking in the village below finally she made herself walk forward beneath one of the archways she tried the door to the mosque it was locked walking along the small portico she knocked on the door to the imams quarters there was no answer the place was deserted erica stepped back into the courtyard they must have decided she was not coming and she eyed the door to the street but instead of leaving right away she walked back under the portico and sat down her back against the front of the mosque in front of her the dark archway framed a view of the courtyard beyond the walls erica could see the eastern sky which brightened in anticipation of the rising moon erica rummaged in her tote bag until she found a cigarette she lit one to salvage her courage and looked at her watch with the aid of a match it was eightfifteen as the moon rose the shadows in the courtyard grew paradoxically darker the longer erica sat the more her imagination played tricks on her every sound from the village made her jump after fifteen minutes shed had enough she stood up and dusted off the seat of her pants then she walked back across the courtyard and yanked open the wooden door to the street miss baron said a figure in a black burnoose he was standing in the dirt street just outside the door to the courtyard with the moon directly over his shoulder erica could not see his face he bowed before continuing i beg your pardon for the delay please follow me he smiled revealing huge teeth there was no more conversation the man who erica guessed was a nubian led her up the hillside above the village they followed one of the many trails and the going was easy with the moonlight reflecting from the light rock and sand they passed a few rectangular openings of tombs the nubian was breathing heavily now and it was with obvious relief that he stopped by a sloping cut into the mountainside at the base of the slope was an entrance closed with a heavy iron grille the number hung on the gate i beg your pardon but you must wait here for just a few minutes said the nubian before erica could respond he started back toward qurna erica watched the retreating figure then glanced at the iron gate she turned started to say something but the nubian was already so far away that she would have had to shout walking down the ramp erica grasped the iron gate and shook it the number rattled but the gate did not budge it was locked erica could just make out some ancient egyptian decoration on the walls she walked back up the ramp and the anxiety she had felt before entering the curio antique shop swept over her she stood on the lip of the tomb watching the nubian entering the village below in the distance a few dogs barked behind her she could feel the ominous presence of the overhanging mountain suddenly she heard a sharp metallic click behind her fear made her legs weak then she heard an agonizing grating of steel on steel she wanted to run but was unable to move as her imagination conjured horrid images issuing from the tomb the iron gate closed behind her and she heard steps slowly she forced herself to turn around good evening miss baron said a figure coming up the ramp he was dressed in a black burnoose like the nubians but with the hood over his head beneath the hood he wore a white turban my name is muhammad abdulal he bowed and erica regained some composure i apologize for these delays but unfortunately they are necessary the statues you are about to see are very valuable and we were afraid you might have been followed by the authorities erica again realized how important it had been for her to lose her shadow please follow me said muhammad as he passed erica and began climbing higher on the slope erica cast a last glance at the village below her she could barely make out her taxi waiting on the asphalt road she had to hurry to catch up to muhammad he turned to the left when they reached the very base of the sheer cliff trying to look up the rock face erica practically fell over backward they walked for another fifty feet and rounded a huge boulder again she had to hurry after muhammad on the other side of the rock was a ramp similar to that for tomb there was another heavy iron grille but this time without a number erica stopped behind muhammad as he fumbled with a large ring of keys she had lost her nerve but was now equally afraid to show fear she had had no idea the statue would be stored in such an isolated location the iron gate squealed on its hinges unaccustomed to being opened please said muhammad simply motioning for erica to enter it was an undecorated tomb she turned and watched muhammad close the door behind him there was a resounding click as the lock engaged anemic moonlight filtered in through the iron bars muhammad lit a single match and pushed past erica moving down a narrow corridor she had no choice but to stay close behind they moved in a small sphere of light and she had a helpless feeling that events were far beyond her control they entered an antechamber erica could make out dim line drawings on the walls muhammad bent down and touched his match to an oil lamp the light flickered making his shadow dance among the ancient egyptian deities on the walls a sharp gilded reflection caught ericas eye there it was the seti statue the burnished gold radiated a light more powerful than the lamp for the moment awe conquered fear and erica walked over to the sculpture its alabasterandgreenfeldspar eyes were hypnotic and she had to force herself to look below at the hieroglyphics there were the cartouches of seti i and tutankhamen the phrase was the same as that on the houston statue eternal life granted unto seti i who ruled after tutankhamen it is magnificent said erica with sincerity how much do you want for it we have others said muhammad wait until you see the others before you make your choice erica turned to look at him intending to say she was satisfied but she did not speak once again she was paralyzed by fear muhammad had flipped back his hood revealing his mustache and goldtipped teeth he was one of the killers of abdul hamdi we have a wonderful selection of statues in the next room said muhammad please he halfbowed and gestured toward the narrow doorway a cold sweat chilled her body the grate to the tomb was locked she had to play for time she turned and started toward the doorway not wanting to go deeper into the tomb but muhammad came up behind her please he said and pushed her gently forward their shadows moved grotesquely on the walls as they walked down the sloping corridor ahead erica could see a recess that extended on both sides of the passageway a stout beam ran from the floor up into the alcove as erica passed she realized that the beam supported a huge stone portcullis just beyond the passageway ended and a flight of stairs hewn from the rock led steeply downward into darkness how much farther she asked her voice was higher than usual just a little way with the light behind her ericas shadow fell onto the stairs in front of her blocking her vision she felt ahead with her foot it was at that point she felt something on her back she first thought it was muhammads hand then she realized he had centered his foot in the small of her back erica only had time to throw her hands out against the smooth walls of the stairway the force of the kick had knocked her feet out from under her and she began falling she landed on her buttocks but the stairs were so steep that she continued sliding unable to stop her downward motion into absolute blackness muhammad quickly put down his oil lamp and pulled a stone sledge from the recess with several carefully directed blows he dislodged the supporting beam triggering the balanced portcullis in slow motion the fortyfiveton granite block slid down a short incline then fell into place with a deafening crash that sealed the ancient tomb no american woman got off the train at nag hamdi said raoul and there was no one that even came close to ericas description on the train it looks like weve been tricked he was standing at the door to the balcony across the river the moonlight was bright on the mountains above the necropolis yvon was sitting rubbing his temples am i always destined to come so close only to see success slip through my fingers he turned to khalifa and what has the mighty khalifa learned there was no one at the curio antique shop the other shops were still open and there were plenty of tourists apparently the shop had closed right after erica left the proprietors name is lahib zayed and no one seemed to know where hed gone and i was quite insistent khalifa smiled i want the curio antique shop and the winter palace watched i dont care if you both have to stay up all night when yvon was alone he walked out onto the balcony the night was peaceful and soft the sound from the piano in the dining room drifted up through the palms nervously he began pacing the small terrace erica ended in a sitting position at the bottom of the stairs with one leg tucked under her her hands were badly scraped but otherwise she was unhurt most of the contents of her tote bag had fallen out she tried to look around in the stygian darkness but she could not even see her hand directly in front of her face like a blind person she groped in her bag for the flashlight it was not there struggling to her hands and knees she felt along the paving stone she found her camera which seemed intact then her guidebook but still no flashlight her hand hit a wall and she recoiled in fear every phobia shed ever had about snakes scorpions and spiders emerged to frighten her the image of the cobra at abydos plagued her groping back along the wall until she found the corner she felt her way back to the stairway and found the pack of cigarettes the book of matches was pushed beneath the cellophane cover she struck a match and held it away from her she was in a room about ten feet square with two doorways plus the stairway behind her the walls were plastered with painted scenes of everyday life in ancient egypt she was in one of the tombs of the nobles against the far wall erica caught a glimpse of her flashlight before the match singed the tips of her fingers she lit another and in its hesitant light walked over to retrieve the flashlight the front glass had broken but the bulb was still in place erica pressed the switch and it leaped to life without allowing herself time to think about her situation she returned to the stairs climbed to the top and ran the beam of the flashlight around the perimeter of the portcullis the granite plug fit into its slot with incredible precision she pushed against it it was cold and motionless like the mountain itself returning to the base of the stairs she began to explore the tomb the two doorways from the antechamber led into a burial chamber on the left and a storeroom on the right she entered the burial chamber first except for a roughhewn sarcophagus the room was empty the ceiling was painted dark blue with hundreds of gold fivepointed stars and the walls were decorated with scenes from the book of the dead from the back wall erica could read whose tomb she was in ahmose scribe and vizier to pharaoh amenhotep iii moving her light about the sarcophagus erica saw a skull lying amid rags on the floor hesitantly she moved closer the eye sockets were darkened pits and the lower jaw had separated giving the mouth an expression of continued agony all the teeth were in place it was not that old standing over the skull erica realized that she was looking at the remains of a whole corpse the body had been curled up beside the sarcophagus as if in sleep ribs and vertebrae could be seen through the decaying clothing just under the skull erica saw a flash of gold falteringly she reached down and lifted the object it was a yale ring gingerly erica replaced it and stood up lets see the next room she said out loud hoping the sound of her voice would reassure her she did not want to think not yet and as long as there were places to explore she could keep her mind from the reality of the situation acting like a tourist she passed into the next and last chamber it was the same size as the burial chamber and completely empty save for a few rocks and a little sand the decorations were of everyday life as in the antechamber but they were unfinished the wall to the right had been prepared for a large harvest scene and the figures were drawn in red ocher there was a broad band of white plaster prepared for hieroglyphics running along the bottom after shining her light around the room erica returned to the antechamber she was running out of things to do and a cold fear threatened to surface she began to pick up the rest of her things from the floor and replace them in the tote bag thinking she might have probably missed something she climbed the long flight of stairs to the granite plug an overwhelming sense of claustrophobia swept over her and vainly trying to control her emotions she pushed at the stone with both hands help she shouted at the top of her lungs the sound reverberated against the rock faces and echoed within the depths of the tomb then the silence closed in on her again smothering her with its absolute stillness she felt as if she needed air her breathing became labored she slapped the granite plug with an open palm harder and harder until she could feel pain tears welled up and overflowed her eyes and she continued to pound the stone sobs racking her body the exertion exhausted her and she slowly sank to her knees still crying uncontrollably all her fears of death and abandonment rose from the recesses of her mind causing renewed spells of sobbing and shaking she had suddenly realized that she was buried alive having faced the grim reality of her situation erica began to recover a modicum of rational thought she picked up the flashlight and descended the long flight of stone steps to the antechamber she wondered when yvon would begin to worry that something might have happened once he became suspicious he would probably go to the curio antique shop but did lahib zayed know where she was would her taxi driver ever think of reporting that he had taken an american girl to qurna who had failed to return erica had no answers to these questions but the mere asking of them revived a glimmer of hope that supported her until her flashlight perceptibly dimmed she switched it off and rummaged through her bag until she found three books of matches it wasnt much but while looking for the matches she came across a felttip pen touching the pen gave her an idea she could leave some sort of message on the wall of the unfinished chamber explaining what had happened to her she could write it in form of hieroglyphics so that her captors would probably not recognize its significance she did not delude herself into believing that such an act would have any value short of giving her mind something to do but that was something fear had given way to despair and bitter regret doing something would at least distract her with the flashlight propped up with several rocks erica began to space out her message the simpler the better she thought once the spacing was accomplished she began to outline the figures she was about halfway through when the flashlight suddenly dimmed markedly it came back on again but only for a moment then it dimmed to a red ember once again erica refused to contemplate her plight she struck matches to continue the hieroglyphic text she was crouching down at the base of the wall on the right the text running in columns from the floor to the bottom of the unfinished harvest scene she still suffered intermittent bouts of tears as she admitted to herself that her cleverness had been just enough to get her into inescapable trouble everyone had warned her about the involvement and she had listened to no one shed been a fool training in egyptology had not equipped her to deal with criminals especially someone like muhammad abdulal with only one pack of matches left erica did not want to think about how much time she had left about how long the oxygen would last she bent down near to the floor to draw a bird before she could outline the figure the match suddenly went out it had gone very fast and erica cursed in the darkness she struck another but as she bent to write this also went right out erica lit a third and very carefully approached the area where she was working the match burned smoothly then suddenly wavered as if in a wind licking her fingers erica could feel a stream of air coming from a small vertical crack in the plaster close to the floor the flashlight still glowed very slightly in the darkness and erica used it as a beacon to fetch one of the rocks shed used to prop it up it was a piece of granite probably part of the sarcophagus lid erica carried it over to the draft and struck another match holding the meager light in her left hand she hit the plaster in the area of the crack nothing happened she continued to hit the area as hard as she could until the match went out then locating the crack in the darkness by feel erica pounded the spot blindly for more than a minute finally calming down she lit another match at the spot where the crack had been now there was a small hole big enough for her to insert her finger there was a space beyond and more importantly a current of cool air unseeing erica continued to pound the area with the piece of granite until she could feel movement beneath the stone she lit a match a crack now ran along the juncture of the floor and the wall before arching back to join the slowly enlarging opening erica concentrated on pounding this area holding the match with her left hand suddenly a large piece of plaster broke free and disappeared after a moment erica heard it hit the ground the hole was now about a foot in diameter when she tried to light another match the air current put it out gingerly she stuck her hand into the hole as if she were reaching into the mouth of a wild beast she could feel a smooth plastered surface on the inside turning her palm up she could feel a ceiling she had discovered another room built diagonally below the room she was in with renewed enthusiasm erica slowly enlarged the opening she worked in the dark not willing to sacrifice any more matches finally the hole was deep enough to allow her to stick her head in after locating a few pebbles she lay prone on the floor of the chamber shoving her head into the opening she let the pebbles go and listened for the impact the room did not seem deep and appeared to have a floor of sand erica emptied her cigarettes from the pack and lit the paper when it was flaming she pushed it into the hole and let it go the flames went out but the ember sank in a spiral when it landed it was about eight feet away erica found more stones and with her head in the hole she tossed them in various directions trying to get some idea of the space it seemed to be a square room and what pleased erica there was a constant movement of air sitting in the inky blackness she debated what she should do if she lowered herself into the room shed found there was a chance she would not be able to get back into the tomb she was in but what difference did that make the real problem was finding the courage to go into the hole she had only half a pack of matches left erica picked up her tote bag counting to three she forced herself to drop it through the opening on all fours she backed up to the wall and lowered her legs into the hole she had an image of being swallowed slowly she wriggled farther and farther into space until the tips of her toes touched a smooth plastered wall like a diver trying to get himself to plunge into cold water erica forced her body to slide through the hole into the black void as she fell for what seemed forever her arms flailed in the air attempting to keep her feet first she landed off balance but unhurt and fell over backward on a rubblestrewn sand floor fear of the unknown made her stumble to her feet only to lose her balance again and sprawl forward there was a tremendous amount of dust choking her her outstretched right hand fell on an object that she thought was a piece of wood she held onto it hoping it would ignite like a torch finally she managed to stand up she switched the piece of wood to her left hand in order to get her matches from her jeans pocket but the object no longer felt like a piece of wood touching it with both hands she realized she was holding a mummified forearm and hand trailing wrappings in the darkness with disgust she threw the object away from her shaking erica pulled the matches from her pocket and struck one as its light filtered outward in the dust erica found herself in a catacomb with bare unadorned walls and filled with partially wrapped mummies the bodies had been broken apart and stripped of any valuables then rudely discarded turning around slowly erica saw evidence that the ceiling had partially caved in in the corner she saw a low dark doorway grabbing her tote bag she struggled forward in the kneedeep debris the match burned her fingers and she shook it out moving forward with her hands groping for the wall then the doorway she passed into the next room lighting another match she found herself in a room filled with equally grotesque images a niche in the wall was filled with decapitated mummified heads there was evidence of more caveins on the wall opposite erica were two widely separated doorways she worked her way into the center of the room and holding the match ahead of her decided the air was coming from the smaller passage the match went out and she moved forward with her hands ahead of her suddenly there was a great commotion a cavein erica threw herself forward against the wall feeling particles hit her hair and shoulders but there was no crash instead the commotion in the air continued and the atmosphere became saturated with dust and highpitched screeches then something landed on ericas shoulder it was alive and clawing as her hand swept the animal off her back she touched wings it wasnt a cavein it was a million disturbed bats she covered her head with her arm and crouched low against the wall breathing as best she could gradually the bats quieted and she was able to move into the next room erica slowly realized that she had fallen into a maze of tombs of the common people of ancient thebes the catacombs had been progressively cut into the mountainside in the form of a labyrinth to make room for the millions of dead sometimes they had inadvertently connected with other tombs in this case with the tomb of ahmose in which erica had been interred the connection had been plastered over and forgotten erica pushed on although the presence of the bats was horrifying it was also encouraging there had to be a connection with the outside eventually she tried lighting the mummy wrappings and discovered they burned briskly in fact erica found that the pieces of mummies with their wrappings burned like torches and she forced herself to pick them up the forearms were best because they were easy to hold with the help of better light she worked her way through many galleries and up several levels until she felt fresh air dousing her torch erica walked the last feet by the light of the moon when she emerged into the warm egyptian night she was several hundred yards from the place she had entered the mountain with muhammad directly below her was the village of qurna there were very few lights for a time erica stood trembling at the entrance to the catacomb appreciating the moon and the stars in a way shed never done she knew she was enormously lucky to be alive the first thing she needed was a place to rest pull herself together and have a drink her throat was raw from the suffocating dust she also wanted to wash as if the experience clung to her like dirt and most of all she wished to see a friendly face the closest source of all these comforts was aida ramans house she could see it up against the hillside a light still shone in the window stepping from the seclusion of the catacomb erica walked warily along the base of the cliff until she got back to luxor she would take no chance on being seen by muhammad or the nubian what she really wanted to do was get back to yvon shed tell him as best she could the location of the statue and then get out of egypt shed had enough when she was directly above aida ramans erica began the descent for the first hundred yards it was deep sand then loose gravel which frightened her by shifting noisily in the bright moonlight finally she reached the back of the house erica waited for a few minutes in the shadows watching the village she saw no movement satisfied that it was all clear she walked around the building into the courtyard and knocked at the door aida raman shouted something in arabic erica responded by calling out her name and asking if she could talk with her go away shouted aida through the closed door erica was surprised aida had been so warm and friendly please mrs raman she said through the door i need a drink of water the door unlatched and swung open aida raman was clad in the same cotton dress she had on for their first meeting thank you said erica im sorry to trouble you but i am very thirsty aida looked older than she had two days previously gone was the apparent humor all right she said but wait here by the door you cannot stay while the old woman fetched a drink erica looked around the room the familiar sight was comforting the longhandled shovel nested in its brackets the framed photos hung neatly on the wall many were of howard carter with a turbaned arab erica thought had to be raman there was a small mirror among the photos and erica was shocked by her appearance aida raman brought some of the juice shed given erica on her first visit erica drank slowly swallowing hurt her throat my family was very angry when i told them you tricked me into revealing the papyrus to you said aida family said erica the drink reviving her i thought you said you were the last of the ramans i am my two sons died but i also had two daughters who have families it was one of my grandsons i told about your visit he became very angry and took the papyrus what did he do with it asked erica alarmed i dont know he said it had to be treated very carefully and that he would put it somewhere safe he also said that the papyrus was a curse and that now that you have seen it you must die do you believe that erica knew that aida raman was no fool i dont know its not what my husband said mrs raman erica said i translated the whole papyrus your husband was right there was nothing about a curse the papyrus was written by an ancient architect for pharaoh seti i a dog barked loudly in the village a human voice shouted in reply you must go said aida raman you must go in case my grandson returns please what is your grandsons name asked erica muhammad abdulal the news hit erica like a slap in the face you know him asked aida i think i met him tonight does he live here in qurna no he lives in luxor have you seen him tonight asked erica nervously today but not tonight please you must go erica hastened to leave she was more nervous than aida but at the doorway she paused loose ends were beginning to merge what kind of work does muhammad abdulal do erica was remembering that abdul hamdi had written in the hidden letter in the guidebook that a government official was involved he is the chief of the guard of the necropolis and he helps his father run the concession stand in the valley of the kings erica nodded in understanding chief of the guards was the perfect position from which to mastermind a blackmarket operation then erica thought about the concession stand and raman and that concession stand is the same one that your husband sarwat raman built yes yes miss baron please go all at once everything became clear all at once she believed she could explain everything and it all depended on the concession stand in the valley of the kings aida said erica with feverish excitement listen to me as your husband said there is no curse of the pharaohs and i can prove it provided you will help i just need time all i ask is that you do not tell anyone not even your family that i have returned to see you they will not ask i can assure you so all im begging is that you do not bring it up please erica grasped aidas upper arms to emphasize her earnestness you can prove my husband was right absolutely said erica aida nodded her head all right oh there is something else said erica i need a flashlight all i have is an oil lamp that will be fine said erica as she left erica gave aida a hug but the old woman remained passive and withdrawn holding the oil lamp and several books of matches erica stood in the shadow of the house watching the village it was deathly still the moon had passed the zenith and was now in the western sky the lights of luxor were still bright with activity taking the same path she had two days previously erica hiked up the spur of the mountain it was a much easier climb in the moonlight than in the hot sun erica knew she was violating her recent resolve to leave the rest of the mystery to yvon and the police but the conversation with aida had rekindled her intoxication with the past going from the tomb of ahmose down into the public catacombs had offered her a single explanation for all the disparate events including the mystery of the inscription on the statue and the meaning of the papyrus and with the knowledge that muhammad abdulal would never imagine she was free erica felt reasonably safe even if he wanted to check the ahmose tomb it would probably take days to raise the portcullis erica believed she had time and she wanted to visit the valley of the kings and the concession stand of raman if she was right she would discover a truth that would make tutankhamens tomb pale to insignificance reaching the summit of the ridge she paused to catch her breath the desert wind softly whistled among the naked peaks adding to the feeling of desolation from where she was standing she could see into the dark and barren valley of the kings with its network of etched paths erica could see her goal the concession stand and rest house stood out clearly on its small rocky promontory seeing it encouraged her and she pushed on descending carefully to keep from setting off small avalanches of pebbles she did not want to disturb anyone who might be in the valley once she had joined the route to the ancient necropolis workers village the trail flattened out and she could walk much more easily before entering one of the carefully scraped pathways lined with stones that ran between the tombs erica waited and listened all she could hear was the wind and the occasional screech of a bat in flight with a light step erica walked to the center of the valley and mounted the front steps of the concession stand as she expected it was tightly shuttered and locked walking back out onto the veranda erica let her line of vision trace the triangle made by tutankhamens tomb seti is tomb and the concession stand then she walked around to the rear of the rock building and steeling herself against the foul odors pushed her way into the ladies room putting a match to aida ramans oil lamp she checked out the room following the foundation line there was nothing strange about its construction within the mens room the pungent smell of urine was much more intense it came from a long urinal made from fired brick built along the front wall above the urinal was a twofoothigh crawl space that extended forward under the veranda the mens room did not abut the front foundation of the building erica walked toward the urinal the lip of the crawl space was at shoulder height holding the oil lamp into the opening she tried to look in but the light penetrated for only five or six feet she could see an opened sardine can and a few bottles strewn on the dirt floor with the help of the waste barrel erica climbed up into the crawl space she left her tote bag on the edge avoiding the debris she crawled forward like a crab until she came to the front masonry wall the smell of the toilet was worse in the confined space and ericas enthusiasm rapidly waned but having come this far she forced herself to check the rough stone wall from one end to the other nothing resting her head on her wrists erica admitted that shed been wrong it had seemed so clever she sighed deeply then tried to turn around it was difficult so she began to worm her way backward toward the toilet holding the oil lamp in one hand she attempted to push herself backward with the other but the earth under her was loose and gave way she tried to gain a better purchase on the ground and when she pushed she felt something smooth under the dirt erica twisted herself and looked down her right hand was touching a metallic surface scraping away some of the dirt she exposed a piece of sheet metal she put the lamp down and with both hands began to clear away the loose earth at the perimeter of the metal she could see that it had been set down into a carved bed in the rock she had to clear away all the dirt before she could lift the edge of the metal and work it up over the mounds of surrounding earth beneath the sheet of metal a yawning shaft had been cut into the bedrock holding the light over the hole erica could see that it was about four feet deep and was the beginning of a tunnel that headed toward the front of the building she had been right her head slowly rose and she stared into the gloom a sense of satisfaction and excitement gripped her she knew how howard carter had felt in november quickly she pulled her tote bag into the depths of the crawl space then she lowered herself backward into the shallow pit and held the oil lamp to the mouth of the tunnel it slanted downward and immediately enlarged taking a deep breath she moved forward at first she had to walk partially bent over as she advanced she tried to estimate the yardage the tunnel was heading directly for tutankhamens tomb nassif boulos crossed the dark empty parking area of the valley of the kings he was seventeen years old and the youngest of the three nighttime guards as he walked he hiked up the shoulder strap of his aged rifle which had been abandoned in egypt during the first world war he was angry because it was not his turn to walk up to the end of the valley and back to the guard house where he could rest and get a drink once again his colleagues had taken advantage of his youth and lack of seniority by ordering him to make the rounds the moonlit night soon soothed his anger leaving him merely restless and anxious for something to break the boredom of his watch but the valley was quiet and each of the tombs was sealed by its stout iron gate nassif would have loved to use his rifle against a thief and his mind wandered into one of his fantasies in which he protected the valley against a band of brigands he stopped across from the entrance to tutankhamens tomb he wished the tomb were being found now instead of a halfcentury before he looked up at the concession stand because that was where hed have been on guard in carters day hed have hidden behind the parapet on the veranda and no one would be able to approach the tomb without succumbing to his murderous rifle looking up nassif noticed the door to the lavatories was ajar he realized it had never been left open before and he debated whether he wanted to walk up to the building then he looked up into the valley and decided hed check the lavatory on the way back while he walked he pictured himself traveling to cairo with a group of men hed arrested erica estimated that she should be very close to tutankhamens tomb progress had been slow because of the rounded uneven floor of the tunnel in front of her there was a sharp turn to the left and she could not see ahead until she had rounded the corner the floor of the passageway then slanted steeply down and entered a room with her hands pressed against the rough rockhewn sides of the tunnel she inched herself downward until her feet rested on a smooth floor she had entered an underground chamber now erica guessed she was directly below the antechamber of tutankhamens tomb she lifted the oil lamp above her head and the light spread out illuminating smoothly finished but unadorned walls the room was about twentyfive feet long and fifteen feet wide with a ceiling made of a single gigantic limestone block as ericas eyes dropped to the floor she saw an enormous tangle of skeletons some with varying amounts of naturally mummified tissue holding the light a little closer she could see that each one of the skulls had been fractured and penetrated by the blow of a heavy blunt instrument my god whispered erica she knew what she was looking at this was the remains of the massacre of the ancient workers who had dug the chamber in which she was standing slowly she passed through the room with its gruesome reminder of ancient cruelty and began to descend a long flight of steps that led to a masonry wall raman had opened a large hole and erica stepped into another much larger room when the light penetrated the darkness erica gasped for breath and steadied herself against the wall spread out in front of her was an archaeological fairyland the room was supported by massive square columns the walls were painted with exquisite images of the ancient egyptian pantheon in front of each deity was the image of seti i erica had found the pharaohs treasure nenephta had realized that the safest spot for one treasure was below another gingerly erica advanced holding her oil lamp so that the flickering light could play upon the myriad objects carefully stored within the room in contrast to tutankhamens small tomb there was no disarray everything had its place entire gilded chariots were standing as if waiting to be harnessed to a horse huge coffers and upright chests fashioned from cedar and inlaid with ebony lined the right wall one small ivory chest was open and its contentjewelry made with unparalleled elegancehad been carefully laid out on the floor obviously it had been a source of plunder for raman wandering around the central pillars erica discovered there was another stairway this led to a further room of the same dimensions also filled with treasure there were several passageways leading to still more rooms my god said erica again only this time with astonishment not horror she realized that she was in a vast complex of chambers extending downward and outward in bewildering directions she knew she was gazing on a treasure beyond comprehension as she wandered on she thought of the famous deir elbahri cache discovered in the late s and carefully plundered by the rasul family for ten years here the raman family and then the abdulal family were apparently doing the same entering another room erica stopped she was standing in a chamber that was relatively empty there were four matching chests of ebony built in the form of osiris the decorations on the walls were from the book of the dead the vaulted ceiling was painted black with gold stars in front of erica was a doorway carefully blocked with masonry and sealed with the ancient necropolis seals on each side of the doorway were alabaster plinths with hieroglyphics carved in high relief along the front erica could read the phrase instantly eternal life granted to seti i who rests under tutankhamen all at once it was clear to erica that the verb was rest not rule and the preposition was under not after she also realized she was looking at the original location of the two seti statues they had been standing across from each other in front of the masonry wall for three thousand years suddenly erica realized that she was standing at the unopened entrance to the burial chamber of the mighty seti i what she had found was not just a treasure trove but an entire pharaonic tomb the statue of seti she had seen had been one of the guards of the burial chamber like the bituminized statues found in tutankhamens tomb seti i had not been buried in the tomb constructed in a pattern of the other new kingdom pharaohs it had been nenephtas final ruse a substitute body had been buried in the tomb publicly proclaimed to be setis when in actuality seti had been buried in a secret tomb below tutankhamen nenephta had pleased both sides he gave the professional thieves a tomb to rob and his sovereign protection that no other pharaoh had been given nenephta probably also believed that even if someone stumbled into tutankhamens tomb they would never imagine that it would serve as a shield for the mighty treasure below he had understood the ways of the greedy and unjust shaking the lamp to check the oil erica decided that shed better begin the journey back reluctantly she turned and retraced her footsteps continuing to marvel at nenephtas scheme he had indeed been clever but hed also been arrogant leaving the papyrus in tutankhamens tomb had been the weakest link in his elaborate plan it had provided the clue for the equally clever raman to solve the mystery erica wondered if the arab had gone to the great pyramid as she had and if he noticed that the chambers had been built one on top of the other or if on visiting one of the tombs of the nobles he had found a tomb below it walking up the narrow passage erica thought of the enormity of the discovery and the huge stakes involved no wonder there had been a murder the thought brought erica to a stop she wondered just how many murders there had been for more than fifty years the secret had to have been kept the young man from yale all at once erica began to question the association of the socalled curse of the pharaohs perhaps the people had been killed to protect the secret what about lord carnarvon himself reaching the uppermost chamber erica paused to glance at the jewelry taken from the ivory chest although she had been scrupulously careful not to touch anything for fear of disturbing the archaeological aspects of the tomb she felt comfortable touching something already disturbed she picked up a pendant with a cartouche of seti i rendered in solid gold she wanted to have something in case yvon and ahmed refused to believe her story so she took the pendant with her as she mounted the steps to the room filled with skeletons of the luckless ancient workers climbing up into the tunnel was much easier than the descent at the end she placed the oil lamp on the dirt and pulled herself into the crawl space under the concession stand she had to decide the best way to return to luxor it was just past midnight so the chances of running into muhammad or the nubian were much less her biggest worry was the government guard who worked under muhammad on the asphalt road into the valley she remembered seeing a gatehouse consequently she could not leave via the road but would have to take the trail back to qurna manipulating the piece of sheet metal was difficult in the confined space erica had to slide it over the dirt and allow it to drop into its bed then with the sardine can shed seen earlier she began to scoop the loose dirt over the metal cover nassif was several hundred feet away from the concession stand when he heard the clank of metal against stone immediately he pulled the rifle from his shoulder and dashed toward the partially open doorway to the lavatories with the butt of the rifle he pushed the door completely open moonlight filtered into the small entryway erica heard the door opening and smothered the oil lamp with her hand she was about ten feet from the edge of the mens room her eyes quickly adjusted to the dark and she could see the doorway to the vestibule her heart began to pound as it had when richard entered her hotel room while she watched a dark silhouette slipped into the room even in the partial light erica could recognize the rifle a feeling of panic began to grip her as the man slowly moved directly toward her he was hunched over moving like a cat stalking its prey with no idea what the man could see erica hugged the ground he appeared to be looking directly at her as he reached the wall of the urinal then he stopped and for what seemed like hours he stood there intently staring finally he reached out and grabbed a handful of loose dirt cocking his arm he tossed the dirt into the recess erica closed her eyes as a portion of it hit her the man repeated the action some of the pebbles clanked against the stillexposed sheet metal nassif stood up harrah he muttered he was angry because he did not even get to shoot a rat erica felt a small amount of relief but noticed the man did not move away he stood there looking at her in the darkness with his rifle back on his shoulder erica was perplexed until she heard the trickle of urine there was enough moonlight reflecting from the sail of the felucca for erica to see the time it was after one the passage across the nile was so smooth that she could have dozed crossing the river was the last hurdle and she allowed her body to relax she was sure luxor was safe the excitement of her discovery had superseded the harrowing experience in the tomb and it was her anticipation of revealing her find that kept her awake looking back toward the west bank erica felt pleased shed climbed from the valley of the kings passed the sleeping village of qurna and crossed the cultivated fields to the banks of the nile without any problems a confrontation with some dogs had been solved by merely bending down to pick up a stone she stretched her tired legs the boat heeled against a puff of wind and erica looked up at the graceful curve of the sail across the starstrewn sky she was not sure who shed enjoy telling her discovery to the most yvon ahmed or richard yvon and ahmed would be the most appreciative richard would be the most surprised even her mother would for once be genuinely pleased she would never again have to make excuses at the country club for her daughters career choice back on the east bank she was pleased to find the lobby of the winter palace hotel deserted she had to call out at the desk to raise a clerk the sleepy egyptian although taken aback by her appearance gave her a key and an envelope without saying a word erica started up the broad carpeted stairway while the clerk looked after her wondering what she could have been doing to get so dirty erica glanced at the envelope it was winter palace stationery addressed to her in a bold heavy hand when she reached the corridor she put her finger into the corner of the envelope tearing it open while she navigated around the remnants of the hotel construction at her door she was about to insert the key when she unfolded the letter it was a meaningless scribble looking at the outside of the envelope erica wondered if it were some kind of joke if so she did not understand it or appreciate it it was like getting a phone call and hearing the person hang up without speaking it was somehow unnerving erica looked at her door if there was one thing shed learned during the trip it was that hotels were not safe places she remembered finding ahmed in her room richards arrival her room being searched with a renewed sense of uncertainty she pushed her key into the door suddenly she thought she heard a noise in her present state of mind that was all she needed leaving the key dangling in its slot erica fled down the corridor in her haste her tote bag hit against a stack of building blocks with a resounding crunch behind her she heard her door being rapidly unlocked from within when evangelos had heard the sound of the key he had jumped up and rushed to the door kill her shouted stephanos awakened by the noise drawing his beretta evangelos whipped open the door in time to see erica disappear down the main stairway she had no idea who was in her room but she had no illusions about being protected by the sleeping clerk besides he wasnt even at the desk she had to get to yvon at the new winter palace she ran out the back of the hotel into the garden in spite of his size evangelos could move like a hawk on the attack especially when he concentrated and when given an order for violence he was like a rabid dog erica ran through a flowerbed and reached the edge of the pool trying to run around it she slipped on the wet tiles falling on her side scrambling to her feet she discarded her bag and began to run again footsteps were gaining on her evangelos was close enough for an easy shot stop he yelled leveling his gun at ericas back erica knew it was hopeless there was still another fifty yards to the new winter palace she stopped exhausted her chest heaving and turned to look at her pursuer he was only thirty feet away she recognized him from the al azhar mosque the huge laceration he had that day was now sutured making him look like the frankenstein monster his gun was pointed at her the muzzle hidden by an evil silencer evangelos tried to decide what kind of shot hed make finally holding the gun out at arms length he aimed for ericas neck and slowly began to pull the trigger erica saw his arm extend slightly and her eyes widened as she realized he was going to shoot even though shed stopped as commanded no the gun muffled by the silencer gave a soft thump erica felt no pain and the image in front of her remained clear then the strangest thing happened a small red flower blossomed in the center of evangelos forehead and he fell forward onto his face the gun dropping from his hand erica could not move her hands were motionless at her sides behind her she heard movement within the bushes then a voice you should not have been so clever about losing me erica slowly turned in front of her was the man with the pointed tooth and hooked nose that was very close said khalifa motioning toward evangelos i assume you are on your way to monsieur de margeaus youd better hurry there will be more trouble erica tried to speak but couldnt she nodded and stumbled past khalifa her gait unsteady on rubbery legs she did not remember how she got to yvons room the frenchman opened the door and she collapsed into his arms mumbling about the shot about being sealed in the tomb about finding the statue yvon was calm stroking her hair sitting her down telling her to start from the beginning she was about to begin when someone knocked at the door yes called yvon instantly alert it is khalifa yvon opened the door and khalifa propelled stephanos into the room you hired me to protect the girl and get the person who tried to kill her here he is khalifa pointed toward stephanos stephanos looked at yvon then at erica who was surprised that khalifa had been hired by yvon to protect her since yvon had deliberately downplayed her risk erica began to feel uncomfortable look yvon said stephanos at length it is ridiculous for you and me to be at odds with each other youre angry at me because i sold the first seti statue to the man from houston but all i did was get the statue from egypt to switzerland there really is no competition between us you want to control the black market fine i just want to protect my corner i can get your stuff out of egypt with a timetested method we should work together erica looked quickly at yvon to see his reaction she wanted to hear him laugh and tell stephanos that he was all wrong that he yvon wanted to destroy the black market yvon ran his fingers through his hair why were you threatening erica he asked because she had learned too much from abdul hamdi i wanted to protect my route but if you two are working together then everythings fine you didnt have anything to do with hamdis death and the disappearance of the second statue asked yvon no said stephanos i swear it i hadnt even heard about the second seti statue that was what worried me i was afraid i was being closed out and that hamdis letter would get to the police closing her eyes erica let the truth sweep over her yvon was no crusader his idea of controlling the black market meant controlling it for his own ends not for the benefit of science egypt or the world his passion for antiquities superseded any moral issue erica had been duped and more aggravating still she could have been killed her fingernails dug into the couch she knew she had to get away she had to tell ahmed about setis tomb stephanos did not kill abdul hamdi said erica suddenly the people who killed abdul hamdi are the people here in luxor who control the source of the antiquities the seti statue was brought back here to luxor ive seen it and i can lead us to it she was careful to use the word us yvon looked back at erica a little surprised by her sudden recovery she smiled at him reassuringly her instincts for selfpreservation gave her unexpected power furthermore said erica stephanos route through yugoslavia is far better than trying to get things from alexandria in cotton bales stephanos nodded as he began talking with yvon smart woman and shes right my method is far better than packing antiquities in cotton bales was that really what you had planned my god it would last for one or two shipments at the most erica stretched she knew that she had to convince yvon that she had personal interests in antiquities tomorrow i can show you the location of the seti statue where is it asked yvon in one of the unmarked tombs of the nobles on the west bank it is very difficult to describe its location ill have to show you its above the village of qurna and there are a number of other very interesting pieces erica fished in the pocket of her jeans for the gold seti pendant she pulled it out and tossed it casually onto a table my fee for finding the seti statue will be for stephanos to get this pendant out of the country for me this is exquisite yvon said examining the necklace there are many more pieces there some much better than that the pendant was the one i could afford now i for one would like to bathe and get some rest in case you havent noticed ive had quite a night erica went over to yvon and gave him a kiss on the cheek it was the hardest thing shed done she thanked khalifa for helping her in the garden then she boldly walked to the door erica said yvon calmly she turned yes there was a silence perhaps you should stay here said yvon it was apparent he was debating what to do with her tonight im too tired said erica the implication was obvious stephanos smiled behind his hand raoul called yvon i want to make sure miss baron is safe tonight i think ill be fine said erica opening the door just to be sure said yvon i want raoul to go with you evangelos body was still lying in the moonlight by the pool as erica and raoul walked back toward the winter palace he looked like he was sleeping except for the pool of dark blood that ran from under his head and dripped into the water erica averted her face as raoul went over and checked to see if evangelos was really dead suddenly she noticed evangelos semiautomatic pistol still lying on the tiles erica stole a glance at raoul he was struggling to turn evangelos over without looking at erica he spoke god khalifa is fantastic he got him between the eyes erica reached down and picked up the gun it was heavier than she expected her finger curled around the trigger she detested the instrument and it frightened her she had never held a gun before and the knowledge of its lethal capabilities made her tremble she did not delude herself she knew she could never pull the trigger but she turned and looked at raoul who was standing up and brushing his hands he was dead before he hit the ground said raoul turning toward erica ah i see you found his gun hand it to me and ill put it in his hand dont move said erica slowly raouls eyes danced back and forth between the gun and ericas face erica what shut up take off your jacket raoul complied tossing his blazer on the ground now pull your shirt over your head commanded erica erica said raoul now she extended evangelos gun to arms length raoul yanked his shirt from his trousers and with some difficulty pulled it over his head beneath his shirt he had on a sleeveless undershirt strapped under his left was a small pistol erica moved around behind him and took the gun from the holster she threw it into the pool hearing it hit the water she hesitated fearful raoul would be angry then the absurdity of the idea caught her of course he was going to be angry she was holding a gun on him she had raoul replace his shirt so he could see where he was going then she ordered him to walk around to the front of the hotel he tried to talk and she told him again to shut up erica thought how ridiculously easy it was in gangster movies to incapacitate a man by hitting nothing if raoul had turned around he could have taken the gun but he didnt and they walked single file through the shadows around to the front of the hotel several antique street lights cast a pale glow over a row of taxis parked along the curb of the curved driveway the drivers had long since departed for the night their principal job being to run back and forth between the hotel and the airport but since the last flight arrived at nineten pm there was nothing for them to do tourists preferred the romantic carriages for transport in and around the town with evangelos gun trembling in her hand erica marched raoul along the line of aged taxis glancing in at the ignitions most of the keys were in place she wanted to get to ahmed but had to decide what to do with raoul the lead car was similar to the others with the exception of tassels lining the rear window the keys were in the ignition lie down commanded erica she was terrified someone would walk out of the hotel raoul took it upon himself to step sideways onto the closeclipped lawn hurry up said erica trying to sound angry leaning on his palms raoul lay down he kept his hands under him ready to spring his confusion dissolving into anger arms out in front of you said erica she opened the door to the taxi and got in behind the vinylcoated steering wheel a pair of soft red plastic dice hung from the dash the engine turned over agonizingly slowly belched black smoke then caught keeping the gun on raoul erica searched for the headlight switch and flipped it on then she threw the pistol on the seat next to her and put the car in gear it lurched forward and bucked dramatically bouncing the pistol from the seat to the floor out of the corner of her eye erica saw raoul leap to his feet and rush toward the taxi she played with the accelerator and clutch trying to ease the bucking and gain speed as he jumped on the back bumper and grabbed the closed trunk the car was in second gear when erica pulled out onto the broad illuminated boulevard there was no other traffic and she accelerated as fast as she could past the temple of luxor when the motor was racing erica forced the gearshift into third she had no idea of the speed because the speedometer was not functioning in the rearview mirror she could see raoul still clinging to the trunk his dark hair was blowing wildly in the wind erica wanted to get him off the car she threw the steering wheel from side to side the taxi careened in a serpentine manner its tires screeching but raoul pressed himself against the back of the car and managed to hold on erica put the car in fourth gear and pressed on the accelerator the taxi leaped forward but developed a shimmy in the rightfront tire the vibration was so violent that she had to hold the steering wheel tightly with both hands as she shot past the two ministers houses the soldiers on guard just smiled at seeing the shuddering taxi speed by with a man clinging to the trunk jamming on the brakes erica brought the car to a sudden stop raoul slid up onto the back window downshifting to first erica again accelerated but raoul continued to hang on grasping the rear doorframes erica could still see him in the mirror so she deliberately drove onto the shoulder of the road seeking out potholes which the car hit with jarring force the passenger door on the right sprang open the red dice fell from the dash raoul was now lying on the trunk with his arms spanning the back window each hand holding a doorframe through the missing windows of the rear doors the impact with each pothole made his head and body slam up against the back of the car he was determined to stay with erica he thought shed gone crazy at the turnoff to ahmeds the headlights of the taxi illuminated a mudbrick wall at the side of the road erica screeched to a stop and threw the car into reverse the sudden stop caused raoul to slide up on top of the car he grabbed for a handhold his left hand grasping the doorframe next to ericas face erica accelerated backward the car weaving wildly before ramming the wall her neck snapped back like a whip the rightfront door swung open to its limit almost pulling it from its hinges raoul hung on throwing the shift into first erica forced the car to leap forward the sudden acceleration caused the right front door to close slamming on raouls hand he cried out from the pain and jerked his hand back by reflex at the same moment the car hit the asphalt lip of the road and the jolt tossed raoul into the sand by the roadside almost the instant he hit the ground he regained his feet supporting his throbbing hand he ran after erica noticing that she was pulling up at a low whitewashed mudbrick house he came to a stop as she dashed from the car toward the front door after making sure he knew exactly where he was he turned around and headed back to get yvon erica was afraid raoul was right behind her when she reached ahmeds door it was unlocked and she burst through leaving the door ajar she had to convince ahmed as quickly as possible of the conspiracy so that adequate police protection could be arranged running directly into the living room she was overjoyed to see ahmed still up conversing with a friend im being followed shouted erica ahmed leaped to his feet dumbfounded when he recognized erica quickly she continued we must have help ahmed recovered enough to dash past her and out the open doorway erica turned to ahmeds companion to ask him to summon the police her mouth started to open but then her eyes widened with astonishment and fear closing the door behind him ahmed returned and swept erica into his arms its all clear erica he said its all clear and you are safe let me look at you i dont believe it it is a miracle but erica didnt respond just strained to see over ahmeds shoulder her blood ran cold she was looking at muhammad abdulal now both she and ahmed would be killed she could tell that muhammad was equally astonished to see her but he collected himself and unleashed a torrent of angry arabic at first ahmed ignored muhammads raving he asked erica who had been following her but before she could respond muhammad said something that triggered in ahmed the same suppressed violence erica had seen when he smashed the teacup his eyes darkened and he whirled to face muhammad he spoke in arabic and at first his voice was low and threatening but it gradually rose in pitch until he was shouting erica looked back and forth between the two men expecting muhammad to pull out a weapon to her relief she noticed that instead he was cowering apparently he took orders from ahmed because he sat down when ahmed pointed to a chair then with relief came fear when ahmed turned back to erica she looked into his powerfully deep eyes what was happening ahmed spoke softly erica it is truly a miracle that you have returned ericas mind was beginning to scream that something was wrong what was ahmed saying what did he mean return it must be allahs wish that you and i should be together he continued and i am willing to accept his decision i have been talking with muhammad for many hours about you i was going to come to you to talk with you to plead with you ericas heart pounded her whole sense of reality was disintegrating you knew about my being sealed in the tomb yes it was a difficult decision for me but you had to be stopped i ordered that you would not be hurt i was going to come to the tomb to convince you to join us i love you erica one other time i had to give up the woman i loved my uncle made sure i had no choice but not this time i want you to become part of the familymy family and muhammads family closing her eyes for a moment erica tried to deal with all her conflicting thoughts she could not believe what was happening and what she was hearing marriage family her voice was uncertain you are related to muhammad yes said ahmed he led her slowly to the couch and sat her down muhammad and i are cousins our grandmother is aida raman she is my mothers mother ahmed carefully described the complicated genealogy of their family starting with sarwat and aida raman when he finished speaking erica threw a frightened glance at muhammad erica said ahmed to regain her attention you have been able to do something no one else has been able to do for fifty years no one outside of the family has seen the raman papyrus and anyone with even the slightest idea of its existence has been dealt with thanks to the media the deaths have been ascribed to some mysterious curse its been most convenient and all the secrecy is to guard the tomb asked erica ahmed and muhammad exchanged glances what tomb are you referring to asked ahmed the real seti tomb under tutankhamens said erica muhammad jumped up and treated ahmed to another stream of harsh arabic ahmed listened this time and did not shut him up when muhammad was finished ahmed turned back to erica his voice was still calm you are indeed a marvel erica now you know why the stakes are so high yes we are guarding an unplundered tomb of one of the great egyptian pharaohs with your training you know what that means unbelievable wealth so you can understand that you have put us in an embarrassing position but if you marry me then it is part yours and you can help clear this most spectacular archaeological find erica tried again to think of a way to escape first shed had to get away from yvon now ahmed and raoul was probably going back to yvon there would be a horrible confrontation the world was crazy to stall for time she asked why hasnt the tomb been cleared already the tomb is filled with such riches that removing any required careful planning my grandfather raman knew it would take a generation to set up the machinery to market the treasures from such a tomb and to place the family in positions where they could control moving the priceless objects from egypt during the latter part of his life we only took from the tomb enough to educate the next generation it has only been within the last year that i have become director of the department of antiquities and muhammad chief guard of the necropolis of luxor so its like the rasul family in the nineteenth century said erica there is a superficial resemblance said ahmed we are working on a very sophisticated level the archaeological interests are being carefully considered in fact erica you could be instrumental in that aspect was lord carnarvon one of the people that had to be dealt with asked erica im not certain said ahmed it was a long time ago but i think so muhammad nodded erica continued ahmed how did you learn what you did i mean what made suddenly the lights in the house went out the moon had set and the darkness was absolute like a tomb erica did not move she heard someone pick up the phone then slam it down she guessed yvon and raoul had cut the wires she heard ahmed and muhammad speak swiftly in arabic then her eyes began to accustom themselves to the darkness so she could see vague forms a figure loomed toward her and she shrank back it was ahmed and he grasped her wrist and pulled her to her feet she could see only his eyes and his teeth i ask you again who was following you his voice was an urgent halfwhisper she tried to speak but she stumbled over her words she was terrified she was caught between two horrid forces ahmed yanked on her wrist impatiently finally erica managed to say yvon de margeau ahmed did not let go of ericas wrist while he conversed with muhammad erica caught the gleam from the barrel of a pistol in muhammads hand she had the helpless feeling that events were again beyond her control without warning ahmed pulled erica across the living room and down the long darkened hallway toward the rear of the house she struggled to free her hand unable to see and fearing she was going to trip and fall but ahmeds grip was like steel muhammad ran behind they exited from the house into the courtyard where there was slightly more light they skirted the stable reaching the back gate ahmed and muhammad spoke quickly then ahmed opened the wooden door the alley beyond was deserted and darker than the courtyard because of a double row of date palms muhammad carefully leaned out with his gun poised his eyes searching the shadows satisfied he stepped back making room for ahmed without releasing her wrist ahmed urged erica forward pushing her through the doorway into the alley he followed close behind the first thing erica was aware of was a sudden tightening of ahmeds hold on her wrist then she heard the report of the gun it was the same dull thud shed heard when she faced the crazed evangelos it was the sound of a gun with a silencer ahmed fell sideways back through the doorway pulling erica off her feet on top of him in the meager light she could see hed been shot like evangelos between the eyes bits of brain tissue had spattered on the side of her face erica pushed herself up to a kneeling position in a state of catatonia muhammad lunged past her running across the alley to the safety of the rows of palm trunks erica blankly watched him turn and fire his pistol down the alley then he turned and fled in the opposite direction in a daze erica stood up her eyes riveted to the lifeless ahmed she backed up into the shadows until she hit against the wall of the stable her mouth was open and her breathing was in shallow gasps from the front part of the house she could hear a sharp splintering sound followed by a crash that had to be the front door behind her she could hear sawda nervously stir in his stable she was immobilized directly in front of her and framed by the doorway to the alley erica saw a crouching figure run past almost immediately more shots rang out on the right then behind her she heard the sounds of running in the house and her numbness began to revert to terror she knew that it was she that yvon wanted he was desperate erica heard the back door to the house swing open she held her breath as a silent figure came into view it was raoul she watched as he bent over ahmed then exited into the alley ericas paralysis lasted for another five minutes the sound of the firefight fading in the alley suddenly she pushed away from the wall and stumbled back through the dark house and out the front door she crossed the road and ran down a passageway made of mud bricks she passed through a yard then another causing a few lights to come on in her noisy wake she crashed through debris a chicken coop and splashed through an open sewer in the distance she could hear more shots and a man shouting she ran on until she felt she was going to collapse but it wasnt until she stumbled onto the nile that she allowed herself to rest she tried to think of where to go no one could be trusted since muhammad abdulal was chief of the guards she was even afraid of the police it was at that point that erica remembered the two houses of the ministers guarded by the casual soldiers with effort she heaved herself to her feet and began walking south she remained in the shadows away from the road until she had reached the guarded properties then like an automation she walked out into the lighted street and rounded the front wall of the first house the soldiers were there conversing with each other across the fifty feet that separated the two entranceways they both turned and watched as erica walked directly toward the first he was young dressed in loosefitting brown uniform with highly polished boots a machine pistol hung from a shoulder strap he moved the weapon around and as erica came closer he started to say something with no intention of stopping erica walked right past the surprised youth into the grounds of the house o af andak yelled the soldier coming after erica erica stopped then after mustering her resources she yelled as loud as possible help and kept screaming until a light came on in the darkened house soon a robed figure appeared at the doorbald overweight and shoeless do you speak english asked erica breathlessly of course said the man surprised and slightly irritated do you work for the government yes im deputy assistant defense minister do you have anything to do with antiquities nothing wonderful said erica i have the most incredible story to tell you boston the twa banked gently then made its graceful approach to logan airport with her nose pressed up against the window erica stared out on the vista of boston in the late fall it looked very good to her she felt a true excitement about coming home the wheels of the huge jet touched down sending a slight shudder through the cabin a few passengers clapped happy that the long transatlantic flight was at an end as the plane taxied toward the internationalarrivals building erica marveled at the experiences shed had since her departure she was a different person than when shed left feeling that shed finally made the transition from the academic to the real world and with the invitation by the egyptian government to play a major role in clearing the tomb of seti i she felt confident of a promising career there was a final lurch as the plane came to the gate the sounds of the engines died away and the passengers began opening overhead storage bins erica stayed in her seat and looked out at the crisp new england clouds she remembered lieutenant iskanders immaculate white uniform when hed come to see her off from cairo he had told her the final result of that fateful night in luxor ahmed khazzan had died from gunshot woundsa fact shed known from the moment hed been hit muhammad abdulal was still in a coma yvon de margeau had somehow received clearance and had flown out of the country becoming a persona non grata in egypt and stephanos markoulis had just disappeared it all seemed so unreal now that she was in boston the experience saddened her especially about ahmed the experience also made her question her ability to judge people especially because of yvon even after what had happened he had had the nerve to telephone her from paris when shed returned to cairo offering her large sums to provide inside information about the tomb of seti i she shook her head in dismay as she gathered her carryon belongings erica allowed herself to be carried along by the crowd she passed through the immigration control quickly and retrieved her baggage then she pushed out into the waiting area they saw each other at the same moment richard ran up and hugged her as erica dropped her bags forcing the people behind her to step over them they held each other without speaking their emotions balanced finally erica pulled away you were right richard i was over my head from the start im lucky to be alive richards eyes filled with tears something erica had never seen no erica we were both right and both wrong it just means there is a lot we need to learn about each other and believe me im willing erica smiled she wasnt sure what it meant but it made her feel good oh by the way said richard picking up her bags theres a man here from houston who wants to see you really asked erica yeah he apparently knew dr lowery who gave him my phone number hes over there richard pointed my god said erica its jeffrey john rice as if on cue jeffrey rice came over taking off his stetson with a flourish sorry to interrupt you two at this time but miss baron heres your check for finding that seti statue but i dont understand said erica the egyptian government now owns the statue you cannot buy it thats just the point it makes mine the only one outside of egypt because of you its worth tons more than it was before houston is mighty pleased erica looked down at the tenthousanddollar check and burst out laughing richard who did not really understand what was happening saw her amazed expression and began laughing too rice shrugged and still holding the check led them out into the bright boston sun
