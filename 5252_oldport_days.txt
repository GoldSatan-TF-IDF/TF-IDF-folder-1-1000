madam delias expectations sunshine and petrarch a shadow footpaths oldport days oldport in winter our august life rushes by in oldport as if we were all shot from the mouth of a cannon and were endeavoring to exchange visitingcards on the way but in september when the great hotels are closed and the bronze dogs that guarded the portals of the ocean house are collected sadly in the music pavilion nose to nose when the last fourinhand has departed and a man may drive a solitary horse on the avenue without a pangthen we know that the season is over winter is yet several months awaymonths of the most delicious autumn weather that the american climate holds but to the human bird of passage all that is not summer is winter and those who seek oldport most eagerly for two months are often those who regard it as uninhabitable for the other ten the persian poet saadi says that in a certain region of armenia where he travelled people never died the natural death but once a year they met on a certain plain and occupied themselves with recreation in the midst of which individuals of every rank and age would suddenly stop make a reverence to the west and setting out at full speed toward that part of the desert be seen no more it is quite in this fashion that guests disappear from oldport when the season ends they also are apt to go toward the west but by steamboat it is pathetic on occasion of each annual bereavement to observe the wonted looks and language of despair among those who linger behind and it needs some fortitude to think of spending the winter near such a wharf of sighs but we console ourselves each season brings its own attractions in summer one may relish what is new in oldport as the liveries the incomes the manners there is often a delicious freshness about these exhibitions it is a pleasure to see some opulent citizen in his first kid gloves his newborn splendor stands in such brilliant relief against the confirmed respectability of the old stone mill the only thing on the atlantic shore which has had time to forget its birthday but in winter the old mill gives the tone to the society around it we then bethink ourselves of the crown upon our trinity church steeple and resolve that the courtesies of a bygone age shall yet linger here is there any other place in america where gentlemen still take off their hats to one another on the public promenade the hat is here what it still is in southern europethe lineal successor of the sword as the mark of a gentleman it is noticed that in going from oldport to new york or boston one is liable to be betrayed by an overflourish of the hat as is an arkansas man by a display of the bowieknife winter also imparts to these spacious estates a dignity that is sometimes wanting in summer i like to stroll over them during this epoch of desertion just as once when i happened to hold the keys of a church it seemed pleasant to sit on a weekday among its empty pews the silent walls appeared to hold the pure essence of the prayers of a generation while the routine and the ennui had vanished all away one may here do the same with fashion as there with devotion extracting its finer flavors if such there be unalloyed by vulgarity or sin in the winter i can fancy these fine houses tenanted by a true nobility all the sons are brave and all the daughters virtuous these balconies have heard the sighs of passion without selfishness those cedarn alleys have admitted only vows that were never broken if the occupant of the house be unknown even by name so much the better and from homes more familiar what lovely childish faces seem still to gaze from the doorways what graceful absences to borrow a certain poets phrase are haunting those windows there is a sense of winter quiet that makes a stranger soon feel at home in oldport while the prospective stir of next summer precludes all feeling of stagnation commonly in quiet places one suffers from the knowledge that everybody would prefer to be unquiet but nobody has any such longing here doubtless there are aged persons who deplore the good old times when the oldportmailbags were larger than those arriving at new york but if it were so now what memories would there be to talk about if you wish for syrian peace immortal leisurea place where no grown person ever walks rapidly along the street and where few care enough for rain to open an umbrella or walk fastercome here my abode is on a broad sunny street with a few great elms overhead and with large old houses and grassbanks opposite there is so little snow that the outlook in the depth of winter is often merely that of a paler and leafless summer and a soft springlike sky almost always spreads above past the window streams an endless sunny panorama for the house fronts the chief thoroughfare between country and townrelics of summer equipages in faded grandeur great fragrant haycarts vast moving mounds of golden straw loads of crimson onions heaps of pale green cabbages piles of gray treeprunings looking as if the patrician trees were sending their superfluous wealth of branches to enrich the impoverished orchards of the poor farm wagons of seaweed just from the beach with bright moist hues and dripping with seawater and seamemories each weed an argosy bearing its own wild histories at this season the very houses move and roll slowly by looking round for more lucrative quarters next season never have i seen real estate made so transportable as in oldport the purchaser after finishing and furnishing to his fancy puts his name on the door and on the fence a large white placard inscribed for sale then his household arrangements are complete and he can sit down to enjoy himself by a sideglance from our window one may look down an ancient street which in some early epoch of the worlds freshness received the name of spring street a certain lively lady addicted to daring scriptural interpretations thinks that there is some mistake in the current versions of genesis and that it was spring street which was created in the beginning and the heavens and earth at some subsequent period there are houses in spring street and there is a confectioners shop but it is not often that a sound comes across its rugged pavements save perchance in summer the drone of an ancient handorgan such as might have been devised by adam to console his eve when paradise was lost yet of late the desecrating hammer and the earpiercing saw have entered that haunt of ancient peace may it be long ere any such invasion reaches those strange little wharves in the lower town full of small black gambrelroofed houses with projecting eaves that might almost serve for piazzas it is possible for an unpainted wooden building to assume in this climate a more timeworn aspect than that of any stone and on these wharves everything is so old and yet so stunted you might fancy that the houses had been sent down there to play during their childhood and that nobody had ever remembered to fetch them back the ancient aspect of things around us joined with the softening influences of the gulf stream imparts an air of chronic languor to the special types of society which here prevail in winteras for instance people of leisure tradespeople living on their summers gains and finally fishermen those who pursue this last laborious calling are always lazy to the eye for they are on shore only in lazy moments they work by night or at early dawn and by day they perhaps lie about on the rocks or sit upon one heel beside a fishhouse door i knew a missionary who resigned his post at the isles of shoals because it was impossible to keep the sunday worshippers from lying at full length on the seats our boatmen have the same habit and there is a certain dreaminess about them in whatever posture indeed they remind one quite closely of the german boatman in uhland who carried his reveries so far as to accept three fees from one passenger but the truth is that in oldport we all incline to the attitude of repose now and then a man comes here from farther east with the new england fever in his blood and with a pestilent desire to do something you hear of him presently proposing that the town hall should be repainted opposition would require too much effort and the thing is done but the gulf stream soon takes its revenge on the intruder and gradually repaints him also with its own soft and mellow tints in a few years he would no more bestir himself to fight for a change than to fight against it it makes us smile a little therefore to observe that universal delusion among the summer visitors that we spend all winter in active preparations for next season not so we all devote it solely to meditations on the season past i observe that nobody in oldport ever believes in any coming summer perhaps the tide is turned we think and people will go somewhere else you do not find us altering our houses in december or building out new piazzas even in march we wait till the people have actually come to occupy them the preparation for visitors is made after the visitors have arrived this may not be the way in which things are done in what are called smart business places but it is our way in oldport it is another delusion to suppose that we are bored by this long epoch of inactivity not at all we enjoy it if you enter a shop in winter you will find everybody rejoiced to see youas a friend but if it turns out that you have come as a customer people will look a little disappointed it is rather inconsiderate of you to make such demands out of season winter is not exactly the time for that sort of thing it seems rather to violate the conditions of the truce could you not postpone the affair till next july every country has its customs i observe that in some places new york for instance the shopkeepers seem rather to enjoy a fieldday when the sun and the customers are out in oldport on the contrary mens spirits droop at such times and they go through their business sadly they force themselves to it during the summer perhapsfor one must make some sacrificesbut in winter it is inappropriate as strawberries and cream the same spirit of repose pervades the streets nobody ever looks in a hurry or as if an hours delay would affect the thing in hand the nearest approach to a mob is when some stranger thinking himself late for the train as if the thing were possible is tempted to run a few steps along the sidewalk on such an occasion i have seen doors open and heads thrust out but ordinarily even the physicians drive slowly as if they wished to disguise their profession or to soothe the nerves of some patient who may begazing from a window yet they are not to be censured since death their antagonist here drives slowly too the number of the aged among us is surprising and explains some phenomena otherwise strange you will notice for instance that there are no posts before the houses in oldport to which horses may be tied fashionable visitors might infer that every horse is supposed to be attended by a groom yet the tradition is that there were once as many posts here as elsewhere but that they were removed to get rid of the multitude of old men who leaned all day against them it obstructed the passing and these aged citizens while permitted to linger at their posts were gossiping about men still older in earthly or heavenly habitations and the sensation of longevity went on accumulating indefinitely in their talk their very disputes had a flavor of antiquity and involved the reputation of female relatives to the third or fourth generation an old fisherman testified in our police court the other day in narrating the progress of a street quarrel then i called him polly garterthats his grandmother and he called me susy reynoldsthats my aunt thats dead and gone in towns like this from which the young men mostly migrate the work of life devolves upon the venerable and the very young when i first came to oldport it appeared to me that every institution was conducted by a boy and his grandfather this seemed the case for instance with the bank that consented to assume the slender responsibility of my deposits it was further to be observed that if the elder official was absent for a day the boy carried on the proceedings unaided while if the boy also wished to amuse himself elsewhere a worthy neighbor from across the way came in to fill the places of both seeing this i retained my small hold upon the concern with fresh tenacity for who knew but some day when the directors also had gone on a picnic the senior depositor might take his turn at the helm it may savor of selfconfidence but it has always seemed to me that with one days control of a bank even in these degenerate times something might be done which would quite astonish the stockholders longer acquaintance has however revealed the fact that these oldport institutions stand out as models of strict discipline beside their suburban compeers a friend of mine declares that he went lately into a country bank nearby and found no one on duty being of opinion that there should always be someone behind the counter of a bank he went there himself wishing to be informed as to the resources of his establishment he explored desks and vaults found a good deal of paper of different kinds and some rich veins of copper but no cashier going to the door again in some anxiety he encountered a casual schoolboy who kindly told him that he did not know where the financial officer might be at the precise moment of inquiry but that half an hour before he was on the wharf fishing death comes to the aged at last however even in oldport we have lately lost for instance that patient old postman serenest among our human antiquities whose deliberate tread might have imparted a tone of repose to broadway could any imagination have transferred him thither through him the correspondence of other days came softened of all immediate solicitude ere it reached you friends had died or recovered debtors had repented creditors grown kind or your children had paid your debts perils had passed hopes were chastened and the most eager expectant took calmly the missive from that tranquillizing hand meeting his friends and clients with a step so slow that it did not even stop rapidly he like tennysons mariana slowly from his bosom drew old letters but a summons came at last not to be postponed even by him one day he delivered his mail as usual with no undue precipitation on the next the blameless soul was himself taken and forwarded on some celestial route irreparable would have seemed his loss did there not still linger among us certain types of human antiquity that might seem to disprove the fabled youth of america one veteran i daily meet of uncertain age perhaps but with at least that air of brevet antiquity which long years of unruffled indolence can give he looks as if he had spent at least half a lifetime on the sunny slope of some beach and the other half in leaning upon his elbows at the window of some sailor boardinghouse he is hale and broad with a head sunk between two strong shoulders his beard falls like snow upon his breast longer and longer each year while his slumberous thoughts seem to move slowly enough to watch it as it grows i always fancy that these meditations have drifted far astern of the times but are following after in patient hopelessness as a dog swims behind a boat what knows he of the presidents message he has just overtaken some remarkable catch of mackerel in the year thirtyeight his hands lie buried fathomdeep in his pockets as if part of his brain lay there to be rummaged and he sucks at his old pipe as if his head like other venerable hulks must be smoked out at intervals his walk is that of a sloth one foot dragging heavily behind the other i meet him as i go to the postoffice and on returning twenty minutes later i pass him again a little farther advanced all the children accost him and i have seen him stopno great retardation indeedto fondle in his arms a puppy or a kitten yet he is liable to excitement in his way for once in some high debate wherein he assisted as listener when one old man on a wharf was doubting the assertion of another old man about a certain equinoctial gale i saw my friend draw his right hand slowly and painfully from his pocket and let it fall by his side it was really one of the most emphatic gesticulations i ever saw and tended obviously to quell the rising discord it was as if the herald at a tournament had dropped his truncheon and the fray must end womens faces are apt to take from old age a finer touch than those of men and poverty does not interfere with this where there is no actual exposure to the elements from the windows of these old houses there often look forth delicate faded countenances to which belongs an air of unmistakable refinement nowhere in america i fancy does one see such counterparts of the reduced gentlewoman of englandas described for instance in cranfordquiet maiden ladies of seventy with perhaps a tradition of beauty and bellehood and still wearing always a bit of blue ribbon on their once golden curlsthis headdress being stillcarefully arranged each day by some handmaiden of sixty so long a housemate as to seem a sister though some faint suggestion of wages and subordination may be still preserved among these ladies as in cranford there is a dignified reticence in respect to moneymatters and a courteous blindness to the small economies practised by each other it is not held good breeding when they meet in a shop of a morning for one to seem to notice what another buys these ancient ladies have coats of arms upon their walls hereditary damasks among their scanty wardrobes store of domestic traditions in their brains and a whole court guide of highsounding names at their fingers ends they can tell you of the supposed sister of an english queen who married an american officer and dwelt in oldport of the scotch lady janet who eloped with her tutor and here lived in poverty paying her washerwoman with costly lace from her trunks of the oldport dame who escaped from france at the opening of the revolution was captured by pirates on her voyage to america then retaken by a privateer and carried into boston where she took refuge in john hancocks house they can describe to you the malbone gardens and as the night wanes and the embers fade can give the tale of the phantom of rough point gliding farther and farther into the past they revert to the brilliant historic period of oldport the successive english and french occupations during our revolution and show you gallant inscriptions in honor of their grandmothers written on the windowpanes by the diamond rings of the foreign officers the newer strata of oldport society are formed chiefly by importation and have the one advantage of a variety of origin which puts provincialism out of the question the mild winter climate and the supposed cheapness of living draw scattered families from the various atlantic cities and coming from such different sources these visitors leave some exclusiveness behind the boast of heraldry the pomp of power are doubtless good things to have in ones house but are cumbrous to travel with meeting here on central ground partial aristocracies tend to neutralize each other a boston family comes bristling with genealogies and making the most of its little all of two centuries another arrives from philadelphia equally fortified in local heraldries unknown in boston a third from new york brings a briefer pedigree but more gilded their claims are incompatible but there is no common standard and so neither can have precedence since no human memory can retain the greatgrandmothers of three cities we are practically as well off as if we had no greatgrandmothers at all but in oldport as elsewhere the spice of conversation is apt to be in inverse ratio to family tree and incometax and one can hear better repartees among the boatbuilders shops on long wharf than among those who have made the grand tour all the world over one is occasionally reminded of the french officers verdict on the garrison town where he was quartered that the good society was no better than the good society anywhere else but the bad society was capital i like for instance to watch the shoals of fishermen that throng our streets in the early spring inappropriate as porpoises on land or as scotts pirates in peaceful kirkwall unwieldy bearded creatures in oilskin suitsmen who have never before seen a basketwagon or a liveried groom and whose first comments on the daintinesses of fashion are far more racy than anything which fashion can say for itself the life of our own fishermen and pilots remains active in its way all winter and coasting vessels come and go in the open harbor every day the only schooner that is not so employed is to my eye more attractive than any of them it is our sole winter guest this year of all the graceful flotilla of yachts that helped to make our summer moonlights so charming while europe seems in such ecstasy over the ocean yachtrace there lies at anchor stripped and dismantled a vessel which was excluded from the match it is said simply because neither of the three competitors would have had a chance against her i like to look across the harbor at the graceful proportions of this uncrowned victor in the race she never ran and to my eye her laurels are the most attractive she seems a fit emblem of the genius that waits while talent merely wins let me know said that fine but unappreciated thinker brownlee brownlet me know what chances a man has passed in contempt not what he has made but what he has refused to make reserving himself for higher ends all outdoor work in winter has a cheerful look from the triumph of caloric it implies but i know none in which man seems to revert more to the lower modes of being than in searching for seaclams one may sometimes observe a dozen men employed in this way on one of our beaches while the cold wind blows keenly off shore and the spray drifts back like snow over the green and sluggish surge the men pace in and out with the wave going steadily to and fro like a pendulum ankledeep in the chilly brine their steps quickened by hope or slackening with despair where the maidens and children sport and shout in summer there in winter these heavy figures succeed to them the lovely crest of the emerald billow is but a chariot for clams and is valueless if it comes in empty really the position of the clam is the more dignified since he moves only with the wave and the immortal being in fishboots wades for him the harbor and the beach are thus occupied in winter but one may walk for many a mile along the cliffs and see nothing human but a few gardeners spreading green and white seaweed as manure upon the lawns the mercury rarely drops to zero here and there is little snow but a newfallen drift has just the same virgin beauty as farther inland and when one suddenly comes in view of the sea beyond it there is a sensation of summer softness the water is not then deep blue but pale with opaline reflections vessels in the far horizon have the same delicate tint as if woven of the same liquid material a single wave lifts itself languidly above a reefa whitebreasted loon floats near the shorethe sea breaks in long indolent curvesthe distant islands swim in a vague mirage along the cliffs hang great organpipes of ice distilling showers of drops that glitter in the noonday sun while the barer rocks send up a perpetual steam giving to the eye a sense of warmth and suggesting the comforts of fire beneath the low tide reveals long stretches of goldenbrown seaweed caressed by the lapping wave high winds bring a different scene sometimes i fancy that in winter with less visible life upon the surface of the water andless of unseen animal life below it there is yet more that seems like vital force in the individual particles of waves each separate drop appears more charged with desperate and determined life the lines of surf run into each other more brokenly and with less steady roll the low sun too lends a weird and jagged shadow to gallop in before the crest of each advancing wave and sometimes there is a second crest on the shoulders of the first as if there were more than could be contained in a single curve greens and purples are called forth to replace the prevailing blue far out at sea great separate mounds of water rear themselves as if to overlook the tossing plain sometimes these move onward and subside with their green hue still unbroken and again they curve into detached hillocks of foam white multitudinous side by side not ridged but moving on like a mob of white horses neck overarching neck breast crowded against breast across those tumultuous waves i like to watch after sunset the revolving light there is something about it so delicate and human it seems to bud or bubble out of the low dark horizon a moment and it is not and then another moment and it is with one throb the tremulous light is born with another throb it has reached its full size and looks at you coy and defiant and almost in that instant it is utterly gone you cannot conceive yourself to be watching something which merely turns on an axis but it seems suddenly to expand a flower of light or to close as if soft petals of darkness clasped it in during its moments of absence the eye cannot quite keep the memory of its precise position and it often appears a hairbreadth to the right or left of the expected spot this enhances the elfish and fantastic look and so the pretty game goes on with flickering surprises every night and all night long but the illusion of the seasons is just as coquettish and when next summer comes to us with its blossoms and its joys it will dawn as softly out of the darkness and as softly give place to winter once moreoldport wharves everyone who comes to a wharf feels an impulse to follow it down and look from the end there is a fascination about it it is the point of contact between land and sea a bridge evades the water and unites land with land as if there were no obstacle but a wharf seeks the water and grasps it with a solid hand it is the sign of a lasting friendship once extended there it remains the water embraces it takes it into its tumultuous bosom at high tide leaves it in peace at ebb rushes back to it eagerly again plays with it in sunshine surges round it in storm almost crushing the massive thing but the pledge once given is never withdrawn buildings may rise and fall but a solid wharf is almost indestructible even if it seems destroyed its materials are all there this shore might be swept away these piers be submerged or dashed asunder still every brick and stone would remain half the wharves of oldport were ruined in the great storm of yet not one of them has stirred from the place where it lay its foundations have only spread more widely and firmly they are a part of the very pavement of the harbor submarine mountain ranges on one of which yonder schooner now lies aground thus the wild ocean only punished itself and has been embarrassed for half a century like many another mad profligate by the wrecks of what it ruined yet the surges are wont to deal very tenderly with these wharves in summer the sea decks them with floating weeds and studs them with an armor of shells in the winter it surrounds them with a smoother mail of ice and the detached piles stand white and gleaming like the outdoor palace of a russian queen how softly and eagerly this coming tide swirls round them all day the fishes haunt their shadows all night the phosphorescent water glimmers by them and washes with long refluent waves along their sides decking their blackness with a spray of stars water seems the natural outlet and discharge for every landscape and when we have followed down this artificial promontory a wharf and have seen the waves on three sides of us we have taken the first step toward circumnavigating the globe this is our last terra firma one step farther and there is no possible foothold but a deck which tilts and totters beneath our feet a wharf therefore is properly neutral ground for all it is a silent hospitality understood by all nations it is in some sort a thing of universal ownership having once built it you must grant its use to everyone it is no trespass to land upon any mans wharf the sea like other beautiful savage creatures derives most of its charm from its reserves of untamed power when a wild animal is subdued to abjectness all its interest is gone the ocean is never thus humiliated so slight an advance of its waves would overwhelm us if only the restraining power once should fail and the water keep on rising even here in these safe haunts of commerce we deal with the same salt tide which i myself have seen ascend above these piers and which within half a century drowned a whole family in their home upon our long wharf it is still the same ungoverned ocean which twice in every twentyfour hours reasserts its right of way and stops only where it will at monckton on the bay of fundy the wharves are built forty feet high and at ebbtide you may look down on the schooners lying aground upon the mud below in six hours they will be floating at your side but the motions of the tide are as resistless whether its rise be six feet or forty as in the lazy stretching of the caged lions paw you can see all the terrors of his spring our principal wharf the oldest in the town has lately been doubled in size and quite transformed in shape by an importation of broad acres from the country it is now what is called made landa manufacture which has grown so easy that i daily expect to see some enterprising contractor set up endwise a bar of railroad iron and construct a new planet at its summit which shall presently go spinning off into space and be called an asteroid there are some people whom would it be pleasant to colonize in that way but meanwhile the unchanged southern side of the pier seems pleasanter with its boatbuilders shops all facing sunwarda cheerful haunt upon a winters day on the early maps this wharf appears as queenhithe a name more graceful than its present cognomen hithe or hythe signifies a small harbor and is the final syllable of many english names as of lambeth hythe is also one of those cinqueports of which the duke of wellington was warden this wharf was probably still familiarly called queenhithe in when washington and rochambeau walked its length bareheaded between the ranks of french soldiers and it doubtless bore that name when dean berkeley arrived in and the rev mr honyman and all his flock closed hastily their prayerbooks and hastened to the landing to receive their guest but it had lost this name ere the days yet remembered by aged men when the long wharf became a market beeves were then driven thither and tethered while each hungry applicant marked with a piece of chalk upon the creatures side the desired cut when a sufficient portion had been thus secured the sentence of death was issued fancy the chalk a live coal or the beast endowed with human consciousness and no indian or inquisitorial tortures could have been more fearful it is like visiting the houses at pompeii to enter the strange little black warehouses which cover some of our smaller wharves they are so old and so small it seems as if some race of pygmies must have built them though they are two or three stories high with steep gambrelroofs and heavily timbered their rooms are yet so low that a man six feet high can hardly stand upright beneath the great crossbeams there is a row of these structures for instance described on a map of as the old buildings on lopez wharf and to these another century has probably brought very little change lopez was a portuguese jew who came to this place with several hundred others after the lisbon earthquake of he is said to have owned eighty squarerigged vessels in this port from which not one such craft now sails his little countingroom is in the second storey of the building its walltimbers are of oak and are still sound the few remaining planks are grained to resemble rosewood and mahogany the fragments of wallpaper are ofenglish make in the crossbeam just above your head are the pigeonholesonce devoted to different vessels whose names are still recorded above them on faded papership cleopatra brig juno and the like many of these vessels measured less than two hundred tons and it seems as if their owner had built his ships to match the size of his countingroom a sterner tradition clings around an old building on a remoter wharf for men have but lately died who had seen slaves pass within its doors for confinement the wharf in those days appertained to a distillery an establishment then constantly connected with the slavetrade rum being sent to africa and human beings brought back occasionally a cargo was landed here instead of being sent to the west indies or to south carolina and this building was fitted up for their temporary quarters it is but some twentyfive feet square and must be less than thirty feet in height yet it is divided into three stories of which the lowest was used for other purposes and the two upper were reserved for slaves there are still to be seen the barred partitions and latticed door making half the second floor into a sort of cage while the agents room appears to have occupied the other half a similar latticed doorjust such as i have seen in southern slavepenssecures the foot of the upper stairway the whole small attic constitutes a single room with a couple of windows and two additional breathingholes two feet square opening on the yard it makes one sick to think of the poor creatures who may once have gripped those bars with their hands or have glared with eager eyes between them and it makes me recall with delight the day when i once wrenched away the stocks and chains from the floor of a pen like this on the st marys river in florida it is almost forty years since this distillery became a mill and sixty since the slavetrade was abolished the date is scrawled upon the door of the cagethe very year when the port of charleston was reopened for slaves just before the traffic ceased a few years more and such horrors will seem as remote a memory in south carolina thank god as in rhode island other wharves are occupied by mastyards places that seem like playrooms for grown men crammed fuller than any old garret with those odds and ends in which the youthful soul delights there are planks and spars and timber broken rudders rusty anchors coils of rope bales of sailcloth heaps of blocks piles of chaincable great iron tarkettles like antique helmets strange machines for steaming planks inexplicable little chimneys engines that seem like dwarflocomotives windlasses that apparently turn nothing and incipient canals that lead nowhere for in these yards there seems no particular difference between land and water the tide comes and goes anywhere and nobody minds it boats are drawn up among burdocks and ambrosia and the platform on which you stand suddenly proves to be something afloat vessels are hauled upon the ways each side of the wharf their poor ribs pitiably unclothed ready for a cumbrous mantuamaking of oak and iron on one side within a floating boom lies a fleet of masts and unhewn logs tethered uneasily like a herd of captive seamonsters rocking in the ripples a vast shed that has doubtless looked ready to fall for these dozen years spreads over half the entrance to the wharf and is filled with spars kneetimber and planks of fragrant wood its uprights are festooned with all manner of great hawsers and smaller ropes and its dim loft is piled with empty casks and idle sails the sun always seems to shine in a shipyard there are apt to be more loungers than laborers and this gives a pleasant air of repose the neighboring water softens all harsher sounds the foot treads upon an elastic carpet of embedded chips and pleasant resinous odors are in the air then there are wharves quite abandoned by commerce and given over to small tenements filled with families so abundant that they might dispel the fears of those alarmists who suspect that children are ceasing to be born shrill voices resound thereamerican or irish as the case may bethrough the summer noontides and the domestic clothesline forever stretches across the paths where imported slaves once trod or rich merchandise lay piled some of these abodes are nestled in the corners of houses once stately with large windows and carven doorways others occupy separate buildings almost always of black unpainted wood sometimes with the long sloping roof of massachusetts oftener with the quaint gambrel of rhode island from the busiest point of our main street i can show you a single cottage with low gables projecting eaves and sheltering sweetbrier that seems as if it must have strayed hither a century or two ago out of some english lane some of the more secluded wharves appear wholly deserted by men and women and are tenanted alone by rats and boys two amphibious races either can swim anywhere or scramble and penetrate everywhere the boys launch some abandoned skiff and with an oar for a sail and another for a rudder pass from wharf to wharf nor would it be surprising if the brighteyed rats were to take similar passage on a shingle yet after all the human juveniles are the more sagacious brood it is strange that people should go to europe and seek the society of potentates less imposing when home can endow them with the occasional privilege of a nod from an american boy in these sequestered haunts i frequently meet some urchin three feet high who carries with him an air of consummate worldly experience that completely overpowers me and i seem to shrink to the dimensions of tom thumb before his calm and terrible glance all disguises fail you may put on a bold and careless air and affect to overlook him as you pass but it is like assuming to ignore the existence of the pope of rome or of the london times he knows better grown men are never very formidable they are shy and shamefaced themselves usually preoccupied and not very observing if they see a man loitering about without visible aim they class him as a mild imbecile and let him go but boys are natures detectives and one does not so easily evade their scrutinizing eyes i know full well that while i study their ways they are noting mine through a clearer lens and are probably taking my measure far better than i take theirs one instinctively shrinks from making a sketch or memorandum while they are by and if caught in the act one fondly hopes to pass for some harmless speculator in real estate whose pencillings may be only a matter of habit like those casual sums in compound interest which are usually to be found scrawled on the margins of the daily papers in boston readingrooms our wharves are almost all connected by intricate byways among the buildings and one almost wishes to be a pirate or a smuggler for the pleasure of eluding the officers of justice through such seductive paths it is perhaps to counteract this perilous fascination that our new policeoffice has been established on a wharf you will see its brick tower rising not ungracefully as youenter the inner harbor it looks the better for being almost windowless though beauty was not the aim of the omission a curious stranger is said to have asked one of our city fathers the reason of this peculiarity no use in windows said the experienced official sadly the boys would only break em it seems very unjust to assert that there is no subordination in our american society the citizens show deference to the police and the police to the boys the ancient aspect of these wharves extends itself sometimes to the vessels which lie moored beside them at yonder pier for instance has lain for thirteen years a decaying bark which was suspected of being engaged in the slavetrade she was run ashore and abandoned on block island in the winter of and was afterwards brought in here her purchaser was offered eight thousand dollars for his bargain but refused it and here the vessel has remained paying annual wharf dues and charges till she is worthless she lies chained at the wharf and the tide rises and falls within her thus furnishing a convenient bathinghouse for the children who also find a perpetual gymnasium in the broken shrouds that dangle from her masts turner when he painted his slaveship could have asked no better model there is no name upon the stern and it exhibits merely a carved eagle with the wings clipped and the head knocked off only the lower masts remain which are of a dismal black as are the tops and mizzen crosstrees within the bulwarks on each side stand rows of black blocks to which the shrouds were once attached these blocks are called by sailors deadeyes and each stands in weird mockery with its three ominous holes like so many human skulls before some palace in dahomey other blocks like these swing more ominously yet at the ends of the shrouds that still hang suspended waving and creaking and jostling in the wind each year the ropes decay and soon the repulsive pendants will be gone not so with the iron belayingpins a few of which still stand around the mast so rusted into the iron fiferail that even the persevering industry of the children cannot wrench them out it seems as if some guilty stain must cling to their sides and hold them in by one of those fitnesses which fortune often adjusts but which seem incredible in art the wharf is now used on one side for the storage of slate and the hulk is approached through an avenue of gravestones i never find myself in that neighborhood but my steps instinctively seek that condemned vessel whether by day when she makes a dark foreground for the white yachts and the summer waves or by night when the storm breaks over her desolate deck if we follow northward from queenhithe along the shore we pass into a region where the ancient wharves of commerce ruined in have never been rebuilt and only slender pathways for pleasure voyagers now stretch above the submerged foundations once the court end of the town then its commercial centre it is now divided between the tenements of fishermen and the summer homes of city households still the great old houses remain with mahogany stairways carved wainscoting and painted tiles the sea has encroached upon their gardens and only boats like mine approach where english dukes and french courtiers once landed at the head of yonder private wharf in that spacious and still cheerful abode dwelt the beautiful robinson sisterhoodthe three quaker belles of revolutionary days the memory of whose loves might lend romance to this neighborhood forever one of these maidens was asked in marriage by a captain in the english army and was banished by her family to the narragansett shore under a flag of truce to avoid him her lover was afterward killed by a cannonball in his tent and she died unwedded another was sought by two aspirants who came in the same ship to woo her the one from philadelphia the other from new york she refused them both and they sailed southward together but the wind proving adverse they returned and one lingered till he won her hand still another lover was forced into a vessel by his friends to tear him from the enchanted neighborhood while sailing past the house he suddenly threw himself into the waterit must have been about where the end of the wharf now reststhat he might be rescued and carried a passive leander into yonder door the house was first the headquarters of the english commander then of the french and the sentinels of de noailles once trod where now croquetballs form the heaviest ordnance peaceful and untitled guests now throng in summer where st vincents and northumberlands once rustled and glittered and there is nothing to recall those brilliant days except the painted tiles on the chimney where there is a choice society of coquettes and beaux priests and conjurers beggars and dancers and every wig and hoop dates back to the days of queen anne sometimes when i stand upon this pier by night and look across the calm black water so still perhaps that the starry reflections seem to drop through it in prolonged javelins of light instead of resting on the surface and the opposite lighthouse spreads its cloth of gold across the bayi can imagine that i discern the french and english vessels just weighing anchor i see de lauzun and de noailles embarking and catch the last sheen upon their lace the last glitter of their swords it vanishes and i see only the lighthouse gleam and the dark masts of a sunken ship across the neighboring island those motionless spars have after all a nearer interest and as i saw them sink i will tell their tale that vessel came in here one day last august a stately fullsailed bark nor was it known till she had anchored that she was a mass of imprisoned fire below she was the trajan from rockland bound to new orleans with a cargo of lime which took fire in a gale of wind being wet with seawater as the vessel rolled the captain and crew retreated to the deck and made the hatches fast leaving even their clothing and provisions below they remained on deck after reaching this harbor till the planks grew too hot beneath their feet and the water came boiling from the pumps then the vessel was towed into a depth of five fathoms to be scuttled and sunk i watched her go down early impressions from peter parley had portrayed the sinking of a vessel as a frightful plunge endangering all around like a maelstrom the actual process was merely a subsidence so calm and gentle that a child might have stood upon the deck till it sank beneath him and then might have floated away instead of a convulsion it was something stately and very pathetic to the imagination the bark remained almost level the bows a little higher than the stern and her breath appeared to be surrendered in a series of pulsations as if every gasp of the lungs admitted more of the suffocating wave after each long heave she went visibly a few inches deeper and then paused the face of the benign emperor her namesake was on the stern first sank the carven beard then the rather mutilated nose then the white and staring eyes that gazed blankly over the engulfing waves the figurehead was trajan again at full length with the costume of an indian hunter and the face of a roman sage thisimage lingered longer and then vanished like victor hugos gilliatt by cruel gradations meanwhile the gilded name upon the taffrail had slowly disappeared also but even when the ripples began to meet across her deck still her descent was calm as the water gained the hidden fire was extinguished and the smoke at first densely rising grew rapidly less yet when it had stopped altogether and all but the top of the cabin had disappeared there came a new ebullition of steam like a hot spring throwing itself several feet in air and then ceasing as the vessel went down several beams and planks came springing endwise up the hatchway like liberated men but nothing had a stranger look to me than some great black casks which had been left on deck these as the water floated them seemed to stir and wake and to become gifted with life and then got into motion and wallowed heavily about like hippopotami or any unwieldy and bewildered beasts at last the most enterprising of them slid somehow to the bulwark and after several clumsy efforts shouldered itself over then others bounced out eagerly following as sheep leap a wall and then they all went bobbing away over the dancing waves for the wind blew fresh meanwhile and there were some twenty sailboats lyingto with reefed sails by the wreck like so many seabirds and when the loose stuff began to be washed from the deck they all took wing at once to save whatever could be picked upsince at such times as at a conflagration on land every little thing seems to assume a valueand at last one young fellow steered boldly up to the sinking ship itself sprang upon the vanishing taffrail for one instant as if resolved to be the last on board and then pushed off again i never saw anything seem so extinguished out of the universe as that great vessel which had towered so colossal above my little boat it was impossible to imagine that she was all there yet beneath the foaming and indifferent waves no effort has yet been made to raise her and a dead eagle seems to have more in common with the living bird than has now this submerged and decaying hulk with the white and winged creature that came sailing into our harbor on that summer day it shows what conversational resources are always at hand in a seaport town that the boatman with whom i first happened to visit this burning vessel had been thrice at sea on ships similarly destroyed and could give all the particulars of their fate i know no class of uneducated men whose talk is so apt to be worth hearing as that of sailors even apart from their personal adventures and their glimpses at foreign lands they have made observations of nature which are far more careful and minute than those of farmers because the very lives of sailors are always at risk their voyages have also made them sociable and fond of talk while the pursuits of most men tend to make them silent and their constant changes of scene though not touching them very deeply have really given a certain enlargement to their minds a quiet demeanor in a seaport town proves nothing the most inconspicuous man may have the most thrilling career to look back upon with what a superb familiarity do these men treat this habitable globe cape horn and the cape of good hope are in their phrase but the west cape and the east cape merely two familiar portals of their wonted home with what undisguised contempt they speak of the enthusiasm displayed over the ocean yachtrace that any man should boast of crossing the atlantic in a schooner of two hundred tons in presence of those who have more than once reached the indian ocean in a fishingsmack of fifty and have beaten in the homeward race the ships in whose company they sailed it is not many years since there was here a fishingskipper whose surname was daredevil and who sailed from this port to all parts of the world on sealing voyages in a sloop so small that she was popularly said to go under water when she got outside the lights and never to reappear until she reached her port and not only those who sail on long voyages but even our local pilots and fishermen still lead an adventurous and untamed life less softened than any other by the appliances of modern days in their undecked boats they hover day and night along these stormy coasts and at any hour the beating of the longroll upon the beach may call their full manhood into action cowardice is sifted and crushed out from among them by a pressure so constant and they are withal truthful and steady in their ways with few vices and many virtues they are born poor and remain poor for their work is hard with more blanks than prizes but their life is a life for a man and though it makes them prematurely old yet their old age comes peacefully and well in almost all pursuits the advance of years brings something forlorn it is not merely that the body decays but that men grow isolated and are pushed aside there is no common interest between age and youth the old farmer leads a lonely existence and ceases to meet his compeers except on sunday nobody consults him his experience has been monotonous and his age is apt to grow unsocial the old mechanic finds his tools and his methods superseded by those of younger men but the superannuated fisherman graduates into an oracle the longer he lives the greater the dignity of his experience he remembers the great storm the great tide the great catch the great shipwreck and on all emergencies his counsel has weight he still busies himself about the boats too and still sails on sunny days to show the youngsters the best fishingground when too infirm for even this he can at least sun himself beside the landing and dreaming over inexhaustible memories watch the bark of his own life go downthe haunted window it was always a mystery to me where severance got precisely his combination of qualities his father was simply what is called a handsome man with stately figure and curly black hair not without a certain dignity of manner but with a face so shallow that it did not even seem to ripple and with a voice so prosy that when he spoke of the sky you wished there were no such thing his mother was a fair little pallid creaturewashblond as they say of lacepatient meek and always fatigued and fatiguing but severance as i first knew him was the soul of activity he had dark eyes that had a great deal of light in them without corresponding depth his hair was dark straight and very soft his mouth expressed sweetness without much strength he talked well and though he was apt to have a wandering look as if his thoughts were laying a submarine cable to another continent yet the young girls were always glad to have the semblance of conversation with him in this to me he was in the last degree lovable he had just enough of that subtile quality called genius perhaps to spoil first his companions and then himself his words had weight with you though you might know yourself wiser and if you went to give him the most reasonable advice you were suddenly seized with a slight paralysis of the tongue thus it was at any rate with me we were cemented therefore by the firmest tiesa nominal seniority on my part and a substantial supremacy on his we lodged one summer at an old house in that odd suburb of oldport called the point it is a sort of artists quarter of the town frequented by a class of summer visitors more addicted to sailing and sketching than to driving and bowingpersons who do not object to simple fare and can live as one of them said on potatoes and point here severance and i made our summer home basking in the delicious sunshine of the lovely bay the bare outlines around oldport sometimes dismay the stranger but soon fascinate nowhere does one feel bareness so little because there is no sharpness of perspective everything shimmers in the moist atmosphere the islands are all glamour and mirage and the undulating hills of the horizon seem each like the soft arched back of some pet animal and you long to caress them with your hand at last your thoughts begin to swim also and pass into vague fancies which you also love to caress severance and i were constantly afloat body and mind he was a perfect sailor and had that dreaminess in his nature which matches with nothing but the ripple of the waves still i could not hide from myself that he was a changed man since that voyage in search of health from which he had just returned his mother talked in her humdrum way about heart disease and his father taking up the strain bored us about organic lesions till we almost wished he had a lesion himself severance ridiculed all this but he grew more and more moody and his eyes seemed to be laying more submarine cables than ever when we were not on the water we both liked to mouse about the queer streets and quaint old houses of that region and to chat with the fishermen and their grandmothers there was one house however which was very attractive to meperhaps because nobody lived in it and which for that or some other reason he never would approach it was a great square building of rough gray stone looking like those sombre houses which everyone remembers in montreal but which are rare in the states it had been built many years before by some millionnaire from new orleans and was left unfinished nobody knew why till the garden was a wilderness of bloom and the windows of ivy oldport is the only place in new england where either ivy or traditions will grow there were to be sure no legends about this house that i could hear of for the ghosts in those parts were feebleminded and retrospective by reason of age and perhaps scorned a mansion where nobody had ever lived but the ivy clustered round the projecting windows as densely as if it had the sins of a dozen generations to hide the house stood just above what were commonly called from their slaty color the blue rocks it seemed the topmost pebble left by some tide that had recededwhich perhaps it was nurses and children thronged daily to these rocks during the visitors season and the fishermen found there a favorite loungingplace but nobody scaled the wall of the house save myself and i went there very often the gate was sometimes opened by paul the silent bavarian gardener who was master of the keys and there were also certain great cats that were always sunning themselves on the steps and seemed to have grown old and gray in waiting for mice that had never come they looked as if they knew the past and the future if the owl is the bird of minerva the cat should be her beast they have the same sleepy air of unfathomable wisdom there was such a quiet and potent spell about the place that one could almost fancy these constant animals to be the transformed bodies of human visitors who had stayed too long who knew what tales might be told by these tall slender birches clustering so closely by the sombre wallsbirches which were but whispering shrubs when the first gray stones were laid and which now reared above the eaves their white stems and dark boughs still whispering and waiting till a few more years should show them across the roof the topmost blossoms of other birches on the other side before the great western doorway spread the outer harbor whither the coasting vessels came to drop anchor at any approach of storm these silent visitors which arrived at dusk and went at dawn and from which no boat landed seemed fitting guests before the portals of the silent house i was never tired of watching them from the piazza but severance always stayed outside the wall it was a whim of his he said and once only i got out of him something about the resemblance of the house to some portuguese mansionat madeira perhaps or at rio janeiro but he did not saywith which he had no pleasant associations yet he afterwards seemed to wish to deny this remark or to confuse my impressions of it which naturally fixed it the better in my mind i remember well the morning when he was at last coaxed into approaching the house it was late in september and a day of perfect calm as we looked from the broad piazza there was a glassy smoothness over all the bay and the hills were coated with a film or rather a mere varnish inconceivably thin of haze more delicate than any other climate in america can show over the water there were white gulls flying lazy and low schools of young mackerel displayed their white sides above the surface and it seemed asif even a butterfly might be seen for miles over that calm expanse the bay was covered with mackerelboats and one man sculled indolently across the foreground a scarlet skiff it was so still that every white sailboat rested where its sail was first spread and though the tide was at halfebb the anchored boats swung idly different ways from their moorings yet there was a continuous ripple in the broad sail of some almost motionless schooner and there was a constant melodious plash along the shore from the mouth of the bay came up slowly the premonitory line of bluer water and we knew that a breeze was near severance seemed to rise in spirits as we approached the house and i noticed no sign of shrinking except an occasional lowering of the voice seeing this i ventured to joke him a little on his previous reluctance and he replied in the same strain i seated myself at the corner and began sketching old fort louis while he strolled along the piazza looking in at the large vacant windows as he approached the farther end i suddenly heard him give a little cry of amazement or dismay and looking up saw him leaning against the wall with pale face and hands clenched a minute sometimes appears a long while and though i sprang to him instantly yet i remember that it seemed as if during that instant the whole face of things had changed the breeze had come the bay was rippled the sailboats careened to the wind fishes and birds were gone and a dark gray cloud had come between us and the sun such sudden changes are not however uncommon after an interval of calm and my only conscious thought at the time was of wonder at the strange aspect of my companion what was that asked severance in a bewildered tone i looked about me equally puzzled not there he said in the window i looked in at the window saw nothing and said so there was the great empty drawingroom across which one could see the opposite window and through this the eastern piazza and the garden beyond nothing more was there with some persuasion severance was induced to look in he admitted that he saw nothing peculiar but he refused all explanation and we went home never let me go to that house again he said abruptly as we entered our own door i pointed out to him the absurdity of thus yielding to a nervous delusion which was already in part conquered and he finally promised to revisit the scene with me the next day to clear all possible misgivings from my own mind i got the key of the house from paul explored it thoroughly and was satisfied that no improper visitor had recently entered the drawingroom at least as the windows were strongly bolted on the inside and a large cobweb heavy with dust hung across the doorway this did no great credit to pauls stewardship but was perhaps a slight relief to me nor could i see a trace of anything uncanny outside the house when severance went with me next day the coast was equally clear and i was glad to have cured him so easily unfortunately it did not last a few days after there was a brilliant sunset after a storm with gorgeous yellow light slanting everywhere and the sun looking at us between bars of dark purple cloud edged with gold where they touched the pale blue sky all this fading at last into a great whirl of gray to the northward with a cold purple ground at the height of the show i climbed the wall to my favorite piazza and was surprised to find severance already there he sat facing the sunset but with his head sunk between his hands at my approach he looked up and rose to his feet do not deceive me any more he said almost savagely and pointed to the window i looked in and must confess that for a moment i too was startled there was a perceptible moment of time during which it seemed as if no possible philosophy could explain what appeared in sight not that any object showed itself within the great drawingroom but i distinctly sawacross the apartment and through the opposite windowthe dark figure of a man about my own size who leaned against the long window and gazed intently on me above him spread the yellow sunset light around him the birchboughs hung and the ivytendrils swayed while behind him there appeared a glimmering watersurface across which slowly drifted the tall masts of a schooner it looked strangely like a view i had seen of some foreign harboramalfi perhapswith a vineclad balcony and a single human figure in the foreground so real and startling was the sight that at first it was not easy to resolve the whole scene into its component parts yet it was simply such a confused mixture of real and reflected images as one often sees from the window of a railway carriage where the mirrored interior seems to glide beside the train with the natural landscape for a background in this case also the frame and foliage of the picture were real and all else was reflected the sunlit bay behind us was reproduced as in a camera and the dark figure was but the fulllength image of myself it was easy to explain all this to severance but he shook his head so cool a philosopher as yourself he said should remember that this image is not always visible at our last visit we looked for it in vain when we first saw it it appeared and disappeared within ten minutes on your mechanical theory it should be otherwise this staggered me for a moment then the ready solution occurred that the reflection depended on the strength and direction of the light and i proved to him that in our case it had appeared and disappeared with the sunshine he was silenced but evidently not convinced yet time and commonsense it seemed would take care of that soon after all this i was called out of town for a week or two if severance would go with me it would doubtless complete the cure i thought but this he obstinately declined after my departure my sister wrote he seemed absolutely to haunt the empty house by the blue rocks he undoubtedly went here to sketch she thought the house was in charge of a realestate agenta retiredlandscapepainter whose pictures did not sell so profitably as their originals and her theory was that this agent hoped to make our friend buy the place and so allured him there under pretence of sketching moreover she surmised he was studying some effect of shadow because unlike most men he appeared in decent spirits only on cloudy days it is always so easy to fit a man out with a set of readymade motives but i drew my own conclusions and was not surprised to hear soon after that severance was seriously ill this brought me back at oncesailing down from providence in an open boat i remember one lovely moonlight night next day i saw severance who declared that he had suffered from nothing worse than a prolonged sickheadache i soon got out of him all that had happened he had seen the figure in the window every sunny day he said of course he had if he chose to look for it and i could only smile though it perhaps seemed unkind but i stopped smiling when he went on to tell that not satisfied with these observations he had visited the house by moonlight also and had then seen as he averred a second figure standing beside the first of course there was no defence against such a theory as this except simply to laugh it down but it made me very anxious for it showed that he was growing thoroughly morbid either it was pure fancy i said or it was paul the gardener but here he was prepared for me it seemed that on seeing the two figures severance had at once left the piazza and with an instinct of commonsense that was surprising had crossed the garden scaled the wall and looked in at the window of pauls little cottage where the man and his wife were quietly seated at supper probably after a late fishingtrip there was another reason he said but here he stopped and would give no description of the second figure which he had however seen twice again always by moonlight he consented to let me accompany him the following night we accordingly went it was a calm clear night and the moon lay brightly on the bay the distant shores looked low and filmy a naval vessel was in the harbor and there was a ball on board with music and fireworks some fishermen were singing in their boats late as was the hour severance was absorbed in his own gloomy reveries and when we had crossed the wall the world seemed left outside and the glamour of the place began to creep over me also i seemed to see my companion relapsing into some phantom realm beyond power of withdrawal i talked sang whistled but it was all a rather hollow effort and soon ceased the great house looked gloomy and impenetrable the moonlight appeared sick and sad the birchboughs rustled in a dreary way we went up the steps in no jubilant mood i crossed the piazza at once looked in at the farthest window and saw there my own image though far more faintly than in the sunlight severance then joined me and his reflected shape stood by mine something of the first ghostly impression was renewed i must confess by this meeting of the two shadows there was something rather awful in the way the bodiless things nodded and gesticulated at each other in silence still there was nothing more than this as severance was compelled to own and i was trying to turn the whole affair into ridicule when suddenly without sound or warning i sawas distinctly as i perceive the words i now write yet another figure stand at the window gaze steadfastly at us for a moment and then disappear it was as i fancied that of a woman but was totally enveloped in a very full cloak reaching to the ground with a peculiarly cut hood that stood erect and seemed half as long as the body of the garment i had a vague recollection of having seen some such costume in a picture of course i dashed round the corner of the house threaded the birchtrees and stood on the eastern piazza no one was there without losing an instant i ran to the garden wall and climbed it as severance had done to look into pauls cottage that worthy was just getting into bed in a state of complicated deshabille his blackbearded head wrapped in an old scarlet handkerchief that made him look like a retired pirate in reduced circumstances he being accounted for i vainly traversed the shrubberies returned to the western piazza watched awhile uselessly and went home with severance a good deal puzzled by daylight the whole thing seemed different that i had seen the figure there was no doubt it was not a reflected image for we had no companion it was then human after all thought i it is a commonplace thing enough this masquerading in a cloak and hood someone has observed severances nocturnal visits and is amusing himself at his expense the peculiarity was that the thing was so well done and the figure had such an air of dignity that somehow it was not so easy to make light of it in talking with him i went into his room next day his sickheadache or whatever it was had come on again and he was lying on his bed rutherfords strange old book on the second sight lay open before him look there he said and i read the motto of a chapter in sunlight one in shadow none in moonlight two in thunder two then comes death i threw the book indignantly from me and began to invent doggerel parodying this precious incantation but severance did not seem to enjoy the joke and it grows tiresome to enact ones own farce and do ones own applauding for several days after he was laid up in earnest but instead of getting any mental rest from this he lay poring over that preposterous book and it really seemed as if his brain were a little disturbed meanwhile i watched the great house day and night sought for footsteps and by some odd fancy took frequent observations on the gardener and his wife failing to get any clew i waited one day for pauls absence and made a call upon the wife under pretence of hunting up a missing handkerchieffor she had been my laundress i found the handsome swarthy creature with her six bronzed children around her training up the madeira vine that made a bower of the whole side of her little black gambrelroofed cottage on learning my errand she became full ofsympathy and was soon emptying her bureaudrawers in pursuit of the lost handkerchief as she opened the lowest drawer i saw within it something which sent all the blood to my face for a moment it was a black cloth cloak with a stiff hood two feet long of precisely the pattern worn by the unaccountable visitant at the window i turned almost fiercely upon her but she looked so innocent as she stood there caressing and dusting with her fingers what was evidently a pet garment that it was really impossible to denounce her is that a bavarian cloak said i trying to be cool and judicial here broke in the eldest boy named john aged ten a native american and a sailor already whom i had twice fished up from a capsized punt mother aint a bavarian quoth the young salt fathers a bavarian mothers a portegee portegees wear them hoods i am a portuguese sir from fayal said the woman prolonging with sweet intonation the soft name of her birthplace this is my capote she added taking up with pride the uncouth costume while the children gathered round as if its vast folds came rarely into sight it has not been unfolded for a year she said as she spoke she dropped it with a cry and a little mouse sprang from the skirts and whisked away into some corner we found that the little animal had made its abode in the heavy woollen of which three or four thicknesses had been eaten through and then matted together into the softest of nests this contained moreover a small family of mouselets who certainly had not taken part in any midnight masquerade the secret seemed more remote than ever for i knew that there was no other portuguese family in the town and there was no confounding this peculiar local costume with any other returning to severances chamber i said nothing of all this he was by an odd coincidence looking over a portfolio of fayal sketches made by himself during his late voyage among them were a dozen studies of just such capotes as i had seensome in profile completely screening the wearer others disclosing womens faces old or young he seemed to wish to put them away however when i came in really the plot seemed to thicken and it was a little provoking to understand it no better when all the materials seemed close to ones hands a day or two later i was summoned to boston returning thence by the stagecoach we drove from tiverton the whole length of the island under one of those wild and wonderful skies which give better than anything in nature the effect of a field of battle the heavens were filled with ten thousand separate masses of cloud varying in shade from palest gray to ironblack borne rapidly to and fro by upper and lower currents of opposing wind they seemed to be charging retreating breaking recombining with puffs of what seemed smoke and a few wan sunbeams sometimes striking through for fire wherever the eye turned there appeared some flying fragment not seen before and yet in an hour this noiseless antietam grew still and a settled leaden film overspread the sky yielding only to some level lines of light where the sun went down perhaps our driver was looking toward the sky more than to his own affairs for just as all this ended a wheel gave out and we had to stop in portsmouth for repairs by the time we were again in motion the changing wind had brought up a final thunderstorm which broke upon us ere we reached our homes it was rather an uncommon thing so late in the season for the lightning like other brilliant visitors usually appears in oldport during only a month or two of every year the coach set me down at my own door so soaked that i might have floated in i peeped into severances room however on the way to my own strange to say no one was there yet some one had evidently been lying on the bed and on the pillow lay the old book on the second sight open at the very page which had so bewitched him and vexed me i glanced at it mechanically and when i came to the meaningless jumble in thunder two a flash flooded the chamber and a sudden fear struck into my mind who knew what insane experiment might have come into that boys head with sudden impulse i went downstairs and found the whole house empty until a stupid old woman coming in from the woodhouse with her apron full of turnips told me that severance had been missing since nightfall after being for a week in bed dangerously ill and sometimes slightly delirious the family had become alarmed and were out with lanterns in search of him it was safe to say that none of them had more reason to be alarmed than i it was something however to know where to seek him meeting two neighboring fishermen i took them with me as we approached the wellknown wall the blast blew out our lights and we could scarcely speak the lightning had grown less frequent yet sheets of flame seemed occasionally to break over the dark square sides of the house and to send a flickering flame along the ridgepole and eaves like a surf of light a surf of water broke also behind us on the blue rocks sounding as if it pursued our very footsteps and one of the men whispered hoarsely to me that a nantucket brig had parted her cable and was drifting in shore as we entered the garden lights gleamed in the shrubbery to my surprise it was paul and his wife with their two oldest childrenthese last being quite delighted with the stir and showing so much illumination in the lee of the house that it was quite a feast of lanterns they seemed a little surprised at meeting us too but we might as well have talked from point judith to beaver tail as to have attempted conversation there i walked round the building but a flash of lightning showed nothing on the western piazza save a birchtree which lay across blown down by the storm i therefore went inside with pauls household leaving the fishermen withoutnever shall i forget that search as we went from empty room to room the thunder seemed rolling on the very roof and the sharp flashes of lightning appeared to put out our lamps and then kindle them again we traversed the upper regions mounting by a ladder to the attic then descended into the cellar and the winevault the thorough bareness of the house the fact that no brighteyed mice peeped at us from their holes no uncouth insects glided on the walls no flies buzzed in the unwonted lamplight scarcely a spider slid down his damp and trailing weball this seemed to enhance the mystery the vacancy was more dreary than desertion it was something old which had never been young we found ourselves speaking in whispers the children kept close to their parents we seemed to be chasing some awful silence from room to room and the last apartment the great drawingroom we really seemed loath to enter the less the rest of the house had to show the more it seemed must be concentrated there even as we entered a blast of air from a broken pane extinguished our last light and it seemed to take many minutes to rekindle it as it shone once more a brilliant lightningflash also swept through the window and flickered and flickered as if it would never have done the eldest child suddenly screamed and pointed with her finger first to one great window and then to its opposite my eyes instinctively followed the successive directions and the double glance gave me all i came to seek and more than all outside the western window lay severance his white face against the pane his eyes gazing across and past usstruck down doubtless by the fallen tree which lay across the piazza and hid him from external view opposite him and seen through the eastern window stood statuelike the hooded figure but with the great capote thrown back showing a sad eager girlish face with dark eyes and a good deal of black hairone of those faces of peasant beauty such as america never showsfaces where ignorance is almost raised into refinement by its childlike look contrasted with severances wild gaze the countenance wore an expression of pitying forgiveness almost of calm yet it told of wasting sorrow and the wreck of a life gleaming lustrous beneath the lightning it had a more mystic look when the long flash had ceased and the single lantern burned beneath it like an altarlamp before a shrine it is aunt emilia exclaimed the little girl and as she spoke the father turning angrily upon her dashed the light to the ground and groped his way out without a word of answer i was too much alarmed about severance to care for aught else and quickly made my way to the western piazza where i found him stunned by the fallen treeinjured i feared internallystill conscious but unable to speak with the aid of my two companions i got him home and he was ill for several weeks before he died during his illness he told me all he had to tell and though paul and his family disappeared next dayperhaps going on board the nantucket brig which had narrowly escaped shipwrecki afterwards learned all the remaining facts from the only neighbor in whom they had placed confidence severance while convalescing at a countryhouse in fayal had fallen passionately in love with a young peasantgirl who had broken off her intended marriage for love of him and had sunk into a halfimbecile melancholy when deserted she had afterwards come to this country and joined her sister pauls wife paul had received her reluctantly and only on condition that her existence should be concealed this was the easier as it was one of her whims to go out only by night when she had haunted the great house which she said reminded her of her own island so that she liked to wear thither the capote which had been the pride of her heart at home on the few occasions when she had caught a glimpse of severance he had seemed to her no doubt as much a phantom as she seemed to him on the night of the storm they had both sought their favorite haunt unconscious of each other and the friends of each had followed in alarm i got traces of the family afterwards at nantucket and later at narragansett and had reason to think that paul was employed one summer by a farmer on conanicut but i was always just too late for them and the money which severance left as his only reparation for poor emilia never was paid the affair was hushed up and very few even among the neighbors knew the tragedy that had passed by them with the storm after severance died i had that temporary feeling of weakened life which remains after the first friend or the first love passes and the heart seems to lose its sense of infinity his father came and prosed and measured the windows of the empty house and calculated angles of reflection and poured even death and despair into his crucible of commonplace the mother whined in her feebler way at home while the only brother a talkative medical student tried to poohpooh it all and sent me a letter demonstrating that emilia was never in america and that the whole was an hallucination i cared nothing for his theory it all seemed like a dream to me and as all the actors but myself are gone it seems so still the great house is yet unoccupied and likely to remain so and he who looks through its western window may still be startled by the weird image of himself as i lingered round it today beneath the winter sunlight the snow drifted pitilessly past its ivied windows and so hushed my footsteps that i scarce knew which was the phantom myself or my reflection and wondered if the medical student would not argue me out of existence next this is the end of my story if i sought for a moral it would be hard to attach one to a thing so slight it could only be this that shadow and substance are always ready to link themselves in unexpected ways against the diseased imagination and that remorse can make the most transparent crystal into a mirror for its sina driftwood fire this ae nighte this ae nighte every nighte and alle fire and salt and candlelighte and christe receive thy saule a lykewake dirge the october days grow rapidly shorter and brighten with more concentrated light it is but half past five yet the sun dips redly behind conanicut the sunsetgun booms from our neighbors yacht the flag glides down from his mainmast and the slender pennant running swiftly up the opposite halyards dances and flickers like a flame and at last perches with dainty hesitation at the masthead a tint of salmoncolor burnished into long undulations of lustre overspreads the shallower waves but a sober gray begins to steal in beneath the sunset rays and will soon claim even the brilliant foreground for its own pile a few more fragments of driftwood upon the fire in the great chimney little maiden and then couch yourself before it that i may have your glowing childhood as a foreground for those heaped relics of shipwreck and despair you seem in your scarlet boatingdress annie like some bright tropic bird alit for a moment beside that other bird of the tropics flame thoreau thought that his temperament dated from an earlier period than the agricultural because he preferred woodcraft to gardening and it is also pleasant to revert to the period when men had invented neither saws nor axes but simply picked up their fuel in forests or on oceanshores fire is a thing which comes so near us and combines itself so closely with our life that we enjoy it best when we work for it in some way so that our fuel shall warm us twice as the country people sayonce in the getting and again in the burning yet no work seems to have more of the flavor of play in it than that of collecting driftwood on some convenient beach or than this boatservice of ours annie when we go wandering from island to island in the harbor and glide over seaweedgroves and the habitations of crabsor to the flowery and ruined bastions of rose islandor to those caves at coasters harbor where we played victor hugo and were eaten up in fancy by a cuttlefish then we voyaged you remember to that further cave in the solid rock just above lowwatermark a cell unapproachable by land and high enough for you to stand erect there you wished to play constance in marmion and to be walled up alive if convenient but as it proved impracticable on that day you helped me to secure some bits of driftwood instead longer voyages brought waifs from remoter islandswhose very names tell perchance the changing story of mariners long since wreckedisles baptized patience and prudence hope and despair and other relics bear witness of more distant beaches and of those wrecks which still lie sentinels of ruin along brentons point and castle hill to collect driftwood is like botanizing and one soon learns to recognize the prevailing species and to look with pleased eagerness for new it is a tragic botany indeed where as in enchanted gardens every specimen has a voice and as you take each from the ground you expect from it a cry like the mandrakes and from what a garden it comes as one walks round brentons point after an autumnal storm it seems as if the passionate heaving of the waves had brought wholly new tints to the surface hues unseen even in dreams before greens and purples impossible in serener days these match the prevailing green and purple of the slatecliffs and nature in truth carries such fine fitnesses yet further for as we tread the delicate seaside turf which makes the farthest point seem merely the lands last bequest of emerald to the ocean we suddenly come upon curved lines of lustrous purple amid the grass rows on rows of bright muscleshells regularly traced as if a child had played therethe graceful highwatermark of the terrible storm it is the crowning fascination of the sea the consummation of such might in such infantine delicacy you may notice it again in the summer when our bay is thronged for miles on miles with inchlong jellyfisheslovely creatures in shape like disembodied gooseberries and shot through and through in the sunlight with all manner of blue and golden glistenings and bearing tiny rows of fringing oars that tremble like a babys eyelids there is less of gross substance in them than in any other created thingmere water and outline destined to perish at a touch but seemingly never touching for they float secure finding no conceivable cradle so soft as this awful sea they are like melodies amid beethovens symphonies or like the songs that wander through shakespeare and that seem things too fragile to risk near cleopatras passion and hamlets woe thus tender is the touch of ocean and look how around this piece of oaken timber twisted and torn and furrowedits iron bolts snapped across as if bittenthere is yet twined a gay garland of ribbonweed bearing on its trailing stem a cluster of bright shells like a mermaids chatelaine thus adorned we place it on the blaze as night gathers without the gale rises it is a season of uneasy winds and of strange rainless storms which perplex the fishermen and indicate rough weather out at sea as the house trembles and the windows rattle we turn towards the fire with a feeling of safety representing the fiercest of all dangers it yet expresses security and comfort should a gale tear the roof from over our heads and show the black sky alone above us we should not feel utterly homeless while this fire burnedat least i can recall such a feeling of protection when once left suddenly roofless by night in one of the wild gorges of mount katahdin there is a positive demonstrative force in an open fire which makes it your fit ally in a storm settled and obdurate cold may well be encountered by the quiet heat of an invisible furnace but this howling wind might depress ones spirits were it not met by a force as palpablethe warm blast within answering to the cold blast without the wide chimney then becomes the scene of contest wind meets wind sparks encounter raindrops they fight in the air like the visioned soldiers of attila sometimes a daring drop penetrates and dies hissing on the hearth and sometimes a troop of sparks may make a sortie from thechimneytop i know not how else we can meet the elements by a defiance so magnificent as that from this open hearth and in burning driftwood especially we turn against the enemy his own ammunition for on these fragments three elements have already done their work water racked and strained the hapless ships air hunted them and they were thrown at last upon earth the sternest of all now fire takes the shattered remnants and makes them a means of comfort and defence it has been pointed out by botanists as one of natures most graceful retributions that in the building of the ship the apparent balance of vegetable forces is reversed and the herb becomes master of the tree when the delicate blueeyed flax taking the stately pine under its protection stretches over it in cordage or spreads in sails but more graceful still is this further contest between the great natural elements when this most fantastic and vanishing thing this delicate and dancing flame subdues all these huge vassals to its will and after earth and air and water have done their utmost comes in to complete the task and to be crowned as monarch the sea drinks the air said anacreon and the sun the sea my fire is the child of the sun i come back from every evening stroll to this gleaming blaze it is a domestic lamp and shines for me everywhere to my imagination it burns as a central flame among these dark houses and lights up the whole of this little fishing hamlet humble suburb of the fashionable wateringplace i fancy that others too perceive the light and that certain huge visitors are attracted even when the storm keeps neighbors and friends at home for the slightest presage of foul weather is sure to bring to yonder anchorage a dozen silent vessels that glide up the harbor for refuge and are heard but once when the chaincable rattles as it runs out and the iron hand of the anchor grasps the rock it always seems to me that these unwieldy creatures are gathered not about the neighboring lighthouse only but around our ingleside welcome ye great winged strangers whose very names are unknown this hearth is comprehensive in its hospitalities it will accept from you either its fuel or its guests your mariners may warm themselves beside it or your scattered timbers may warm me strange instincts might be supposed to thrill and shudder in the ribs of ships that sail toward the beacon of a driftwood fire morituri salutant a single shock and all that magnificent fabric may become mere fuel to prolong the flame here beside the roaring ocean this blaze represents the only receptacle more vast than ocean we say unstable as water but there is nothing unstable about the flickering flame it is persistent and desperate relentless in following its ends it is the most tremendous physical force that man can use if drugs fail said hippocrates use the knife should the knife fail use fire conquered countries were anciently given over to fire and sword the latter could only kill but the other could annihilate see how thoroughly it does its work even when domesticated it takes up everything upon the hearth and leaves all clean the greek proverb says that the sea drinks up all the sins of the world save fire only the sea is the most capacious of all things but its task is left incomplete it only hides its records while fire destroys them in the norse edda when the gods try their games they find themselves able to outdrink the ocean but not to eat like the flame logi or fire licks up food and trencher and all this chimney is more voracious than the sea give time enough and all which yonder depths contain might pass through this insatiable throat leaving only a few ashes and the memory of a flickering shadepulvis et umbra we recognize this when we have anything to conceal deep crimes are buried in earth deeper are sunk in water but the deepest of all are confided by trembling men to the profounder secrecy of flame if every old chimney could narrate the fearful deeds whose last records it has cancelled what sighs of undying passion would breathe from its dark summitwhat groans of guilt those lurid sparks that whirl over yonder housetop tossed aloft as if fire itself could not contain them may be the last embers of some written scroll one rescued word of which might suffice for the ruin of a household and the crushing of many hearts but this domestic hearth of ours holds only besides its driftwood the peaceful records of the dayits shreds and fragments and fallen leaves as the ancients poured wine upon their flames so i pour roseleaves in libation and each morning contributes the faded petals of yesterdays wreaths all our roses of this season have passed up this chimney in the blaze their delicate veins were filled with all the summers fire and they returned to fire once moreashes to ashes flame to flame for holding with bettina that every flower which is broken becomes immortal in the sacrifice i deem it more fitting that their earthly part should die by a concentration of that burning element which would at any rate be in some form their ending so they have their altar on this bright hearth let us pile up the fire anew with driftwood annie we can choose at random for our logs came from no single forest it is considered an important branch of skill in the country to know the varieties of firewood and to choose among them well but tonight we have the whole atlantic shore for our woodpile and the gulf stream for a teamster every foreign tree of rarest name may for aught we know send its treasures to our hearth logwood and satinwood may mingle with cedar and maple the old cellar floors of this once princely town are of mahogany and why not our fire i have a very indistinct impression what teak is but if it means something black and impenetrable and nearly indestructible then there is a piece of it annie on the hearth at this moment it must be owned indeed that timbers soaked long enough in saltwater seem almost to lose their capacity of being burnt perhaps it was for this reason that in the ancient lykewakes of the north of england a pinch of salt was placed upon the dead body as a safeguard against purgatorial flames yet salt melts ice and so represents heat one would think and one can fancy that these fragments should be doubly inflammable by their saline quality and by the unmerciful rubbing which the waves have given them i have noticed what warmth this churning process communicates to the clotted foam that lies in tremulous masses among the rocks holding all the blue of ocean in its bubbles after ones hands are chilled with the water one can warm them in the foam these driftwood fragments are but the larger foam of shipwreckswhat strange comrades this flame brings together as foreign sailors from remotest seas may sit and chat side by side before some boardinghouse fire in this seaport town so these shapeless sticks perhaps gathered from far wider wanderings now nestle together against the backlog and converse in strange dialects as they burn it is written in the heetopades of veeshnoo sarma that as two planks floating on the surface of the mighty receptacle of the waters meet and having met are separated forever so do beings in this life come together and presently are parted perchance this chimney reunites the planks at the last moment as death must reunite friends and with what wondrous voices these strayed wanderers talk to one another on the hearth they bewitch us by the mere fascination of their language such a delicacy of intonation yet such a volume of sound the murmur of the surf is not so soft or so solemn there are the merest hints and traceries of tonesphantom voices more remote from noise than anything which is noise and yet there is an undertone of roar as from a thousand cities the cities whence these wild voyagers came watch the decreasing sounds of a fire as it diesfor it seems cruel to leave it as we do to die alone i watched beside this hearth last night as the fire sank down the little voices grew stiller and more still and at last there came only irregular beats at varying intervals as if from a heart that acted spasmodically or as if it were measuring off by ticks the little remnant of time then it said hush two or three times and there came something so like a sob that it seemed human and then all was still if these dying voices are so sweet and subtile what legends must be held untold by yonder fragments that lie unconsumed photography has familiarized us with the thought that every visible act since the beginning of the world has stamped itself upon surrounding surfaces even if we have not yet skill to discern and hold the image and especially in looking on a liquid expanse such as the ocean in calm one is haunted with these fancies i gaze into its depths and wonder if no stray reflection has been imprisoned there still accessible to human eyes of some scene of passion or despair it has witnessed as some maiden visitor at holyrood palace looking in the ancient metallic mirror might start at the thought that perchance some lineament of mary stuart may suddenly look out in desolate and forgotten beauty mingled with her own and if the mere waters of the ocean satiate and wearied with tragedy as they must be still keep for our fancy such records how much more might we attribute a human consciousness to these shattered fragments each seared by its own special grief yet while they are silent i like to trace back for these component parts of my fire such brief histories as i share this block for instance came from the large schooner which now lies at the end of castle hill beach bearing still aloft its broken masts and shattered rigging and with its keel yet stanch except that the sternpost is goneso that each tide sweeps in its green harvest of glossy kelp and then tosses it in the hold like hay desolately tenanting the place which once sheltered men the floating weed so graceful in its own place looks but dreary when thus confined on that fearfully cold monday of last winter january when the mercury stood at deg even in this mildest corner of new englandthis vessel was caught helplessly amid the ice that drifted out of the west passage of narragansett bay before the fierce northwind they tried to beat into the eastern entrance but the schooner seemed in sinking condition the sails and helm were clogged with ice and every rope as an eyewitness told me was as large as a mans body with frozen sleet twice they tacked across making no progress and then to save their lives ran the vessel on the rocks and got ashore after they had left her a higher wave swept her off and drifted her into a little cove where she has ever since remained there were twelve wrecks along this shore last wintermore than during any season for a quarter of a century i remember when the first of these lay in great fragments on graves point a schooner having been stranded on cormorant rocks outside and there broken in pieces by the surf she had been split lengthwise and one great side was leaning up against the sloping rock bows on like some wild seacreature never before beheld of men and come there but to die so strong was this impression that when i afterwards saw men at work upon the wreck tearing out the iron bolts and chains it seemed like torturing the last moments of a living thing at my next visit there was no person in sight another companion fragment had floated ashore and the two lay peacefully beside the sailors graves which give the name to the point as if they found comfort there a little farther on there was a brig ashore and deserted a fog came in from the sea and as i sat by the graves some unseen passing vessel struck eight bells for noon for a moment i fancied that it came from the empty briga ghostly call to summon phantom sailors that smouldering brand which has alternately gleamed and darkened for so many minutes i brought from prices neck last winter when the brentons reef lightship went ashore yonder the oddly shaped vessel rides at anchor now two miles from land bearing her lanterns aloft at fore and main top she parted her moorings by night in the fearful storm of october and i well remember that as i walked through the streets that wild evening it seemed dangerous to be out of doors and i tried to imagine what was going on at sea while at that very moment the lightship was driving on toward me in the darkness it was thus that it happened there had been a heavy gale from the southeast which after a few hours of lull suddenly changed in the afternoon to the southwest which is on this coast the prevailing direction beginning about three oclock this new wind had risen almost to a hurricane by six and held with equal fury till midnight after which it greatly diminished though when i visited the wreck next morning it was hard to walk against the blast the lightship went adrift at eight in the evening the men let go another anchor with forty fathoms of cable this parted also but the cable dragged as she drifted in keeping the vessels head to the wind which was greatly to her advantage the great waves took her over five lines of reef on each of which her keel grazed or held for a time she came ashore on prices neck at last about elevenit was utterly dark the sea broke high over the ship even over her lanterns and the crew could only guess that they were near the land by the sound of the surf the captain was not on board and the mate was in command though his leg had been broken while holding the tiller they could not hear each others voices and could scarcely cling to the deck there seemed every chance that the ship would go to pieces before daylight at last one of the crew named william martin a scotchman thinking as he afterwards told me of his wife and three children and of the others on board who had familiesand that something must be done and he might as well do it as anybodygot a rope bound around his waist and sprang overboard i asked the mate next day whether he ordered martin to do this and he said no he volunteered it i would not have ordered him for i would not have done it myself what made the thing most remarkable was that the man actually could not swim and did not know how far off the shore was but trusted to the waves to take him thitherperhaps two hundred yards his trust was repaid struggling in the mighty surf he sometimes felt the rocks beneath his feet sometimes bruised his hands against them at any rate he got on shore alive and securing his rope made his way over the moors to the town and summoned his captain who was asleep in his own house they returned at once to the spot found the line still fast and the rest of the crew four in number lowered the whaleboat and were pulled to shore by the rope landing safely before daybreak when i saw the vessel next morning she lay in a little cove stern on not wholly out of watersteady and upright as in a drydock with no sign of serious injury except that the rudder was gone she did not seem like a wreck the men were the wrecks as they lay among the rocks bare or tattered scarcely able to move waiting for low tide to go on board the vessel it was like a scene after a battle they appeared too inert poor fellows to do anything but yearn toward the sun when they changed position for shelter from time to time they crept along the rocks instead of walking they were like the little floating sprays of seaweed when you take them from the water and they become a mere mass of pulp in your hand martin shared in the general exhaustion and no wonder but he told his story very simply and showed me where he had landed the feat seemed to me then and has always seemed almost incredible even for an expert swimmer he thus summed up the motives for his action i thought that god was first and i was next and if i did the best i could no man could do more than that so i jumped overboard it is pleasant to add that though a poor man he utterly declined one of those small donations of money by which we anglosaxons are wont clumsily to express our personal enthusiasms and i think i appreciated his whole action the more for its coming just at the close of a war during which so many had readily accepted their award of praise or pay for acts of less intrinsic daring than his stir the fire annie with yonder broken fragment of a flagstaff its truck is still remaining though the flag is gone and every nation might claim it as you stir the burning brands evince a remembrance of their sealost life the sparks drift away like foamflakes the flames wave and flap like sails and the wail of the chimney sings a second shipwreck as the tiny scintillations gleam and scatter and vanish in the soot of the chimneywall instead of there goes the parson and there goes the clerk it must be the captain and the crew we watch a driftwood fire should always have children to tend it for there is something childlike about it unlike the steadier glow of walnut logs it has a coaxing infantine way of playing with the oddly shaped bits of wood we give it and of deserting one to caress with flickering impulse another and at night when it needs to be extinguished it is as hard to put to rest as a nursery of children for some bright little head is constantly springing up anew from its pillow of ashes and in turn what endless delight children find in the manipulation of a fire what a variety of playthings too in this fuel of ours such inexplicable pieces treenails and tholepins trucks and sheaves the lid of a locker and a broken handspike these larger fragments are from spars and planks and knees some were dropped overboard in this quiet harbor others may have floated from fayal or hispaniola mozambique or zanzibar this eagle figurehead chipped and battered but still possessing highly aquiline features and a single eye may have tangled its curved beak in the vast weedbeds of the sargasso sea or dipped it in the sea of milk tell us your story o heroic but dilapidated bird and perhaps song or legend may find in it themes that shall be immortal the eagle is silent and i suspect annie that he is but a plain homebred fowl after all but what shall we say to this piece of plank hung with barnacles that look large enough for the fabled barnaclegoose to emerge from observe this fragment a little another piece is secured to it not neatly as with proper tools but clumsily with many nails of different sizes driven unevenly and with their heads battered awry wedged clumsily in between these pieces and secured by a supplementary nail is a bit of broken rope let us touch that rope tenderly for who knows what despairing hands may last have clutched it when this rude raft was made it may indeed have been the handiwork of children on the penobscot or the st marys river but its condition betokens voyages yet longer and it may just as well have come from the stranded golden rule on roncador reefthat picturesque shipwreck where as a rescued woman told me the eyes of the people in their despair seemed full of sublime resignation so that there was no confusion or outcry and even gamblers and harlots looked death in the face as nobly for all that could be seen as the saintly and the pure or who knows but it floated round cape horn from that other wreck on the pacific shore of the central america where the rough miners found that there was room in the boats only for their wives and their gold and where pushing the women off with a few men to row them the doomed husbands gave a cheer of courage as the ship went down here again is a piece of pine wood cut in notches as for a tally and with every seventh notch the longest these notches having been cut deeply at the beginning and feebly afterwards stopping abruptly before the end was reached who could have carved it not a schoolboy awaiting vacation or a soldier expecting his discharge for then each tally would have been cut off instead of added nor could it be the squad of two soldiers who garrison rose island for their tour of duty lasts but a week there are small barnacles and seaweed too which give the mysterious stick a sort of brevet antiquity it has been long adrift and these little barnacles opening and closing daily their minute valves have kept meanwhile their own register and with their busy fringed fingershave gathered from the whole atlantic that small share of its edible treasures which sufficed for them plainly this waif has had its experiences it was robinson crusoes annie depend upon it we will save it from the flames and when we establish our marine museum nothing save a veritable piece of the north pole shall be held so valuable as this undoubted relic from juan fernandez but the night deepens and its reveries must end with the winter will pass away the winterstorms and summer will bring its own more insidious perils then the drowsy old seaport will blaze into splendor through saloon and avenue amidst which many a bright career will end suddenly and leave no sign the ocean tries feebly to emulate the profounder tragedies of the shore in the crowded halls of gay hotels i see wrecks drifting hopelessly dismasted and rudderless to be stranded on hearts harder and more cruel than brentons reef yet hid in smiles falser than its fleecy foam what is a mere forsaken ship compared with stately houses from which those whom i first knew in their youth and beauty have since fled into midnight and despair but one last gleam upon our hearth lights up your innocent eyes little annie and dispels the gathering shade the flame dies down again and you draw closer to my side the pure moon looks in at the southern window replacing the ruddier glow while the fading embers lisp and prattle to one another like drowsy children more and more faintly till they fall asleepan artists creation when i reached kenmures house one august evening it was rather a disappointment to find that he and his charming laura had absented themselves for twentyfour hours i had not seen them together since their marriage my admiration for his varied genius and her unvarying grace was at its height and i was really annoyed at the delay my fair cousin with her usual exact housekeeping had prepared everything for her guest and then bequeathed me as she wrote to janet and baby marian it was a pleasant arrangement for between baby marian and me there existed a species of passion i might almost say of betrothal ever since that little threeyearold sunbeam had blessed my mothers house by lingering awhile in it six months before still i went to bed disappointed though the delightful windows of the chamber looked out upon the glimmering bay and the swinging lanterns at the yardarms of the frigates shone like some softer constellation beneath the brilliant sky the house was so close upon the water that the cool waves seemed to plash deliciously against its very basement and it was a comfort to think that if there were no adequate human greetings that night there would be plenty in the morning since marian would inevitably be pulling my eyelids apart before sunrise it was scarcely dawn when i was roused by a little arm round my neck and waked to think i had one of raphaels cherubs by my side fingers of waxen softness were ruthlessly at work upon my eyes and the little form that met my touch felt lithe and elastic like a kittens limbs there was just light enough to see the child perched on the edge of the bed her soft blue dressinggown trailing over the white nightdress while her black and longfringed eyes shone through the dimness of morning she yielded gladly to my grasp and i could fondle again the silken hair the velvety brunette cheek the plump childish shoulders yet sleep still half held me and when my cherub appeared to hold it a cherubic practice to begin the day with a demand for lively anecdote i was fain drowsily to suggest that she might first tell some stories to her doll with the sunny readiness that was a part of her nature she straightway turned to that young ladyplain susan halliday with both cheeks patched and eyes of different colorsand soon discoursed both her and me into repose when i waked again it was to find the child conversing with the morning star which still shone through the window scarcely so lucent as her eyes and bidding it go home to its mother the sun another lapse into dreams and then a more vivid awakening and she had my ear at last and won story after story requiting them with legends of her own youth almost a year agohow she was perilously lost for instance in the small front yard with a little playmate early in the afternoon and how they came and peeped into the window and thought all the world had forgotten them then the sweet voice distinct in its articulation as lauras went straying off into wilder fanciesa chaos of autobiography and conjecture like the letters of a war correspondent you would have thought her little life had yielded more pangs and fears than might have sufficed for the discovery of the north pole but breakfasttime drew near at last and janets honest voice was heard outside the door i rather envied the good scotchwoman the pleasant task of polishing the smooth cheeks and combing the dishevelled silk but when a little later the small maiden was riding down stairs in my arms i envied no one at sight of the bread and milk my cherub was transformed into a hungry human child chiefly anxious to reach the bottom of her porringer i was with her a great deal that day she gave no manner of trouble it was like having the charge of a floating butterfly endowed with warm arms to clasp and a silvery voice to prattle i sent janet out to sail with the other servants by way of frolic and marians perfect temperament was shown in the way she watched the departing there they go she said as she stood and danced at the window now they are out of sight what i said are you pleased to have your friends go yes she answered but i shall be pleaseder to see them come back life to her was no alternation between joy and grief but only between joy and delight twilight brought us to an improvised concert climbing the pianostool she went over the notes with her little taper fingers touching the keys in a light knowing way that proved her a musicians child then i must play for her and let the dance begin this was a wondrous performance on her part and consisted at first in hopping up and down on one spot with no change of motion but in her hands she resembled a minute and irrepressible shaker or a live and beautiful marionnette then she placed janet in the middle of the floor and performed the dance round her after the manner of vivien and merlin then came her supper which like its predecessors was a solid and absorbing meal then one more fairy story to magnetize her off and she danced and sang herself up stairs and if she first came to me in the morning with a halo round her head she seemed still to retain it when i at last watched her kneeling in the little bedperfectly motionless with her hands placed together and her long lashes sweeping her cheeksto repeat two verses of a hymn which janet had taught her my nerves quivered a little when i saw that susan halliday had also been duly prepared for the night and had been put in the same attitude so far as her jointless anatomy permitted this being ended the doll and her mistress reposed together and only an occasional toss of the vigorous limbs or a stifled baby murmur would thenceforth prove through the darkened hours that the one figure had in it more of life than the other on the next morning kenmure and laura came back to us and i walked down to receive them at the boat i had forgotten howstriking was their appearance as they stood together his broad strong saxon look his manly bearing and clear blue eyes enhanced the fascination of her darker beauty america is full of the shortlived bloom and freshness of girlhood but it is a rare thing in ones life to see a beauty that really controls with a permanent charm one must remember such personal loveliness as one recalls some particular moonlight or sunset with a special and concentrated joy which the multiplicity of fainter impressions cannot disturb when in those days we used to read in petrarchs one hundred and twentythird sonnet that he had once beheld on earth angelic manners and celestial charms whose very remembrance was a delight and an affliction since it made all else appear but dream and shadow we could easily fancy that nature had certain permanent attributes which accompanied the name of laura our laura had that rich brunette beauty before which the mere snow and roses of the blonde must always seem wan and unimpassioned in the superb suffusions of her cheek there seemed to flow a tide of passions and powers that might have been tumultuous in a meaner woman but over which in her the clear and brilliant eyes and the sweet proud mouth presided in unbroken calm these superb tints implied resources only not a struggle with this torrent from the tropics in her veins she was the most equable person i ever saw and had a supreme and delicate goodsense which if not supplying the place of genius at least comprehended its work not intellectually gifted herself perhaps she seemed the cause of gifts in others and furnished the atmosphere in which all showed their best with the steady and thoughtful enthusiasm of her puritan ancestors she combined that charm which is so rare among their descendantsa grace which fascinated the humblest while it would have been just the same in the society of kings her person had the equipoise and symmetry of her mind while it had its separate points of beauty each a source of distinct and peculiar pleasureas the outline of her temples the white line that parted her nightblack hair the bend of her wrists the moulding of her fingertipsyet these details were lost in the overwhelming sweetness of her presence and the serene atmosphere that she diffused over all human life a few days passed rapidly by us we walked and rode and boated and read little marian came and went a living sunbeam a selfsufficing thing it was soon obvious that she was far less demonstrative toward her parents than toward me while her mother gracious to her as to all yet rarely caressed her and kenmure though habitually kind was inclined to ignore her existence and could scarcely tolerate that she should for one instant preoccupy his wife for laura he lived and she must live for him he had a studio which i rarely entered and marian never though laura was almost constantly there and after the first cordiality was past i observed that their daily expeditions were always arranged for only two the weather was beautiful and they led the wildest outdoor life cruising all day or all night among the islands regardless of hours and almost of health no matter kenmure liked it and what he liked she loved when at home they were chiefly in the studio he painting modelling poetizing perhaps and she inseparably united with him in all it was very beautiful this unworldly and passionate love and i could have borne to be omitted in their daily plans since little marian was left to mesave that it seemed so strange to omit her also besides there grew to be something a little oppressive in this peculiar atmosphere it was like living in a greenhouse yet they always spoke in the simplest way of this absorbing passion as of something about which no reticence was needed it was too sacred not to be mentioned it would be wrong not to utter freely to all the world what was doubtless the best thing the world possessed thus kenmure made laura his model in all his art not to coin her into wealth or famehe would have scorned it he would have valued fame and wealth only as instruments for proclaiming her looking simply at these two lovers then it was plain that no human union could be more noble or stainless yet so far as others were concerned it sometimes seemed to me a kind of duplex selfishness so profound and so undisguised as to make one shudder is it i asked myself at such moments a great consecration or a great crime but something must be allowed perhaps for my own private dissatisfactions in marians behalf i had easily persuaded janet to let me have a peep every night at my darling as she slept and once i was surprised to find laura sitting by the small white bed graceful and beautiful as she always was she never before had seemed to me so lovely for she never had seemed quite like a mother but i could not demand a sweeter look of tenderness than that with which she now gazed upon her child little marian lay with one brown plump hand visible from its full white sleeve while the other nestled half hid beneath the sheet grasping a pair of blue morocco shoes the last acquisition of her favorite doll drooping from beneath the pillow hung a handful of scarlet poppies which the child had wished to place under her head in the very superfluous project of putting herself to sleep thereby her soft brown hair was scattered on the sheet her black lashes lay motionless upon the olive cheeks laura wished to move her that i might see her the better you will wake her exclaimed i in alarm wake this little dormouse laura lightly answered impossible and twining her arms about her the young mother lifted the child from the bed three or four times in succession while the healthy little creature remained utterly undisturbed breathing the same quiet breath i watched laura with amazement she seemed transformed she gayly returned my eager look and then seeming suddenly to penetrate its meaning cast down her eyes while the color mounted into her cheeks you thought she said almost sternly that i did not love my childno i said half untruthfully i can hardly wonder she continued more sadly for it is only what i have said to myself a thousand times sometimes i think that i have lived in a dream and one that few share with me i have questioned others and never yet found a woman who did not admit that her child was more to her in her secret soul than her husband what can they mean such a thought is foreign to my very nature why separate the two i asked i must separate them in thought she answered with the air of one driven to bay by her own selfreproaching i had like other young girls my dream of love and marriage unlike all the rest i believe i found my visions fulfilled the reality was more than the imagination and i thought it would be so with my love for my child the first cry of that baby told the difference to my ear i knew it all from that moment the bliss which had been mine as a wife would never be mine as a mother if i had not known what it was to adore my husband i might have been content with my love for marian but look at that exquisite creature as she lies there asleep and then think that i her mother should desert her if she were dying for aught i know at one word from him your feeling does not seem natural i said hardly knowing what to answer what good does it serve to know that she said defiantly i say it to myself every day once when she was ill and was given back to me in all the precious helplessness of babyhood there was such a strange sweetness in it i thought the charm might remain but it vanished when she could run about once more and she is such a healthy selfreliant little thing added laura glancing toward the bed with a momentary look of motherly pride that seemed strangely out of place amid these selfdenunciations i wish her to be so she added the best service i can do for her is to teach her to stand alone and at some day continued the beautiful woman her whole face lighting up with happiness she may love as i have loved and your husband i said after a pausedoes your feeling represent his my husband she said lives for his genius as he should you that know him why do you ask and his heart i said half frightened at my own temerity heart she answered he loves me her color mounted higher yet she had a look of pride almost of haughtiness all else seemed forgotten she had turned away from the childs little bed as if it had no existence it flashed upon me that something of the poison of her artificial atmosphere was reaching her already kenmures step was heard in the hall and with fire in her eyes she hastened to meet him i found myself actually breathing more freely after the departure of that enchanting woman in danger of perishing inwardly i said to myself in an air too lavishly perfumed bending over marian i wondered if it were indeed possible that a perfectly healthy life had sprung from that union too intense and too absorbed yet i had often noticed that the child seemed to wear the temperaments of both her parents as a kind of playful disguise and to peep at you now out of the one now from the other showing that she had her own individual life behind as if by some infantine instinct the darling turned in her sleep and came unconsciously nearer me with a halffeeling of selfreproach i drew around my neck inch by inch the little arms that tightened with a delicious thrill and so i half reclined there till i myself dozed and the watchful janet looking in warned me away crossing the entry to my own chamber i heard kenmure and laura down stairs but i knew that i should be superfluous and felt that i was sleepy i had now indeed become always superfluous when they were together though never when they were apart even they must be separated sometimes and then each sought me in order to discourse about the other kenmure showed me every sketch he had ever made of laura there she was through all the range of her beautythere she was in clay in cameo in pencil in watercolor in oils he showed me also his poems and at last a longer one for which pencil and graver had alike been laid aside all these he kept in a great cabinet she had brought with her to their housekeeping and it seemed to me that he also treasured every flower she had dropped every slender glove she had worn every ribbon from her hair i could not wonder seeing his passion as it was who would not thrill at the touch of some such slight memorial of mary of scotland or of heloise and what was all the regal beauty of the past to him he found every room adorned when she was in it empty when she had gonesave that the trace of her was still left on everything and all appeared but as a garment she had worn it seemed that even her great mirror must retain film over film each reflection of her least movement the turning of her head the ungloving of her hand strange that with all this intoxicating presence she yet led a life so free from self so simple so absorbed that all trace of consciousness was excluded and she was as free from vanity as her own child as we were once thus employed in the studio i asked kenmure abruptly if he never shrank from the publicity he was thus giving laura madame recamier was not quite pleased i said that canova had modelled her bust even from imagination do you never shrink from permitting irreverent eyes to look on lauras beauty think of men as you know them would you give each ofthem her miniature perhaps to go with them into scenes of riot and shame would to heaven i could said he passionately what else could save them if that did not god lets his sun shine on the evil and on the good but the evil need it most there was a pause and then i ventured to ask him a question that had been many times upon my lips unspoken does it never occur to you i said that laura cannot live on earth forever you cannot disturb me about that he answered not sadly but with a set stern look as if fencing for the hundredth time against an antagonist who was foredoomed to be his master in the end laura will outlive me she must outlive me i am so sure of it that every time i come near her i pray that i may not be paralyzed and die outside her arms yet in any event what can i do but what i am doingdevote my whole soul to the perpetuation of her beauty it is my only dreamto recreate her through art what else is worth doing it is for this i have triedthrough sculpture through painting through verseto depict her as she is thus far i have failed why have i failed is it because i have not lived a life sufficiently absorbed in her or is it that there is no permitted way by which after god has reclaimed her the tradition of her perfect loveliness may be retained on earth the blinds of the piazza doorway opened the sweet seaair came in the low and level rays of yellow sunset entered as softly as if the breeze were their chariot and softer and stiller and sweeter than light or air little marian stood on the threshold she had been in the fields with janet who had woven for her breezeblown hair a wreath of the wild gerardia blossoms whose purple beauty had reminded the good scotchwoman of her own native heather in her arms the child bore like a little gleaner a great sheaf of graceful goldenrod as large as her grasp could bear in all the artists visions he had seen nothing so aerial so lovely in all his passionate portraitures of his idol he had delineated nothing so like to her marians cheeks mantled with rich and winelike tints her hair took a halo from the sunbeams her lips parted over the little milkwhite teeth she looked at us with her mothers eyes i turned to kenmure to see if he could resist the influence he scarcely gave her a glance go marian he said not impatientlyfor he was too thoroughly courteous ever to be ungracious even to a childbut with a steady indifference that cut me with more pain than if he had struck her the sun dropped behind the horizon the halo faded from the shining hair and every ray of light from the childish face there came in its place that deep wondering sadness which is more touching than any maturer sorrowjust as a childs illness melts our hearts more than that of man or woman it seems so premature and so plaintive she turned away it was the very first time i had ever seen the little face drawn down or the tears gathering in the eyes by some kind providence the mother coming in flushed and beautiful with walking met marian on the piazza and caught the little thing in her arms with unwonted tenderness it was enough for the elastic child after one moment of such bliss she could go to janet go anywhere and when the same graceful presence came in to us in the studio we also could ask no more we had music and moonlight and were happy the atmosphere seemed more human less unreal going up stairs at last i looked in at the nursery and found my pet rather flushed and i fancied that she stirred uneasily it passed whatever it was for next morning she came in to wake me looking as usual as if a new heaven and earth had been coined purposely for her since she went to sleep we had our usual long and important discoursethis time tending to protracted narrative of the mothergoose description until if it had been possible for any human being to be late for breakfast in that house we should have been the offenders but she ultimately went downstairs on my shoulder and as kenmure and laura were already out rowing the baby put me in her own place sat in her mothers chair and ruled me with a rod of iron how wonderful was the instinct by which this little creature who so seldom heard one word of parental severity or parental fondness knew so thoroughly the language of both had i been the most depraved of children or the most angelic i could not have been more sternly excluded from the sugarbowl or more overwhelmed with compensating kisses later on that day while little marian was taking the very profoundest nap that ever a baby was blessed with she had a pretty way of dropping asleep in unexpected corners of the house like a kitten i somehow strayed into a confidential talk with janet about her mistress i was rather troubled to find that all her loyalty was for laura with nothing left for kenmure whom indeed she seemed to regard as a sort of objectionable altar on which her darlings were being sacrificed when she came to particulars certain stray fears of my own were confirmed it seemed that lauras constitution was not fit janet averred to bear these irregular hours early and late and she plaintively dwelt on the untasted oatmeal in the morning the insufficient luncheon the precarious dinner the excessive walking and boating the evening damps there was coming to be a look about laura such as her mother had who died at thirty as for marianbut here the complaint suddenly stopped it would have required far stronger provocation to extract from the faithful soul one word that might seem to reflect on marians mother another year and her forebodings had come true it is needless to dwell on the interval since then i have sometimes felt a regret almost insatiable in the thought that i should have been absent while all that gracious loveliness was fading and dissolving like a cloud and yet at other times it has appeared a relief to think that laura would ever remain to me in the fulness of her beauty not a tint faded not a lineament changed with all my efforts i arrived only in time to accompany kenmure home at night after the funeral service we paused at the door of the empty househow empty i hesitated but kenmure motioned to me to follow him inwe passed through the hall and went up stairs janet met us at the head of the stairway and asked me if i would go in to look at little marian who was sleeping i begged kenmure to go also but he refused almost savagely and went on with heavy step into lauras deserted room almost the moment i entered the childs chamber she waked up suddenly looked at me and said i know you you are my friend she never would call me her cousin i was always her friend then she sat up in bed with her eyes wide open and said as if stating a problem which had been put by for my solution i should like to see my mother how our hearts are rent by the unquestioning faith of children when they come to test the love that has so often worked what seemed to them miraclesand ask of it miracles indeed i tried to explain to her the continued existence of her mother and she listened to it as if her eyes drank in all that i could say and more but the apparent distance between earth and heaven baffled her baby mind as it so often and so sadly baffles the thoughts of us elders i wondered what precise change seemed to her to have taken place this allfascinating laura whom she adored and who had yet never been to her what other women are to their darlingsdid heaven seem to put her farther off or bring her more near i could never know the healthy child had no morbid questionings and as she had come into the world to be a sunbeam she must not fail of that mission she was kicking about the bed by this time in her nightgown and holding her pink little toes in all sorts of difficult attitudes when she suddenly said looking me full in the face if my mother was so high up that she had her feet upon a star do you think that i could see her this astronomical apotheosis startled me for a moment but i said unhesitatingly yes feeling sure that the lustrous eyes that looked in mine could certainly see as far as dantes when beatrice was transferred from his side to the highest realm of paradise i put my head beside hers upon the pillow and stayed till i thought she was asleep i then followed kenmure into lauras chamber it was dusk but the aftersunset glow still bathed the room with imperfect light and he lay upon the bed his hands clenched over his eyes there was a deep bowwindow where laura used to sit and watch us sometimes when we put off in the boat her aeolian harp was in the casement breaking its heart in music a delicate handkerchief was lodged between the cushions of the windowseat the very handkerchief she used to wave in summer days long gone the white boats went sailing beneath the evening light children shouted and splashed in the water a song came from a yacht a steamwhistle shrilled from the receding steamer but she for whom alone those little signs of life had been dear and precious would henceforth be as invisible to our eyes as if time and space had never held her and the young moon and the evening star seemed but empty things unless they could pilot us to some world where the splendor of her loveliness could match their own twilight faded evening darkened and still kenmure lay motionless until his strong form grew in my moody fancy to be like some carving of michel angelos more than like a living man and when he at last startled me by speaking it was with a voice so far off and so strange it might almost have come wandering down from the century when michel angelo lived you are right he said i have been living in a fruitless dream it has all vanished the absurdity of speaking of creative art with all my lifelong devotion i have created nothing i have kept no memorial of her presence nothing to perpetuate the most beautiful of lives before i could answer the door came softly open and there stood in the doorway a small white figure holding aloft a lighted taper of pure alabaster it was marian in her little nightdress with the loose blue wrapper trailing behind her let go in the effort to hold carefully the doll susan halliday robed also for the night may i come in said the child kenmure was motionless at first then looking over his shoulder said merely what janet said continued marian in her clear and methodical way that my mother was up in heaven and would help god hear my prayers at any rate but if i pleased i could come and say them by you a shudder passed over kenmure then he turned away and put his hands over his eyes she waited for no answer but putting down the candlestick in her wonted careful manner upon a chair she began to climb upon the bed lifting laboriously one little rosy foot then another still dragging after her with great effort the doll nestling at her fathers breast i saw her kneel once my mother put her arm round me when i said my prayers she made this remark under her breath less as a suggestion it seemed than as the simple statement of a fact instantly i saw kenmures arm move and grasp her with that strong and gentle touch of his which i had so often noticed in the studioa touch that seemed quiet as the approach of fate and equally resistless i knew him well enough to understand that iron adoption he drew her toward him her soft hair was on his breast she looked fearlessly into his eyes and i could hear the little prayer proceeding yet in so low a whisper that i could not catch one word she was infinitely solemn at such times the darling and therewas always something in her low clear tone through all her prayings and philosophizings which was strangely like her mothers voice sometimes she paused as if to ask a question and at every answer i could see her fathers arm tighten the moments passed the voices grew lower yet the candle flickered and went out the doll slid to the ground marian had drifted away upon a vaster ocean than that whose music lulled her from withoutupon that sea whose waves are dreams the night was wearing on the lights gleamed from the anchored vessels the water rippled serenely against the low seawall the breeze blew gently in marians baby breathing grew deeper and more tranquil and as all the sorrows of the weary earth might be imagined to exhale themselves in spring through the breath of violets so i prayed that it might be with kenmures burdened heart through hers by degrees the strong mans deeper respirations mingled with those of the child and their two separate beings seemed merged and solved into identity as they slumbered breast to breast beneath the golden and quiet stars i passed by without awaking them and i knew that the artist had attained his dreamin a wherry we have a phrase in oldport what newyorkers call poverty to be reduced to a pony phaeton in consequence of a november gale i am reduced to a similar state of destitution from a sailboat to a wherry and like others of the deserving poor i have found many compensations in my humbler condition which is the more enjoyable rowing or sailing if you sail before the wind there is the glorious vigor of the breeze that fills your sails you get all of it you have room for and a ship of the line could do no more indeed your very nearness to the water increases the excitement since the water swirls and boils up as it unites in your wake and seems to clutch at the low stern of your sailboat and to menace the hand that guides the helm or if you beat to windward it is as if your boat climbed a liquid hill but did it with bounding and dancing like a child there is the plash of the lighter ripples against the bow and the thud of the heavier waves while the same blue water is now transformed to a cool jet of white foam over your face and now to a dark whirlpool in your lee sailing gives a sense of prompt command since by a single movement of the tiller you effect so great a change of direction or transform motion into rest there is therefore a certain magic in it but on the other hand there is in rowing a more direct appeal to your physical powers you do not evade or cajole the elements by a cunning device of keel and canvas you meet them manfashion and subdue them the motion of the oars is like the strong motion of a birds wings to sail a boat is to ride upon an eagle but to row is to be an eagle i prefer rowingat least till i can afford another sailboat what is a good day for rowing almost any day that is good for living living is not quite agreeable in the midst of a tornado or an equinoctial storm neither is rowing there are days when rowing is as toilsome and exhausting a process as is bunyans idea of virtue while there are other days like the present when it seems a mere oriental passiveness and the forsaking of worksjust an excuse to nature for being out among her busy things for even at this stillest of hours there is far less repose in nature than we imagine what created thing can seem more patient than yonder kingfisher on the seawall yet as we glide near him we shall see that no creature can be more full of concentrated life all his nervous system seems on edge every instant he is rising or lowering on his feet the tail vibrates the neck protrudes or shrinks again the feathers ruffle the crest dilates he talks to himself with an impatient chirr then presently hovers and dives for a fish then flies back disappointed we say free as birds but their lives are given over to arduous labors and so when our condition seems most dreamy our observing faculties are sometimes desperately on the alert and we find afterwards to our surprise that we have missed nothing the best observer in the end is not he who works at the microscope or telescope most unceasingly but he whose whole nature becomes sensitive and receptive drinking in everything like a sponge that saturates itself with all floating vapors and odors though it seems inert and unsuspicious until you press it and it tells the tale most men do their work out of doors and their dreaming at home and those whose work is done at home need something like a wherry in which to dream out of doors on a squally day with the wind northwest it is a dream of action and to round yonder point against an ebbing tide makes you feel as if you were grant before richmond when you put about you gallop like sheridan and the winds and waves become a cavalry escort on other days all elements are hushed into a dream of peace and you look out upon those once stormy distances as landseers sheep look into the mouth of the empty cannon on a dismantled fort these are the days for revery and your thoughts fly forth gliding without friction over this smooth expanse or rather they are like yonder pair of white butterflies that will flutter for an hour just above the glassy surface traversing miles of distance before they alight again by a happy trait of our midsummer these various phases of wind and water may often be included in a single day on three mornings out of four the wind blows northwest down our bay then dies to a calm before noon after an hour or two of perfect stillness you see the line of blue ripple coming up from the ocean till it conquers all the paler water and the southwest breeze sets in this middle zone of calm is like the noonday of the romans when they feared to speak lest the great god pan should be awakened while it lasts a thin aerial veil drops over the distant hills of conanicut then draws nearer and nearer till it seems to touch your boat the very nearest section of space being filled with a faint disembodied blueness like that which fills on winter days in colder regions the hollows of the snow sky and sea show but gradations of the same color and afford but modifications of the same element in this quietness yonder schooner seems not so much to lie at anchor in the water as to anchor the water so that both cease to move and though faint ripples may come and go elsewhere on the surface the vessel rests in this liquid island of absolute calm for there certainly is elsewhere a sort of motionless movement as keats speaks of a little noiseless noise among the leaves or as the summer clouds form and disappear without apparent wind and without prejudice to the stillness a man may lie in the profoundest trance and still be breathing and the very pulsations of the life of nature in these calm hours are to be read in these changing tints and shadows and ripples and in the miragebewildered outlines of the islands in the bay it is this incessant shifting of relations this perpetual substitution of fantastic for real values this inability to trust your own eye or ear unless the mind makes its own correctionsthat gives such an inexhaustible attraction to life beside the ocean the seachange comes to you without your waiting to be drowned you must recognize the working of your own imagination and allow for it when for instance the seafog settles down around us at nightfall it sometimes grows denser and denser till it apparently becomes more solid than the pavements of the town or than the great globe itself and when the fogwhistles go wailing on through all the darkened hours they seem to be signalling not so much for a lost ship as for a lost island how unlike are those weird and gloomy nights to this sunny noon when i rest my oars in this sheltered bay where a small lagoon makes in behind coasters harbor island and the very last breath and murmur of the ocean are left outside the coming tide steals to the shore in waves so light they are a mere shade upon the surface till they break and then die speechless for one that has avoice and even those rare voices are the very most confidential and silvery whispers in which nature ever spoke to man the faintest summer insect seems resolute and assured beside them and yet it needs but an indefinite multiplication of these sounds to make up the thunder of the surf it is so still that i can let the wherry drift idly along the shore and can watch the life beneath the water the small fry cluster and evade between me and the brink the halftranslucent shrimp glides gracefully undisturbed or glances away like a flash if you but touch the surface the crabs waddle or burrow the smaller species mimicking unconsciously the hue of the soft green seaweed and the larger looking like motionless stones covered with barnacles and decked with fringing weeds i am acquainted with no better darwinian than the crab and however clumsy he may be when taken from his own element he has a free and floating motion which is almost graceful in his own yielding and buoyant home it is so with all wild creatures but especially with those of water and air a gull is not reckoned an especially graceful bird but yonder i see one snowy white that has come to fish in this safe lagoon and it dips and rises on its errands as lightly as a butterfly or a swallow beneath that neighboring causeway the waterrats run over the stones lithe and eager and alert the body carried low the head raised now and then like a hounds the tail curving gracefully and aiding the poise now they are running to the water as if to drink now racing for dear life along the edge now fairly swimming then devoting an interval to reflection like squirrels then again searching over a pile of seaweed and selecting some especial tuft which is carried with long sinuous leaps to the unseen nest indeed man himself is graceful in his unconscious and direct employments the poise of a fisherman for instance the play of his arm the cast of his line or netthese take the eye as do the stealthy movements of the hunter the fine attitudes of the woodchopper the grasp of the sailor on the helm a haystack and a boat are always picturesque objects and so are the men who are at work to build or use them so is yonder stakenet glistening in the noonday lightthe innumerable meshes drooping in soft arches from the high stakes and the line of floats stretching shoreward like tiny steppingstones two or three rowboats are gathered round it with fishermen in red or blue shirts while one white sailboat hovers near and i have looked down on our beach in spring at sunset and watched them drawing nets for the young herring when the rough men looked as graceful as the nets they drew and the horseman who directed might have been redgauntlet on the solway sands i suppose it is from this look of natural fitness that a windmill is always such an appropriate object by the seashore it is simply a fourmasted schooner stranded on a hilltop and adapting itself to a new sphere of duty it can have needed but a slight stretch of invention in some seaman to combine these lofty vans and throw over them a few remodelled sails the principle of their motion is that by which a vessel beats to windward the miller spreads or reefs his sails like a sailorreducing them in a high wind to a mere pigeonwing as it is called two or three feet in length or in some cases even scudding under bare poles the whole structure vibrates and creaks under rapid motion like a mast and the angry vans disappointed of progress are ready to grind to powder all that comes within their grasp as they revolve hopelessly in this sea of air when the sun grows hot i like to take refuge in a sheltered nook beside goat island lighthouse where the wharf shades me and the resonant plash of waters multiplies itself among the dark piles increasing the delicious sense of coolness while the noonday bells ring twelve i take my rest round the corner of the pier the fishingboats come gliding in generally with a boy asleep forward and a weary man at the helm one can almost fancy that the boat itself looks weary having been out since the early summer sunrise in contrast to this expression of labor ended the white pleasureboats seem but to be taking a careless stroll by water while a skiff full of girls drifts idly along the shore amid laughter and screaming and much aimless splash more resolute and businesslike the boys row their boat far up the bay then i see a sudden gleam of white bodies and then the boat is empty and the surrounding water is sprinkled with black and bobbing heads the steamboats look busier yet as they go puffing by at short intervals and send long waves up to my retreat and then some schooner sails in full of life with a white ripple round her bows till she suddenly rounds to drops anchor and is still opposite me on the landward side of the bay the green banks slope to the water on yonder cool piazza there is a young mother who swings her baby in the hammock or a whiterobed figure pacing beneath the trailing vines peace and lotuseating on shore on the water even in the stillest noon there are life and sparkle and continual change one of those fishermen whose boats have just glided to their moorings is to me a far more interesting person than any of his mates though he is perhaps the only one among them with whom i have never yet exchanged a word there is good reason for it he has been deaf and dumb since boyhood he is reported to be the boldest sailor among all these daring men he is the last to retreat before the coming storm the first after the storm to venture through the white and whirling channels between dangerous ledges to which others give a wider berth i do not wonder at this for think how much of the awe and terror of the tempest must vanish if the ears be closed the ominous undertone of the waves on the beach and the muttering thunder pass harmless by him how infinitely strange it must be to have the sight of danger but not the sound fancy such a deprivation in war for instance where it is the sounds after all that haunt the memory the longest the rifles crack the irregular shots of skirmishers the long roll of alarm the roar of great guns this man would have missed them all were a broadside from an enemys gunboat to be discharged above his head he would not hear it he would only recognize by some jarring of his other senses the fierce concussion of the air how much deeper seems his solitude than that of any other lone fisher on the lonely sea yet all such things are comparative and while the others contrast that wavetossed isolation with the cheeriness of home his home is silent too he has a wife and children they all speak but he hears not their prattle or their complaints he summons them with his fingers as he summons the fishes and they are equally dumb to him has he a special sympathy with those submerged and voiceless things dunfish in the old newspapers were often called dumbd fish and they perchance come to him as to one of their kindred they may have learned like other innocent things to accept this defect of utterance and even imitate it i knew a deafanddumb woman whose children spoke and heard but while yet too young for words they had learned that their mother was not to be reached in that way they never cried or complained before her and when most excited would only whisper her baby ten months old if disturbed in the nightwould creep to her and touch her lips to awaken her but would make no noise one might fancy that all men who have an agonizing sorrow or a fearful secret would be drawn by irresistible attraction into the society of the deaf and dumb what awful passions might not be whispered what terror safely spoken in the charmed circle round yonder silent boata circle whose centre is a human life which has not all the susceptibilities of life a confessional where even the priest cannot hear would it not relieve sorrow to express itself even if unheeded what more could one ask than a dumb confidant and if deaf also so much the safer to be sure he would give you neither absolution nor guidance he could render nothing in return save a look or a clasp of the hand nor can the most gifted or eloquent friendship do much more ah but suddenly the thought occurs suppose that the defect of hearing as of tongue were liable to be loosed by an overmastering emotion and that by startling him with your hoarded confidence you were to break the spell the hint is too perilous let us row away a few strokes take us to the halfsubmerged wreck of a limeschooner that was cut to the waters edge by a collision in a gale twelve months ago the water kindled the lime the cable was cut the vessel drifted ashore and sunk still blazing at this little beach when i saw her at sunset the masts had been cut away and the flames held possession on board fire was working away in the cabin like a live thing and sometimes glared out of the hatchway anon it clambered along the gunwale like a schoolboy playing and the waves chased it as in play just a flicker of flame then a wave would reach up to overtake it then the flames would be or seem to be where the water had been and finally as the vessel lay careened the waves took undisturbed possession of the lower gunwale and the flames of the upper so it burned that day and night part red with fire part black with soaking and now twelve months have made all its visible parts look dry and white till it is hard to believe that either fire or water has ever touched it it lies over on its bare knees and a single knee torn from the others rests imploringly on the shore as if that had worked its way to land and perished in act of thanksgiving at low tide one half the frame is lifted high in air like a dead tree in the forest perhaps all other elements are tenderer in their dealings with what is intrusted to them than is the air fire at least destroys what it has ruined earth is warm and loving and it moreover conceals water is at least caressingit laps the greater part of this wreck with protecting waves covers with seaweeds all that it can reach and protects with incrusting shells even beyond its grasp it tosses soft pendants of moss that twine like vinetendrils or sway in the wind it mellows harsh colors into beauty and ruskin grows eloquent over the wavewashed tint of some tarry weatherbeaten boat but air is pitiless it dries and stiffens all outline and bleaches all color away so that you can hardly tell whether these ribs belonged to a ship or an elephant and yet there is a certain cold purity in the shapes it leaves and the birds it sends to perch upon these timbers are a more graceful company than lobsters or fishes after all there is something sublime in that sepulture of the parsees who erect near every village a dokhma or tower of silence upon whose summit they may bury their dead in air thus widely may ones thoughts wander from a summer boat but the season for rowing is a long one and far outlasts in oldport the stay of our annual guests sometimes in autumnal mornings i glide forth over water so still it seems as if saturated by the indiansummer with its own indefinable calm the distant islands lift themselves on white pedestals of mirage the cloudshadows rest softly on conanicut and what seems a similar shadow on the nearer slopes of fort adams is in truth but a mounted battery drilling which soon moves and slides across the hazy hill like a cloud i hear across nearly a mile of water the faint sharp orders and the sonorous blare of the trumpet that follows each command the horsemen gallop and wheel suddenly the band within the fort strikes up for guardmounting and i have but to shut my eyes to be carried back to warlike days that passed bywas it centuries ago meantime i float gradually towards brentons cove the lawns that reach to the waters edge were never so gorgeously green in any summer and the departure of the transient guests gives to these lovely places an air of cool seclusion when fashion quits them the imagination is ready to move in an agreeable sense of universal ownership comes over the winterstaying mind in oldport i like to keep up this little semblance of habitation on the part of our human birds of passage it is very pleasant to me and perhaps even pleasanter to them that they should call these emerald slopes their own for a month or two but when they lock the doors in autumn the ideal key reverts into my hands and it is evident that they have only been tenants by the courtesy in the fine legal phrase provided they stay here long enough to attend to their lawns and pay their taxes i am better satisfied than if these estates were left to me the whole year round the tide takes the boat nearer to the fort the horsemen ride more conspicuously with swords and trappings that glisten in the sunlight while the white fetlocks of the horses twinkle in unison as they move one troophorse without a rider wheels and gallops with the rest and seems to revel in the free motion here also the tide reaches or seems to reach the very edge of the turf and when the light battery gallops this way it is as if it were charging on my floating fortress upon the other side is a scene of peace and a fisherman sings in his boat as he examines the floats of his stakenet hand over hand a white gull hovers close above him and a dark one above the horsemen fit emblems of peace and war the slightest sounds the rattle of an oar the striking of a hoof against a stone are borne over the water to an amazing distance as if the calm bay amid its seeming quiet were watchful of the slightest noise but look in a moment the surface is rippled the sky is clouded a swift change comes over the fitful mood of the season the water looks colder and deeper the greensward assumes a chilly darkness the troopers gallop away to their stables and the fisherman rows home that indefinable expression which separates autumn from summer creeps almost in an instant over all soon even upon this isle of peace it will be winter each season as winter returns i try in vain to comprehend this wonderful shifting of expression that touches even a thing so essentially unchanging as the sea how delicious to all the senses is the summer foam above yonder rock in winter the foam is thesame the sparkle as radiant the hue of the water scarcely altered and yet the effect is by comparison cold heavy and leaden it is like that mysterious variation which chiefly makes the difference between one human face and another we call it by vague names and cannot tell in what it lies we only know that when expression changes all is gone no warmth of color no perfection of outline can supersede those subtile influences which make one face so winning that all human affection gravitates to its spell and another so cold or repellent that it dwells forever in loneliness and no passionate heart draws near i can fancy the ocean beating in vague despair against its shores in winter and moaning i am as beautiful as restless as untamable as ever why are my cliffs left desolate why am i not loved as i was loved in summermadam delias expectations madam delia sat at the door of her showtent which as she discovered too late had been pitched on the wrong side of the parade it was election day in oldport and there must have been a thousand people in the public square there were really more than the four policemen on duty could properly attend to so that half of them had leisure to step into madam delias tent and see little gerty and the rattlesnakes it was past the appointed hour but the exhibition had never yet been known to open for less than ten spectators and even the addition of the policemen only made eight so the mistress of the show sat in resolute expectation a little defiant of the human race it was her thirteenth annual tour and she knew mankind surely there were people enough surely they had money enough surely they were easily pleased they gathered in crowds to hear crazy mrs green denouncing the city government for sending her to the poorhouse in a wagon instead of a carriage they thronged to inspect the load of hay that was drawn by the two horses whose harness had been cut to pieces and then repaired by denisons eureka cement they all bought whips with that unfailing readiness which marks a rural crowd they bought packages of leadpencils with a dollar so skilfully distributed through every six parcels that the oldest purchaser had never found more than ten cents in his they let the man who cured neuralgia rub his magic curative on their foreheads and allowed the man who cleaned watchchains to dip theirs in the purifying powder they twirled the magic arrow which never by any chance rested at the corner compartments where the gold watches and the heavy bracelets were piled but perpetually recurred to the side stations and indicated only a beggarly prize of indiarubber sleevebuttons they bought ten cents worth of jewelry obtaining a mingled treasure of two breastpins a plain gold ring an enamelled ring and a piece of california gold but still no added prizes in the human lottery fell to the showtent of madam delia as time went on and the day grew warmer the crowd grew visibly less enterprising and business flagged the man with the liftingmachine pulled at the handles himself a gratuitous exhibition before a circle of boys now penniless the man with the metallic polish dipped and redipped his own watchchain the men at the booths sat down to lunch upon the least presentable of their own pies the proprietor of the magic arrow who had already two large breastpins on his dirty shirt selected from his own board another to grace his coatcollar as if thereby to summon back the waning fortunes of the day but madam delia still sat at her post undaunted she kept her eye on two sauntering militiamen in uniform but they only read her sign and seated themselves on the curbstone to smoke then a stout black soldier came in sight but he turned and sat down at a table to eat oysters served by a vast and smiling matron of his own race but even this though perhaps the most wholly cheerful exhibition that the day yielded had no charms for madam delia her own dinner was ordered at the tavern after the morning show and where is the human being who does not resent the spectacle of another human being who dines earlier than himself it grew warmer so warm that the canvas walls of the tent seemed to grasp a certain armful of heat and keep it inexorably in so warm that the outofdoor man was dozing as he leaned against the tentstake and only recovered himself at the sound of madam delias penetrating voice and again began to summon people in though there was nobody within hearing it was so warm that mr de marsan born bangs the wedded husband of madam delia dozed as he walked up and down the sidewalk and had hardly voice enough to testify as an unconcerned spectator to the value of the show only the unwearied zeal of the showwoman defied alike thermometer and neglect she kept her eye on everythingon old bill as he fed the monkeys within on monsieur comstock as he hung the trapeze for the performance on the little girls as they tried to peddle their songs on the sleepy outofdoor man and on the people who did not draw near if she could she would have played all the parts in her own small company and would have put the inexhaustible nervous energies of her own new england nature she was born at meddibemps state of maine into all apart from this potent stimulus not a soul in the establishment save little gerty possessed any energy whatever old bill had unfortunately never learned total abstinence from the wild animals among which he had passed his life monsieur comstocks brains had chiefly run into his arms and legs and mr de marsan the nominal head of the establishment was a peaceful pennsylvanian who was wont to move as slowly as if he were one of those processions that take a certain number of hours to pass a given point this madam delia understood and expected he was an innocent who was to be fed clothed and directed but his languor was no excuse for the manifest feebleness of the outofdoor man that man dont know how to talk no more n nothin at all said madam delia reproachfully to the large policeman who stood by her he never speaks up bold to nobody why dont he tell em whats inside the tent i dont want him to say no more n the truth but he might tell that tell em about gerty you nincum tell em about the snakes tell em what comstock is t aint the real original comstock this to the policeman its only another that used to perform with him in comstock brothers this one cant swaller so we leave out the knives wheres t other said the sententious policeman whose ears were always open for suspicious disappearances didnt you hear cried the incredulous lady scattered gone went off one day with a box of snakes and two monkeys come now you must have heard we had a sight of trouble payin detectives what for a looking fellow was he said the policeman dark complected was the reply black mustache he understood his business i tell you now swallered five or six knives to onst and give good satisfaction to any audience it was him that brought us gerty and annethats the other little girl i didnt know as they was his children and didnt know as they was but one day he said he got em from an old woman in new york and thatwas all he knew theyre smart said the man whom gerty had just coaxed into paying three cents instead of two for number six of the singers journala dingy little sheet containing a song about a fat policeman which she had brought to his notice youd better believe it said madam delia proudly at least gerty is anne aint i tell em gerty knows enough for both anne dont know nothin and what she does know she dont know sartin all she can do is just to hang on shes the strongest and she does the heavy business on the trapeze and parallel bars is gerty good on that said the public guardian i tell you said the head of the establishmentgo and dress children five minutes all this time madam delia had been taking occasional fees from the tardy audience had been making change detecting counterfeit currency and discerning at a glance the impostures of one deceitful boy who claimed to have gone out on a check and lost it at last stephen blake and his little sister entered and the house was regarded as full these two revellers had drained deep the cup of electionday excitement they had twirled all the arrows bought all the jewelry inspected all the colored eggs blown at all the spirometers and tasted all the eggpop which the festal day required these delights exhausted they looked round for other worlds to conquer saw madam delia at her tentdoor and were conquered by her she did indeed look energetic and comely as she sat at the receipt of custom her smooth black hair relieved by gold earrings her cotton velvet sack by a white collar and her dark gingham dress by a cheap breastpin and by linen cuffs not very much soiled the black leather bag at her side had a welltodo look but all else in the establishment looked a little povertystricken the tent was made of very worn and soiled canvas and was but some twentyfive feet square there were no seats and the spectators sat on the grass there was a very small stage raised some six feet this was covered with some strips of old carpet and surrounded by a few old and tattered curtains through their holes you could easily see the lithe brown shoulders of the little girls as they put on their professional suits and on the other side monsieur comstock scarcely hidden by the drapery leaned against a crossbar and rested his chin upon his tattooed arms as he counted the spectators among these mr de marsan pacing slowly distributed copies of this programmethirteenth annual tour madam delias museum and variety combinationwill exhibit proclamation to the publicthe proprietors would say that they have abandoned the old and playedout practice of decorating the outer walls of all principal streets with flaming posters and handbills and have adopted the congenial and they trust successful plan of advertising with programmes giving a full and accurate description as now organized which will be distributed in hotels saloons factories workshops and all private dwellings by their special agents three days before the exhibition takes place madam delia with her pet snakes miss gerty the child wonder danseuse and contortionist will appear in her wonderful feats at each performance mons comstock the champion swordswallower will also exhibit his wonderful power of swallowing five swords measuring from to inches in length it is not so much the beauty of this feat that makes it so remarkable as its seeming impossibility master bobby the banjo soloist and burlesque comic acrobat by miss gerty and mons comstock madam delia the wonderful and original snaketamer with her pets measuring feet in length and weighing lbs a pet rattlesnake years of age captured on the prairies of illinois oldest on exhibition in connection with this exhibition there are anteaters african monkeys c cosmoramic stereoscopic scenes in the united states and other countries including a view of the funeral procession of president taylor which is alone worth the price of admission exhibition every halfhour during day and evening secure your seats early admission cents particular care will be taken and nothing shall occur to offend the most fastidious stephen and his little sister strolled about the tent meanwhile the final preparations went slowly on the few spectators teased the anteater in one corner or the first violin in another one or two young farmers boys were a little uproarious with eggpop and danced awkward breakdowns at the end of the tent then a cracked bell sounded and the curtain rose showing hardly more of the stage than was plainly visible before little gerty aged ten came in first all rumpled gauze and tarnished spangles to sing in a poor little voice feebler and shriller than the chattering of the monkeys she sang a song about the grecian bend and enacted the same walking round and round the stage whirling her tawdry finery then anne aged twelve came in as a boy and joined her both the girls had rather pretty features blue eyes and tightly curling hair both had pleasing faces but anne was solid and phlegmatic while gerty was keen and flexible as a weasel and almost as thin presently anne went out and reappeared as master bobby of the hills making love to gerty in that capacity through song and dance then gerty was transformed by the addition of a single scarf into a highland maid and danced a fling this quite gracefully to the music of two violins exeunt the children and enter madam delia and her pets the showwoman had laid aside her velvet sack and appeared with bare neck and arms over her shoulders hung a rattlesnake fifteen feet long while a smaller specimen curled from each hand the reptiles put their cold triangular faces against hers they touched her lips they squirmed around her she tied their tails together in elastic knots that soon undid they reared their heads aboveher black locks till she looked like a stage medusa then laid themselves lovingly on her shoulder and hissed at the audience then she lay down on the stage and pillowed her head on the writhing mass she opened her black bag and took out a tiny brown snake which she placidly transferred to her bosom then turned to a barrel into which she plunged her arm and drew out a black hissing coil of mingled heads and tails her keen goodnatured face looked cheerfully at the audience through it all and took away the feeling of disgust and something of the excitement of fear the lady and the pets retiring gertys hour of glory came she hated singing and only half enjoyed character dancing but in posturing she was in her glory dressed in soiled tights that showed every movement of her little body she threw herself upon the stage with a handspring then kissed her hand to the audience and followed this by a backsomerset then she touched her head by anslow effort to her heels then turned away put her palms to the ground raised her heels gradually in the air and in this inverted position kissed first one hand then the other to the spectators then she crossed the stage in a series of somersets then rolled back like a wheel then held a hoop in her two hands and put her whole slender body through it limb after limb then appeared monsieur comstock he threw a handspring and gave her his feet to stand upon she grasped them with her hands and inverted herself her feet pointing skyward then he resumed the ordinary attitude of rational beings and she lay on her back across his uplifted palms which supported her neck and feet then she curled herself backward around his waist almost touching head and heels indeed whatever the snakes had done to madam delia gerty seemed possessed with a wish to do to monsieur comstock all but the kissing then that eminent foreigner vanished and the odors of his pipe came faintly through the tattered curtain while anne entered to help gerty in the higher branches a double trapezejust two horizontal bars suspended at different heights by ropes and strapshad been swung from the tentroof gerty ascended to the upper bar hung from it by her hand then by her knees then by her feet then sat upon it leaned slowly backward suddenly dropped and as some children in the audience shrieked in terror she caught by her feet in the sideropes and came up smiling it was a part of the play then another trapeze was hung and was set swinging toward the first and gerty flung herself in triumph with varied somersets from one to the other while anne rattled the banjo below and sang i fly through the air with the greatest of ease a daring young man on the flying trapeeze then the child stopped to rest while all hands were clapped and only the unreverberating turf kept the feet from echoing also people flocked in from outside and madam delia was kept busy at the door then gerty came down to the lower bar while anne ascended the upper and hung to it solidly by her knees thus suspended she put out her hands to gerty who put her feet into them and hung headdownward there was a shuddering pause while the two children clung thus dizzily but the audience had seen enough of peril to lose all fear those straps are safe asked stephen of mr de marsan law bless you yes replied that pleasant functionary comstocks been on em precisely as he spoke one of the straps gave downward a little and then rested firm it was not a halfinch but it jarred the performers gerty im slipping cried anne we shall fall no we shant silly said the other quickly hold on comstock swing me the rope stephen blake sprang to the stage and swung her the rope by which they had climbed to the upper bar it fell short and gerty missed it anne screamed and slipped visibly you cant hold said gerty let go my feet let me drop youll be killed called anne slipping still more drop me i say shouted the resolute gerty while the whole audience rose in excitement instantly the hands of the elder girl opened and down fell gerty headforemost full twelve feet striking heavily on her shoulder while anne relieved of the weight recovered easily her position and slipped down into stephens arms she threw herself down beside the little comrade whose presence of mind had saved at least one of them o gerty are you killed she said i want delia gasped the child madam delia was at her side already having rushed from the door where a surging host of boys had already swept in gratis gerty writhed in pain stephen felt her collarbone and found it bent like a horseshoe and she fainted before she could be taken from the stage when restored she was quite exhausted and lay for days perfectly subdued and gentle sleeping most of the time during thesedays she had many visitors and mr de marsan had ample opportunity for the simple enjoyments of his life tobacco and conversation stephen blake and his sister came often and while she brought her small treasures to amuse gerty he freely pumped the proprietor madam delia had been in the snake business it appeared since early youth thirteen years ago she had been in de marsans employ for eight years before her marriage and his equal and lawful partner for five years since at first they had travelled as sideshow to a circus but that was not so good the way is you see said mr de marsan to take a place like providence thats a good showtown right along and pitch your tent and live there keepstill pays they say youd have to hire a piece of ground anywhere for five or six dollars a day and it dont cost much more by the week you can board for four or five dollars a week but if you board by the day its a dollar and a half to which words of practical wisdom stephen listened with pleased interest it was not so very many years since he had been young enough to wish to run away with a circus and by encouraging these simple confidences he brought round the conversation to the children but here he was met by a sheer absence of all information as to their antecedents the original and deceitful comstock had brought them and left them two years before madam delia had received flattering offers to take her snakes and gerty into circuses and large museums but she had refused for the childs own sake did gerty like it yes she would like to be posturing all day she could do anything she saw done she never needed to be taught nothin as mr de marsan asserted with vigorous accumulation of negatives he thought her father or mother must have been in the business she took to it so easily but she was just as smart at school in the winter and at everything else was the life good for her yes why not rough company and bad language they could hear worse talk every day in the street sometimes a feller would come in with too much liquor aboard the showman admitted and would begin to talk his nonsense but comstock wouldnt ask nothin better than to pitch such a feller out especially if he should sarce the little gals they were good little gals and delia set store by em when stephen and his sister went back that night to their kind hostesses miss martha and miss amy the soft hearts of those dear old ladies were melted in an instant by the story of gertys courage and selfsacrifice they had lived peacefully all their lives in that motherly old house by the bayside where successive generations had lived before them the painted tiles around the open fire looked as if their fops and fine ladies had stepped out of the spectator and the tatler the great mahogany chairs looked as hospitable as when the french officers were quartered in the house during the revolution and its quaker owner miss marthas granduncle had carried out a seat that the weary sentinel might sit down descended from one of those families of quaker beauties whom de lauzun celebrated they bore the memory of those romantic lives as something very sacred in hearts which perhaps held as genuine romances of their own miss marthas sweet face was softened by advancing deafness and by that gentle appealing look which comes when mind and memory grow a little dimmer though the loving nature knows no change sister amy says she meekly confessed that i am losing my memory but i do not care very much there are so few things worth remembering they kept house together in sweet accord and were indeed trained in the neat quaker ways so thoroughly that they always worked by the same methods in opinion and emotion they were almost duplicates yet the world holds no absolute and perfect correspondence and it is useless to affect to concealwhat was apparent to any intimate guestthat there was one domestic question on which perfect sympathy was wanting during their whole lives they had never been able to take precisely the same view of the best method of grinding indian meal miss martha preferred to have it from a windmill while miss amy was too conscientious to deny that she thought it better when prepared by a watermill she said firmly though gently that it seemed to her less gritty living their whole lives in this scarcely broken harmony by the margin of the bay they had long built together one castle in the air they had talked of it for many an hour by their evening fire and they had looked from their chamber windows toward the red light upon rose island to see if it were coming true this vision was that they were to awake some morning after an autumnal storm and to find an unknown vessel ashore behind the house without name or crew or passengers only there was to be one sleeping child with aristocratic features and a few yards of exquisite embroidery years had passed and their lives were waning without a glimpse of that precious waif of gentle blood once in an october night miss martha had been awakened by a crash and looking out had seen that their pier had been carried away and that a dark vessel lay stranded with her bowsprit in the kitchen window but daylight revealed the schooner polly lawton with a cargo of coal and the dream remained unfulfilled they had never revealed it except to each other moved by a natural sympathy miss martha went with stephen to see the injured child gerty lay asleep on a rather dingy little mattress with mr comstocks overcoat rolled beneath her head a days illness will commonly make even the coarsest child look refined and interesting and gertys physical organization was anything but coarse her pretty hair curled softly round her head her delicate profile was relieved against the rough dark pillow and the tips of her little pink ears could not have been improved by art though they might have been by soap and water warm tears came into miss marthas eyes which were quickly followed from corresponding fountains in madam delias thy own child said or rather signalled miss martha forming the letters softly with her lips stephen had his own reasons for leaving her to ask this question in all ignorance no maam said the showwoman not much adopteddoes thee know her parents this was similarly signalled no said madam delia rather coldly does thee suppose that they were and here miss martha stopped and the color came as suddenly and warmly to her cheeks as if monsieur comstock had offered to marry her and to settle upon her the snakes as exclusive property madam delia divined the question she had so often found herself trying to guess the social position of gertys parents i dont know as i know said she slowly whether you ought to know anythin about it but ill tell you what i know that childs folks she added mysteriously lived on quality hill lived where said miss martha breathless upper crust said the other defining her symbol still further no middlins to em genteel as anybody just look here madam delia unclasped her leather bag brought forth from it a mass of checks and tickets some birdseed a small whip a dogcollar and a dingy morocco box this held a piece of an oldfashioned enamelled ring and a fragment of embroidered muslin marked a shed lived with me six months before she brought em said the showwoman whispering the bit of handkerchief was enough was it a dream thought the dear old lady what the ocean had refused was this sprite who had lived between earth and air to fulfil miss martha bent softly over the bedside resting her clean glove on the only dirty mattress it had ever touched and quietly kissed the child then she looked up with a radiant face of perfect resolution mrs de marsan said she with dignity that was almost solemnity i wish to adopt this child no one can doubt thy kindness of heart but thee must see that thee is in no condition to give her suitable care and christian nurture thats a fact interposed madam delia with a pang then thee will give her to me asked miss martha firmly madam delia threw her apron over her face and choked and sobbed beneath it for several minutes then reappearing its what ive always expected said she then with a tinge of suspicion would you have taken her without the ring and handkerchief perhaps i should said the other gently but that seems to make it a clearer call fair enough said madam delia submitting i aint denyin of it then she reflected and recommenced there never was such a smart performin child as that since the world began she can do just anythin and just as easy time and again i might have hired her out to a circus and she glad of the chance mind you but no i would keep her safe to home then when she showed me the ring and the other things all my expectations altered very sudden i knowed we couldnt keep her and i began to mistrust that she would somehow find her folks i guess my rathers was that she should considerin but i did wish it had been anne for she aint got nothin better in her than just to live genteel but anne seems a nice child too said miss martha consolingly well thats just what she is replied madam delia with some contempt but what is she for a contortionist ask comstock what shes got in her and how to run the show without gerty thats what beats me why folks begin to complain already that we advertise swallerin and yet dont swaller but never you mind maam you shall have gerty you shall have her she added with a gulp if i have to sell out go ahead and again the apron went over her face at this point gerty waked up with a little murmur looked up at miss marthas kind face and smiled a sweet childish smile half asleep still she put out one thin muscular little hand and went to sleep as the old lady took it in hers a kiss awaked her what has thee been dreaming about my little girl said miss martha angels and things i guess said the child somewhat roused will thee go home with me and live said the lady yesm replied gerty and went to sleep again two days later she was well enough to ride to miss marthas in a carriage escorted by madam delia and by anne that dulluninteresting child as miss amy had reluctantly described her so different from this graceful adelaide this romantic name was a rapid assumption of the softhearted miss amys but once suggested it was as thoroughlyfixed as if a dozen baptismal fonts had written it in water madam delia was sustained up to the time of gertys going by a sense of selfsacrifice but this emotion like other strong stimulants has its reactions that remorse for a crime committed in vain which dr johnson thought the acutest of human emotions is hardly more depressing than to discover that we have got beyond our depth in virtue and are in water where we really cannot quite swimand this was the good womans position during her whole wandering though blameless lifein her girlish days when she charmed snakes at meddibemps or through her brief time of service as plain carline prouty at the biddeford mills or when she ran away from her stepmother and took refuge among the indians at orono or later since she had joined her fate with that of de marsanshe had never been so severely tried that child was so smart she said beneath the evening canvas to her sympathetic spouse i always expected when we got old wed kinder retire on a farm or suthin and let her and her husbandsay comstock if he was young enoughrun the business and even after she showed us the ring and things i thought likely shed just come into her property somewheres and take care of us i dont know as i ever thought shed leave us either way and there shes gone she wont forget us said the peaceful proprietor no said the wife but its lonesome if it had only been anne i shall miss gerty the worst kind and itll kill the show and to tell the truth the show languished nothing but the happy acquisition of a chinese giant nearly eight feet high with slanting eyes and a long pigtaila man who did penance in his height for the undue brevity of his undersized nationwould have saved the museum meantime the neat proprieties of orderly life found but a poor disciple in gerty her warm heart opened to the dear old ladies but she found nothing familiar in this phantom of herself this welldressed little girl who after a rapid convalescence was introduced at school and meeting under the name of adelaide the school studies did not dismay her but she played the jewsharp at recess and danced the clogdance in indiarubbers to the dismay of the little misses grundy her companions in the calisthenic exercises she threw beanbags with an untamed vigor that soon ripped the stitches of the bags and sowed those vegetables in every crack of the schoolroom floor there was a ladder in the garden and it was some comfort to ascend it hand over hand upon the under side or to hang by her toes from the upper rung to the terror of her schoolmates but she became ashamed of the hardness of her palms and she grew in general weary of her life her clothes pinched her so did her new boots madam delia had gone to providence with the show and gerty had not so much as seen the new chinese giant of all days sunday was the most objectionable when she had to sit still in friends meeting and think how pleasant it would be to hang by the knees head downward from the parapet of the gallery she liked better the seamens bethel near by where there was an aroma of tar and tarpaulin that suggested the odors of the showtent and where when the methodist exhorter gave out the hymn howl howl ye winds of night the choir rendered it with such vigor that it was like being at sea in a northeaster but each week made her new life harder until having cried herself asleep one saturday evening she rose early the next morning for her orisons which i regret to say were as follows i must get out of this quoth gerty i must cut and run ill make it all right for the old ladies for ill send em anne shell like it here first rate she hunted up such remnants of her original wardrobe as had been thought worth washing and preserving and having put them on together with a hat whose trimmings had been vehemently burned by miss martha she set out to seek her fortune of all her new possessions she took only a pair of boots and those she carried in her hand as she crept softly down stairs save us exclaimed biddy who had been to a mission mass of incredible length and was already sweeping the doorsteps christmas she added as a still more pious ejaculation when the child said good by biddy im off now where to thin exclaimed biddy to providence said gerty but dont you tell but ye cant go the morns mornin said biddy its sunday and theres no cars theres legs replied the child briefly as she closed the door its much as iver said the stumpy hibernian to herself as she watched the twinkling retreat of those slim but vigorous little members they had been gertys support too long in body and estate for her to shrink from trusting them in a walk of a dozen or a scoreof miles but the locomotion of stephens horse was quicker and she did not get seriously tired before being overtaken andnot without difficulty and some hot tearscoaxed back fortunately madam delia came down from providence that evening on a very unexpected visit and at the confidential hour of bedtime the childs heart was opened and made a revelation wont you be mad if i tell you something she said to madam delia abruptly no said the showwoman with surprise wont you let comstock box my ears ill box his if he does was the indignant answer the gravest contest that had ever arisen in the museum was when monsieur comstock teased beyond endurance had thus taken the law into his own hands well said gerty after a pause i aint a great lady no more n nothin them things i brought to you was annes annes things gasped madam deliathe ring and the piece of a handkerchief yes m said gerty and ive got the rest and exploring her little trunk she produced from a slit in the lining the other half of the ring with the name anne deering you naughty naughty girl said madam delia how did you get em away from anne coaxed her said the child well how did you make her hush up about it told her id kill her if she said a single word said gerty undauntedly i showed her pa de marsans old dirkknife and told her id stick it into her if she didnt hush she was just such a fraidcat she believed me she might have known i didnt mean nothin now she can have em and be a lady she was always tallkin about bein a lady and that put it into my head what did she want to be a lady for asked madam delia indignantly said she wanted to have a parlor and dress tight i dont want to be one of her old ladies i want to stay with you delia and learn the clogdance and she threw her arms round the showwomans neck and cried herself to sleep never did the energetic proprietress of a museum and variety combination feel a greater exultation than did madam delia that night the childs offence was all forgotten in the delight of the discovery to which it led if there had been expectations of social glories to accrue to the house of de marsan through gertys social promotion they melted away and the more substantial delight of still having someone to love and to be proud ofsome object of tenderness warmer than snakes and within nearer reach than a chinese giantthis came in its stead the show too was in a manner on its feet again de marsan said that he would rather have gerty than a hundreddollar bill madam delia looked forward and saw herself sinking into the vale of years without a sigh reaching a period when a serpent fifteen feet long would cease to charm or she to charm itand still having a source of pride and prosperity in this triumphant girl the tent was in its glory on the day of gertys return to be sure nothing in particular had been washed except the face of old bill but that alone was a marvel compared with which all election day was feeble and when you add a paper collar words can say no more monsieur comstock also had that ten times barbered look which shakespeare ascribes to mark antony and which has belonged to that heros successors in the histrionic profession ever since his chin was unnaturally smooth his mustache obtrusively perfumed and nothing but the unchanged dirtiness of his hands still linked him like antaeus with the earth de marsan had intended some personal preparation but had been as usual in no hurry and the appointed moment found him as usual in his shirtsleeves madam delia however wore a new breastpin and gave gerty another and the great new attraction the chinese giant had put on a black broadcloth coat across his bony shoulders in her honor and made a vigorous effort to sit up straight and appear at his ease when off duty he habitually stooped a good deal in private life as if there were no object in being eight feet high except before spectators anne the placid and imperturbable was promoted to take the place that gerty had rejected in the gentle home of the good sisters the secret of her birth whatever it was never came to light but she took kindly as madam delia had predicted to living genteel and grew up into a wellbehaved mediocrity unregretful of the showtent yet probably no one reared within the smell of sawdust ever quite outgrew all taste for the profession

placid little thing demure enough to have been born in a quaker family and exhibiting no contortions or gymnastics but those common to its years and you may be sure that the retired showwoman found in the duties of brevetgrandmother a glory that quite surpassed her expectations sunshine and petrarch near my summer home there is a little cove or landing by the bay where nothing larger than a boat can ever anchor i sit above it now upon the steep bank kneedeep in buttercups and amid grass so lush and green that it seems to ripple and flow instead of waving below lies a tiny beach strewn with a few bits of driftwood and some purple shells and so sheltered by projecting walls that its wavelets plash but lightly a little farther out the sea breaks more roughly over submerged rocks and the waves lift themselves before breaking in an indescribable way as if each gave a glimpse through a translucent window beyond which all oceans depths might be clearly seen could one but hit the proper angle of vision on the right side of my retreat a high wall limits the view while close upon the left the crumbling parapet of fort greene stands out into the foreground its verdant scarp so relieved against the blue water that each inwardbound schooner seems to sail into a cave of grass in the middle distance is a white lighthouse and beyond lie the round tower of old fort louis and the soft low hills of conanicut behind me an oriole chirrups in triumph amid the birchtrees which wave around the house of the haunted window before me a kingfisher pauses and waits and a darting blackbird shows the scarlet on his wings sloops and schooners constantly come and go careening in the wind their white sails taking if remote enough a vague blue mantle from the delicate air sailboats glide in the distanceeach a mere white wing of canvasor coming nearer and glancing suddenly into the cove are put as suddenly on the other tack and almost in an instant seem far away there is today such a live sparkle on the water such a luminous freshness on the grass that it seems as is so often the case in early june as if all history were a dream and the whole earth were but the creation of a summers day if petrarch still knows and feels the consummate beauty of these earthly things it may seem to him some repayment for the sorrows of a lifetime that one reader after all this lapse of years should choose his sonnets to match this grass these blossoms and the soft lapse of these blue waves yet any longer or more continuous poem would be out of place today i fancy that this narrow cove prescribes the proper limits of a sonnet and when i count the lines of ripple within yonder projecting wall there proves to be room for just fourteen nature meets our whims with such little fitnesses the words which build these delicate structures of petrarchs are as soft and fine and closetextured as the sands upon this tiny beach and their monotone if such it be is the monotone of the neighboring ocean is it not possible by bringing such a book into the open air to separate it from the grimness of commentators and bring it back to life and light and italy the beautiful earth is the same as when this poetry and passion were new there is the same sunlight the same blue water and green grass yonder pleasureboat might bear for aught we know the friends and lovers of five centuries ago petrarch and laura might be there with boccaccio and fiammetta as comrades and with chaucer as their stranger guest it bears at any rate if i know its voyagers eyes as lustrous voices as sweet with the world thus young beauty eternal fancy free why should these delicious italian pages exist but to be tortured into grammatical examples is there no reward to be imagined for a delightful book that can match brownings fantastic burial of a tedious one when it has sufficiently basked in sunshine and been cooled in pure salt air when it has bathed in heaped clover and been scented page by page with melilot cannot its beauty once more blossom and its buried loves revive emboldened by such influences at least let me translate a sonnet and see if anything is left after the sweet italian syllables are gone before this continent was discovered before english literature existed when chaucer was a child these words were written yet they are today as fresh and perfect as these laburnumblossoms that droop above my head and as the variable and uncertain air comes freighted with cloverscent from yonder field so floats through these long centuries a breath of fragrance the memory of laura sonnet lieti fiori e felici o joyous blossoming everblessed flowers mid which my queen her gracious footstep sets o plain that keepst her words for amulets and holdst her memory in thy leafy bowers o trees with earliest green of springtime hours and springtimes pale and tender violets o grove so dark the proud sun only lets his blithe rays gild the outskirts of your towers o pleasant countryside o purest stream that mirrorest her sweet face her eyes so clear and of their living light can catch the beam i envy you her haunts so close and dear there is no rock so senseless but i deem it burns with passion that to mine is near goethe compared translators to carriers who convey good wine to market though it gets unaccountably watered by the way the more one praises a poem the more absurd becomes ones position perhaps in trying to translate it if it is so admirableis the natural inquirywhy not let it alone it is a doubtful blessing to the human race that the instinct of translation still prevails strongerthan reason and after one has once yielded to it then each untranslated favorite is like the trees round a backwoodsmans clearing each of which stands a silent defiance until he has cut it down let us try the axe again this is to laura singing sonnet quando amor i begli occhi a terra inchina when love doth those sweet eyes to earth incline and weaves those wandering notes into a sigh soft as his touch and leads a minstrelsy clearvoiced and pure angelic and divine he makes sweet havoc in this heart of mine and to my thoughts brings transformation high so that i say my time has come to die if fate so blest a death for me design but to my soul thus steeped in joy the sound brings such a wish to keep that present heaven it holds my spirit back to earth as well and thus i live and thus is loosed and wound the thread of life which unto me was given by this sole siren who with us doth dwell as i look across the bay there is seen resting over all the hills and even upon every distant sail an enchanted veil of palest blue that seems woven out of the very souls of happy daysa bridal veil with which the sunshine weds this soft landscape in summer such and so indescribable is the atmospheric film that hangs over these poems of petrarchs there is a delicate haze about the words that vanishes when you touch them and reappears as you recede how it clings for instance around this sonnet sonnet aura che quelle chiome sweet air that circlest round those radiant tresses and floatest mingled with them fold on fold deliciously and scatterest that fine gold then twinest it again my hearts dear jesses thou lingerest on those eyes whose beauty presses stings in my heart that all its life exhaust till i go wandering round my treasure lost like some scared creature whom the night distresses i seem to find her now and now perceive how far away she is now rise now fall now what i wish now what is true believe o happy air since joys enrich thee all rest thee and thou o stream too bright to grieve why can i not float with thee at thy call the airiest and most fugitive among petrarchs lovepoems so far as i knowshowing least of that air of earnestness which he has contrived to impart to almost allis this little ode or madrigal it is interesting to see from this that he could be almost conventional and courtly in moments when he held laura farthest aloof and when it is compared with the depths of solemn emotion in his later sonnets it seems like the soft glistening of young birchleaves against a background of pines canzone xxiii nova angeletta sovra l ale accorta a newborn angel with her wings extended came floating from the skies to this fair shore where fatecontrolled i wandered with my sorrows she saw me there alone and unbefriended she wove a silken net and threw it oer the turf whose greenness all the pathway borrows then was i captured nor could fears arise such sweet seduction glimmered from her eyes turn from these light compliments to the pure and reverential tenderness of a sonnet like this sonnet qual donna attende a gloriosa fama doth any maiden seek the glorious fame of chastity of strength of courtesy gaze in the eyes of that sweet enemy whom all the world doth as my lady name how honor grows and pure devotions flame how truth is joined with graceful dignity there thou mayst learn and what the path may be to that high heaven which doth her spirit claim there learn soft speech beyond all poets skill and softer silence and those holy ways unutterable untold by human heart but the infinite beauty that all eyes doth fill this none can copy since its lovely rays are given by gods pure grace and not by artthe following on the other hand seems to me one of the shakespearian sonnets the successive phrases set sail one by one like a yacht squadron each spreads its graceful wings and glides away it is hard to handle this white canvas without soiling macgregor in the only version of this sonnet which i have seen abandons all attempt at rhyme but to follow the strict order of the original in this respect is a part of the pleasant problem which one cannot bear to forego and there seems a kind of deity who presides over this union of languages and who sometimes silently lays the words in order after all ones own poor attempts have failed sonnet o passi sparsi o pensier vaghi e pronti o wandering steps o vague and busy dreams o changeless memory o fierce desire o passion strong heart weak with its own fire o eyes of mine not eyes but living streams o laurel boughs whose lovely garland seems the sole reward that glorys deeds require o haunted life delusion sweet and dire that all my days from slothful rest redeems o beauteous face where love has treasured well his whip and spur the sluggish heart to move at his least will nor can it find relief o souls of love and passion if ye dwell yet on this earth and ye great shades of love linger and see my passion and my grief yonder flies a kingfisher and pauses fluttering like a butterfly in the air then dives toward a fish and failing perches on the projecting wall doves from neighboring dovecotes alight on the parapet of the fort fearless of the quiet cattle who find there a breezy pasture these doves in taking flight do not rise from the ground at once but edging themselves closer to the brink with a caution almost ludicrous in such airy things trust themselves upon the breeze with a shy little hop and at the next moment are securely on the wing how the abundant sunlight inundates everything the great clumps of grass and clover are imbedded in it to the roots it flows in among their stalks like water the lilacbushes bask in it eagerly the topmost leaves of the birches are burnished a vessel sails by with plash and roar and all the white spray along her side is sparkling with sunlight yet there is sorrow in the world and it reached petrarch even before laura diedwhen it reached her this exquisite sonnet shows it sonnet i vidi in terra angelici costumi i once beheld on earth celestial graces and heavenly beauties scarce to mortals known whose memory lends nor joy nor grief alone but all things else bewilders and effaces i saw how tears had left their weary traces within those eyes that once like sunbeams shone i heard those lips breathe low and plaintive moan whose spell might once have taught the hills their places love wisdom courage tenderness and truth made ill their mourning strains more high and dear than ever wove sweet sounds for mortal ear and heaven seemed listening in such saddest ruth the very leaves upon the boughs to soothe such passionate sweetness filled the atmosphere these sonnets are in petrarchs earlier manner but the death of laura brought a change look at yonder schooner coming down the bay straight toward us she is hauled close to the wind her jib is white in the sunlight her larger sails are touched with the same snowy lustre and all the swelling canvas is rounded into such lines of beauty as scarcely anything else in the worldhardly even the perfect outlines of the human formcan give now she comes up into the wind and goes about with a strong flapping of the sails smiting on the ear at a halfmiles distance then she glides off on the other tack showing the shadowed side of her sails until she reaches the distant zone of haze so change the sonnets after lauras death growing shadowy as they recede until the very last seems to merge itself in the blue distance sonnet gli occhi di ch io parlai those eyes neath which my passionate rapture rose the arms hands feet the beauty that erewhile could my own soul from its own self beguile and in a separate world of dreams enclose the hairs bright tresses full of golden glows and the soft lightning of the angelic smile that changed this earth to some celestial isle are now but dust poor dust that nothing knowsand yet i live myself i grieve and scorn left dark without the light i loved in vain adrift in tempest on a bark forlorn dead is the source of all my amorous strain dry is the channel of my thoughts outworn and my sad harp can sound but notes of pain and yet i live what a pause is implied before these words the drawing of a long breath immeasurably long like that vast interval of heartbeats that precedes shakespeares since cleopatra died i can think of no other passage in literature that has in it the same wide spaces of emotion the following sonnet seems to me the most stately and concentrated in the whole volume it is the sublimity of a despair not to be relieved by utterance sonnet soleasi nel mio cor she ruled in beauty oer this heart of mine a noble lady in a humble home and now her time for heavenly bliss has come t is i am mortal proved and she divine the soul that all its blessings must resign and love whose light no more on earth finds room might rend the rocks with pity for their doom yet none their sorrows can in words enshrine they weep within my heart and ears are deaf save mine alone and i am crushed with care and naught remains to me save mournful breath assuredly but dust and shade we are assuredly desire is blind and brief assuredly its hope but ends in death in a later strain he rises to that dream which is more than earths realities sonnet levommi il mio pensiero dreams bore my fancy to that region where she dwells whom here i seek but cannot see mid those who in the loftiest heaven be i looked on her less haughty and more fair she touched my hand she said within this sphere if hope deceive not thou shalt dwell with me i filled thy life with wars wild agony mine own day closed ere evening could appear my bliss no human brain can understand i wait for thee alone and that fair veil of beauty thou dost love shall wear again why was she silent then why dropped my hand ere those delicious tones could quite avail to bid my mortal soul in heaven remain it vindicates the emphatic reality and pesonality of petrarchs love after all that when from these heights of vision he surveys and resurveys his lifes long dream it becomes to him more and more definite as well as more poetic and is farther and farther from a merely vague sentimentalism in his later sonnets laura grows more distinctly individual to us her traits show themselves as more characteristic her temperament more intelligible her precise influence upon petrarch clearer what delicate accuracy of delineation is seen for instance in this sonnet sonnet dolci durezze e placide repulse gentle severity repulses mild full of chaste love and pity sorrowing graceful rebukes that had the power to bring back to itself a heart by dreams beguiled a softtoned voice whose accents undefiled held sweet restraints all duty honoring the bloom of virtue puritys clear spring to cleanse away base thoughts and passions wild divinest eyes to make a lovers bliss whether to bridle in the wayward mind lest its wild wanderings should the pathway miss or else its griefs to soothe its wounds to bind this sweet completeness of thy life it is that saved my soul no other peace i find in the following sonnet visions multiply upon visions would that one could transfer into english the delicious way in which thesweet italian rhymes recur and surround and seem to embrace each other and are woven and unwoven and interwoven like the heavenly hosts that gathered around laura sonnet gli angeli eletti the holy angels and the spirits blest celestial bands upon that day serene when first my love went by in heavenly mien came thronging wondering at the gracious guest what light is here in what new beauty drest they said among themselves for none has seen within this age come wandering such a queen from darkened earth into immortal rest and she contented with her newfound bliss ranks with the purest in that upper sphere yet ever and anon looks back on this to watch for me as if for me she stayed so strive my thoughts lest that high path i miss i hear her call and must not be delayed these odes and sonnets are all but parts of one symphony leading us through a passion strengthened by years and only purified by death until at last the graceful lay becomes an anthem and a nunc dimittis in the closing sonnets petrarch withdraws from the world and they seem like voices from a cloister growing more and more solemn till the door is closed this is one of the last sonnet dicemi spesso il mio fidato speglio oft by my faithful mirror i am told and by my mind outworn and altered brow my earthly powers impaired and weakened now deceive thyself no more for thou art old who strives with natures laws is overbold and time to his commandments bids us bow like fire that waves have quenched i calmly vow in lifes long dream no more my sense to fold and while i think our swift existence flies and none can live again earths brief career then in my deepest heart the voice replies of one who now has left this mortal sphere but walked alone through earthly destinies and of all women is to fame most dear how true is this concluding line who can wonder that women prize beauty and are intoxicated by their own fascinations when these fragile gifts are yet strong enough to outlast all the memories of statesmanship and war next to the immortality of genius is that which genius may confer upon the object of its love laura while she lived was simply one of a hundred or a thousand beautiful and gracious italian women she had her loves and aversions joys and griefs she cared dutifully for her household and embroidered the veil which petrarch loved her memory appeared as fleeting and unsubstantial as that woven tissue after five centuries we find that no armor of that iron age was so enduring the kings whom she honored the popes whom she revered are dust and their memory is dust but literature is still fragrant with her name an impression which has endured so long is ineffaceable it is an earthly immortality time is the chariot of all ages to carry men away and beauty cannot bribe this charioteer thus wrote petrarch in his latin essays but his love had wealth that proved resistless and for laura the chariot stayeda shadow i shall always remember one winter evening a little before christmastime when i took a long solitary walk in the outskirts of the town the cold sunset had left a trail of orange light along the horizon the dry snow tinkled beneath my feet and the early stars had a keen clear lustre that matched well with the sharp sound and the frosty sensation for some time i had walked toward the gleam of a distant window and as i approached the light showed more and more clearly through the white curtains of a little cottage by the road i stopped on reaching it to enjoy the suggestion of domestic cheerfulness in contrast with the dark outside i could not see the inmates nor they me but something of human sympathy came from that steadfast ray as i looked a film of shade kept appearing and disappearing with rhythmic regularity in a corner of the window as if some one might be sitting in a low rockingchair close by presently the motion ceased and suddenly across the curtain came the shadow of a woman she raised in her arms the shadow of a baby and kissed it then both disappeared and i walked on what are raphaels madonnas but the shadow of a mothers love so traced as to endure forever in this picture of mine the group actually moved upon the canvas the curtains that hid it revealed it the ecstasy of human love passed in brief intangible panorama before me it was something seen yet unseen airy yet solid a type yet a reality fugitive yet destined to last in my memory while i live it said more to me than would any madonna of raphaels for his mother never kisses her child i believe i have never passed over that road since then never seen the house never heard the names of its occupants their character their history their fate are all unknown but these two will always stand for me as disembodied types of humanitythe mother and the child they seem nearer to me than my immediate neighbors yet they are as ideal and impersonal as the goddesses of greece or as platos archetypal man i know not the parentage of that child whether black or white native or foreign rich or poor it makes no difference the presence of a baby equalizes all social conditions on the floor of some southern hut scarcely so comfortable as a dogkennel i have seen a dusky woman look down upon her infant with such an expression of delight as painter never drew no social culture can make a mothers face more than a mothers as no wealth can make a nursery more than a place where children dwell lavish thousands of dollars on your babyclothes and after all the child is prettiest when every garment is laid aside that becoming nakedness at least may adorn the chubby darling of the poorest home i know not what triumph or despair may have come and gone through that wayside house since then what jubilant guests may have entered what lifeless form passed out what anguish or what sin may have come between that woman and that child through what worlds they now wander and whether separate or in each others armsthis is all unknown fancy can picture other joys to which the first happiness was but the prelude and on the other hand how easy to imagine some special heritage of human woe and call it theirs i thought of times when pain might be thy guest lord of thy house and hospitality and grief uneasy lover might not rest save when he sat within the touch of thee nay the foretaste of that changed fortune may have been present even in the kiss who knows what absorbing emotion besides loves immediate impulse may have been uttered in that shadowy embrace there may have been some contrition for illtemper or neglect or some triumph over ruinous temptation or some pledge of immortal patience or some heartbreaking prophecy of bereavement it may have been simply an act of habitual tenderness or it may have been the wild reaction toward a neglected duty the renewed selfconsecration of the saint or the joy of the sinner that repenteth no matter she kissed the baby the feeling of its soft flesh the busy struggle of its little arms between her hands the impatient pressure of its little feet against her kneesthese were the same whatever the mood or circumstance beside they did something to equalize joy and sorrow honor and shame maternal love is love whether a woman be a wife or only a mother only a mother the happiness beneath that roof may perhaps have never reached so high a point as at that precise moment of my passing in the coarsest household the mother of a young child is placed on a sort of pedestal of care and tenderness at least for a time she resumes something of the sacredness and dignity of the maiden coleridge ranks as the purest of human emotions that of a husband towards a wife who has a baby at her breasta feeling how free from sensual desire yet how different from friendship and to the true mother however cultivated or however ignorant this period of early parentage is happier than all else in spite of its exhausting cares in that delightful book the letters of mrs richard trench mother of the wellknown english writer the most agreeable passage is perhaps that in which after looking back upon a life spent in the most brilliant society of europe she gives the palm of happiness to the time when she was a young mother she writes to her goddaughter i believe it is the happiest time of any womans life who has affectionate feelings and is blessed with healthy and welldisposed children i know at least that neither the gayeties and boundless hopes of early life nor the more grave pursuits and deeper affections of later years are by any means comparable in my recollection with the serene yet lively pleasure of seeing my children playing on the grass enjoying their little temperate supper or repeating with holy look their simple prayers and undressing for bed growing prettier for every part of their dress they took off and at last lying down all freshness and love in complete happiness and an amiable contest for mammas last kissthat kiss welcomed the child into a world where joy predominates the vast multitude of human beings enjoy existence and wish to live they all have their earthly life under their own control some religions sanction suicide the christian scriptures nowhere explicitly forbid it and yet it is a rare thing many persons sigh for death when it seems far off but the desire vanishes when the boat upsets or the locomotive runs off the track or the measles set in a wise physician once said to me i observe that every one wishes to go to heaven but i observe that most people are willing to take a great deal of very disagreeable medicine first the lives that one least enviesas of the digger indian or the outcast boy in the cityare yet sweet to the living they have only a pleasure like that of the brutes we say with scorn but what a racy and substantial pleasure is that the flashing speed of the swallow in the air the cool play of the minnow in the water the dance of twin butterflies round a thistleblossom the thundering gallop of the buffalo across the prairie nay the clumsy walk of the grizzly bear it were doubtless enough to reward existence could we have joy like such as these and ask no more this is the hearty physical basis of animated life and as step by step the savage creeps up to the possession of intellectual manhood each advance brings with it new sorrow and new joy with the joy always in excess there are many who will utterly disavow this creed that life is desirable in itself a fair woman in a ballroom exquisitely dressed and possessed of all that wealth could give once declared to me her beliefand i think honestlythat no person over thirty was consciously happy or would wish to live but for the fear of death there could not even be pleasure in contemplating ones children she asserted since they were living in such a world of sorrow asking the opinion within half an hour of another woman as fair and as favored by fortune i found directly the opposite verdict for my part i can truly say she answered that i enjoy every moment i live the varieties of temperament and of physical condition will always afford us these extremes but the truth lies between them and most persons will endure many sorrows and still find life sweet and the mothers kiss welcomes the child into a world where good predominates as well as joy what recreants must we be in an age that has abolished slavery in america and popularized the governments of all europe if we doubt that the tendency of man is upward how much that the world calls selfishness is only generosity with narrow wallsa too exclusive solicitude to maintain a wife in luxury or make ones children rich in an audience of rough people a generous sentiment always brings down the house in the tumult of war both sides applaud an heroic deed a courageous woman who had traversed alone on benevolent errands the worst parts of new york told me that she never felt afraid except in the solitudes of the country wherever there was a crowd she found a protector a policeman of great experience once spoke to me with admiration of the fidelity of professional thieves to each other and the risks they would run for the women whom they loved when bristol bill was arrested he said there was found upon the burglar a set of false keys not quite finished by which he would certainly within twentyfour hours have had his mistress out of jail parentduchatelet found always the remains of modesty among the fallen women of paris hospitals and mayhew amid the london outcasts says that he thinks better of human nature every day even among politicians whom it is our american fashion to revile as the chief of sinners there is less of evil than of good in wilberforces memoirs there is an account of his having once asked mr pitt whether his long experience as prime minister had made him think well or ill of his fellowmen mr pitt answered well and his successor lord melbourne being asked the same question answered after a little reflection my opinion is the same as that of mr pitt let us have faith it was a part of the vigor of the old hebrew tradition to rejoice when a manchild was born into the world and the maturer strength of nobler ages should rejoice over a womanchild as well nothing human is wholly sad until it is effete and dying out where there is life there is promise vitality is always hopeful was the verdict of the most refined and clearsighted woman who has yet explored the rough mining villages of the rocky mountains there is apt to be a certain coarse virtue in rude health as the germanic races were purest when least civilized and our american indians did not unlearn chastity till they began to decay but even where vigor and vice are found together they still may hold a promise for the next generation out of the strong cometh forth sweetness parisian wickedness is not so discouraging merely because it is wicked as from a suspicion that it is draining the lifeblood of the nation a mob of miners or of new york bullies may be uncomfortable neighbors and may make a man of refinement hesitate whether to stop his ears or to feel for his revolver but they hold more promise for the coming generations than the line which ends in madame bovary or the vicomte de camors but behind that cottage curtain at any rate a new and prophetic life had begun i cannot foretell that childs future but i know something of its past the boy may grow up into a criminal the woman into an outcast yet the baby was beloved it came not in utter nakedness it found itself heir of the two prime essentials of existencelife and love its first possession was a womans kiss and in that heritage the most important need of its career was guaranteed an ounce of mother says the spanish proverb is worth a pound of clergy jean paul says that in life every successive influence affects us less and less so that the circumnavigator of the globe is less influenced by all the nations he has seen than by his nurse well may the child imbibe that reverence for motherhood which is the first need of man where woman is most a slave she is at least sacred to her son the turkish sultan must prostrate himself at the door of his mothers apartments and were he known to have insulted her it would make his throne tremble among the savage african touaricks if two parents disagree it is to the mother that the childs obedience belongs over the greater part of the earths surface the foremost figures in all temples are the mother and child christian and buddhist nations numbering together two thirds of the worlds population unite in this worship into the secrets of the ritual that baby in the window had already received initiationand how much spiritual influence may in turn have gone forth from that little one the coarsest father gains a new impulse to labor from the moment of his babys birth he scarcely sees it when awake and yet it is with him all the time every stroke he strikes is for his child new social aims new moral motives come vaguely up to him the london costermonger told mayhew that he thought every man would like his son or daughter to have a better start in the world than his own after all there is no tonic like the affections philosophers express wonder that the divine laws should give to some young girl almost a child the custody of an immortal soul but what instruction the baby brings to the mother she learns patience selfcontrol endurance her very arm grows strong so that she can hold the dear burden longer than the father can she learns to understand character too by dealing with it in training my first children said a wise mother to me i thought that all were born just the same and that i was wholly responsible for what they should become i learned by degrees that each had a temperament of its own which i must study before i could teach it and thus as the little ones grow older their dawning instincts guide those of the parents their questions suggest new answers and to have loved them is a liberal education for the height of heights is love the philosopher dries into a skeleton like that he investigates unless love teaches him he is blind among his microscopes unless he sees in the humblest human soul a revelation that dwarfs all the world beside while he grows gray in ignorance among his crucibles every girlish mother is being illuminated by every kiss of her child that house is so far sacred which holds within its walls this newborn heir of eternity but to dwell on these high mysteries would take us into depths beyond the present needs of mother or of infant and it is better that the greater part of the babylife should be that of an animated toy perhaps it is well for all of us that we should live mostly on the surfaces of things and should play with life to avoid taking it too hard in a nursery the youngest child is a little more than a doll and the doll is a little less than a child what spell does fancy weave on earth like that which the one of these small beings performs for the other this battered and tattered doll this shapeless featureless possibly legless creature whose mission it is to be dragged by one arm or stood upon its head in the bathingtub until it finally reverts to the ragbag whence it camewhat an affluence of breathing life is thrown around it by one touch of dawning imagination its little mistress will find all joy unavailing without its sympathetic presence will confide every emotion to its penandink ears and will weep passionate tears if its extremely soiled person is pricked when its clothes are mended what psychologist what student of the human heart has ever applied his subtile analysis to the emotions of a child toward her doll i read lately the charming autobiography of a little girl of eight years written literally from her own dictation since pet marjorie i have seen no such actual selfrevelation on the part of a child in the course of her narration she describes with great precision and correctness the travels of the family through europe in the preceding year assigning usually the place of importance to her doll who appears simply as my baby nothing can be more grave more accurate more serious than the whole history but nothing in it seems quite so real and alive as the doll when we got to nice i was sick the next morning the doctor came and he said i had something that was very much like scarlet fever then i had annie take care of baby and keep her away for i was afraid she would get the fever she used to cry to come to me but i knew it wouldnt be good for her what firm judgment is here what tenderness without weakness what discreet motherhood when christmas came it appears that baby hung up her stocking with the rest her devoted parent had bought for her a slate with a real pencil others provided thimble and scissors and bodkin and a spool of thread and a travellingshawl with a strap and a cap with tarletan ruffles i found baby with the cap on early in the morning and she was so pleased she almost jumped out of my arms thus in the midst of visits to the coliseum and st peters the drama of early affection goes always on i used to take her to hear the band in the carriage and she went everywhere i did but the love of all dolls as of other pets must end with a tragedy and here it comes the next place we went to was lucerne there was a lovely lake there but i had a very sad time one day i thought id take baby down to breakfast and as i was going up stairs my foot slipped and baby broke her head and o i felt so bad and i cried out and i ran up stairs to annie and mamma came and o we were all so sorry and mamma said she thought i could get another head but i said it wont be the same baby and mamma said maybe we could make it seem so at this crisis the elder brother and sister departed for mount righi they were going to stay all night and mamma and i stayed at home to take care of each other i felt very bad about baby and about their going too after they went mamma and i thought we would go to the little town and see what we could find after many difficulties a waxen head was discovered mamma bought it and we took it home and put it on baby but i said it wasnt like my real baby only it was better than having no child at all this crushing bereavement this reluctant acceptance of a child by adoption to fill the vacant hearthow real and formidable is all this rehearsal of the tragedies of maturer years i knew an instance in which the last impulse of ebbing life was such a gush of imaginary motherhood a dear friend of mine whose sweet charities prolong into a third generation the unbounded benevolence of old isaac hopper used to go at christmastime with dolls and other gifts to the poor children on randalls island passing the bed of a little girl whom the physician pronounced to be unconscious and dying the kind visitor insisted on putting a doll into her arms instantly the eyes of the little invalid opened and she pressed the gift eagerly to her heart murmuring over it and caressing it the matron afterwards wrote that the child died within two hours wearing a happy face and still clinging to her newfound treasure and beginning with this transfer of all human associations to a doll the childs life interfuses itself readily among all the affairs of the elders in its presence formality vanishes the most oppressive ceremonial is a little relieved when children enter theirinfluence is pervasive and irresistible like that of water which adapts itself to any landscapealways takes its place welcome or unwelcomekeeps its own level and seems always to have its natural and proper margin out of doors how children mingle with nature and seem to begin just where birds and butterflies leave off leigh hunt with his delicate perceptions paints this well the voices of children seem as natural to the early morning as the voice of the birds the suddenness the lightness the loudness the sweet confusion the sparkling gayety seem alike in both the sudden little jangle is now here and now there and now a single voice calls to another and the boy is off like the bird so heine with deeper thoughtfulness noticed the intimacy with the trees of the little woodgatherer in the hartz mountains soon the child whistled like a linnet and the other birds all answered him then he disappeared in the thicket with his bare feet and his bundle of brushwood children thought heine are younger than we and can still remember the time when they were trees or birds and can therefore understand and speak their language but we are grown old and have too many cares and too much jurisprudence and bad poetry in our heads but why go to literature for a recognition of what one may see by opening ones eyes before my window there is a pool two rods square that is haunted all winter by childrenclearing away the snow of many a storm if need be and mining downward till they strike the ice i look this morning from the window and the pond is bare in a moment i happen to look again and it is covered with a swarm of boys a great migrating flock has settled upon it as if swooping down from parts unknown to scream and sport themselves here the air is full of their voices they have all tugged on their skates instantaneously as it were by magic now they are in a confused cluster now they sweep round and round in a circle now it is broken into fragments and as quickly formed again games are improvised and abandoned there seems to be no plan or leader but all do as they please and yet somehow act in concert and all chatter all the time now they have alighted every one upon the bank of snow that edges the pond each scraping a little hollow in which to perch now every perch is vacant again for they are all in motion each moment increases the jangle of shrill voicessince a boys outdoor whisper to his nearest crony is as if he was hailing a ship in the offingand what they are all saying can no more be made out than if they were a flock of gulls or blackbirds i look away from the window once more and when i glance out again there is not a boy in sight they have whirled away like snowbirds and the little pool sleeps motionless beneath the cheerful wintry sun who but must see how gradually the joyous life of the animal rises through childhood into mansince the soaring gnats the glancing fishes the sliding seals are all represented in this mob of halfgrown boyhood just released from school if i were to choose among all gifts and qualities that which on the whole makes life pleasantest i should select the love of children no circumstance can render this world wholly a solitude to one who has that possession it is a freemasonry wherever one goes there are the little brethren and sisters of the mystic tie no diversity of race or tongue makes much difference a smile speaks the universal language if i value myself on anything said the lonely hawthorne it is on having a smile that children love they are such prompt little beings they require so little prelude hearts are won in two minutes at that frank period and so long as you are true to them they will be true to you they need no argument no bribery they have a hearty appetite for gifts no doubt but it is not for these that they love the giver take the wealth of the world and lavish it with counterfeited affection i will win all the childrens hearts away from you by emptyhanded love the gorgeous toys will dazzle them for an hour then their instincts will revert to their natural friends in visiting a house where there are children i do not like to take them presents it is better to forego the pleasure of the giving than to divide the welcome between yourself and the gift let that follow after you are gone it is an exaggerated compliment to women when we ascribe to them alone this natural sympathy with childhood it is an individual not a sexual trait and is stronger in many men than in many women it is nowhere better exhibited in literature than where the happy wilhelm meister takes his boy by the hand to lead him into the free and lordly world such love is not universal among the other sex though men in that humility which so adorns their natures keep up the pleasing fiction that it is as a general rule any little girl feels some glimmerings of emotion towards anything that can pass for a doll but it does not follow that when grown older she will feel as ready an instinct toward every child try it point out to a woman some bundle of blueandwhite or whiteandscarlet in some ones arms at the next street corner ask her do you love that baby not one woman in three will say promptly yes the others will hesitate will bid you wait till they are nearer till they can personally inspect the little thing and take an inventory of its traits it may be dirty too it may be diseased ah but this is not to love children and you might as well be a man to love children is to love childhood instinctively at whatever distance the first impulse being one of attraction though it may be checked by later discoveries unless your heart commands at least as long a range as your eye it is not worth much the dearest saint in my calendar never entered a railway car that she did not look round for a baby which when discovered must always be won at once into her arms if it was dirty she would have been glad to bathe it if ill to heal it it would not have seemed to her anything worthy the name of love to seek only those who were wholesome and clean like the young girl in holmess most touching poem she would have claimed as her own the outcast child whom nurses and physicians had abandoned take her dread angel break in love this bruised reed and make it thine no voice descended from above but avis answered she is mine when i think of the selfdevotion which the human heart can containof those saintly souls that are in love with sorrow and that yearn to shelter all weakness and all griefit inspires an unspeakable confidence that there must also be an instinct of parentagebeyond this human race a heart of hearts cor cordium as we all crave something to protect so we long to feel ourselves protected we are all infants before the infinite and as i turned from that cottage window to the resplendent sky it was easy to fancy that mute embrace that shadowy symbol of affection expanding from the narrow lattice till it touched the stars gathering every created soul into the armsof immortal lovefootpaths all round the shores of the island where i dwell there runs a winding path it is probably as old as the settlement of the country and has been kept open with pertinacious fidelity by the fishermen whose right of way it represents in some places as between fort adams and castle hill it exists in its primitive form an irregular track above rough cliffs whence you look down upon the entrance to the harbor and watch the whitesailed schooners that glide beneath elsewhere the highroad has usurped its place and you have the privilege of the path without its charm along our eastern cliffs it runs for some miles in the rear of beautiful estates whose owners have seized on it and graded it and gravelled it and made stiles for it and done for it everything that landscapegardening could do while leaving it a footpath still you walk there with croquet and roses on the one side and with floating loons and wild ducks on the other in remoter places the path grows wilder and has ramifications striking boldly across the peninsula through rough moorland and among great ledges of rock where you may ramble for hours out of sight of all but some sportsman with his gun or some truantboy with dripping waterlilies there is always a charm to me in the inexplicable windings of these wayward tracks yet i like the path best where it is nearest the ocean there while looking upon blue sea and snowy sails and floating gulls you may yet hear on the landward side the melodious and plaintive drawl of the meadowlark most patient of summer visitors and indeed lingering on this island almost the whole year round but who cares whither a footpath leads the charm is in the path itself its promise of something that the highroad cannot yield away from habitations you know that the fisherman the geologist the botanist may have been there or that the cows have been driven home and that somewhere there are bars and a milkpail even in the midst of houses the path suggests schoolchildren with their luncheonbaskets or workmen seeking eagerly the noonday interval or the twilight rest a footpath cannot be quite spoiled so long as it remains such you can make a road a mere avenue for fast horses or showy women but this humbler track keeps its simplicity and if a queen comes walking through it she comes but as a village maid on sunday when it is not etiquette for our fashionables to drive but only to walk along the cliffs they seem to wear a more innocent and wholesome aspect in that novel position i have seen a fine lady pause under such circumstances and pick a wildflower she knew how to do it a footpath has its own character while that of the highroad is imposed upon it by those who dwell beside it or pass over it indeed roads become picturesque only when they are called lanes and make believe that they are but paths the very irregularity of a footpath makes half its charm so much of loitering and indolence and impulse have gone to its formation that all which is stiff and military has been left out i observed that the very dikes of the southern rice plantations did not succeed in being rectilinear though the general effect was that of tennysons flowery squares even the country road which is but an enlarged footpath is never quite straight as thoreau long since observed noting it with his surveyors eye i read in his unpublished diary the law that plants the rushes in waving lines along the edge of a pond and that curves the pond shore itself incessantly beats against the straight fences and highways of men and makes them conform to the line of beauty at last it is this unintentional adaptation that makes a footpath so indestructible instead of striking across the natural lines it conforms to them nestles into the hollow skirts the precipice avoids the morass an unconscious landscapegardener it seeks the most convenient course never doubting that grace will follow mitchell at his edgewood farm wishing to decide on the most picturesque avenue to his front door ordered a heavy load of stone to be hauled across the field and bade the driver seek the easiest grades at whatever cost of curvature the avenue followed the path so made when a footpath falls thus unobtrusively into its place all natural forces seem to sympathize with it and help it to fulfil its destiny once make a welldefined track through a wood and presently the overflowing brooks seek it for a channel the obstructed winds draw through it the fox and woodchuck travel by it the catbird and robin build near it the bee and swallow make a highroad of its convenient thoroughfare in winter the first snows mark it with a white line as you wander through you hear the bluejays cry and see the hurrying flight of the sparrow the graceful outlines of the leafless bushes are revealed and the clinging birdsnests leaves that do not fall give happy memories of summer homes thus nature meets man halfway the paths of the wild forest and of the rural neighborhood are not at all the same thing indeed a spotted trail marked only by the woodmans axemarks on the trees is not a footpath thoreau who is sometimes foolishly accused of having sought to be a mere savage understood this distinction well a man changes by his presence he says in his unpublished diary the very nature of the trees the poets is not a loggers path but a woodmansthe logger and pioneer have preceded him and banished decaying wood and the spongy mosses which feed on it and built hearths and humanized nature for him for a permanent residence there can be no comparison between this and the wilderness our woods are sylvan and their inhabitants woodsmen and rustics that is a selvaggia and its inhabitants salvages what thoreau loved like all men of healthy minds was the occasional experience of untamed wildness i love to see occasionally he adds a man from whom the usnea lichen hangs as gracefully as from a spruce footpaths bring us nearer both to nature and to man no highroad not even a lane conducts to the deeper recesses of the wood where you hear the woodthrush there are a thousand concealed fitnesses in nature rhymed correspondences of bird and blossom for which you must seek through hidden paths as when you come upon some black brook so palisaded with cardinalflowers as to seem a stream of sunsets or trace its shadowy course till it spreads into some forestpool above which that rare and patrician insect the agrion dragonfly flits and hovers perpetually as if the darkness and the cool had taken wings the dark brown pellucid water sleeps between banks of softest moss white stars of twinflowers creep close to the brink delicate sprays of dewberry trail over it and the emerald tips of drooping leaves forever tantalize the still surface above these the slender darkblue insect waveshis dusky wings like a liberated ripple of the brook and takes the few stray sunbeams on his lustrous form whence came the correspondence between this beautiful shy creature and the moist dark nooks shot through with stray and transitory sunlight where it dwells the analogy is as unmistakable as that between the scorching heats of summer and the shrill cry of the cicada they suggest questions that no savant can answer mysteries that wait like goethes secret of morphology till a sufficient poet can be born and we meanwhile stand helpless in their presence as one waits beside the telegraphic wire while it hums and vibrates charged with all fascinating secrets above the heads of a wondering world it is by the presence of pathways on the earth that we know it to be the habitation of man in the barest desert they open to us a common humanity it is the absence of these that renders us so lonely on the ocean and makes us glad to watch even the track of our own vessel but on the mountaintop how eagerly we trace out the road that brings places together as schiller says it is the first thing we look for till we have found it each scattered village has an isolated and churlish look but the glimpse of a furlong of road puts them all in friendly relations the narrower the path the more domestic and familiar it seems the railroad may represent the capitalist or the government the highroad indicates what the surveyor or the county commissioners thought best but the footpath shows what the people needed its associations are with beauty and humble lifethe boy with his dog the little girl with her fagots the pedler with his pack cheery companions they are or ought to be jog on jog on the footpath way and merrily hent the stilea a merry heart goes all the day your sad one tires in a milea the footpath takes you across the farms and behind the houses you are admitted to the family secrets and form a personal acquaintance even if you take the wrong path it only leads you acrosslots to some man ploughing or some old woman picking berriesperhaps a very spicy acquaintance whom the road would never have brought to light if you are led astray in the woods that only teaches you to observe landmarks more closely or to leave straws and stakes for tokens like a gypsys patteran to show the ways already traversed there is a healthy vigor in the mind of the boy who would like of all things to be lost in the woods to build a fire out of doors and sleep under a tree or in a haystack civilization is tiresome and enfeebling unless we occasionally give it the relish of a little outlawry and approach in imagination at least the zest of a gypsy life the records of pedestrian journeys the wanderjahre and memoirs of goodfornothings and all the delightful german forest literaturethese belong to the footpath side of our nature the passage i best remember in all bayard taylors travels is the ecstasy of his thuringian forester who said i recall the time when just a sunny morning made me so happy that i did not know what to do with myself one day in spring as i went through the woods and saw the shadows of the young leaves upon the moss and smelt the buds of the firs and larches and thought to myself all thy life is to be spent in the splendid foresti actually threw myself down and rolled in the grass like a dog over and over crazy with joy it is the charm of pedestrian journeys that they convert the grandest avenues to footpaths through them alone we gain intimate knowledge of the people and of nature and indeed of ourselves it is easy to hurry too fast for our best reflections which as the old monk said of perfection must be sought not by flying but by walking perfectionis via non pervolanda sed perambulanda the thoughts that the railway affords us are dusty thoughts we ask the news read the journals question our neighbor and wish to know what is going on because we are a part of it it is only in the footpath that our minds like our bodies move slowly and we traverse thought like space with a patient thoroughness rousseau said that he had never experienced so much lived so truly and been so wholly himself as during his travels on foot what can hawthorne mean by saying in his english diary that an american would never understand the passage in bunyan about christian and hopeful going astray along a bypath into the grounds of giant despair from there being no stiles and bypaths in our country so much of the charm of american pedestrianism lies in the bypaths for instance the whole interior of cape ann beyond gloucester is a continuous woodland with granite ledges everywhere cropping out around which the highroad winds following the curving and indented line of the sea and dotted here and there with fishing hamlets this whole interior is traversed by a network of footpaths rarely passable for a wagon and not always for a horse but enabling the pedestrian to go from any one of these villages to any other in a line almost direct and always under an agreeable shade by the longest of these hidden ways one may go from pigeon cove to gloucester ten miles without seeing a public road in the little inn at the former village there used to hang an old map of this whole forest region giving a chart of some of these paths which were said to date back to the first settlement of the country one of them for instance was called on the map old road from sandy bay to squam meetinghouse through the woods but the road is now scarcely even a bridlepath and the most faithful worshipper could not seek squam meetinghouse in the family chaise those woods have been lately devastated but when i first knew that region it was as good as any german forest often we stepped almost from the edge of the sea into some gap in the woods there seemed hardly more than a rabbittrack yet presently we met some wayfarer who had crossed the cape by it a piny dell gave some vista of the broad sea we were leaving and an opening in the woods displayed another blue sealine before the encountering breezes interchanged odor of berrybush and scent of brine penetrating farther among oaks and chestnuts we came upon some little cottage quaint and sheltered as any spenser drew it was built on no highroad and turned its vineclad gable away from even the footpath then the ground rose and we were surprised by a breeze from a new quarter perhaps we climbed trees to look for landmarksand saw only still farther in the woods some great cliff of granite or the derrick of an unseen quarry three miles inland as i remember we found the hearthstones of a vanished settlement then we passed a swamp with cardinalflowers then a cathedral of noble pines topped with crowsnests if we had not gone astray by this time we presently emerged on dogtown common an elevated tableland overspread with great boulders as with houses and encircled with a girdle of green woods and an outer girdle of blue sea i know of nothing more wild than that gray waste of boulders it is a natural salisbury plain of which icebergs and oceancurrents were the druidic builders in that multitude of couchant monsters there seems a sense of suspended life you feel as if they must speak and answer to each other in the silent nights but by day only the wandering seabirds seek them on their way across the cape and the sweetbay and green fern embed them in a softer and deeper setting as the years go by this is the height of ground of that wild footpath but as you recede farther from the outer ocean and approach gloucester you come among still wilder ledges unsafe without a guide and you find in one place a cluster of deserted houses too difficult of access to remove even their materials so that they are left to moulder alone i used to wander in those woods summer after summer till i had made my own chart of their devious tracks and now when i close my eyes in this oldport midsummer the soft italian air takes on something of a scandinavian vigor for the incessant roll of carriages i hear the tinkle of the quarrymans hammer and the veerys song and i long for those perfumed and breezy pastures and for those promontories of granite where the fresh water is nectar and the salt sea has a regal blue i recall another footpath near worcester massachusetts it leads up from the low meadows into the wildest region of all that vicinity tatesset hill leaving behind you the open pastures where the cattle lie beneath the chestnuttrees or drink from the shallow brook you pass among the birches and maples where the woodsmans shanty stands in the clearing and the raspberryfields are merry with childrens voices the familiar birds and butterflies linger below with them and in the upper and more sacred depths the woodthrush chants his litany and the brown mountain butterflies hover among the scented vines higher yet rises the rattlesnake ledge spreading over one side of the summit a black avalanche of broken rock now overgrown with reindeermoss and filled with tufts of the smaller wild geranium just below this ledgeamid a dark dense track of secondgrowth forest masked here and there with grapevines studded with rare orchises and pierced by a brook that vanishes suddenly where the ground sinks away and lets the blue distance inthere is a little monument to which the footpath leads and which always seemed to me as wild a memorial of forgotten superstition as the traveller can find amid the forests of japan it was erected by a man called solomon pearson not to give his name too closely a quiet thoughtful farmer longbearded lowvoiced and with that aspect of refinement which an ideal life brings forth even in quite uninstructed men at the height of the second advent excitement this man resolved to build for himself upon these remote rocks a house which should escape the wrath to come and should endure even amid a burning and transformed earth thinking as he had once said to me that if the first dispensation had been strong enough to endure there would have been no need of a second he resolved to build for his part something which should possess permanence at least and there still remains on that high hillside the small beginning that he made there are four low stone walls three feet thick built solidly together without cement and without the trace of tools the endwalls are nine feet high the sides being lower and are firmly united by a strong iron ridgepole perhaps fifteen feet long which is imbedded at each end in the stone other masses of iron lie around unused in sheets bars and coils brought with slow labor by the builder from far below the whole building was designed to be made of stone and iron it is now covered with creeping vines and the debris of the hillside but though its construction had been long discontinued when i saw it the interior was still kept scrupulously clean through the care of this modern solomon who often visited his shrine an arch in the terminal wall admits the visitor to the small roofless temple and he sees before him imbedded in the centre of the floor a large smooth block of white marble where the deed of this spot of land was to be recorded in the hope to preserve it even after the globe should have been burned and renewed but not a stroke of this inscription was ever cut and now the young chestnut boughs droop into the uncovered interior and shy forestbirds sing fearlessly among them having learned that this house belongs to god not man as if to reassure them and perhaps in allusion to his own vegetarian habits the architect has spread some rough plaster at the head of the apartment and marked on it in bold characters thou shalt not kill two slabs outside a little way from the walls bear these inscriptions peace on earth goodwill to men when i visited it the path was rough and so obstructed with bushes that it was hard to comprehend how it had afforded passage for these various materials it seemed more as if some strange architectural boulder had drifted from some runic period and been stranded there it was as apt a confessional as any of wordsworths nooks among the trossachs and when one thinks how many men are wearing out their souls in trying to conform to the traditional mythologies of others it seems nobler in this man to have reared upon that lonely hill the unfinished memorial of his own i recall another path which leads from the lower saranac lake near martins to what the guides call or used to call the philosophers camp at amperzand on this oddly named lake in the adirondack region a tract of land was bought by professor agassiz and his friends who made there a summer campingground and with one comrade i once sought the spot i remember with what joy we left the boatso delightful at first so fatiguing at last for i cannot with mr murray call it a merit in the adirondacks that you never have to walkand stepped away into the free forest we passed tangled swamps so dense with upturned trees and trailing mosses that they seemed to give no opening for any living thing to pass unless it might be the soft and silent owl that turned its head almost to dislocation in watching us ere it flitted vaguely away farther on the deep cool forest was luxurious with plumy ferns we trod on mosscovered roots finding the emerald steps so soft we scarcely knew that we were ascending every breath was aromatic there seemed infinite healing in every fragrant drop that fell upon our necks from the cedar boughs we had what i think the pleasantest guide for a daylight trampone who has never before passed over that particular route and can only pilot you ongeneral principles till he gladly at last allows you to pilot him when we once got the lead we took him jubilantly on and beginning to look for the philosophers camp found ourselves confronted by a large cedartree on the margin of a wooded lake this was plainly the end of the path was the camp then afloat our escort was in that state of hopeless ignorance of which only lost guides are capable we scanned the green horizon and the level water without glimpse of human abode it seemed an enchanted lake and we looked about the treetrunk for some fairy horn that we might blow it that failing we tried three rifleshots and out from the shadow of an island on the instant there glided a boat which bore no lady of the lake but a redshirted woodsman the artist whom we sought was on that very island it seemed sketching patiently while his guides were driving the deer this artist was he whose procession of the pines had identified his fame with that delightful forest region he it was who had laid out with artistic taste the philosophers camp and who was that season still awaiting philosophers as well as deer he had been there for a month alone with the guides and declared that nature was pressing upon him to an extent that almost drove him wild his eyes had a certain remote and questioning look that belongs to imaginative men who dwell alone it seemed an impertinence to ask him to come out of his dream and offer us dinner but his instincts of hospitality failed not and the redshirted guide was sent to the camp which was it seemed on the other side of the lake to prepare our meal while we bathed i am thus particular in speaking of the dinner not only because such is the custom of travellers but also because it was the occasion of an interlude which i shall never forget as we were undressing for our bath upon the lonely island where the soft pale water almost lapped our feet and the deep wooded hills made a great amphitheatre for the lake our host bethought himself of something neglected in his instructions ben vociferated he to the guide now rapidly receding ben paused on his oars remember to boooil the venison ben shouted the pensive artist while all the slumbering echoes arose to applaud this culinary confidence and ben he added imploringly dont forget the dumplings upon this the loons all down the lake who had hitherto been silent took up the strain with vehemence hurling their wild laughter at the presumptuous mortal who thus dared to invade their solitudes with details as trivial as mr pickwicks tomatosauce they repeated it over and over to each other till ten square miles of loons must have heard the news and all laughed together never was there such an audience they could not get over it and two hours after when we had rowed over to the camp and dinner had been served this irreverent and invisible chorus kept bursting out at all points of the compass with scattered chuckles of delight over this extraordinary bill of fare justice compels me to add that the dumplings were made of indianmeal upon a recipe devised by our artist the guests preferred the venison but the host showed a fidelity to his invention that proved him to be indeed a dweller in an ideal world another path that comes back to memory is the bare trail that we followed over the prairies of nebraska in when the missouri river was held by roving bands from the slave states and freedom had to seek an overland route into kansas all day and all night we rode between distant prairiefires pillars of evening light and of morning cloud while sometimes the low grass would burn to the very edge of the trail so that we had to hold our breath as we galloped through parties of armed missourians were sometimes seen over the prairie swells so that we had to mount guard at nightfall freestate emigrants fleeing from persecution continually met us and we sometimes saw parties of wandering sioux or passed their great irregular huts and houses of worship i remember one desolate prairie summit on which an indian boy sat motionless on horseback his bare red legs clung closely to the white sides of his horse a gorgeous sunset was unrolled behind him and he might have seemed the last of his race just departing for the huntinggrounds of the blest more often the horizon showed no human outline and the sun set cloudless and elongated into pearshaped outlines as behind oceanwaves but i remember best the excitement that filled our breasts when we approached spots where the contest for a free soil had already been sealed with blood in those days as one went to pennsylvania to study coal formations or to lake superior for copper so one went to kansas for men every footpath on this planet said a rare thinker may lead to the door of a hero and that trail into kansas ended rightly at the tentdoor of john brown and later who that knew them can forget the picketpaths that were worn throughout the sea islands of south carolina paths that wound along the shores of creeks or through the depths of woods where the great wild roses tossed their airy festoons above your head and the brilliant lizards glanced across your track and your horses ears suddenly pointed forward and his pace grew uneasy as he snuffed the presence of something you could not see at night you had often to ride from picket to picket in dense darkness trusting to the horse to find his way or sometimes dismounting to feel with your hands for the track while the great southern fireflies offered their floating lanterns for guidance and the hoarse chuckwillswidow croaked ominously from the trees and the great guns of the siege of charleston throbbed more faintly than the drumming of a partridge far away those islands are everywhere so intersected by dikes and ledges and winding creeks as to form a natural military region like la vendee and yet two plantations that are twenty miles asunder by the road will sometimes be united by a footpath which a negro can traverse in two hours these tracks are limited in distance by the island formation but they assume a greater importance as you penetrate the mainland they then join great states instead of mere plantations and if you ask whither one of them leads you are told to alabama or to tennessee time would fail to tell of that wandering path which leads to the mine mountain near brattleborough where you climb the high peak at last and perhaps see the showers come up the connecticut till they patter on the leaves beneath you and then swerving pass up the black ravine and leave you unwet or of those among the white mountains gorgeous with great red lilies which presently seem to take flight in a cloud of butterflies that match their tintspaths where the balsamic air caresses you in light breezes andmasses of alderberries rise above the waving ferns or of the paths that lead beside many a little new england stream whose bank is lost to sight in a smooth green slope of grapevine the lower shoots rest upon the quiet water but the upper masses are crowned by a white wreath of alderblooms beside them grow great masses of wildroses and the simultaneous blossoms and berries of the gaudy nightshade or of those winding tracks that lead here and there among the flat stones of peaceful old graveyards so entwined with grass and flowers that every spray of sweetbrier seems to tell more of life than all the accumulated epitaphs can tell of death and when the paths that one has personally traversed are exhausted memory holds almost as clearly those which the poets have trodden for usthose innumerable byways of shakespeare each more real than any highroad in england or chaucers little path i found of mintes full and fennell greene or spensers pathes and alleies wide with footing worne or the path of brownings pippa down the hillside up the glen love me as i love or the weary tracks by which little nell wandered or the haunted way in sydney dobells ballad ravelstone ravelstone the merry path that leads down the golden morning hills and through the silver meads or the few american paths that genius has yet idealized that where hawthornes david swan slept or that which thoreau found upon the banks of walden pond or where whittier parted with his childhoods playmate on ramoth hill it is not heights or depths or spaces that make the world worth living in for the fairest landscape needs still to be garlanded by the imaginationto become classic with noble deeds and romantic with dreams go where we please in nature we receive in proportion as we give ivo the old bishop of chartres wrote that neither the secret depth of woods nor the tops of mountains make man blessed if he has not with him solitude of mind the sabbath of the heart and tranquillity of conscience there are many roads but one termination and plato says in his republic that the point where all paths meet is the souls true restingplace and the journeys end the end
