hero of rome douglas jackson prologue the flames reached out to him like a lovers arms as he walked naked between the twin fires he felt their warm caress upon his skin but knew they could not harm him for they were the flames of taranis and he was the gods servant another mans flesh would have been scorched and shrivelled by their heat yet he remained untouched when he reached the far side of the chamber aymer high priest of the sect awaited him with the clothing he would wear on his journey cleansed and blessed in its turn the druid was very ancient a shrunken husk of a man dried out and worn down by all the long years of toil and study and abstinence in the great oakwalled halls of pencerrig but the life force was still strong in him and gwlym felt it now along with a palpable expansion of his own mind as the milky faded eyes locked on his no words were spoken as aymer passed to him the knowledge that would take him to his goal but he saw the path ahead clearly the black mountains with their deep gorges and narrow paths along foaming rockstrewn streams the great river swirling deep and dark which he must cross unseen then more dangerous still the flat green pastureland with its wellworn tracks and curious inhabitants before he reached the final sanctuary of the forests and the faraway sea it is done the priest said his voice brittle with age the cleansing is complete gwlym dressed quickly and followed the druid into the darkness where the ponies waited they picked their way through the night along hidden trackways until they reached the edge of a low cliff overlooking a narrow beach from below came the gentle hiss of waves breaking rhythmically against a pebble shore and he saw a shadowy figure working on the fragile wood and animalskin craft which would carry him across the light or lack of it made the sea a dull leaden silver and beyond it was visible the darker more sinister contour of the mainland shorter routes existed between mona the sacred isle of the druids and the country of the deceangli but they would undoubtedly be watched they will come for us soon aymers words were barely audible by then you must have completed your task gwlym nodded there was nothing more to say he understood he would never see aymer again after this night soon the legions of rome would march through those same mountain gorges to destroy the last stronghold of the druids and break their power for ever he felt the dull ache of regret at the knowledge he would not share the fate of the priests who had trained him and nurtured his unceasing quest for knowledge but he had his own mission and it was more important still for even as the spears of the legions descended upon mona he would fan the embers of the longneglected fire that was celtic pride and create a conflagration that would consume every roman and every romanlover on the island of britain shame and resentment and humiliation would be his greatest weapons after sixteen years of conquest and debasement the tribes were ripe for rebellion all they needed was a spark and a leader gwlym would be the spark the gods would provide the leader carry the word carry it far but carry it with care you must not be taken aymer paused allowing gwlym time to reflect on the grim reality of his last words counsel patience when the time is right the gods will send a sign the wrath of andraste will rain from the sky and the people of britain will rise from their bondage and sweep the usurpers from our land in a maelstrom of blood and flame the wrath of andraste the younger man whispered the words to himself as if they were a prayer before he picked his way carefully down to the beach without a backward glance i what was the ruin of sparta and athens but this that mighty as they were in war they spurned from them as aliens those whom they had conquered claudius emperor of rome ad severn valley siluria september ad could it only have been ten minutes gaius valerius verrens gritted his teeth behind his smile and his eyes locked on his opponents but the message if message there were beneath those hooded lids was the opposite of what he wanted to see the bastard was mocking him he breathed hard through his nostrils drawing in the sharp pine scent of the freshly cut stump on which his right elbow rested at the same time he felt the agony that had been tearing the big muscle in his upper arm ease a little he channelled the relief up into his forearm and along his inner wrist to the fingers of his right hand the increase in power must have been infinitesimal he barely registered it himself but he noticed a slight movement as crespos eyebrows twitched and he knew the centurion had sensed it too so the hand that gripped his the elbow resting precisely to the left of his own was horny and calloused and had all the yield of a hypocaust brick fingers like talons clasped with a force designed to break bone but he resisted the temptation to meet the challenge instead he directed all his own strength into moving crespos fist to the left any movement even a hairs breadth would do so far crespo hadnt yielded even that but then again neither had he the thought made him grin and the crowd of legionaries ringing the tree stump cheered encouragement at the sign of confidence arm wrestling was a favoured pastime in the first cohort of the twentieth legion all you needed was a flat surface and the inclination sometimes they wrestled for fun sometimes to gamble and sometimes because they hated each others guts the first had been in the temporary camp in the lee of the silurian hill fort for six days when the cavalry patrol had failed to return two weeks earlier the legates reaction had been immediate reprisal in force three thousand men five legionary cohorts and a mixed unit of auxiliary infantry and horse from gaul and thrace had marched behind their standards down the river severn then west into the rough hill country beyond they had found the heads twenty of them still in their helmets like marker points on a trail a few unfortunate celtic peasants picked up along the way and put to the question had led them here it had taken five of those six days to dig the ditch and rampart around the base of the rugged hill which now entirely isolated the forts inhabitants from either help or escape when the legionaries werent digging they spent the time on guard drilling exercising or patrolling but during their occasional rest periods they were able to sit outside their leather eightman tents and do the things soldiers always do mend and polish their equipment gamble their pay away and grumble about their officers or just sit and stare at the sky and the bluegrey haze of the distant mountains valerius concentrated on his right arm attempting to will more power into it the big muscle bulged below the short sleeve of his tunic as if it were trying to burst free from the skin and he could see the twisting snakes of dark veins beneath the tanned surface it had swelled to the size of a small melon and matched that of crespo who was judged the strongest man in the cohort the forearm was broad tapering towards the wrist where the tendons stood out like tree roots his wrist was bound firmly to crespos by a strap of red cloth so that neither man could shift his grip and win by trickery but he knew crespo would try because crespo was a cheat a liar and a thief but he was also a senior centurion which made him untouchable almost he had discovered crespo beating one of the new recruits young quintus from ravenna with the gnarled vine stick he carried as the traditional badge of his rank every centurion disciplined his men because discipline was what made a legion a legion but crespo confused discipline with brutality or maybe he just enjoyed brutality for its own sake because he had beaten quintus half to death when valerius ordered him to stop crespo had looked him up and down with those expressionless icechip eyes of his the two men had a history of sorts but one that was more animal wariness than physical hostility the first time theyd met had been like two dogs coming together on a narrow path a rising of the hackles a sizing up of strengths and weaknesses a quick sniff and a moving on gone but far from forgotten now he stared into crespos features from two feet away did he sense uncertainty by the gods he hoped so the fire which had started in the crook of his elbow was moving up into his shoulder and on into the base of his neck and it was like no pain hed ever experienced crespos washedout eyes glared back from a long narrow face that had somehow stayed pale while the sun turned most mens walnut brown valerius could make out a pattern of individual pockmarks dotting his opponents forehead and chin evidence of some childhood disease unfortunately survived his nose was long and sharply angled like the blade of a pioneers axe and below it hung a thin rattrap mouth that reminded valerius of a vipers oh he was a handsome fellow was crespo but handsome or not he was a sword hilt taller and though valerius was broader in the chest and shoulder the centurion had the wiry strength of fifteen years in the legion the kind of strength you didnt get from running errands in the law courts still growing up on his fathers farms had given valerius his own strength and the confidence to use it the sweat started at the very edge of crespos hairline tiny almost invisible diamonds of moisture among the untidy dark stubble the units barber had left him valerius watched fascinated as they slowly grew in size until two or three joined and formed a clear drop which trickled gently down the centurions sloping forehead until it reached the point where it joined his nose and stopped he felt disappointment the droplet had seemed an omen if it had carried on and run down the blade of the axe to the tip he was certain it would have foretold victory now he wasnt so sure still it was a sign of something was there a loosening of the talons a sense that the opposing force though it felt as relentless as ever had passed its peak or was crespo luring him into a trap allowing him to think hed won and then producing a burst of energy hed kept in reserve for the moment he had him slightly off balance no wait patience tribune valerius recognized the voice but tried not to let it affect his concentration tribune verrens the tone was a little more officious than was proper in a doublepay man addressing a roman officer but when the doublepay man was clerk to the twentieths commander it seemed sensible to ignore the potential slight had enough yet pretty boy crespos lips barely moved as he hissed the words through clenched teeth the thick sicilian accent grated on valeriuss ears as much as the insult what is it soldier valerius addressed the man behind him but kept his eyes on crespo and his voice steady the joined fists remained as motionless as if they were carved in rock you are to attend the legate sir the announcement brought groans of disappointment from the dozen legionaries crowding around the tree stump valerius could have groaned with them he sensed that the contest was there to be won but you didnt keep the legate waiting which posed a problem how to extricate himself without giving crespo something to crow about he knew that the instant he relaxed the centurion would force his arm over and claim victory a small thing a minor defeat which a man could easily bear and would cost nothing but a little hurt pride but he wasnt prepared to give crespo even that satisfaction he thought for a few seconds allowing crespo to anticipate his moment of triumph then maintaining his grip rose smoothly to his feet drawing the puzzled centurion with him crespo suppressed a curse and glared at valerius as the young tribune used his left hand to untie the cloth binding their wrists therell be another time i had you where i wanted you valerius laughed you had your chance centurion and i have better things to do as he pushed through the grinning crowd of off duty legionaries at the heels of the legates messenger he heard crespo boasting dismissively to his cronies the senior men he kept loyal by handing out light duties too soft theyre all the same these rich boys just shorttimers playing at soldiers it took valerius twenty minutes to wash the sweat from his body and don his uniform over his tunic and braccae the calflength trousers the legions had adopted after their first winter in britain first the dark red overtunic then the belt round his waist with the decorative apron of studded leather straps that were meant to protect his groin but in reality wouldnt stop a goose feather never mind a spear over the tunic his orderly helped him strap the lorica segmentata the jointed plate armour that covered his shoulders chest and back and would stop a spear but was also light enough to allow him to move fast and fight freely the shortbladed gladius hung from the scabbard on his left hip the weight comfortable against his upper leg ready to be crossdrawn with that musical hiss that always made the hair stand up on the back of his neck finally the heavy polished helmet with its neck protector and cheek pieces topped by the stiff scarlet horsehair crest he knew he was testing the legates patience but marcus livius drusus was a general in the mould of the great gaius marius and anything out of place would be noted and remembered when he was satisfied he marched the short distance from the bivouac he shared with another of the legions six military tribunes to the tented pavilion which doubled as the commanders living quarters and the principia the legions nerve centre the surroundings were comfortingly familiar neat rows of tents divided into units of centuries and cohorts the via praetoria stretching off to the point where it was bisected by the via principalis just before the principia and beyond that the supply area workshop tents and horse lines glevum the twentieths permanent headquarters lay forty miles to the northeast but since hed arrived in britain all those months ago freshfaced and nervous at the port on the river tamesa hed spent more time on the march or on engineering detail than in the fort marching camps like this hardly varying in any way were more home to him now than his fathers villa from the first soldiering had come perhaps not easily but certainly naturally to him in those early days hed often lain wrapped in his cloak exhausted after a long day on patrol and wondered at the fate which had brought him here where he belonged he knew instinctively that his ancestors had fought at romuluss side marched with scipio and stood with caesar at pharsalus it was there inside in every nerve and sinew he recognized the two legionaries on guard outside the principia as permanent members of the legates bodyguard the man on the right raised his eyebrows warning of the reception he was likely to receive valerius grinned his thanks then switched to his expressionless soldiers mask inside the general bent low over a sand table at the rear of the tent flanked by a pair of his aides valerius removed his helmet and stood for a few seconds before clashing his fist against his chest armour with a loud crash tribune verrens at your service sir livius turned slowly to face him the afternoon heat had left the inside of the principia airless and clammy but even so he wore the heavy scarlet cloak that marked his rank over his full dress uniform and by now his puffy patrician face and balding scalp matched it almost to perfection i hope i didnt disturb your games verrens the voice was excessively cultured and the tone almost solicitous perhaps we should have our tribunes wrestling in the mud with the common soldiery every morning it would raise their morale considerably to inflict a few lumps and bumps on their officers we might even lose a few but then tribunes arent much good for anything in any case yes good for morale but not good for discipline the final sentence was barked out with all the venom livius could inject into it valerius picked out a worn spot on the tent wall behind the legates right shoulder as he prepared to ride out the inevitable storm the legionary commander spat out his words like a volley of ballista bolts discipline verrens is what has allowed rome to conquer every worthwhile part of this world and to dominate whats left discipline not courage not organization not even the untold riches of the empire discipline the kind of discipline that will keep a legionary holding the line while his comrades fall one by one at his side the discipline that will keep him in the fight until he has not another drop of blood to give the kind of discipline which you gaius valerius verrens by your childish desire to impress are in danger of fatally weakening do you think you made yourself more popular by challenging crespo do you want to be liked show me a legion whose officers are liked by their soldiers and i will show you a legion ripe for defeat this is the twentieth legion this is my legion and i will have discipline the only thing you achieved tribune was to diminish a centurions authority without warning the tone softened youre not a bad soldier valerius one day you may become a very good one your father asked me to take you on my staff to provide the military experience you require to make a career in politics and i fulfilled my obligation because our families have been voting side by side on the field of mars for ten generations but the one thing i have learned in our time together is that you are no politician flattery and dissembling are not in your nature nor is a natural desire to curry favour you lack true ambition which is essential and you are honest which is most certainly not if you follow the political path you will fail i have already tried to tell your father this but perhaps i was overly subtle for he still sees you in the senate some day what age are you twentytwo twentythree a quaestorship in three years atop some desert dung heap twelve months spent attempting to prevent your rapacious governor or proconsul from ruining his province and its people valerius was surprised enough to allow his eyes to drop and meet the legates oh yes tribune i have been there counting every sestertius and gasping at the mans greed then counting them again just to be sure he hasnt stolen a few more and after that a year back in rome perhaps with an appointment perhaps not that is when your future will be decided and by then it will be in your hands valerius could see the two aides still staring at the model on the sand table and trying to look as if they werent listening the legate followed his gaze leave us the two men saluted and hurriedly made for the door come valerius followed his commander across the dirt floor towards the sand table there will be a day valerius when your soldiers are mere coins to be spent what will you do then when you know you must order them into the abyss the truth is that they do not seek your friendship but your leadership here he pointed at the sand table which held a perfect miniature replica of the hill and the british fortress sir it is time to end this ii the silurian chieftain looked down from the wooden ramparts towards the symmetrical lines of the roman encampment and fought back an unfamiliar panic he was puzzled and yes frightened not frightened for himself or for the impetuous warriors who had brought this upon him but for the people who had come to this place seeking sanctuary but were instead facing annihilation within the walls of the fortress stood perhaps a hundred and fifty thatched roundhouses clustered in the lee of the ramparts or around the little temple in the centre of the compound dedicated to the god teutates the inhabitants farmed the fields in the surrounding countryside hunted and fished and traded the surplus to the less fortunate communities of which he was also the overlord in the rugged hills to the west normally the fort would support fewer than five hundred people today all the warrior strength he could gather and an additional thousand refugees scrabbled for space among the huts and fought for water from the single well the ambush on the roman cavalry patrol had been carried out at the orders of the high king of the silures who had in turn received guidance from his druid who had no doubt received similar guidance from the leaders of his sect in faraway mona he had been against it but how could he a lowly border chieftain refuse his king in any case his young men were eager to test their mettle against the enemy who paraded across their hills and their valleys as if they were their masters but the high king was a long way from the soldiers who now threatened his fortress one tribe would feel the power of the romans revenge and it would be this one he had always intended to fight his honour and his authority depended on it but initially he had intended to fight and run this was not the first time he had seen a roman legion prepare for battle ten years before in a valley not three days ride away he had stood with the catuvellauni war leader caratacus when the long line of brightly painted shields crossed the river and the last great alliance of the british tribes had smashed itself against them the way a wave breaks against a rocky shoreline he knew what the romans were capable of his puzzlement had begun when the legionaries started digging and by the time hed worked out why his opportunity to run had gone now his people were in a fortress within a fortress trapped but the puzzlement only turned to fear when the messengers he sent to ask for terms and offer hostages failed to return such offers had always been accepted in the past the reason this one was not became clear when the leader of the ambush explained the fate of the roman auxiliary cavalrymen and clearer still when the heads of his two messengers were sent back by a roman catapult father at first he didnt acknowledge the melodious highpitched cry because he needed every ounce of courage and he knew that even to look at her would weaken his resolve please father he turned at last gilda stood at her mothers side part child part woman liquid doe eyes beneath an untidy fringe of raven hair for a moment their combined beauty cast aside the bleak shadow that blanketed his mind but only for a moment the thought of what might happen to them in the next few hours placed a lump of stone in his throat and he barely knew his own voice i told you to go to the temple he said to his wife who for reasons only a woman would understand wore her best grey dress on this of all days you will be safe there he could see she didnt believe him but what could he tell her another man would have given her a dagger and instructed her to use it but he wasnt that man he had spoken more sharply than he intended and gilda gave him a look of reproach as they walked away hand in hand when he turned back to the ramparts and the roman preparations below his vision was strangely blurred valerius stared up at the fortress on the flattopped hill he had seen native oppida like it many times but this was by far the largest and the most skilfully constructed he studied it carefully impressed by the engineering the approaches had been cunningly designed to force attackers to assault the palisaded walls from an angle so that they would be more exposed to the slings and spears of the defenders he could see those defenders now a silent line of heads silhouetted against the sky above the first of the three ramparts that encompassed an area measuring as much as two legionary encampments the legate called for his chief engineer who had been summoned from glevum when a siege became inevitable it may look formidable livius growled but this place is no alesia and i do not have caesars patience how long before the heavy weapons are ready the man chewed his lip but livius knew him well enough to be certain he had the answer to hand one hour for the onagers and ballistas perhaps two more for the big catapults we had a little trouble at the last river crossing you have two hours to put everything in place he also knew the engineer well enough to be certain he had built in the leeway to be able to meet his generals deadline two onagers two ballistas and a single catapult between each pair of watchtowers later the heavy chopping sound that was instantly recognizable as the discharge of a ballista brought him from his tent he looked up at the sun and a particularly sensitive watcher might have noted the shadow of a smile cross the stern features two hours less perhaps ten minutes good a ranging shot sir short by a dozen yards the engineer announced a waste of a bolt but well do better this time more tension on the rope there valerius hurried across to join them and watched as the weapons commander hauled on the winch and the two front arms of the ballista bent noticeably back as the ratchet turned noisily it was a big bow really one that shot massive fivefoot arrows with heavy needlepointed iron heads a big mechanical bow encased in a wooden frame and mounted on a cart for easy transportation they called the arrows shieldsplitters and he had seen the destruction they could do to an enemy battle line they would be equally deadly when they fell among the british warriors and the shambling mob of refugees who had sought the false security of the fortress walls those walls were now ringed by twenty ballistas and the same number of onagers the little stonethrowing catapults experience told him the onagers would struggle to hurl their tenpound projectiles over the walls of the inner rampart but they would add to the chaos and the panic there would be no such problems for the big catapults the long fifteenfoot arm could throw a boulder five times the size of a mans head from one side of this hill to the other weapon armed and ready sir the engineer scuttled round to the rear of the ballista and stared along the launching ramp towards the fortress another elevation the ballista commander lifted the central beam of the weapon a notch and stood back as the engineer again checked the aim the calculations twitching one by one across his furrowed brow eventually he turned back towards livius you have the honour general the legate nodded ballista fire from the eastern gateway of his fortress the silurian chieftain heard a soft thud at the base of the hill and detected a flicker of movement against the green and brown of the earth below in the same second some force disturbed the air close by his left shoulder plucking at the heavy cloth of his cloak and a moment later he heard a shriek from within the fortress behind him he turned knowing what he would see at first he wasnt certain whether it was one person or two writhing in the dust they must have been standing face to face when they were hit mother and son brother and sister lovers it did not matter now the ballista bolt had taken the man in the centre of the back punching through his spine on the downward arc of its trajectory the impact of the strike had thrown him forward and the point of the fivefoot arrow had pierced the womans lower body so that now they squirmed and gasped and quivered in some obscene parody of the act of love it had begun livius nodded to the engineer to continue and turned to valerius he looked the young tribune up and down yes the boy would do a credit to his father even if the father was not a credit to him of medium height but powerfully built with it crowdark hair cropped short beneath the polished helmet a strong jaw and a sculpted chin with its almost invisible central cleft shadowed with the slightest stubble serious eyes of a deep aqueous green confidently returned his stare but look a little closer and there was something slightly disturbing about those eyes a hint of what might be cruelty that would attract a certain type of woman and hidden in their depths the unyielding hardness which made him the right man for this mission he had his orders but no harm in reinforcing them rome does not generally place her tribunes in peril but in your case i have decided to make an exception you attack in two days at dawn our gaulish auxiliaries will carry out a diversionary assault on the western gateway it will provide you with your opportunity once they have engaged the enemy and drawn their reserves you will assault the eastern gate with three cohorts of heavy infantry more than fifteen hundred men i have studied the east gate once the catapults have done their work it will not hold you for long remember take the fight to them and do not stop killing until there are no more warriors left to kill that is the price they pay for murdering romes soldiers the women and children will be taken as slaves anyone too old or too sick to march well you know what must be done for rome for the next two nights valerius watched as the bombardment battered the rebel defences he had seen what the artillery could do the casual arbitrary malevolence that turned one family into bloody scraps fit for nothing but the dogs and the next second immolated a dozen warriors in an allencompassing fireball that left them blackened smoking imitations of the human form it was the big catapults of course with their boulders that would take out a section of wall or gate and everyone behind it and the fiery missiles that stank of pitch and sulphur and consumed hut and flesh alike the assault continued spasmodically through the night the impact of each deathbringer preceded by the distinct sound of its passage the almighty whooshing surge of the giant rocks and the peculiar whup whup whup sound of the fireballs as they spun through the air against the awesome violence of the catapults the more numerous projectiles of the smaller weapons would seem almost puny by comparison but still they would take their toll among the packed ranks of the refugees and the doomed warriors who stood on the ramparts defiant as if flesh and blood alone could halt the roman assault he tried to blank out images of the exposed bones of shattered children tried not to imagine the screams of the dismembered or those impaled or blinded by splinters as the wooden palisades and the once mighty gates were smashed flat on the morning of the third day an hour before dawn the three cohorts of the assault force formed up amid the flickering torchlight on the camps parade ground valerius stood silently at the centre of the square beside the legions eagle and the individual unit standards held aloft by the signiferi their rank and role emphasized by the wolffur cloaks they wore each man here had signed up for twentyfive years in the legions as a military tribune valerius had joined for six months served sixteen because the life agreed with him and would be sent home in another eight months at most he gazed slowly round the square attempting to judge the mood but in the darkness every face was lost in the shadow of a helmet brim im leading an army of the dead the thought entered his head before he could suppress it and he shuddered was it an ill omen he made the sign against evil and took a deep breath you all know me his firm voice carried across the parade ground and you know im only here because your primus pilus twisted his leg the other day he regrets his absence but not as much as i do a few of them laughed at that but not many valerius knew that some of them would be glad the legions feared senior centurion would not be there to hound them up the hill but the veterans understood that the loss of experience could cost lives he noticed crespo in his distinctive helmet with the curved transverse crest scowl youve all done this a hundred times before and theres nothing on that hill you have to fear when we go we go fast and we stop for nothing anyone whos wounded on the way is left behind and that includes the officers stay tight because the tighter we are the safer we are ill be up front with the first cohort and where i lead you follow they wont be expecting us to come knocking on the front door so it should be simple this time they did laugh because they knew it was a lie the sides of the hill were too steep for a direct assault on the walls only the two gateways to the east and the west were vulnerable and the enemy would be waiting behind both once were inside the gate its over he ended decisively these people may know how to fight but they dont know how to win we know how to win they cheered him and pride rose up inside him like water from a spring he felt a bond with these men that was stronger than family a comradeship of the spirit tempered in the heat of battle they had marched together and fought together and there was a fair chance that when the sun came up they would die together their blood mingling in the mud of a british ditch all of them knew that some of the men who marched up that hill would not be coming down again but instead of weakening them the knowledge gave them strength that was what made them what they were soldiers of rome he issued detailed instructions to each of the unit commanders in turn finally approaching crespo who was to lead the second cohort he found it difficult to hide his dislike for the man but the hour before an attack was a time to put aside petty rivalries he could see the pale eyes glittering in the darkness but he couldnt read what was in them may your god protect you crespo the centurion followed mithras and somewhere in the camp was the hidden shrine where he would have made a sacrifice to the bullslayer it was a secretive cult but anyone who survived the initiation was worthy of respect for courage at least soldiers did well not to ignore the gods but valerius worshipped them the way most men did doing just enough to keep them happy and calling on them in time of need stay close on the way in once were past the gates the first will hold the enemy in position while you punch a hole through their line with the second when youre beyond them turn and well crush them between us it was a good plan but its success depended on many different factors he had fought the celtic warriors of western britain before and for all his confident talk about their weaknesses he knew them for courageous fighters prepared to die in defence of what was theirs today they would have no choice because they had nowhere to run crespo grunted suspiciously so we do the fighting and dying while you hide behind your shields and take all the glory valerius felt the anger rise in him but bit back the words that accompanied it no point in getting into an argument with the embittered sicilian dying is what we are paid to do centurion he said and turned away before crespo could reply iii the barrage paused and for a few seconds the soft false light of the grey predawn was accompanied by an unearthly calm the serenity broken only by the crackle of burning wood from the hilltop at the head of his men valerius closed his eyes and tried to read the sounds at first nothing but a moment later he heard the muted growl he knew was the start of the auxiliary attack he kept his eyes shut a little longer enjoying a final moment of peace and when he opened them a fire arrow arched through the sky like a shooting star now he led the legionaries at the trot eight abreast in their centuries the legate had placed a screen of archers to the right and left of the assault point and as the spearhead of the attack passed them the bowmen loosed a flight of arrows that harvested the defenders from the first of the three ramparts valerius had spent the two days preparing for the attack examining every inch of the eastern slope and he had noted something that gnawed like a maggot at his brain the most obvious route to the gate had a very clear entrance but no apparent exit of course the way out could be hidden a tunnel perhaps but that even in a fortress of this size would be the expenditure of enormous effort for very little gain the longer he looked at it the less he liked it the anomaly might have a perfectly innocent explanation but in valeriuss experience nothing in war was innocent now he made his choice knowing he was gambling his soldiers lives on the result he led his men swiftly past the first opening and on to a sloping platform running parallel with the fortress walls and when it took a sharp uphill turn he followed it the route brought the first legionaries within range of spears hurled from the palisade that topped the second rampart form testudo at the order each man in the first century locked his shield above his head with those of the man next to him only those in the front and rear ranks and the men on the edges of the formation kept their shields vertical the result was a solid carapace which made the eighty men inside the testudo invulnerable to attack from above behind him valerius knew each century in the attacking cohorts would be following his example now he was operating on pure instinct following the wellworn path upwards and praying the silurians had placed no more false exits or hidden traps a dozen kneedeep pits could shatter a testudo in less time than it took to draw his sword no a fortress this size must be a place of commerce as well as refuge and commerce meant ease of access whoever had designed the defences would have been forced to make that compromise his chest was heaving his arm ached from holding the heavy shield above his head and the breath rasped in his throat sweat blinded his eyes in the little oven of his iron helmet with the big cheek flaps that restricted his vision but wouldnt save him from a blade to his throat the clatter of spears and arrows against the outer surface of the testudo was almost constant now like a heavy shower of rain death was everywhere around him but he had never felt more alive he thought of his father mouldering in semiretirement on the country estate in the pretty wooded valley close to fidenae and making his plans to revive the familys political fortunes plans which had valerius at their very heart next year he would have to return to resume his legal career touting for minor cases outside the basilica julia snapping up the crumbs left by brighter minds it wasnt that he disliked the law to sit and listen to one of the great practitioners wield logic and rhetoric the way a champion retiarius wielded net and trident was one of lifes pleasures but to stand up before a court didnt light a fire in his belly the way he knew it must do in a cicero or a seneca only combat did that and the gate they had reached the gate ram to the front the missiles had destroyed the gate structure beyond recognition but the britons had used the smashed timbers to form a makeshift barrier it wouldnt take long to clear though it would delay the assault and hed seen what happened when attacks became delayed the battering ram was with the second century but the legions practised reforming the testudo under fire until it was almost habit and the big rectangular shields quickly formed a tunnel that allowed the ram squad forward most legionaries were small men iron tough but more gristle than muscle compared with them the soldiers who wielded the legions battering ram were broadchested giants they had to be to handle the specially reinforced oak trunk that was their stockintrade still it took too long and he heard the inevitable crashes and screams that told him the britons were making good use of the boulders the catapults had hurled at them now they were dropping those stones some of them weighing as much as a small ox on to the testudines following him the defences were sure against light weapons but a big boulder would smash a gaping hole in the shields and then the spears and arrows could seek out the soldiers below the testudo would reunite quickly enough but behind him he knew men were dying at last he stepped sharply aside to allow the ram to do its work the massive head of carved stone surging forward with the strength of twenty men behind it to smash the pathetic blockage aside one two three yes three that would do it first cohort with me for rome as he turned to lead the way through the breach in the british defences he glimpsed a line of snarling moustached faces from the gap between his helmets cheek pieces a shower of burning fat thrown from his left spattered his legs and he screamed a curse now he was inside the fortress and his men filed past him to make the line and he stopped thinking and allowed training to take over forward the curveedged shields of the leading cohorts first and second centuries locked in one solid defensive wall and the weight of the attack was multiplied by the addition of two further lines at the far right of the first line valerius tightened his fist on the wooden grip at the rear of the shield boss bunched his muscles in the arm straps and butted the edge against that of the man to his left he knew every man to his rear would be holding his shield aloft to protect the front line from spears and arrows fired by the defenders the romans had their own spear the pilum a fourfoot shaft of ash tipped with an arms length of tempered iron but no one carried one today because they were long heavy and awkward and would only have slowed the attack creating more casualties than they caused this was a day for swords the momentum of the initial breakthrough had pushed the defenders back a dozen paces but now they counterattacked in a single howling mass four or five hundred strong valerius flinched as an arrow nicked his helmet an inch above his right eye and he braced himself for the impact of the charge his eyes searching the barbarian ranks for the man who wanted to kill him there was always one the single individual who hungered for your blood more than any other who saw in your face everything he hated most in this world it took a moment because his eye naturally fell upon the british champions the big men made even taller by hair limestarched into spikes and horns who were the pick of their tribe and carried long iron swords or broadbladed ash spears they fought barechested to prove their courage and decorated their skin with blue tattoos that told the story of their heritage and their bravery in battle but the man who wished to kill him was no champion short with lank dirtyblond hair and a slight frame from which hung a filthy ragged shirt he looked almost harmless in that warrior throng because he didnt carry a sword or a spear only a curved dagger with an edge that gleamed blue from constant union with the whetstone but his eyes told a different story they burned with an enmity beyond hatred a mindless promise of violent painful death all this valerius noted in the time it took his enemy to cover a single pace he knew that the mans lack of height could be an advantage in this kind of fight and it made him doubly dangerous for the battle would be fought above the belly and he would come in low under the big shield and that gleaming blade would seek out the romans unprotected genitals or try to hamstring him valerius experienced a chill in his lower guts yes it would be the balls the haunted eyes told of a loss beyond bearing a loss that could only be avenged by inflicting horror upon its perpetrators a mighty crash announced that the first britons had collided with the centre of the roman shield wall he felt the impact shiver along the line bringing with it a roll like thunder as hundreds of swords began hammering at the painted oak shields as if by obliterating the twentieths emblem of a charging boar they were obliterating the men themselves above the rim of his shield he watched his enemy come with the extreme left of the british attack to the mans right were warriors bigger and better armed but still valeriuss instinct told him this was where the true danger lay when the burning eyes disappeared below the level of the shield he counted the heartbeats one he would have covered another pace two he was crouching preparing to roll under the shield and stab upward the blade seeking the big artery in the groin three with the strength of his shoulder behind it valerius smashed his shield forward and down so that the rounded iron boss struck the charging briton above the bridge of the nose smashing flesh to instant pulp the impact forcing his eyeballs from their sockets and splintering skull bone deep into the brain the blow numbed valeriuss left arm but as it was struck his right was already moving a lightning flick of the gladius that ripped out his enemys throat in a spray of scarlet he felt the flame of exultation explode within him as it always did when he took a life and he tried to still it because he believed the savage atavistic joy shamed him he would never reveal or try to explain that feeling beyond the brotherhood of the battlefield only those who had experienced it could understand that most elemental of human reactions to the most basic of human experiences to survive and to kill the inner fire flared and was gone replaced in an instant by cold calculation from his left a silurian spear sought out the weak point below his armour he brushed it aside with the strengthened edge of the scutum and snarling defiance he was back in line the shield rim hooking behind his neighbours with the breath rasping in his chest he took time to listen attempting to gauge the battle and noticing for the first time the throatfilling stink from the burning huts and granaries the rubbish pits and animal dung and human excrement that lay in haphazard piles all around the main force of the british attack had struck the middle of the roman line and it was here that the howls of impotent rage and screams of the maimed and dying were centred for the moment valerius was happy that his legionaries could contain the enemy crespo could not be far away he heard the call he had been waiting for cornicen the trumpeter who had been hovering behind the line appeared at his shoulder valerius spoke to the man on his left side shouting to be certain he was heard above the clamour of battle on me wheel right ten at the signal he gave time for the order to be passed along the wall of shields sound the command the trumpeter pursed his lips and hesitated for a second before the circular horn blasted out its message the manoeuvre valerius had ordered was complicated and potentially dangerous and he would only have asked it of men he trusted with his life it meant the entire roman line would pivot on his position like a door opening simple for the legionary two or three along from his commander who only had to move forward half a step but not for the unfortunate soldier on the far left of the line who would have to put his shoulder to his shield and smash his way ten paces forward aided by the power of the two men at his back and all without losing formation but ten paces could be the difference between defeat and victory because through the gap if he had timed it correctly crespo was now charging with his centuries in wedge formation arrowheaded human battering rams that would hammer their way through the enemy ranks utterly destroying their cohesion and then turn and attack them from the rear an increase in the intensity of the battle told him hed been right he stepped back and allowed the man behind him to take his place in the line a few yards away the ruins of a shattered roundhouse gave him a vantage point from which he could view the entire length of the british fort studying the smokewreathed hilltop he realized that crespo had added a refinement to his plan or perhaps deliberately disobeyed orders two of his eightyman wedges had punched all the way through to the west gate and from there the auxiliaries of the diversionary attack were now pouring into the fort killing as they came and not distinguishing between fighters and the women and children the legate had ordered taken captive now the britons valerius had faced were trapped hundreds of warriors corralled between the two legionary forces and the fortress wall some attempted to escape by climbing the rampart but there would be no refuge from the bowmen posted at the base of the hill sharp cries rang out from within the midst of those remaining and valerius knew they were calling for mercy but there would be no mercy only the long slumber of the roman peace a roman legion was a killing machine and now he watched that machine at work no amount of silurian courage would change the outcome in the confined space the long curved swords of the britons had little or no room to swing and when they did they expended their force against the three layers of hardwood that made up a legionary shield the gladius was different jabbing between gaps in the shield wall the short razoredged swords ripped into belly and groin then twisted free creating a gaping wound that left a man praying for death then the big shields smashed forward and the swords flicked again the legionaries of the first cohort worked with a studied concentration that made no distinction between old or young brave or fearful the celts were beasts to be slaughtered at first valerius was fascinated by this utterly disciplined lack of humanity the relentless rhythm of death which eventually left the prospective victims slackjawed with horror and sapped of the will even to defend themselves but the fascination faded as the individual details of the butchery burned themselves on to the surface of his brain the moment he felt some fragile barrier in his mind threaten to crumble he turned and walked away through the chaos of victory surviving women and children huddled for protection amongst the wreckage of the wattleanddaub huts by the south wall close by the bodies of the elders who had stood with them only a few moments earlier still twitched in an untidy heap valerius studied the prisoners but none would meet his eye he was reminded of cattle marked for slaughter disturbed by the smell of blood from those who had gone before but helpless to escape their fate meanwhile fighting continued all around him small skirmishes involving groups of warriors who had defended the west gate individual britons fleeing for their lives from a dozen legionaries still lost in the frenzy of battle the air was filled with screams but one scream was different it was a childs scream of pure terror he knew he should walk away what was another childs life in this slaughterhouse but the scream was repeated and he realized it came from one of the few surviving huts less than twenty paces away two legionaries stood in the doorway with their backs towards him beside the crumpled body of a woman in a torn grey dress he dropped his shield against the fence of a nearby animal enclosure and advanced to place the point of his gladius below the closer mans ear the legionary froze first rule of war soldier valerius said quietly if you dont keep your mind on the job you get yourself killed the second legionary turned with a nervous grin he looked towards the first soldier questioningly but valerius shook his head and maintained just enough pressure on the sword to keep him honest nothing in there youd want to see sir i think i should decide that for myself soldier what century are you third of the second sir we a muffled cry of distress interrupted his words and valerius pushed past him and stepped into the hut at first he could see nothing in the darkness but as his eyes acclimatized to the gloom he heard a rhythmic shuffling and traced it to a white blur at the rear of the hut on closer inspection the blur was identified as a pair of male buttocks heaving and thrusting at something below it he gave the buttocks a sharp kick and the heaving stopped the man turned his head and stared up at him the pale eyes were no longer expressionless they could have been those of the briton valerius had killed earlier the only difference was that in crespos the killing rage was more controlled go and find your own whore the centurions voice was slurred with lust and contained a clear warning he turned contemptuously away and began deliberately thrusting his hips back and forth in a brutal almost violent motion over his shoulder valerius could see two terrified painfilled eyes he remembered the screams and wondered why the girl she could be no more than twelve years old now stayed silent then crespo moved again and he understood as he held his victim down with one hand with the other the centurion had forced a dagger between the girls lips the point at the back of her throat he only had to shift his weight and she would be dead valerius almost gagged on the wave of disgust that swept through him he turned as if to walk away then spun and with all his strength swung a kick that took crespo on the side of the skull pitching him clear off the girl and catapulting the dagger from his hand the kick would have knocked a lesser man senseless crespo only shook his head and launched himself across the hut valerius was able to half sidestep the charge but crespo caught him with just enough force to throw him off balance and send his own sword flying a fist landed a glancing blow below valeriuss left cheek and he felt fingers clawing for his eyes he retaliated with a punch of his own that took the centurion square on the chin and knocked him backwards so he stumbled and almost fell when he stooped to the floor valerius thought he had stunned or disabled him but crespo straightened with the knife glittering in his right hand the sicilian didnt hesitate he came in fast holding the dagger low point upwards and feinting right and left but valerius knew he would go for the soft flesh of the lower belly just below the armour he had no doubt that crespo wanted to kill him but he felt no fear at the sight of the blade it was what made him a soldier he knew instinctively he was quicker than his opponent he allowed the centurion to come in close before twisting his body so that the thrust slid down his left side the blade scored his hip and he gasped at the lightning streak of pain but the sacrifice had been worthwhile as he pivoted he grasped crespos knife arm with both hands and used the mans momentum to swing him against the centre post of the hut with a force that shook the whole structure the centurions unprotected face took most of the impact and he reeled back spitting blood and teeth with one eye already swelling closed still he retained the strength to stagger towards valerius would the man never give up the tribune allowed crespo to take two tottering paces then stepped forward and smashed the reinforced crossbrace of his helmet into the centurions forehead dropping him like a poleaxed bull valerius picked up his sword and stood over the prone body he remembered the feeling of power when he had killed the briton and fought back the urge to experience it again it would be neater crespo was capable of anything he would never forgive or forget the disgrace of a defeat but the moment passed quickly and all valerius felt was a curious emptiness a sob attracted his attention and he turned to see the girl standing naked against the rear wall of the hut with one hand to her mouth and the other covering her sex fresh blood stained her inner thighs and valerius had to look away you he snapped to the two men staring wide eyed from the doorway cover her up and put her with the rest he took a last sickened look at the figure on the floor noisily snoring through a broken nose when he wakes up tell him to report to the legate iv you are a fool valerius you should have killed him and had done with it instead you burden me with trouble i dont need and paperwork i dont have time to deal with valerius stood at attention in front of the legates desk exactly where crespo should have been standing the general pursed his lips and frowned did you really think i would arrest crespo the man may only be a centurion but he has powerful friends when i took command of this legion i received letters of commendation about him from my three predecessors look he waved a document he had been reading one of them is now a consul another a military adviser to the emperor i do not need enemies like that he raped i know what you say he did but where is your evidence the two soldiers you say watched him claim they saw nothing the girl is dead valerius remembered the helpless sobbing figure being led from the hut of course the legate was right hed been a fool even if what you say is true and i dont doubt that it is i would remind you that this is a punishment expedition the men of this tribe murdered twenty of my cavalry and they have paid the price for it some would say the price was light and that centurion crespo was only carrying out the punishment in his own fashion he may have overstepped his orders but im too short of experienced officers to lose him tribunes come and tribunes go but our centurions are the backbone of the legion but the law valerius protested we came here to bring these people under the protection of the empire are they to be denied that protection allowing crespo to do what he did and go free makes us as much barbarians as the celts a spark of anger flared in the legates eyes do not try my patience tribune not only are you a fool but you are a naive fool there is no law on the battlefield keep your highminded arguments for the courts you talk of civilization but you cannot have civilization without order we came to this island to bring order and order can only be achieved by the use of force rome has decided the tribes are a resource to be harvested if we must flatter their kings to get the best crop we will do so if flattery fails i am prepared to exterminate as many as it takes to ensure the message is heard and understood if you do not have the stomach for the work say so and i will have you on the first ship home it is important that we demonstrate to the silurians who rule here the scouting party they ambushed was no ordinary patrol it included a metallurgist sent directly from rome somewhere out there he waved a hand to indicate the hills to the west is the primary source of british gold it was his job to find it instead he ended up with his head on a pole he paused and stared out of the tent to where the legionaries and auxiliaries were busy dismantling the camp around them i had intended to continue this demonstration but that is no longer possible i have received orders to retire to glevum and prepare for a major campaign next year we will march on mona the name sent a shiver through valerius every roman had heard of the bloodsoaked druids isle and the terrible rites that took place there the druids are at the heart of every obstacle we face in britain the legate continued but by the time next years harvest ripens there will be no more druids governor paulinus intends to attack the sects stronghold with two legions including the twentieth we will wipe the island clean of the vermin priests and every briton who follows them and when that phase is completed we will turn south and destroy the power of the ordovices and silures once and for all he turned to face valerius you will take the first cohort to winter at colonia claudia victricensis a season repairing roads in the snow is just what they need to keep them battleready work them hard and when theyre not working train them hard they are my best fighting troops and you are my best fighting officer do not let me down valerius opened his mouth to protest colonia claudiuss city of victory lay a hundred miles to the east and was the last place he wanted to be posted when the legion was preparing for an important campaign it had been the site of the british surrender to the emperor when it was known as camulodunum and was the first roman city created in britain although it was becoming increasingly overshadowed by the new port and administrative centre at londinium livius continued before he could interrupt centurion crespo will only be fit for light duties for some weeks the legate suppressed a smile remembering the battered face and outraged protestations of innocence he will accompany the main unit to glevum where he will be given duties commensurate with his standing and his rank under normal circumstances he would take over the first cohort when you return to rome but that may not be ideal i will think on it for a moment valerius thought he had misheard hed been certain the summer campaign meant a reprieve the legate read the look on his face oh yes valerius you cannot escape your destiny in the spring you will return the first to glevum and then await a ship to take you back to rome i will be sorry to lose you my boy i did try to intercede on your behalf but it would take more than a legate and an impending battle to alter what is written on a bureaucrats scroll four days later valerius led his men in full marching order past the wooden walls of londinium and smiled as he heard the subdued muttering behind him the city called to him just as loudly as it did to his soldiers but where the legionaries heard the siren sound of the inns and the brothels along the quay valerius craved only his first proper bath in three months theyre restless his second in command julius a twentyyear veteran who had replaced crespo as the units senior centurion rode at his side auxiliary cavalry scouts ranged ahead and on the flanks and behind the two commanders the cohort marched in its centuries theyre not alone valerius agreed the men knew that the slaves captured at the hill fort would bring them a months pay each and a soldier never liked to keep money in his purse for long but weve been ordered directly to colonia and that means another two hours on the road and two more with a shovel before we can rest a pity id have liked to visit londinium again its surprising how the place has grown in only a year julius followed his gaze from behind the wooden palisade the smoke from hundreds of cooking fires hazed the sky but londinium had already overflowed the boundaries set by the engineers who had sited the port and the fortress which guarded it upstream and down new buildings of wood and stone fringed the bank of the broad river tamesa where once only willows had grown now stood the homes and the workshops of merchants of every sort drawn to the town by the scent of profit at each of the three gates a settlement of huts and shops clung to the edges of roads along which the bounty of an empire passed each day it must have been close to here that claudius had fought the decisive battle which destroyed the might of the southern tribes valerius had heard fifty thousand men died that day but he knew the figure would be exaggerated soldiers always inflated their successes and then the politicians inflated them a little more no matter it had been a great victory one which had won claudius the triumph that cemented his next dozen years on the throne now he was dead and the emperor was nero a man just a year younger than valerius neros mother agrippina had died only a few months earlier hed heard whispers she had been murdered but that wasnt something a lowly tribune dwelt upon if he valued his career the cohort had marched from the silurian border on the military road through the corinium gap then on to the easier going of the gentle rolling downlands inhabited by the atrebates most romanized of all the british tribes military roads were designed to allow the legions swift passage elevated on a bed of earth and compacted stone and paralleled by two deep ditches you knew rome was here to stay when such roads spread their tentacles across the land they were the ropes that bound a vanquished nation ropes that could become a noose if circumstances required it a legion in a hurry could march twenty miles a day along these roads but valerius had set a more leisurely pace the men deserved some rest after their efforts in taking the silurian fort you were here with claudius julius shook his head not with claudius with aulus plautius claudius didnt arrive until the main battle was over it was the twentieth and the fourteenth who forced the bridges but if im being honest the second did most of the fighting i thought the ninth were there as well julius spat you know the ninth last on the battlefield and first off it valerius grinned the rivalry between the ninth and the twentieth was legendary any bar where offduty soldiers of the two met was certain to become a battleground a decurion approached and reported that one of the recent recruits to the fourth century was struggling to keep the pace his centurion requested a short halt to allow the man to recover valerius opened his mouth to agree but then he remembered the legates words of a few days earlier did he want to be liked or did he want to be a leader he shook his head i wont stop the cohort because one man cant keep up assign two of his section to help him if hes still lagging well leave him at the next way station he can rest there and follow on to colonia in his own time but julius interrupted i know valerius said sharply if they left the man behind without written orders hed have trouble persuading any military post to feed him and might well be accused of desertion this is the first cohort of the twentieth not a parade of vestal virgins when he gets to colonia make sure he gets extra training think julius think what would happen if he was left behind in some valley on the way to mona julius nodded he had seen the result when roman prisoners fell into the hands of the britons he remembered a night on guard on a river bank screams from the darkness and a terrible flaming figure and in the morning blackened lumps of charcoal that had once been men he had called friends they reached the halt by late afternoon the scouts had already marked out the position of the cohort marching camp each legionary took his place without thinking in a combined effort they had carried out a thousand times before men dug erected palisades or put up tents a fortunate few formed hunting parties to seek out hare or deer to supplement the monotonous legionary rations they had only covered a dozen miles since dawn but valerius was satisfied he knew theyd reach colonia in four more days and he was in no hurry the only thing that awaited him there was barrackroom walls and boredom he was wrong v they approached from the west on the londinium road through a gap in one of the great turf ramparts which had once defended cunobelins camulodunum colonias origins were clear the moment the city itself came into view it stood on a low flattopped rise above a river crossing a classic defensive position designed to dominate all the country around what had once been a continuous ditch backed by a turf wall and topped by a wooden palisade surrounded the city but much of it was now obliterated by new buildings and orchards to the north beyond the river the ground rose in a hogsback ridge that stretched for miles from east to west once the ridge must have been wild land wood and bog but it had been tamed by the dozens of farmsteads and the occasional small villa that dotted the hillside at the eastern end of the ridge valerius could just make out the distinctive outline of a military signal tower the layout of the farms was almost entirely roman because they were occupied by roman citizens the men who had won this land cleared it ploughed and sown it had been granted that right by the emperor claudius in honour of his victory on the tamesa they were twentyfiveyear veterans of the four legions who had conquered briton men who had reached the end of their service and been rewarded either with twenty iugera of prime land or a share in the legionary fortress they had turned into the first roman colony in britain in return they pledged their service as militia and vowed to protect what theyd been given that had been eight years earlier and from a distance it looked as though they had used the time well beyond the broken walls lay the familiar grid of streets that had originally been home to a legion once those streets would have been lined with tents then permanent legionary barracks but now insulae apartment blocks some of them three storeys high jostled the roadways valeriuss attention was drawn to a small group of soldiers gathered beside the western entrance an honour guard to welcome the cohort to its temporary home and he instinctively straightened his helmet and adjusted the plate armour beneath his cloak behind him he heard the centurions and decurions closing up the ranks he smiled of course they would want to make a show before the men of another unit but as he approached the legionaries at the gate he sensed something odd a roman soldiers equipment had changed little over the last thirty years but the armour and weapons of the men arrayed to welcome him appeared curiously dated and something else was missing a legionary had a certain posture a straightbacked solidity that hinted at strength and stamina these men looked to have neither they stood ten to each side of the roadway beneath a modest triumphal arch that was in the latter stages of completion and as valerius rode towards them a soldier wearing a centurions crested helmet stepped smartly into the road in front of him and saluted valerius reined in and dismounted returning the salute tribune gaius valerius verrens commanding the first cohort of the twentieth legion on assignment to colonia for the winter he announced formally the man pulled back his shoulders marcus quintus falco first file of the colonia militia at your service valerius attempted not to stare the militiaman facing him was like no soldier he had seen before for a start he was an old man perhaps more than fifty with a welltrimmed beard peppered with grey and a substantial paunch that bulged over his belt beneath the oftmended chainmail vest that covered his chest and shoulders his helmet was of a pattern that valerius only recognized because hed seen it on altar stones dedicated to the men of julius caesars legions men who had last worn those helmets a hundred years earlier the cloak he wore had been washed so many times the original vibrant red had faded to a sickly pink and the leather of his scabbard was worn through at the point each member of the welcoming party shared their commanders failings to a degree slumped shoulders weighed down by outofdate rustpitted armour lined faces staring out from beneath antique helmets the hands that held the spears were veined and wrinkled your scouts brought word this morning that you were on the way falco ignored the stare no soldier is more welcome here than a ranker of the twentieth we have prepared ground for your mens tents in the old horse lines but we hope that you personally will accept our hospitality and stay as a guest of the town valerius opened his mouth to refuse but julius appeared at his side before he could speak centurion julius crispinus makes his greetings he rapped out and there was a respect in his voice that surprised valerius it took a lot to win juliuss respect how are you primus pilus falco squinted focusing on the newcomers face julius an officer no it cannot be i knew a julius once who was only fit for cleaning out the latrines valerius waited for the eruption that would inevitably follow this insult but julius only laughed and i knew a first file once with shoulders like a bull not a belly like one with a grin falco reached forward to take the centurions hand by the wrist and drew him forward into an embrace that was more father and son than a meeting of military equals by the gods its good to see you again julius a centurion and a proper centurion too he reached out to touch the medals that hung from the younger mans chest where did you win these phalerae julius mumbled something and blushed like a boy and valerius decided hed better rescue his centurion you will have the opportunity to continue this reunion later he suggested id like to get the cohort settled in and fed julius find the granary and organize the replenishment of our stores sir i can take you if youd agree tribune falco offered my men will lead you to the camp ground no digging for the twentieth tonight the defences are prepared and the latrines ready valerius nodded in that case well fall them out once theyre fed they deserve something after a week on the march three hours on the town should do it but make sure everyone knows i want them back by dark or ill have the skin off their backs he paused remembering previous nights and i want them back alone defaulters to stand guard falco shook his head no need for guards here my men will cheerfully do duty for you in any case this is colonia you wont find a quieter place in the whole of the province that may be sir valerius said mildly but the first is my cohort and no cohort of mine beds down for the night without a guard not in colonia not if we were in the forum in rome falco acknowledged the censure with a smile you shame me tribune as you can see it is a long time since i served ten years ago i hope my reply would have been exactly the same come julius we have much to discuss valerius followed the honour guard through the arch and on to the decumanus maximus colonias main street once they were within the town he glanced at his surroundings the insulae had walls of white plaster punctured by small shuttered windows many of the ground floors were occupied by shops offering the kinds of goods you would find anywhere in the empire fine glassware and jewellery cloth and linen of every colour and quality garum the fish sauce without which no meal was complete fruits even figs that he knew must have been imported from far in the east and of course wine by the amphora without which any roman colony would grind to a halt within a day competing vendors called out their prices and leatherworkers and potters showed off their wares everything spoke of a prosperous thriving and settled community his nostrils were assaulted by the sharp stink of a tanning yard and the strong smell of piss told him a dyer was at work nearby the legate of a legion once ruled here but now colonia would be run by an elected town council a crowd lined the street and children cheered as the men passed and he knew the legionaries would have their chests puffed out and the centurions would be snarling in their ears if they put a foot out of place a small triumph in its way but any triumph was to be savoured soldiers generally had a wary relationship with the civilian population profits could be made but soldiers meant extra mouths to feed and more taxes and civilians didnt like taxes colonia was different this was an army town with army wives and army children they knew how to treat a fighting man valeriuss soldiers might be weary after days on the road but he could sense their excitement at the chance to spend time in proximity to civilization but was it truly civilization his eyes strayed again to the buildings around him and he noted that many were simply reused barrack blocks subdivided into homes even those that had been rebuilt showed signs of having been thrown up in a hurry hed thought colonia a true example of a roman provincial town but now he studied it he realized it was a caricature of one it had none of the comfortable solidity or deep roots that could be found even in gaul or espana the feeling grew as they turned left on to what had been the via principalis past the forum and the curia which was simply part of the original headquarters complex extended and with an extra storey added here the towns togaclad elders gathered on the steps but he kept his eyes to the front and marched the cohort past with only a covert glance a protocol must be followed first he would settle in his men then he would wait for their invitation which would arrive in its own good time falco had been as good as his word the tent lines were laid out with symmetrical precision and it would be the work of a few minutes to erect them no ditches to be dug today and here at least the defensive wall was intact probably because the area had yet to be earmarked for development the old soldier was right they were as secure as they would be in the fortress at glevum still he thought there will be a guard tonight and every night civilization could make a soldier soft and he would not allow that to happen they needed to be hard for what awaited them in the spring he would make sure they were beyond the flat hardened earth of the camp ground was the beginnings of a semicircular structure which must be the towns theatre and beyond that again something which astonished him the temple of claudius of course he had heard tales of its grandeur but nothing had prepared him for the reality it was the glory of britain constructed of creamy white marble and glowing like a beacon even in the flat light of an early autumn afternoon the temple dwarfed everything around it wide fluted columns five or six times the height of a man supported an enormous triangular architrave with a decorative marble frieze showing a bull being led to the sacrifice and another depicting the emperor claudius riding in a chariot gold statues of winged victory rose tall at each corner of the pitched roof the temple stood in the centre of a walled precinct perhaps a hundred and fifty paces square with the entrance in the middle of the southern wall which was set back from the line of the main street building plots and vegetable gardens dotted the area around the precinct but the isolation merely served to emphasize the structures immense scale intrigued valerius left his officers to set up the cohort headquarters and walked to the front of the precinct to take a closer look here the wall was lower and he was able to see the massive building in its entirety he had been taught to admire the balanced symmetry and perfection of form of fine architecture and in the temple of divine claudius he found it manifested in a place he would never have expected wonderful isnt it he turned to discover a tall balding figure in a pristine white toga standing behind him the man studied him complacently the emperor sent an architect from rome to supervise the building and every ounce of marble was carried here from the quarries at carrara it is of similar design to the temples at nemausus and lugdunum in gaul larger than the first but slightly smaller than the second tiberius petronius victor quaestor and adviser to the council he introduced himself valerius smiled to show he was impressed but something in the mans voice a certain unnecessary arrogance irritated him pride was something he understood but it was as if petronius wanted him to believe hed personally laid every stone tribune gaius valerius verrens of the twentieth i lead a detachment of the first cohort we will be based here for the winter petronius smiled in his turn showing an array of white teeth that were so unnaturally perfect they might have belonged to another much younger man i knew of your coming of course i myself served with the staff of the second the words were accompanied by a certain inflexion that made valerius aware their status among the equestrian classes was approximately equal but also raised an intriguing question in the younger mans mind normally a quaestor would serve on the procurators staff for two years but petronius gave the impression of being a permanent member of the citys bureaucracy we have much to do here as you see colonia should be the pride of rome yet we have barely started in the beginning we were encouraged to be ambitious perhaps overly so projects were begun but never properly completed public buildings commissioned but never built the veterans his tone made it clear he didnt care to be included among them preferred to spend their money and their time on the land even then we might have succeeded but the temple naturally when the emperor had ordered the construction of the temple which would bear his name every sestertius every denarius and every aurius must be dedicated to it such funds could be diverted of course but there was an unspoken admission that it would take a braver man than petronius to do it yet as you say it is wonderful valerius said politely petronius gave a tight smile you are invited to join us tomorrow at the eighth hour in the banqueting hall in the precinct he indicated a doorway in the eastern wall valerius nodded his acceptance i will be glad to attend when will your men be ready to start work as i said there is much to do here and the rains will begin soon valerius realized that petronius expected his legionaries to carry out construction work in colonia itself and he almost laughed im sorry quaestor he said allowing his voice to take on an edge of irritation my men are soldiers not housebuilders they carry out military projects we have a warrant to repair the roads and bridges to the north of here with a curt nod and one final look at the temple he returned to his men vi three hours later julius lurched into the cohorts administrative tent to find valerius sitting in the lamplight at his collapsible desk with a writing block in front of him and a stylus in his hand my apologies tribune i understood you were staying in the town if id known valerius looked up no apologies required julius thats exactly what i intended to do but i wanted to see the men settled in and i rode out to visit the cavalry ala at the auxiliary camp to the southeast theyre thracians whove been here since just after the invasion and their prefect is a very conscientious young man bela son of one of their tribal chieftains his troopers showed me some tricks on horseback that would make your hair stand on end tomorrow will be time enough to seek out my billet ill be happy in a tent tonight falco falco is an unusual officer a good officer the best valerius accepted the unspoken reproach they tell me he has three thousand men under his command julius shook his head perhaps nominally but he gives the figure as less nearer two thousand but two thousand veterans who were once the cream of the legions the colonia militia they dont look like proper soldiers ill grant you but that doesnt make them bad soldiers i served with many of them as long as they can walk and carry a sword they can still fight as long as you dont ask them to walk far julius laughed yes i wouldnt like to march them much more than a mile but id venture theyre still good and theyll stand youll see ill see he falco requests that you inspect them hell have them on parade on saturday on the old cavalry exercise ground by the river will you agree sir there was a hint of appeal in juliuss voice and valerius realized that falco was seeking a chance to prove himself and his men saturday was five days away plenty of time to polish armour and sharpen swords of course what was he like as an officer a complete bastard julius laughed again but the toughest hardestfighting bastard in the entire roman army youd have liked him i think i do like him now hes a wine merchant rich he imports faustianum wines from falernia and sells them to the british aristocrats and legionary messes across the south a good man to know the words came out a little slurred and it was clear julius had sampled his old friends wares while theyd been reminiscing about old times you should sleep julius i want the men ready for a full inspection at dawn as usual then well put them through their paces no reason why we shouldnt give old falco and his militia something to think about over the next few days itll do them good to see real soldiers sweat julius yawned youre right sir perhaps a little too much of the good vintage he turned to leave oh i almost forgot you are invited to a dinner at the temple tomorrow apparently the council is eager to meet you i know just what i need four hours of boring provincial gossip and a sore head the next morning id rather storm another hill fort the centurion smiled for once im glad i dont have your social advantages good night sir valerius rose before dawn he detected an unfamiliar chill in the air that hinted at more than autumn and he shivered as he washed and dressed by the time he left the tent the men were already turned out in their sections and centuries on the parade ground eight hundred legionaries five doublestrength centuries rather than six normal ones because this was the first cohort twenty eightman sections to each century the elite of the legion the shock troops who would go where the danger was greatest and the fighting hottest he gave them a long look mariuss mules they called themselves lean and tough mostly men of only medium height but strong and hardy if necessary they could march twenty miles in a day carrying the sixtypound loads of their gear rations and weapons and be ready to fight a battle within the hour but on closer inspection the first was not quite the perfect fighting machine it appeared he walked along the ranks with julius at his side pulling at straps to ensure the armour was tight and pointing out an occasional imperfection on a weapon or a piece of equipment not that there was much to point out as usual the turnout was exemplary he knew how difficult it was to keep armour bright in the damp british air and the constant attention required to stop leather from rotting no it was the legionaries themselves who were out of condition the eyes that stared through him as he walked along the lines were redrimmed and buried deep like slingshot pellets fired at a mud bank the rank smell of stale wine assailed his nostrils he heard the sound of vomiting from one of the rear centuries but decided not to notice your name and rank soldier he barked at a blearyeyed specimen who stood out because he was taller than any man in his unit decimus lunaris duplicarius front rank second century sir the answer was equally brisk a duplicarius was a doublepay man a senior legionary with a trade so lunaris my orders were to return to the camp before sunset were those orders obeyed sir they were sir i counted them in myself julius said helpfully valerius stared at him but julius had been as helpful as he was going to be you dont look like a man who returned to camp before dark lunaris you look very much like a man who spent the entire night drinking how do you account for that lunaris opened his mouth then hesitated speak freely legionary youre among friends here valerius said smoothly allowing a note of sympathy to coat his voice lunaris grinned he was among officers here and he knew an invitation to walk into a trap when he heard one i look like a man whos had an entire nights worth of drink sir valerius raised an eyebrow you specified the time sir but not the volume the second century likes a challenge sir valerius stifled a laugh six merit points to the second century for enterprise centurion he watched julius note the award on his writing tablet so lunaris the second century likes a challenge the legionary studied him warily i want the second century to be ready in full battle order in five minutes scutum and a pair of pila do you think julius then the second century will lead the cohort on three full circuits of the outer walls at double pace he looked up at the sky which was now a deep cloudless blue that should be enough of a challenge before noon lunaris had barely completed half a circuit at the head of the unit by the time valerius caught up with him but sweat was already pouring down the duplicarius s face that must be almost pure wine you shouldnt waste it lunaris looked across surprised most tribunes werent prepared to suffer with their men but then hed heard this one wasnt like most tribunes valerius wore his full armour and carried his shield on his left arm and a pair of the heavy pila in his right hand normally a legionary on the march bore his shield in a leather cover on his back and unless there was an imminent threat of danger a handy mule transported the majority of the units spears the shield was big and heavy and needed constant adjustment to stop it obstructing its bearer and the two spears had a habit of crossing so that the lead weights which gave them their accuracy and power wanted to go in different directions added to the difficulty of jogging across uneven ground with a large pot on your head cooking in an iron shell it made for an interesting exercise not wine vinegar valerius shot him a puzzled look the bars here lunaris grunted the wine they sell is pure vinegar he grinned and gradually stepped up the pace but if he thought he would leave the tribune behind he soon found he was mistaken valeriuss long powerful legs covered the ground in a loping stride that never seemed to falter his armour had been fitted by an expert and allowed him greater ease of movement and less chafing than the segmentata worn by the rank and file it was lighter too but just as strong because the armourer had chosen iron with a greater carbon content by the second circuit lunaris was drawing in the warm air in prolonged shuddering gasps and valerius could hear groans from the ranks behind him he slowed imperceptibly allowing the grateful duplicarius to drop back with him as he ran he studied colonias walls and defensive ditch what do you think of the defences soldier lunaris spat what defences my feelings entirely valerius agreed i think well double the guard tonight just in case second century to supply the first watch he moved away so he wouldnt hear lunaris cursing under his breath vii she was tall was that his first impression no it was her eyes he decided he was drawn to her eyes which were wide and curious and framed by long lashes irises of a deep chestnut brown contained a message which was at once challenging and mocking and perturbingly left him feeling quite naked lustrous shoulderlength hair which matched them was swept back from a broad forehead leaving tendrils to highlight the perfect oval of her face the nose perhaps a little too delicate the mouth a little too wide for classic beauty but in her they combined to create something more she wore a fulllength crimson dress the design of which said roman but something about the way she wore it said not all this in the time it took for an arrow to leave the bow or a shot the sling as he stared into them the eyes changed shape and became serious and he realized the military commander falco was talking to him and this is lucullus our foremost briton a lord of the local tribe the trinovantes and a longtime friend to rome a short rotund man bowed and smiled ingratiatingly valerius would have moved on the local britons were of little interest to him except as potential enemies but lucullus stood his ground and waved the girl forward my daughter maeve he said maeve valerius turned to acknowledge her but she was already walking towards the gate of the temple complex he stared at the slender retreating figure and was rewarded with a venomous backward glance aimed fortunately at her father he felt an almost unstoppable urge to follow her but falco took his arm and steered him round the still smiling lucullus with a sniff of irritation tiberius petronius victor whom i understand you have already encountered valeriuss mind remained focused on the girl but he noted the hint of disapproval in falcos voice he is colonias senior magistrate the procurators personal representative here and one of our leading citizens the militia commander gave a brittle smile and he has a tight grip on the towns purse strings petronius produced a laugh equally devoid of humour clearly little love was lost between the two men each of us has our priorities quintus mine is to ensure we create a colonia worthy of the emperors name it holds we have real soldiers like the tribune here to keep us safe in our beds why should we spend a kings ransom so that your little army can strut the streets like peacocks valerius expected the insult to provoke a violent reaction but it seemed this was an argument so well rehearsed it had lost its power to inflame come falco led him away from the quaestor i will introduce you to the head of the ordo our council of one hundred leading citizens when they were out of petroniuss earshot he explained he means why should we have shields that dont splinter at the first blow and why must we complain when we wear the same rusty swords we carried all the way from the rhenus to the invasion all those years ago every army has supply problems even little armies valerius said he recognized the older mans frustration shortages were part of life in the legions a soldier even a roman soldier had to fight for everything he could get falco looked at him sharply wondering if he was being made fun of valerius smiled perhaps while we are here we will lose a few shields and a few spears my men are sometimes careless there would be no shortages for a unit taking part in the governors campaign against mona that was certain and in any case he would be back in rome before the legions quartermaster worked out what had happened the militia commander slapped his shoulder now i understand why julius likes you come we will share some wine you should have been with us on the tamesa catuvellauni warriors seven feet tall who took a dozen cuts and still wouldnt fall i have nightmares about them even now still talking he led the way into a long narrow room with a patterned mosaic floor and walls painted with lifelike scenes of an emperor who must be claudius carrying out his imperial duties as fawning courtiers looked on two of the paintings immediately caught valeriuss eye in the first the emperor was depicted sitting high on the back of a goldclad ceremonial elephant as a dozen splendid barbarian figures bowed before him he realized this must be the surrender of britain which had taken place close to this very spot the second took up an entire end wall and showed claudius standing proudly on a hill above a broad river surveying the crossing of his legions and the hazy battle beyond the tamesa falco whispered claudius wasnt even there didnt arrive until the next day he was a fraud old claudius but we didnt love him any the less for it valerius looked around to see if anyone was listening criticizing emperors even longdead emperors was not something to be done lightly but falco only winked if he was going to strike me down hed have done it long ago lad i sweated and bled for him and now hes taking care of me in my old age but hes still an old fraud the room had been set for twentyfour people with couches round the walls and a gilt table in the centre valerius found himself between falco and petronius and opposite the briton lucullus who called for wine to be brought one by one he was introduced to the men who ran colonia bland mercantile faces his brain refused to accept had once been seasoned soldiers of romes finest legions a few names stuck in his mind corvinus the goldsmith wideshouldered darkvisaged and improbably handsome who had turned his trade as the twentieths armourer into a more profitable business didius tall and thin and with shifty eyes that fitted all too well with his profession as one of colonias foremost moneylenders and bellator who seemed out of place because his exotic name and relative youth identified him as a freedman and who now prospered by taking a cut of the rent from the insulae he administered for his former master all had one thing in common they were rich they had to be because membership of the ordo didnt come cheap as falco explained in his dry monotone it has its compensations prestige which counts for little unless you are a certain type access and patronage which counts for more particularly when that patronage comes from the senate we have our say upon who gets what contract which buildings must be demolished and which must stay we adjudicate in land and water disputes all of which can be lucrative and creates a bank of favours which will one day be returned but the cost yet not so onerous as election to the augustales petronius interrupted from valeriuss left easy for you to say since a quaestor is above such lowly appointments falco huffed no payments to the treasury or public munificence from you eh petronius augustales valerius enquired the title was new to him a slave brought wine in a silver cup and he accepted it vowing only to sip watered or not the ripe fruity scent reached his nostrils no vinegar here this was as good as anything that would be served at his fathers table the priests of the temple those who officiate in the annual ceremonies central to the cult of divine claudius petronius continued airily taking a deep draught from his cup it is a great honour if you are a certain type valerius noted the repeat of falcos pointed phrase of a few moments earlier however it also carries great responsibilities valerius knew that in rome to be elected to the priesthood of one of the great temples jupiter capitolinus or mars ultor brought with it substantial power and that such an appointment was only open to the knightly classes yet even at a price it must be greatly sought after by the members of your council he said petronius laughed but valerius felt falco shift uneasily behind him no roman citizen would be foolish enough to accept it we leave that honour to the brittunculi falco drew breath and the conversation in the room went quiet valerius saw the smile freeze on luculluss face but petronius carried on as if nothing had changed for them it is as close as they will ever come to being a roman ah at last the food valerius watched as the dishes were set on the table in rome a banquet like this would be an opportunity to show a flair for the exotic peacocks still in their livery swans artfully displayed to seem almost alive but this was wholesome rustic fare sizzling cuts of beef venison and suckling pig duck pigeon and partridge and birds smaller still which looked like particularly plump sparrows a great fish probably from the river below and oysters and crabs from the coast which he knew to be just a few miles downstream he set to with a will army rations could always be supplemented but somehow they were still army rations it had been many months since hed sat down to such a feast his companions too ate greedily all except lucullus who nibbled at the food still wearing his fixed smile petronius raised his cup theatrically your health sir would that we supped like this every day no toast required with this wine the comment provoked a burst of laughter toasted bread was often crumbled into inferior wines to disguise the bitter taste he saw valeriuss look of surprise oh yes he lowered his voice so the young tribune had to lean towards him to hear his next words lucullus our british friend is responsible for everything you see around you food and drink the couch you lie on and even the upkeep of the building he is a fine fellow a friend of rome and an augustalis he cannot be a member of the ordo because although he has chosen a roman name he is not a roman citizen nor ever will be but as one of the priests of the temple he enjoys great honour among certain of his people and even influence in the roman community he must be a very fortunate man despite himself valerius was impressed he considered the celts rough tribesmen a martial race of hut dwellers yet here was a briton who had adopted roman ways and already contributed to the new society that a roman britain would become fortunate petronius gave a quiet belch he has a villa on his farm on the hill yonder he waved a hand in the vague direction of the river and he owns property in town so yes i suppose he could be called rich he smiled and turned towards the neighbour on his left leaving valerius to study the figure across the table the appellation portly could have been coined for lucullus but he carried his bulk in a way that told you he took pride in it that it was in some way a measure of his success and position in life he was short and rounded with a fringe of mousy hair which circled the back of his head like an untidy laurel wreath valerius noted that he shaved his face in the roman fashion yet it shouted out that it would never be complete without the moustache his people habitually wore lucullus met his eyes and raised his cup in salute his smile took on a sad almost resigned aspect valerius had seen the look before in clients he had represented in minor court cases the clients who inevitably lost in that instant something like pity replaced the natural disdain he felt for the trinovante he raised his own cup in reply and wondered what lucullus was thinking he didnt have to wait long to find out you must come and visit my estate the little man offered loftily in a clipped unnatural latin which had a curious singsong lilt the hunting is good no you are not a hunter then perhaps a man of culture i have many fine pieces from rome itself and even from aegyptus the man who painted these walls painted my own i have a copy of the surrender in my atrium valerius knew he should decline the offer but a beautiful face flashed into his head she would be there and this time she wouldnt be able to run away if my duties permit it i would be happy to visit you he became aware of a change in the atmosphere as if a shutter had been opened to allow in the sun the fixed smile disappeared and a different lucullus emerged a lucullus whose eyes twinkled with surprise and genuine pleasure my estate manager will arrange it then for the rest of the meal valerius found himself the hub of attention for the members of the ordo was it true that his soldiers were to waste their time building roads when they had so much to complete in colonia how did he think the town compared with londinium what was the latest news from rome there was a rumour that burrus might be out of favour had he heard the druids were returning it was true corvinus had it from a trader who had it from a merchant who had it from a customer who had it from he fended off the questions with polite harmless nonanswers until falco concluded the proceedings the banquet broke up with men leaving in pairs one or two clinging to each other as a result of the effects of the wine valerius was surprised to see lucullus walk out deep in conversation with petronius falco insisted on accompanying him back to the camp then i will guide you to the townhouse where you will stay while you are with us it is owned by lucullus and very comfortable but the ordo will provide the slaves better to be spied on by a roman eh he laughed i thought your charter denied the celts the right to own property in the town falco gave him a sideways look the charter was drawn up in different times much has changed it is true that technically no briton should own property here but if a man has money there are ways such technicalities can be circumvented third party agreements for instance and who would the third party be in this case valerius knew he was pushing the boundaries of their short acquaintance but even the small amount of wine he had drunk had loosened his tongue the look again longer this time let us just say that lucullus would do well to be wary of his business partners the militia commander laughed of course i am one of them lucullus provides transport for me he has the largest wagon business in the province julius told me you were a wine merchant falcos lips pursed as if he wasnt sure what he was i suppose i am i have a monopoly to supply every legionary mess and public office from here to isca and from noviomagus to lindum a shipload of amphorae in from ostia every two weeks how else would a simple soldier be able to afford to break bread with the likes of petronius valerius had a feeling the older man was anything but a simple soldier but he risked another question when petronius talked of the brittunculi i had the impression he was referring to lucullus falco nodded it is a term that has become popular among a certain type of roman a term that is meant to belittle the celts for myself i believe we must live and work with them and that to insult them only stores up trouble for the future he paused and valerius knew enough to hold his tongue things were done when colonia was founded that do none of us credit land fever greed and envy all played their part our colonists are good men they fought for rome for twentyfive years and knew nothing but hardship who could deny that they deserved this land their emperor had given them but when a legionary sweating to dig up tree roots in parched ground looked across his boundary and saw a celt picking rows of fine vegetables while his cattle drank sweet water from a dew pond what was he to do he was the victor they were the vanquished he took what he believed should be his and if a celt died he shrugged his shoulders it was no real matter now people like petronius look at colonia and see the glory of rome invincible and sustained by the power of four full legions and he has a point we have had eight years of peace since scapula stirred up his hornets nest by attempting to disarm the tribes our farms and estates prosper and grow and with them the town prospers and grows the local britons those such as lucullus who are prepared to work and trade with us have done equally well but he hesitated and his face took on a troubled aspect but i fear we take advantage of their good faith it was the temple six years ago when work began on the temple colonia was not the place you see now claudius was generous with his grant of land in the territorium around the city and each of us had our pension but a farm needs investment and a town needs businesses and such things would drain the resources of even a rich man yet when the emperor was declared divine and we knew this was to be the centre of his cult in britain we were proud he was our emperor but we reckoned without the priests those they sent from rome created a roman institution with roman rules and a roman bureaucracy to be run on roman lines and to make a roman profit but britain is not rome colonia is not rome there is no old money here no great fortunes garnered from hundreds of years of slaves sweat on grand family estates to accept the role of augustalis would mean ruination did you know that claudius himself paid eighty thousand gold aurei when he entered the priesthood during gaius caligulas time he shook his head as if the sum was beyond his wildest imaginings only one class could be persuaded no flattered into accepting nomination the british kings and aristocrats who had supported the invasion and therefore had the most to gain from being magis romanorum quam romanorum more roman than the romans king cogidubnus who rules the atrebates and the regni was the first one taste was enough for him but he had set the precedent others followed and now lucullus a prince of the trinovantes who once held these lands but surely lucullus could not no of course lucullus could not afford such sums but there are those in rome prepared to lend them even the emperor himself and members of his court seneca for one it was he who loaned lucullus the money to buy into the priesthood and provide the community with the theatre you see yonder it should have been enough but lucullus believes he is a man of business where another might have seen the jaws of a trap he saw opportunity he borrowed more to buy his wagons which was a good investment and more still to purchase six insulae in colonia which may or may not be he pays commission to a roman partner who nominally owns the buildings who collects and passes on the rents like bellator though neither would thank me for making the comparison on the surface lucullus is one of the richest men in colonia in reality he is rich only in debt we are here the townhouse stood in a street close to the forum and not far from the legionaries camp which valerius knew falco simple soldier that he was would have insisted upon part of him wished he had refused the offer to sleep beneath a solid roof in a soft bed but refusal would be seen as bad manners he would live with the guilt it wouldnt make the men any more comfortable in any case double doors opened on to the atrium which in turn led to an open courtyard surrounded by a covered walkway from which further doors gave access to other dwellings that no doubt shared the courtyard he sensed a stillness to the place that spoke of lack of inhabitation which suited valerius perfectly but did not bode well for luculluss rents the house itself turned out to be a modest enough place pleasingly bright with unpainted walls and comfortable functional furniture and decorated in the roman fashion with a few busts of notables who were unlikely to be related to the briton but had probably been bought as part of a job lot pride of place as he suspected it always would in colonia went to a flattering painted marble likeness of claudius your sleeping quarters are through here and the latrine is beyond the courtyard falco apologized for the lack of a bathhouse but valerius said he was happy enough to use the public facility his effects had already been delivered so as soon as the militia commander left he settled down and retrieved the copy of thucydides history of the peloponnesian war he always carried the greek writer had served in the military that was certain but he was no soldier not quite homer on whose tales of troy valerius had been weaned but an improvement on herodotus who was much too wordy for his taste later he fell asleep haunted by a female face which never quite came into focus and a sweet tuneful voice he had never heard before viii it was the eyes rather than the words the chieftain thought they made a man feel important even a man who only held sway over a few farmsteads worked by his clan a minor western subtribe of the catuvellauni federation and had little influence beyond his farthest field the priests eyes were the colour of the old amber the chieftains wife coveted in the market down at ratae and hooded like a hawks not that the chief visited the place often he preferred the smell of cowshit to the perfume of the romanlovers who lived there in their palaces for the first time in a decade his fingers itched for a sword he had once been a warrior the amber eyes made him feel like a warrior again gwlym studied the group around the fire most of them were too old or too young to be truly useful in a fight but not too old or too young to hate or too old or too young to die the old remembered the days before the romans came when any man with a shield and a spear was his own master the young knew nothing beyond the boundaries of the little settlement but their minds were open to his subtle arguments and persuasion he talked of life before the romans before the roads and the watchtowers and the cavalry patrols and before the taxes which guaranteed that no matter how good the harvest their bellies would still be empty before winters end he talked of the countless thousands marched off in chains to be worked to death in roman mines of the lands that had been stolen from them and to a growl of approval of mighty caratacus betrayed and brought low before being degraded for an emperors pleasure by the end their eyes blazed as bright as the flames of the council fire and the young men those few who could be forged into warriors fit to face a legion clamoured for the weapons they needed to take their revenge they wanted to act now but the time was not yet right this was the art they had taught him on mona how to tend the fire and keep the flame burning until the moment it was needed he looked at the faces round the fire again seeking the man who would continue the work when he moved on not the chief too many years at the plough and too ready to sacrifice himself and his people no he needed someone more subtle more obedient the quiet darkhaired peasant three rows back young but not too young watchful intelligent eyes determined but not overeager yes he would talk to him later alone wait he ordered have patience organize there will be a sign and always they asked what will be the sign and always he told them the wrath of andraste his mission had almost ended before it had begun in the savage mountains of the deceangli for he could not risk contact with the people there lest word of his coming reach the romans close to starvation he had turned south and crossed into the country of the cornovii just north of the roman fortress at viroconium beyond the bend of the great river there he had forced himself to wait until he was beyond range of the daily cavalry patrols before begging food and shelter at a rough farmstead under the thatched roof with the cattle lowing gently in the background he had listened while the farmer a man more used to conversing with his beasts recounted news and rumour from a dozen miles around only when the tone and the manner had told him what he needed to know did he begin to talk the first farmer had passed him to another and another and from there he had reached the local lord who told him of other lords of similar persuasion with similar complaints and similar ambitions he would arrive at a farm or a village after nightfall gather those he could trust and talk until it was time to sleep the following day he would spend at the plough or the whetstone or gathering in the harvest he used his skills as a healer to foster trust and to bind them to him even though it placed his life in danger tales of a medicine man would spread and multiply where those of an itinerant farm labourer working for bread and beer would soon be forgotten he was always at risk but he was never betrayed by now he realized others followed the same path quite often he would arrive at a household to discover he had been preceded by another of his sect no one said so aloud but he could see it in the puzzled eyes and in the answers they gave to his questions all over southern britain men like him were spreading a message fanning the embers of an almost forgotten fire ix valerius spent his first few days in colonia drawing up work schedules with julius and directing squads of legionaries out into the network of roads around colonia to identify the areas which required immediate attention and those which were less of a priority julius presented a local quarrymaster with a warrant for the supply of the materials they would need and valerius set himself the task of providing the wagons required to carry them which took him back to lucullus the trinovante welcomed him effusively to his office in the centre of town apologizing for the humbleness of his surroundings of course i carry out most of my business at the temple or the baths like a true roman he said when valerius explained the reason for his visit lucullus was delighted to be of service he asked for information on the quantities of material to be hauled and the distances they had to be carried and swiftly calculated the number of wagons needed and the teams of oxen to pull them you will need spare teams of course no point in having a wagon lying idle just because an ox needs to be rested he named a price a time and a place for delivery and valerius presented his warrant he noted that the figure lucullus wrote down bore no relation to the one he had just given now the briton said do not think i have forgotten my invitation i am holding a gathering a week today just a few people whose company i enjoy i think you would find it interesting and perhaps illuminating would the fourth hour after noon be acceptable valerius agreed that it would then asked the question that had been on his mind since he entered the room and is your family well luculluss face darkened families are like taxes a trial to be tolerated a son perhaps i could have guided his fathers success would have provided him with a path to follow but i have no son a daughter he shook his head sadly of course you have no children yourself valerius smiled at the unlikely thought i am not married then you are doubly welcome when he returned to the cohort headquarters julius reminded him that the following day was saturday when he had agreed to watch the colonia militia being exercised by falco valerius grimaced it had seemed a reasonable request at the time but now there were so many other things requiring his attention still it was a duty he couldnt avoid not least out of respect for falco they gathered on the flat ground between the broken remnants of the city walls and the river to practise closeorder drill and arms two thousand men once the elite core of the legions of rome with battle honours that stretched from scythia to the silurian mountains jupiter save us will you look at them grunted lunaris who had accompanied valerius as part of his twelveman escort not one of them is under fifty im surprised they could find their weapons never mind use them it was true there were few who appeared to own a full set of armour most had lost some piece of equipment since they last took the field almost a decade earlier a breastplate a helmet a set of greaves in those years they had grown used to the life of the farmer the trader and the smalltown politician and nothing could disguise it they were a mixture of the potbellied and the scrawny the snowyhaired and the bald some of them hung heavy with the fat of success others were bent by years of labour they had one thing in common they were old men but as valerius watched from the top of the slope he realized his first impression had been flawed there were other things that united them what armour they did have and the weapons they carried were well cared for no matter their antiquity and although they were old they were still legionaries the barked commands were as familiar to valerius and his men as the call to break fast and it was apparent in every manoeuvre the veterans carried out they moved from line to square to wedge and from defence to attack with the practised ease of a lifetimes experience every man knew his place every shield and every sword was positioned exactly where it should be and valerius felt the pride rise in him as it always did when he witnessed professional soldiers at work he saw falco who he guessed wore the same ancient uniform as his men out of choice not necessity watching him and the wine merchant gave an order to the officer at his side the legionaries came together smoothly into their centuries and in a single swift movement each of the eightyman formations transformed into the unbreakable armoured carapace that was familiar to every roman soldier theyd give you a run for your money forming testudo lunaris the big man grinned i doubt theyd want to run for anything these days sir valerius grinned back but a warning in the legionarys eyes told him falco was approaching he turned and saluted the militias primus pilus i congratulate you on a fine display of arms sir your militia does you great credit falco smiled his thanks only two afternoons a week but we work hard those of us who attend regularly at least and there are some things you never forget it becomes more difficult with every passing year and we grow fewer but most regard it as a sacred trust claudius gave us a home and a living and we will serve him to the grave the words would have been falsely sentimental coming from another man but from falco they were a simple statement of fact come take a closer look at them he lowered his voice so that lunaris and the escort wouldnt hear i confess they have made an extra effort for you we do not normally shine quite so brightly they marched down to where the militia now waited in their silent lines facing the fortress the exercise ground stretched away behind them broad and flat to the riverbank where colonias main bridge carried the north road across to the long slope on the far side a single shout brought the militia to attention and valerius followed falco along the ranks the lined faces beneath the helmets were pinkcheeked and sweatslick and shoulders heaved from the earlier exertions but the veterans straightened their backs and sucked in their bellies behind their shields and valeriuss stare was met by a hardeyed confidence he hadnt expected to see they might be farmers and shopkeepers now but they would never forget what they had been it took an hour to complete the inspection valerius murmuring compliments where they were due and falco following behind tutting at some minor fault only he could see when they were done to valeriuss surprise the militia commander called out twelve of his men by name to line up in front of the formation would you like to try them out falco invited a dozen of yours against a dozen of mine valerius opened his mouth to refuse for these were old men and his escort was the pick of the twentieth legion but there was a challenge in falcos eyes and in his voice and valerius though it had occasionally cost him dearly had never turned down a challenge only now did he notice that the men falco had chosen were among the biggest and fittest on parade and that they included corvinus the goldsmith who was attempting to stifle a grin perhaps it wasnt the mismatch hed thought what do you think lunaris a gentle workout wouldnt like to hurt these old gentlemen sir the duplicarius said chicken more likely it was an old soldiers trick to talk without moving the lips but valerius thought the stage whisper probably came from corvinus lunariss eyes narrowed and he grinned and ran his eye along the line of older men maybe just a gentle workout then but im not carrying them up the hill when were done he drew his sword and tested it ostentatiously with his thumb oh no swords falco said hurriedly we dont want your fellows being hurt a simple exercise of shield against shield he heard lunariss snort of derision well perhaps practice swords then a practice sword was a replica gladius made of hardwood it had no edge or point but it weighed twice the real thing and was perfectly capable of cracking bone or denting skull lunaris and the men of the escort accepted shields from the closest century and practice swords were issued to each of the twelve men in the two lines who stood directly opposite each other the younger legionaries bristled with confidence and joked to one another while the veterans waited calmly conserving their energy cries of encouragement rang out from the rear ranks of the massed militia formation valerius cast a warning glance at lunaris he had a feeling this contest might not be as straightforward as it appeared an amphora of my best wine on the outcome tribune falco suggested innocently now valerius was certain hed been lured into a trap but lunaris and the escort were veterans in their own right surely they had nothing to fear from these pensioners falco saw him hesitate at cost price of course valerius nodded of course something told him he was unlikely to get a chance to taste falcos finest tonight falco positioned himself at the end of the gap between the two lines when you are ready attack it should have been so simple lunaris kept his shield hard against his neighbours and could feel the pressure as the man to his left did the same to his own he kept his head low and his left shoulder tight to the rear of the shield boss the sword ready in his right hand to dart between the shields when the chance came he knew it wouldnt come at once because this wasnt a fight against barbarians who could be depended on to expose themselves to the sting of the gladius but he was sure it would come eventually the twelve legionaries were younger stronger and fitter than the men facing them it would be a shoving match but a shoving match they would win and when they won he intended to take his revenge against the old bastard who had called him a chicken keep the line tight he shouted as the two walls of shields were about to meet now the younger men rammed their shields forward square on to the enemy using brute strength to hammer the veterans backwards with the almighty crash of two galleys colliding except the veterans didnt go backwards the wall of shields rippled as they absorbed the power of the attack but the line held and no matter how hard lunaris pushed he couldnt budge the man in front of him after a minute of intense effort he allowed himself to relax just a fraction dont get too comfortable there sonny we dont want to be here all day it was the same voice that had insulted him earlier infuriatingly calm and unflustered from behind the shield in front of him he grunted and put all his strength into pushing again dont worry granddad youll soon get all the rest you want a long long rest similar confrontations were taking place along the entire shield line and lunaris could feel the puzzlement in the younger men he heard messor so slim that his tentmates had nicknamed him pipefish but with a wiry strength that belied his slight frame cursing under his breath and paulus the firsts signifer handing out useless advice still it would be all over soon they were trained to keep this up all day and these old men would soon tire but something strange was happening the angle of the shield facing him kept subtly changing and it became difficult to maintain the force against it first to the left then to the right top and bottom but to no set pattern and never for long enough for him to take advantage of it he tried to analyse what was happening but instinct and training told him to hold his ground and maintain the pressure where he could heave lads well soon have them his shout was echoed by grunts as the legionaries used all their frustration to increase the pressure on the men in front of them lunaris felt a slight change and he knew hed won only he hadnt the shield in front of him disappeared and he found himself sprawled on his back at the far side of the veterans shield wall with a wooden sword at his throat and a grinning swarthy face in his soon have who sonny corvinus asked conversationally the veterans ploy had been repeated by every second man along the line and the contest collapsed in disarray with men struggling and wrestling with each other enough falco shouted he turned grinning to valerius an honourable tie i think valerius nodded and watched as corvinus helped lunaris to his feet you wouldnt have got away with that in a proper fight the duplicarius said evenly he knew hed been tricked but better to be tricked on the training ground than on some heathen battlefield thats right we wouldnt corvinus agreed but it wasnt a proper fight you fashion your tactics to beat whatevers facing you youre good lunaris admitted for your age he held out his hand corvinus studied him suspiciously before gripping lunaris by the forearm if we werent good we wouldnt be here every man you see survived twentyfive years in the legion twentyfive years means as many battles and twice as many pointless skirmishes that are even more likely to kill you twentyfive years of blood and sweat and seeing your tentmate dying by inches with his liver in his lap and twentyfive years of dozy patrician officers like him who dont know what theyre doing lunaris followed his gaze towards valerius oh no not like him not like him at all x two days before the dinner at luculluss villa valerius visited the daily market beside colonias forum it was here the local farmers brought their surplus and the craftsmen who plied their trade in the workshops on the hill to the west of the town came to sell their wares out of curiosity he had walked up the hill and found a bustling place of sparks and smoke curious metallic smells and the clang of blacksmiths hammers among them he found corvinus which surprised him for this was a place of artisans and the goldsmith now counted among colonias elite but the twentieths former armourer explained i have my shop in colonia but our charter doesnt allow manufacture within the walls he pointed to a nearby smiths glowing forge too much risk of fire the things i sell have to be made somewhere so i set up my workshop here i have slaves of course but i keep my hand in and i do the special commissions myself the memory of the encounter started a thought in valeriuss mind but he decided to leave it for another day now he walked among the stalls of vegetables hanging joints of meat bulging sacks of barley and spelt arrays of duck and hen eggs perhaps fresh and perhaps not and fish silverbright from the river and the sea taking in the sights and pungent scents of homegrown herbs and exotic imported spices and ignoring the pleas and flattery of the vendors for a while he carefully studied a basket of scrawny chickens clucking and fussing among their straw but none was quite right the sound of bleating drew him perhaps when he reached the farmers pen he cursed himself for a fool of course there would be no lambs at this season of the year he imagined leading a ewe on a rope through the streets no it wouldnt do he returned to the chickens ill have the biggest one with the white patch on its wing he carried the squawking bird by the legs its wings flapping impotently along the main street until he reached the temple gates today a queue stretched from the temple steps and he had to wait his turn behind a wrinkled elderly woman with a white scroll and a small leather bag clutched tightly to her chest it was several minutes before she stood before the priest at a stone altar set in front of the marble stairway the transaction should have been private but the woman had a loud voice that reminded valerius of the chickens squawking and he couldnt help but overhear i wish the god to place this curse on whoever stole my sheets when they were drying it was my neighbour poppaea im sure but i will know for certain when her feet and her hands turn black the thieving bitch in pursuance of my petition i leave this offering the priest took the leather bag opened it and studied the contents before accepting the scroll with a curt nod the woman bowed and walked away muttering to herself valerius took his place at the altar while the priest noted something on a waxed writing block despite the authority with which hed dealt with the woman and the earlier supplicants the priest was little more than a boy with narrow pinched features and a nose that marked him out as roman at first valerius was puzzled but as he waited a little longer than he needed to he realized that the people who actually operated and managed the cult of claudius were unlikely to be major benefactors like lucullus every organization needed its fetchers and carriers and he recognized one before him he coughed and the priest looked up as if only just noticing his presence valerius wore a simple tunic over his braccae and he knew hed been mistaken for an offduty legionary or perhaps one of the farmers in town for the market i wish to make a sacrifice to the god he said holding out the chicken that the boy asked frowning yes that valerius agreed aware of growing restlessness behind him the boy studied the chicken and valerius wondered if he had ever conducted a sacrifice probably the task was normally carried out by the more experienced priests perhaps you might like some help he ventured the boy looked at him seriously then back to the chicken oh no he paused will you require an augury valerius thought for a second did he really believe this child had the gift he was almost certainly wasting his money still why had he come here if not to find out whether the girl was part of his future how much he asked and was quoted a price that made his purse squeal in protest at these rates the temple of claudius must be the most profitable enterprise in britain he handed over a silver denarius which the boy placed in a basket beneath the altar then the chicken which the young priest expertly held down with one hand while reaching into the basket with the other and producing a lethallooking house knife with a flick of his wrist he slit the birds throat the chicken jerked and its wings fluttered in an involuntary spasm the boy studied its dying movements until it went still then with another expert flick of the blade made a long cut in its belly and allowed the inner parts to spill on to the marble surface valerius stared at the remains of the chicken but all he saw was a heap of feathers and a mess of entrails and watery blood the priest used the point of the knife to move a curling clump of guts to one side and let out a prolonged sigh as he uncovered the liver he sighed again as he found the gall bladder which he studied intently valerius leaned closer as the signs were explained the path you follow is not the one you wish to tread the boy said cautiously yet there are many ways to reach the destination you seek not all are straightforward but each in its own fashion will take you where you want to go he paused studying the entrails more closely still while valerius attempted to decipher the message he was being given was the boy talking about his pursuit of the girl or the path that would take him back to rome against his will or both or neither he raised his head to find the priest studying him a curious look in his dark eyes you may face a great challenge or you may turn away from it your fate is tied to that decision it is not clear but i believe you have much to gain but more to lose if you continue along the road you have chosen he reached into the basket and his hand came out with the silver denarius here i have told you nothing you did not know valerius shook his head no keep it for yourself if not for the temple as he walked away deep in thought he looked back to see the priest staring at him ignoring the line of petitioners waiting to avail themselves of his services the villa of lucullus was set high on the slope opposite colonia and about a mile to the west of the city it lay at the centre of his estate which as far as valerius could see consisted simply of another tract of british farmland dotted randomly with patches of forest and the fleainfested thatched roundhouses the tribesmen lived in a roman villa would have been identified by an ostentatious gateway and landscaped gardens but he had only been able to find his way here because of the precise directions falco had provided passing through and by another dozen farms on the way at first sight the villa was a disappointment a simple singlestorey structure with white walls shuttered windows and a redtiled roof it could have been home to any subsistence farmer on the shores of the mediterranean still he approached along the narrow hedged trackway with his heart thumping against his ribs his mind conjured up conflicting visions of his coming meeting with maeve and he found he could barely remember her face which placed an icy orb of fear in his belly yet her eyes were as familiar to him as his own mothers how would she be dressed he remembered the slim form walking away from the temple perhaps not so slim a narrow waist but her hips and his mouth went suddenly dry and he licked his lips and forced the seductive memory from his head why did he feel more nervous now than when he had been about to lead the attack on the british hill fort was nervous even the correct word no it was more than that he was afraid not afraid of dying or failing but of disappointing or of being disappointed yet the fear was just as real it didnt matter that he had cast eyes on the british girl only once all that mattered was that he should see her again he was not inexperienced with women but that experience had tended to be with a certain type or more correctly types there had been servant girls of course perhaps prompted by his father surely not his mother who had led him along the delicate path towards maturity and when he had donned the toga virilis of adulthood his father had taken him into rome on the obligatory visit to a brothel of the better class where he had been introduced to delights that made his rough fumblings behind the kitchens somehow inconsequential then there had been the army and the soldiers women many of them readily available but only fleeting erotic experiences untouched by passion or tenderness for the first time he realized he had never known love lucullus stood smiling in the courtyard in front of the villa along with a groom who took valeriuss horse and led it towards the stables welcome to my humble house the little celt said formally but valerius could see he was almost dancing with excitement the way his father had sometimes been when some particularly auspicious guest was about to arrive you were very kind to invite me to dine with your family he replied with equal formality you have a fine estate master lucullus lucullus waved dismissively but his smile said he appreciated the compliment this this is nothing the best land is beyond the hill land my ancestors have cultivated for generations the gods thank them and beyond it are my hunting grounds you are sure you do not hunt i must tempt you a fine stag or a boar surely a boar would be a worthy adversary for a soldier valerius shook his head and lucullus laughed and led him towards the house chattering about the animals he had hunted and killed they entered through an arched doorway which led into a hall where a slave surprised valerius by ushering him to a bench so that he could remove his sandals and have them replaced by a pair of soft slippers it was something he would have expected only in the most fashionable houses in rome and seemed out of place in this rough provincial outpost he looked up to find lucullus watching him seeking his approval and he smiled his thanks suitably shod he followed his host into a sumptuously furnished room lit by perfumed oil lamps the room measured around thirty paces by ten and the plastered walls were painted a dramatic deep ochre made more striking by the broad gold horizontal stripe which divided them and the colourful scenes that took up most of each end of the room the floor was basic opus signum covered in rugs apart from the centrepiece a patterned mosaic of blue red and white with the familiar figure of bacchus at its centre surrounded by grapevines again valerius was impressed clearly lucullus took his culture seriously enough to lavish considerable expense upon it two men and a woman stood talking in front of a marble bust and he felt a sting of disappointment when he realized the woman was not maeve lucullus introduced them my cousin cearan and his wife aenid they are of our northern neighbours the iceni valerius bowed politely cearan and aenid were one of the most striking couples he had ever seen with looks so similar they might have been brother and sister cearans features had the perfectly balanced symmetry valerius remembered from statues of greek gods only with a sharper edge his golden hair fell to his shoulders and his eyes were a startling delicate blue aenid was blessed with her husbands high cheekbones and full mouth but she wore her hair long cascading to the middle of her back their clothing somehow managed to bridge the cultural divide between roman and briton without offending either cearon was in a plain cream tunic and braccae with a thin gold torc at his throat while aenid wore a long dress of pale blue that covered her neck and arms it took a second glance to realize that they were older than they appeared probably only a few years younger than their host valerius was still staring at them when lucullus introduced the second man marcus numidius secundus he said numidius constructed the temple of claudius his eyes twinkled as if to say see i recognized your interest and this is my gift to you it seemed that everything with lucullus came at some sort of price numidius nodded and valerius noted that although he was standing beside cearan and aenid he couldnt be said to be with them he held a silver cup in both hands with his arms tight to his sides as if to avoid any inadvertent contact with the two britons dark watchful eyes peered myopically from a thin almost malnourished face but they lit up indeed almost caught fire when the engineer realized he had found a fellow roman citizen he marched across the room and took valeriuss right arm like a drowning man grasping at a piece of passing flotsam come lucullus tells me we have a common passion you must sit by me he steered valerius towards a low table at the far end of the room surrounded by comfortable padded benches luculluss face took on the same fixed smile it had assumed when petronius mentioned the brittunculi yes it is time to dine cearan aenid he ushered the iceni couple towards the benches which valerius noted with a flutter in his stomach numbered six lucullus placed valerius and numidius on one side of the table opposite cearan and aenid on the other he took his place to numidiuss right leaving the couch next to valerius vacant when they were settled he called out something in his own language and valerius though the caught the word maeve amongst the burst of unintelligible syllables he looked up hoping to see the british girl but numidius tugged at the sleeve of his tunic lucullus tells me you are interested in the temple i am interested in all architecture valerius admitted i think the temple of claudius is a fine example the workmanship if not the scale stands comparison with anything in rome anything in the empire the engineer said complacently i worked to the instructions of the architect peregrinus who was sent from rome by claudius himself to oversee the construction we had previously completed the temple in nemausus together but this was an altogether different task valerius nodded politely torn between genuine interest and hope that maeve was about to walk into the room and take the seat next to him it was the foundations you see numidius explained in a voice as dry as an empty amphora the site chosen was entirely inadequate but they insisted because a shrine to one of the heathen celtic gods once stood there peregrinus did not think it could be done but i discovered the answer foundations so strong they could bear the capitoline hill itself it took two hundred slaves to dig the pits and we had to face them with timber or they would have collapsed on the men working in them when they were completed we poured mortar by the ton into them then more in a thick layer over the area between them so that when the material hardened we had created four huge earthfilled vaults of astonishing strength even then peregrinus had his doubts until the priests sacrificed a fine bull to jupiter and predicted the temple would stand for a thousand years finally today she wore white and from the chestnutbrown hair swept into a fashionable pile on her head to the handmade shoes that cradled her delicate manicured feet she looked every inch a roman her dress was long the diaphanous material clinging to her body its folds full of shadows and promises but it left her shoulders bare and her pale skin shone in the yellow light of the lamps valerius noted that she had used powder to turn the healthy glow that flushed her cheeks to a subtle pink and today her lips were the colour of ripe strawberries he wondered how old she was and a voice inside his head answered eighteen xi maeve walked into the room at the head of a line of servants and only when they had placed the dishes they carried to her satisfaction did she take her place opposite her father and to valeriuss left side he must have eaten but he would swear he neither saw nor tasted anything placed before him the murmur of conversation continued but if a single word was addressed directly to him he did not hear it she lay so close that his head swam with the scent of the perfumed oils she wore but frustratingly her face was hidden from him if he moved his eyes to the left when she reached for some morsel on the table he caught a glimpse of the downy golden hairs that covered her lower arm it took a long time before he realized she was no more aware of him than any of the busts that lined the walls and that although he felt her presence like heat from a winter fire to her he might as well have been made of the same cold stone she concentrated all her attention on cearan talking quietly in the language they shared but which left valerius an outcast he felt a tide rising within him and unfamiliar though it was knew it for jealousy it was unreasonable madness even he had not spoken a word to this girl this woman yet he found he couldnt tame it with that realization came anger anger at himself for accepting luculluss invitation and anger at the briton for making it and with the anger the room came back into sharp focus and he heard numidius still droning on about the temple the dimensions are perfect of course according to the principles of vitruvius the length exactly one and one quarter times the width valerius looked up to find lucullus staring at him maeve our guests the trinovante said sharply lord cearan and i were discussing horses the voice in a latin endowed with a gentle almost musical quality came from behind valerius knew it was directed at him but for some reason he was reluctant to turn and face the source our british stock is sound of wind but short in the body and the legs they would benefit from the introduction of some of your roman bloodlines now he had no choice but to turn and look into her eyes which had the qualities of a tuscan mountain stream deep dark and full of intriguing mystery i am sure that would be possible he said knowing it was anything but and wondering why his voice sounded like an old mans then i will call on you tomorrow and we may be disappointed together cearan laughed for ten months i have been trying to persuade your commander of cavalry at the fort south of colonia to give me the use of a single breeding stallion for a week even for a day but all he does is try to sell me his brokendown pack mules and assure me i am getting a bargain valerius felt that honour demanded he defend bela his auxiliary counterpart no doubt he has his reasons a cavalry prefect will always be careful of his mounts and he is a thracian and therefore will be more so perhaps with time you can win his trust you have common interests after all he heard a sharp clicking sound to his left that told him maeve didnt agree but cearan slapped the table well said and you are right if it were only he and i we would get drunk together and boast about the stallions we have known and mares we have broken and in the morning he would say to me cearan take this fine beast and return it when its duty is done and i would give him the first foal of its many unions and he would be satisfied but it is not he and i he has his orders he says and it would be more than his life is worth to disobey them trust the cheerful voice turned serious and the pale eyes bored into valeriuss it is this matter of trust that comes between us i have traded with the farmers in the territorium for five years and each of us has benefited from it they trust me to deliver the ponies i have promised and i trust them to pay me when the crops are sold and they are in funds lucullus deals with these men every day he is a priest of the temple and he has won their respect valerius had a vision of petroniuss drinkswollen face and his derisive reference to the little brits and wondered if that was entirely true but still there are romans who look upon us and see us as their enemy it is true maeve interrupted with passion now he was able to turn towards her again and the breath caught in his throat like a fishhook because she was angled towards him her face only inches from his own she wore the fierce expression of a mother defending her brood and the pride burned through the powder on her cheeks it is sixteen years since you came here we have accepted roman law and wear roman clothes we eat from roman plates and drink roman wine your gods are not our gods but we have accepted them even she paused and valerius sensed some warning glance from either her father or cearan even though some of them are alien to us what more do you need before you give us your trust valerius remembered the celtic tribes in their dark mountains west of glevum and the tattooed warriors who had thrown themselves on the swords of his legionaries he studied lucullus plump and content on his padded couch his eyes hidden in the shadow and cearan not quite comfortable in the almost roman tunic that clearly hid a physique as impressive as any valerius had seen on the silurian battlefield rome had trusted barbarians in the past arminius of the cherusci had been an officer in the legions and had used what he had learned to destroy three of those legions in the teutoburg forest caesar himself had made common cause with the tribes of gaul only for them to try to stab him in the back the trust of rome was not easily earned the icenis horses would never have the bloodlines of roman cavalry mounts because no roman commander would risk the chance of meeting british cavalry on horses that could match his own for strength and stamina on the battlefield even ten years away you have this romans trust lady he replied but if he hoped flattery would pacify her he was mistaken you trust us yet you come to colonia at the head of almost a thousand soldiers do a thousand spears signify trust in rome the number is eight hundred and i bring roadbuilders not soldiers he said evenly soon we will begin work on the roads and bridges between colonia and the north a wellmended road is good for trade your father he bowed his head towards lucullus will save on axles and wheels and his wagons will be able to travel further and faster that in turn will mean more profits to spend on this wondrous villa he knew hed made a mistake when he saw her eyes narrow fortunately cearan stepped in to save him from the retaliation but surely the primary purpose of your roads is military a legion travelling on a metalled road can cover twice the distance of one marching over open country was it not aulus plautius the first governor of this province who said that his roads were the chains that would bind the barbarians for ever you have me at a disadvantage sir i never knew aulus plautius though i understand he was a fine commander cearan met him though didnt you cearan luculluss voice was slightly slurred and valerius noticed maeves eyes widen fractionally but cearan himself only nodded thoughtfully once was enough caratacus believed he would destroy him on the tamesa but it was caratacus who was destroyed and the rest of us with him he smiled sadly i rode to battle with eight thousand men and returned to venta with fewer than six thousand and counted myself fortunate lucullus lurched to his feet and maeve rose from her couch and brushed past valerius to lead him from the room whispering in his ear numidius lay back with his eyes closed snoring gently valerius took the chance to study luculluss painting of the surrender it was a remarkable piece of art the painter had cleverly used the ranks of the surrounding legions to focus attention on the group at the centre claudius wore a cloak of purple and sat high on the back of an elephant resplendent in golden armour before him knelt eleven figures ten male and one female and the artist had somehow contrived with only the slightest embellishment to convey their royal lineage their expressions ranged from mild concern to outright fear cearan came to his side prasutagus my king he pointed to a figure in the centre of the kneeling line his wife boudicca stood at his side that day so that she would share his burden but the artist has overlooked her and she would thank him for it the voice belonged to aenid who now sat upright on her couch picking at an arrangement of honeyed nuts on the table in front of her boudicca needs no reminding of her peoples dishonour forgive my wife she is a remarkable woman but sometimes she forgets her place cearan said with a smile do not believe him tribune aenid interjected she knows her place very well but unlike one of your roman wives she is entitled to her opinion and has the right to voice it and this cearan pointed to the picture again is king cogidubnus whose rule now extends over the atrebates the regni and the cantiaci i once thought to kill him the last sentence was said matteroffactly and at first valerius thought hed misheard cearan smiled sadly he betrayed us betrayed caratacus if the atrebates had stood and fought with the rest who knows perhaps he gave a little shrug but that is in the past we must deal with life as it is not how we would wish it to be valeriuss eye was drawn to the figure in the flowing blue gown the artist had made her beautiful in a way no real woman was beautiful and who is this cearan hesitated and valerius had a feeling his eyes flicked towards his wife that is queen cartimandua of the brigantes the briton said valerius heard aenid snort derisively behind them she came late to the ceremony but was among the first to recognize the benefits of roman rule she is a traitor maeves voice came from the doorway and seemed unnaturally loud in the small room my wife is not the only lady who does not know her place he said mildly you should attend your father child valerius saw maeves nostrils flare at the word child but cearans authority was strong enough to overcome her anger with a last lightning flash of her eyes she turned and swept from the room again with aenid at her heels valerius felt cheated now i truly ask your forgiveness and your forbearance cearan frowned and glanced towards numidius but the engineer was still oblivious of anything around him it would go ill with lucullus if it were known in colonia that his daughter had used that word in connection with cartimandua none is held in higher honour by the romans than she though since i count you my friend and a very special roman i will say that her reputation among her countrymen is less savoury maeve is young and the young at least among our people like to have their voices heard even if what they say is occasionally foolish or hurtful he turned back to the painting our world changed that day but some of us still do not recognize the reality i have often wondered why my cousin should wish to have a depiction of his peoples greatest shame on his wall he says that it is a fine painting by a fine artist and there is some merit in that but i think the truth is that he needs to remind himself each day that the life he once knew no longer exists and that he must don his roman clothes and step into his roman shoes and take his place in colonia as a roman because there is no other path open to him with a nod cearan went to join his wife valerius reluctantly walked out into the night and waited as his horse was brought from the stables he stood beside the animal for a moment enjoying the cool night air the light of a full moon bathed the countryside in silver and in the distance he heard the mournful screech of a hunting owl we believe the owl is a messenger from the goddess she was part hidden in the shadow of the doorway where she must have waited until the servant was gone to encounter one can be a good omen or a bad her voice had a honeyed quality the angry outburst of a few minutes earlier might never have happened it sounds very much like a message from our gods he replied thinking of the augury by the temple steps the signs can be good or bad but they are never clear sometimes you have to decide for yourself he felt her smile he wished she would come into the light i have been told to apologize for my behaviour now the voice was a parody of a small girls and the words held a slight tremor it had a strangely unsettling effect on him you are my fathers guest and he feels i have insulted you in some way i did not intend to my uncle tells me i must learn to control my tongue your uncle is a good man a slight hesitation yes but sometimes he is too honest now it was valeriuss turn to smile can a man be too honest oh yes because all honesty comes at a price the girls voice was gone and it was said with a womans certainty one day cearan may find it too high may i see you again he wasnt even sure that he had spoken the words certainly he hadnt formed them in his head but they must have been said because she let out an audible gasp of surprise when he looked at the doorway it was empty but he sensed she was still there in the shadow he waited and almost a minute passed it would cause complications the whisper came out of the darkness but but another long pause made him think she had gone but if you truly wish it you will find a way the ride back to colonia seemed much shorter at one point a ghostly shape crossed his path a few hundred yards ahead he decided it wasnt an owl xii the last rays of the dying sun caught the roof of the ramshackle temple of juno moneta which shared the summit of the capitoline half a mile away across the forum with the much grander house of jupiter capitolinus for once lucius annaeus seneca agreed with his emperors view of the ruinous state of much of central rome still this was hardly the time to raise the subject and britain he asked britain the pale eyes were a shadowy curtain for whatever was happening behind them the cherubic face tilted slightly to indicate puzzlement a hint of a smile touched lips the shape of a cupids bow but there was the faintest air of petulance which carried a warning seneca smiled back our island province is the final subject of the day caesar surely you havent forgotten the smile stayed in place but seneca noted the eyes appeared to harden he had played this game many times but the boy strange that he still thought of him as a boy even though he was almost twentytwo years old was an emperor now and playing games with emperors however familiar could be like playing touch with a viper agrippina the boys mother had forgotten that simple rule and he had made her pay the price after one of the most ludicrous botched assassination attempts ever devised when his collapsing boat failed to do the job the emperors hirelings had resorted to the simple and much more effective expedient of stabbing her to death remind us lucius domitius ahenobarbus known as nero nodded for seneca to continue no offence had been taken conquered by your respected stepfather a feat for which rome awarded him a triumph in recognition of his military prowess the curtain lifted for a second as nero attempted to reconcile the vision of weakminded doddering old claudius with the victorious general hailed imperator twentytwo times whom the arch on the via flaminia commemorated your rule is imposed by four legions the twentieth and the second in the west soon to be joined by the fourteenth and the ninth to the north to which they have yet to bring romes bounty and the east seneca paused this was more dangerous ground pacified the conquered tribes accept your rule without question the colonia which emperor claudius founded on the fortress of the trinovantes thrives and its people prosper it is an example to all britain the temple dedicated to the cult of your divine stepfather is a masterpiece worthy of rome itself but he hesitated in deference to the delicate decision he was placing before the boy there is of course the question of whether it might be rededicated i will think on it continue your new port of londinium continues to grow seneca allowed his voice to drop to a low murmur as he listed the virtues of the province this was another part of the game he had found that a combination of pace and pitch could mesmerize the boy and he could let his mind drift on to other subjects while his tongue rolled off the facts and figures he had learned by rote in a few short hours earlier that day it was he thought a singular talent but one he would never boast of unlike those other talents for which he and the world must be for ever thankful his genius for oratory his subtlety of argument the way he could turn a simple subject upside down and inside out and find a satisfactory conclusion that would have eluded any other man today his thoughts turned to claudius there too had lain a sort of genius a genius for survival yet at the end he accepted death as meekly as a sacrificial lamb in the temple of fortuna not only accepted it but embraced it claudius had known agrippinas purpose seneca was certain of it so why when it would have been so simple to plead fatigue or insist another took the first bite had he supped the fatal portion with such enthusiasm was this a case of a life so well lived that the man who lived it had recognised his time surely not proximity to claudius and the nest of serpents he called his advisers had been almost as dangerous as proximity to caligula of reviled memory between them the pair had cost him nine years of his life nine long years of heat and wind and dust spent in exile on corsica a small twinge part guilt part annoyance reminded him of his own complicity and he struggled to suppress it it was a sensation he had felt often over the years how could a man so astute yes astute one must be accurate with words how could such a man succumb to a momentary folly or perhaps not so momentary which would endanger not only his career but his very existence but selfanalysis like selfpity could be corrosive and he forced himself to concentrate too late so we still do not know the source of the islands gold the sharp voice interrupted his thoughts he realized his tone must have faltered allowing the spell to be broken that is correct caesar he acknowledged smoothly but we have barely scratched the surface of the silurian heartlands even now your engineers are seeking out the fountainhead the truth was that the empires expectations should have been met years earlier and would have been but for the obstinacy of the rebel caratacus who had held out in the silurian mountains for almost a decade before his capture exploitation one could cloak the reasons for a military campaign in any guise one wished there were still suspicions about the true motive behind claudiuss invasion of britain but the primary purpose would always be exploitation exploitation of natural resources exploitation of land exploitation of peoples and the late and much maligned claudius had proved a master of exploitation better still the exploited were unaware until the hook had been set or the trap closed first subsidies or loans the one as good as the other indeed the one capable of being mistaken for the other and who would know the truth by the time the loan was called in gifts that bound the warrior kings of britain to rome gifts that brought with them obligations and with obligations came taxes which meant more subsidies more loans more debt yet the cost of maintaining our legions is barely covered by the tax revenues it was as though the emperor had read his mind he should have learned by now never to underestimate the intelligence behind the childs mask the profits of our enterprises slim or nonexistent the initial outlay enormous but unrecouped i see little profit in britain perhaps it is time to withdraw seneca nodded in acknowledgement and allowed himself an indulgent smile though the blood froze in his veins nero was not the only actor in the room but does history not teach us that patience is the investors greatest virtue that haste can be an expensive business partner the young man frowned and leaned forward in the gilded throne one hand the right raised to stroke the smooth almost baby textured flesh of his chin the thinkers pose a ruler deliberating on matters most momentous eventually he spoke perhaps but patience does not fill bellies did you not also teach me that filled bellies and a full arena are what keep the mob from the streets of course caesar in fact it had been claudius who had imparted that rather brutish wisdom seneca allowed the daintiest touch of annoyance to seep into his tone i merely counsel against a precipitate decision grand strategy should not be decided like two beggars haggling in the streets you have other advisers perhaps the praetorian prefect is more qualified to provide guidance in military matters the eyes narrowed your most intimate friend afranius burrus your governor of the province then gaius suetonius paulinus surely no decision should be taken without having first been discussed with the man most able to enlighten summon paulinus home and question him as you have questioned me perhaps his answers will be more palatable than my own humble opinions nero laughed it was a childs laugh highpitched and easy have i offended you dearest seneca does the pupils lack of understanding grieve the teacher then you have my apology sometimes the cares of the empire drive your teachings from my head let us lay down the subject of britain for a moment come explain to me again why an emperors greatest need is for compassion and mercy would not wisdom in all things suffice seneca shook his head first a caesar can cause no offence only concern and britain should rightly be a matter for our concern but to mercy your stepfather divine claudius showed mercy when he reprieved the british war leader caratacus from the strangling rope yet he also showed wisdom and statesmanship for in allowing a mighty warrior to live one who had knelt before him in defeat he gained a living monument to his greatness and thereby enhanced both his own and romes security since with security comes stability did not all from the lowest slave to the highest senator gain from it but an hour later seneca left the room and turned past the twin figures of a pair of anonymous praetorian guards into the corridor once he was certain he was alone he put one hand against the painted wall for support and choked down the bile that filled his throat sweat matted his hair and the stink of fear from his own body filled his nostrils nero knew of course he knew it was time to act he must call in his british investments immediately if the legions withdrew it would be lost all of it what could he do to ensure his fortune was safe an idea formed and he saw a face a thin beaknosed miserable face could he trust him could he afford not to yes it would have to do selfinterested panic receded and he considered the wider appalling consequences if nero proceeded with his threat billions of sestertii wasted on sixteen years of folly a dozen potential allies turned in an instant into certain enemies he listed the tribal kingdoms of the province in his head and attempted to calculate the cost of withdrawal the legions would strip them of each and every vestige of wealth every bushel of grain and every cow taking tens of thousands of slaves and hostages to ensure their future compliance compliance the island would starve and the legacy of that starvation would be enmity for a thousand years and they were so close the gold mines of siluria and the brigantian lead reserves would change everything no it must not happen he could not allow it but first he had to retrieve his fortune he closed his eyes and tried to compose himself marble busts of claudius caligula tiberius augustus and divine julius the pantheon of romes great stared at him from their alcoves as he walked quickly past them emperors all a trio at least of tyrants and each he thought had left rome worse than he received it could nero be different had he lucius annaeus seneca been in a position to make him different it was cool here in the heart of the palace complex and he felt the sweat chill in his hairline his mind went back to the earlier conversation yes he knew xiii gwlym could see only a few faces in the glow of the fire but he knew that beyond them a hundred others sat on the damp leaf mould listening to his words they were the elders of the northern catuvellauni at least those he thought he could trust and he had gathered them in this forest clearing so that they should understand that they were not alone this was the most dangerous time the time when he had to persuade the doubters and the timid now they could see that they were many that they were strong that they were part of a great movement but attending a meeting in a forest glade by night did not mean a man would pick up his spear and march against his oppressors they had courage of course and they hated but sometimes it required more than that and he needed to know that when he moved on they would return to their homes and set up the secret furnaces and workshops that would help them rearm their tribes this was once a sacred grove he said his voice soft but strong enough to be heard clearly by every man among them the romans hacked down the oak trees which grew here for a hundred years and slaughtered the guardians so their blood soaked the ground we sit upon but that blood was not wasted he pointed to a ring of small saplings barely a year old for the grove has been replanted and one day the rites will be renewed here one day the gods will return to their rightful home he paused to allow them to consider his words he knew that certain of the rites he spoke of were not universally loved sometimes it was necessary to dispatch a messenger to the gods to ensure an appeal was heard and understood normally the message carrier was a prisoner or a slave but in times of true emergency the gods would only accept a more treasured candidate a chiefs firstborn or the well favoured daughter of a lord but the gods will only return when they are certain that you have not forsaken them what did you do when the romans came with their axes and their swords he let his hawks eyes rove over the men in the inner circle and then the darkness beyond them so that each became the focus of his words and felt the shame they evoked did you fight or send your sons to fight did you stand and say this is the sacred ground of taranis and teutates of esus and epona no you did not for you are still alive yet though you failed them the gods have not forsaken you the message i bring is this prepare for the time of release is upon us arm for strength is the only message the romans understand wait for only when the gods send their sign will the time be right and they asked what will be the sign and he answered the wrath of andraste xiv five days before the festival of armilustrium when his soldiers would hold the annual ceremony to purify their arms valerius received a surprise summons from the camp prefect of the londinium garrison technically he remained under the command of the twentieth legion and the praefectus castrorum had no authority over himself or his troops in reality he knew that with the governor immersed in preparations for the spring campaign the man was de facto commander of the southeast he had a momentary panic that he was being posted home immediately but quickly realized that order would have come in a simple dispatch he made preparations to leave at once then changed his mind he had more than one reason for making the trip he made the short walk to luculluss offices i am sorry you were inconvenienced lucullus looked up at the young tribune from the scroll he studied for an unguarded moment his face was blank before it automatically took on the fixed smile he wore as if it were part of a uniform on the contrary he said cheerfully i apologize for being such a poor host you were fortunate you did not have the oysters they had been kept a day longer than was good for them or for me my factors back now bears the scars to ensure it will not happen again it was kind of you to come here to enquire after my health the last sentence held the slightest hint of a question you have been very kind to me valerius said obliquely but that was not the only reason for my visit i must leave for londinium tomorrow and i have a favour to ask part of my supplies engineering equipment has failed to arrive i could send a letter but it would only give birth to an extended family of paperwork would it be possible to hire another of your wagons i know it is short notice but i would happily pay a premium pah do not talk to me of premiums the little trinovante blustered for my friend valerius there are only discounts i will give you it at half rate although of course you must provide an acknowledgement for the full amount your roman auditors he shook his head solemnly as if a visit from the auditor was like the arrival of the first plague spot valerius reluctantly agreed to what he knew was tax fraud and arranged for lunaris to collect the wagon before turning the conversation to the true subject of his visit you very generously invited me to hunt over your land at the time i was busy but i would be honoured to take up your offer whenever it is convenient luculluss smile visibly transformed itself from lie to truth and he came round the table and clapped valerius on the back wonderful send word when you have fetched your shovels i promised you good sport and you shall have it there is a boar in the far wood who has been digging up my fields my factor says he is as big as a pony if hes that big he can feed fifty people we will have him on a spit in time for samhain and feast till the sun comes up i remember he was still boasting of the beasts he had taken when valerius left ten minutes later but the young roman could only think of one thing he would see maeve again as he made his way back to the camp he felt someone fall into step beside him and he turned to find petronius at his side falco tells me you are doing business with our tame briton i hope he isnt cheating you the words were accompanied by a smile that suggested they were said in jest but valerius felt like a plump trout being tempted by a dangling worm somewhere in the sentence was a barbed hook surely the quaestor would not allow such a thing he replied guardedly in any case falco tells me that you also do business with lucullus falco had done no more than offer a hint but petronius was not the only one who could dangle a bait we have an arrangement the lawyer admitted airily the celt has his uses and we must at least be seen to try to make common cause with the natives and if i benefit does colonia not also benefit to an even greater degree the boast puzzled valerius and it showed on his face petronius laughed you have not heard poor lucullus he talks much more than is good for him how else would i know what the celts from here to the river abus are thinking and planning who is happy with his lot and who is not valerius increased his pace clearly colonia formed part of the great military and civilian spy network that blanketed southern britain one of the reasons paulinus felt secure enough to launch an attack on the druids on mona was that his spymasters had assured him no danger existed to his rear in any case how would the empire decide whom to tax and by how much if they did not know to the last egg and the smallest bushel of corn what the british chieftains were worth he doubted very much that petronius was the intelligence mastermind he appeared to want him to think but the quaestor was a hard man to shake off you have met his daughter valerius almost stopped but that would have betrayed his interest maeve was his business and no one elses his daughter petronius was amused the skinny darkhaired one she was with her father outside the temple skinny valerius shrugged and tried to give the impression that to a soldier one woman was very much like another from the corner of his eye he caught petronius giving him a sly glance but you must remember her i believe someone perhaps it was old numidius the engineer yes im sure it was him mentioned that you dined with the briton and his friends only two days ago surely she must have been on hand im surprised he hasnt already tried to marry her off to you this time valerius did stop he gave the quaestor a look that would have silenced any of his centurions but petronius only laughed do not look so shocked young man you are unmarried and of means and therefore eligible you are a roman citizen which makes you doubly so if you were the emperor himself you could hardly make a finer catch for a briton with ambitions beyond his status far better certainly than many he has tried to tempt her with it is little wonder she had no interest in the attentions of some toothless farmer who still has the manners of the marching camp but a young man of your lineage i am here to do a job sir valerius said stiffly not to find a wife of course not petronius said sympathetically i merely thought to warn you tribune your briton is a cunning fox and lucullus more cunning than most do not be misled by that inane grin he wears there is a mind behind it that could almost be roman were it not that slyness must never be mistaken for intelligence nor playing the fool for wit still you know of the trap now and i doubt you will fall into it i bid you a good day he bowed and walked off in the direction of the temple of claudius the road between colonia and londinium was the most important in the province and valerius made good time assisted by the dispatches he carried and the military warrant which allowed him to change horses three times at staterun way stations when he arrived at the citys east gate the guards directed him to an officers mansio where he could rest and wash off the accumulated dust and sweat of the journey londinium even more than colonia was a place of bare wooden beams wet plaster halftiled roofs and piles of bricks streets echoed to the rattle of hammers as carpenters swarmed over the skeletal beginnings of public buildings houses and apartment blocks one stood out among the rest a massive squat structure with a pillared entrance and two separate wings it was still far from complete but the guards surrounding the building indicated that the governor gaius suetonius paulinus had already taken up residence in his new palace like colonia the city had begun life as a fort protecting a river crossing then when the restrictions of colonias river access became clear protecting the port that was the driving force behind londiniums bustle of economic and commercial activity the fort still remained up by the wall on the high ground to the northwest but the citys heart was here in the ordered grid of streets by the river and in particular on the main street between the forum and the timber bridge linking the city to the communities which had already sprung up on the southern bank valerius crossed the stream known as the wall brook and walked north towards the fort where he knew the camp prefect had his headquarters after presenting his orders at the gate he expected a formal interview and was surprised to be ushered into a small room off the principia and offered wine two minutes later the prefect bustled in throwing out a stream of orders over his shoulder when the curtain closed behind him he sat down with a sigh and poured himself a liberal cup and raised it in salute health he growled though at your age youve still got it after sixteen years in this swampland i have aches that will never leave me and im as stiff and creaky as a siege tower valerius warily acknowledged the exaggeration decimus castus had been a soldier before he was born had risen through the ranks and held every senior centurions post in the ninth legion before being promoted again to his present position where he outranked even senior tribunes with lines of senatorial relatives dating back to before caesar he answered only to his legate and to his governor normally he would still be with the ninth at lindum but it was a measure of londiniums growing importance that the fort was under the authority of a battlehardened veteran instead of the young auxiliary prefect who would normally command a post like this wondering why i dragged you away from your bumps and bridges eh castus beckoned valerius forward to where a map lay pinned to a wooden frame youre based in colonia here he indicated with a full cohort and a complement of mounted scouts i take it youve made contact with the prefect in charge of the auxiliary cavalry wing billeted to the south yes good youll need to work closely with him now see here here and here he pointed to three positions marked across the centre of the map just east of pennocrucium to the south of ratae and about twenty miles from durobrivae weve had word of unusual activity in all these areas nothing solid nothing you can pin down but shall we say a change of attitude among the natives notice the dates valerius looked more closely and saw each site was marked with a date about a week apart with the latest three weeks before now governor paulinus is not minded to take these reports seriously and hes probably right but im old enough to remember what happened when we disarmed the tribes back in scapulas time one minute they were quiet as dormice the next they came screaming over the battlements like wolves never underestimate your briton young man he can be subdued but hell never be tamed theres a pattern to these changes that makes my old wounds itch he waved a hand over the eastern sector of the map as yet unmarked if that pattern continues well have word from around lindum where ive already asked the ninth to quietly keep an eye on things then further southeast which brings us to the point i want you to work with your cavalry commander to carry out aggressive patrols to the north and northwest of colonia with particular emphasis on the country where the boundaries of the trinovantes the catuvellauni and the iceni meet the quaestor s opinion is that this area is quiet valerius ventured castus grunted so i understand the next thing youll be telling me is that the celts enjoy being taxed and they think the price we pay them for corn is fair valerius smiled and resumed his study of the map it seemed a small thing to be getting so exercised about still castus knew his business better than most spies can be wrong he agreed ill issue the order as soon as i return to colonia the cavalry commander bela is a good man and his troops are keen you should pay particular attention to the iceni castus continued theyre our allies and old prasutagus is on friendly terms with the governor but that doesnt make them any more trustworthy and it means we know less about them than we do the other tribes its more difficult to spy on your friends than your enemies anything you can discover would be of help but youll have to be subtle when the interview was over valerius walked the short distance to the quartermasters depot by the north gate there his business looked likely to take longer thanks to a clerk who insisted that a mistake wasnt a mistake unless it was confirmed in writing and endorsed by three seals and he wouldnt budge on that even if it happened to be the governor at the other side of his desk fortunately the clerks overseer was a decurion who had served with the twentieth and recognized valerius if the tribune says the shovels didnt turn up they didnt turn up and if the twentieth needs shovels the twentieth gets shovels anything else you require sir he asked with a wink valerius left with an assurance that when his wagon arrived it would be loaded with a dozen shields and swords and fifty pila to replace those lost during the summer which would go some way to paying his debt to falco lunaris wasnt likely to reach londinium with the wagon until the next day which gave him a night to kill he didnt want to be alone but equally he didnt want to be with the type of woman available to a soldier in a city like this in fact the only woman he wanted to be with was maeve eventually he settled for a night in the mansio drinking wine with a few fellow officers either passing through on their way to join a legion or travelling back to rome it amused him to listen to the veterans hairraising stories of the prowess of the celtic warriors from the western tribes he had faced earlier in the year he watched one of the younger newcomers grow paler and paler and finally took pity on the man i dont believe they were actually seven feet tall he whispered and they bleed just as easily as the next man you have nothing to fear if you keep your shield up and your sword sharp but do they truly burn their prisoners alive and eat their still beating hearts he smiled only in the north and i believe your unit is in the west they burn their prisoners in the west too the growl came from a roughhewn centurion sitting by the fire in the corner of the room at least the druids do but not for much longer i was on the staff of the fourteenth and were going to settle them for good they think theyre safe on their little island but the only way theyll leave it alive will be if they swim for it well be waiting to welcome them on the beach then well see who burns come the summer there wont be a druid left in britain and good riddance to them valerius looked around to see who might be listening talk like this was universal among soldiers but hearing the man trumpet details of an impending military campaign made the hairs on the back of his neck rise the servants in the mansio were all british slaves and he doubted they could be trusted he had heard many stories about the druids merciless cruelty but beneath those stories lay an unlikely respect these men these priests were the mortar which had bound the british tribes until claudius had shattered their unity with a combination of military might and subterfuge they might have been herded back on to their sacred island but they were still organized it wasnt only rome that had spies he shot the centurion a warning look but the man refused to be silenced everyone knows and why should they not he said defiantly if the britons fight so much the better the more of them who try to stop us the more of the vermin we will kill valerius had a sudden image of a pair of firefilled eyes and a flashing knife a man who wanted to kill him more than he loved life itself what if there are too many of them for you to kill xv the following day he woke before dawn and joined legionaries of the londinium garrison in the fortress exercise yard an hour sweating with the practice sword had become as much part of his life as eating and drinking and hed reached a stage where he enjoyed the small agonies which accompanied pushing his body to the very limit he knew lunaris was unlikely to arrive until late afternoon and while he laboured against his opponents shield he decided to spend the morning at the public baths down by the waterfront close to the inn where he had arranged to meet the duplicarius there he spent a few pleasant hours listening to desultory and no doubt scurrilous gossip in the baths and wondering at the good fortune that had allowed him the pleasure of the caldarium and the tepidarium twice in as many weeks after so long an abstinence later a slave oiled his body before scraping the skin clean with a sharpedged strigil and by the time he emerged he felt more relaxed than hed been for months still surrounded by a pleasurable euphoria he reached the tavern happy to see that it hadnt been subsumed in one of the many building projects going on around it it occupied the ground floor of a three storey insula and was identified by an amphora hanging at an angle from two chains above the doorway a painted poster beside the open door advertised the finest imported wines but valerius knew that anyone who thought theyd find them in a place like this was destined to be disappointed inside oil lamps flickered from the walls but seemed to produce more smoke than light it was busy even at this hour of the day as hed guessed it would be this was a sailors town and sailors between voyages only had two interests judging by the laughter and the highpitched female squeals both were available here he took one last deep breath of relatively clean air and plunged inside lunaris had made the choice and valerius could see why but it wasnt a place he would have selected for himself the room he entered had a low ceiling and measured about thirty paces by fifteen with five or six seated alcoves where a man might conduct his business in relative privacy in another establishment the sight of an officers uniform would have caused a hush in the conversation but here his fellow customers ignored his presence a glimpse of scarlet in the gloom told him he was not the only army man among all these seamen he pushed towards the bar through the crowd vying for the attentions of a few heavily painted and only partially dressed women whatll you have lunaris had said the inn was owned by a retired legionary veteran who had sold up in colonia and moved to londinium im with the twentieth he said as hed been instructed i dont give a bugger if youre with the camelhumpers the barman laughed whatll you have oh well it looked as if the place was under new ownership whatevers good now youre talking we had a shipment in from sardinia last week cost you a couple of sestertii more for a jug but you wont regret it he turned to go but valerius grabbed his sleeve if i do i wont be the only one the man laughed unconcerned at the threat suit yourself youll get a seat over there he pointed to a darkened corner ill get the slave to bring it over valerius pushed his way to the corner and sat down with his back to a doorway which from the smell led to either the kitchen or the latrine or possibly both a young man with a cast in one eye brought him a jug filled to overflowing with dark liquid and placed a chipped cup beside it the slave reached to pour the wine but valerius waved him away he studied his surroundings already regretting the impulse that had brought him through the door the noise and the smoke after his hours at the baths made his head spin slightly hed just resolved to leave after a single drink when a slight commotion erupted behind him as two drinkers collided in the doorway with a muttered curse the sound of one of the voices rang a warning bell in his head and he half stood reaching for the knife on his belt too late an arm wrapped itself round his throat and he felt a calloused hand on the back of his head in a classic wrestling hold that he knew could snap his neck as if it were a dry twig he tore at the arm with both hands trying to break the iron grip that was already choking him but the pressure on the back of his skull increased and his vision began to go im dead he thought in the same instant the grip slackened and as he gasped for breath a roar of laughter assaulted his ears a tall figure in a red tunic stumbled into the seat opposite him and stared across the table with peering reddened eyes got a drink for an old pal pretty boy im just about out of cash slave slave another cup and bring another jug while youre at it crespo thought i had you there eh just one twist and crack you were a goner the sicilian chuckled killed a man like that once looked as if he had his head on backwards slave about time the boy arrived with a second cup and another overflowing jug and retreated with a scared glance at crespo as the roman poured the wine carefully into the two cups ave he raised his cup in salute the twentieth and victory reluctantly valerius picked up his own vessel and repeated the toast the twentieth and damnation to the brits and all their diseaseridden sluts valerius stared but the grin on crespos face never wavered maybe i should have killed you caused nothing but trouble for old crespo you did pretty boy had the legate on my back for a month might have been kicked out but crespos too clever for them he tapped his nose valerius noted that it hadnt set well the axe blade now had a distinct notch in it too clever got myself a transfer for a second the eyes glazed over and the centurion rocked back and forward from the waist his head wobbling gently on his long neck crespo had clearly been in the bar for some time possibly all night judging by the crumpled state of his clothing and the dark shadow on his chin valerius recalled the scene in the silurian hut it was as well hed come across crespo cheerfully drunk and in daylight the same thought had evidently occurred to his unwanted companion maybe i should kill you he growled pulling a dagger from inside his tunic and stabbing it into the already scarred table top the noise attracted the attention of everyone in the bar and valerius saw the barman reach below his counter where he undoubtedly kept a large cudgel specifically for situations like this he caught the mans eye and gave a slight shake of his head an unspoken question you sure valerius answered by pinning crespo with the friendliest grin he was capable of why would you want to kill me we had a little misunderstanding thats all things like that happen all the time in the heat of battle he remembered the silurian girls terrified eyes staring at him over crespos shoulder in one movement he could take the dagger by the hilt and put the blade through crespos right eye the centurion would be dead before he could blink everybody in the bar had seen crespo pull the knife there might be a few awkward questions but hed worry about that later crespo frowned he had both hands on the table top and valerius decided that if the right hand moved towards the knife he would kill him misunderstanding sure heat of battle the hand moved but only as far as his cup he took a deep draught and wiped the back of his hand across his lips tell me about the transfer valerius suggested hoping it was somewhere far away and very dangerous germania or even armenia would do a couple of seasons playing tag with the alamanni was just what crespo needed secret crespo said tapping his nose again old tentmates dont have secrets crespo you know that weve fought in the same shield line and shared a latrine bench how could we have secrets procurators office on his staff hes a miserable little shit catus decianus but hes got the right idea squeeze them until they bleed he paused and valerius watched his brain fight the wine in his system you wont tell anybody i said that valerius tried not to show his disappointment the procurators office meant londinium much too close what that hes a miserable little shit not that the other thing squeeze them its a secret squeeze who squeeze the celts crespo said as if the answer was obvious theyve been feeding off rome for years subsidies and tax breaks while me and you were sweating and bleeding theyve been rolling in it now they want it back who wants it back big people the centurion winked powerful people subsidies and tax breaks only now theyre all loans big people powerful people just like crespo to talk up his new job he knew as much about subsidies and tax breaks as valerius did which was precious little it sounded as if hed got out of the twentieth just in time and he seemed inordinately proud of his appointment but what was he just another bloodsucking debt collector so a few britons had got behind with their tax payments maybe someone would have their farm taken away from them well crespo was just the man for that but what really mattered at the moment was that he was drunk enough to be harmless and valerius decided it would be better to keep him that way at least until lunaris arrived he poured wine from the jug into the two cups ensuring crespos was full to the brim tell me about glevum it was dusk when he left the bar with crespo staggering in his wake banging from one side of the doorway to the other and muttering about vengeance he still had his knife and valerius considered taking him down towards the river and finding out whether he could swim with a bellyful of wine but all he really wanted to do was get away from the man proximity to crespo had left him feeling dirty every soldier had his dark places but crespos went to the very centre of hades itself the rape of the silurian girl evidently hadnt been the first not by a long way and there were hints of even more terrible crimes whos the drunk he looked up to see lunaris lounging in the doorway of an apartment block opposite the bar an old friend dont you recognize centurion crespo and arent you supposed to salute an officer sir lunaris rapped his arm against his chest armour with elaborate ceremony i thought we were going to meet inside crespo had slumped against the wall of the tavern and valerius removed the knife from his hand and threw it into an alleyway didnt fancy the company sir mine or his not sure sir what are we going to do with him the legionarys tone made it more of a suggestion than a question maybe the river wasnt such a bad idea valerius looked around no too many witnesses and if crespo was truly on the procurators staff thered be an investigation he had a better idea lets give him a nice soft bed for the night he suggested pointing to a large midden that steamed noxiously beside a stable a few yards down the street they picked crespo up between them and carried him to the dungheap ready lunaris asked on three one two three crespos body landed face down among the horse and mule shit and if valerius was any judge the contents of the owners latrine pit thatll do nicely hes among friends lunaris laughed wait valerius picked up a stick leaning against the stable door and prodded the manure around crespos face until he had space to breathe no point in killing him lunaris snorted i wouldnt be so sure about that xvi valerius dearest son and a fathers pride i greet you and salute you livius sends word that you are in good health and do your duty do not trouble yourself on behalf of your father his joints may creak these days but he thrives like the olive trees on the southern slope beyond the river a little more gnarled with each passing year but still productive in his way granta and cronus send their greetings too the letter had followed him from glevum and must have been written two months earlier valerius smiled as he read the opening again a typical fathers missive to his son replete with familial pleasantries but containing a rebuke in every line the fact that livius had sent word of his condition was meant to remind him that he had not the creaking joints were a hint that his father was feeling abandoned granta and cronus were the two freedmen who managed the estate he struggled to find the hidden message in their inclusion but he had no doubt it was there somewhere he read on i still await the reply from the emperor in connection with my request for an appointment it has been several months i know but i retain some hope of advancement and a resurgence in the fortunes of our family the emperor is a fine young man with many responsibilities but i have taken steps to ensure my application is brought before him valerius felt his heart sink as he read the last sentence even in faraway britain it was clear that dabbling in politics in rome under emperor nero could be as dangerous as a night patrol in a silurian swamp his father had prospered thanks to his friendship with the emperor tiberius but that had been long ago he had only survived caligula by retreating to the estate and resolutely ignoring the blandishments of every competing faction there had been a brief revival under claudius which ended with some indiscretion his father would never discuss which had left him with an enduring hatred for the old emperors freedman narcissus now was not the time to be making a political comeback the problem was that lucius believed he had friends at court i had a most pleasant encounter with your old tutor seneca just the other day and he brought me up to date with events in rome and in the senate valerius groaned as a boy he had studied under the great man and the philosopher now owned an estate in the next valley to his father seneca in his early sixties could be a wonderful dinner companion entertaining and erudite fashioning arguments that could turn a mans head inside out and have him debating against himself he was also reckless and dangerous to know one clever remark too many had lost him caligulas patronage and might easily have cost him his life yet just when his star was in the ascendancy again a flagrant affair with the nowdead emperors sister julia livilla had seen him sent into exile by her uncle caligulas successor claudius claudiuss wife agrippina had rescued him from obscurity in corsica to tutor her son and now that same son ruled the empire and seneca sat at his side seneca advises that you consider leaving britain at once these things can be arranged he says and resume your legal career it appears that your island province has not met the emperors expectations he sees only huge expenditure without tangible result and only his respect for his late stepfathers achievements there maintains his interest my friend fears that interest may not be indefinite he hinted that if i had any investments in britain it might be wise to withdraw them and direct them elsewhere but my only investment is you my son valerius imagined he could see a stain on the letter where a stray tear had dropped and the thought of that investment ending its days on the point of some savages spear undoubtedly shortens a tenure already sadly decreased by lifes manifest burdens more of the same emotional blackmail followed before the letter descended into a catalogue of complaint directed against the weather the slaves the worthy granta and cronus who were the only reason the estate remained in profit the price of olive oil which was down and the price of cattle feed which was up valerius put the letter aside before he had finished reading it knowing it would undoubtedly end with another plea for his return to rome but his mind dwelt on the contents the old mans ambitions were worrying enough but what about the hints of high politics could nero truly be considering abandoning britain it seemed impossible that such an enormous investment in gold and blood should be cast aside so lightly no it was not possible he was here in colonia the tangible proof that britain was rome a city with an emperors name and a god emperors temple at its heart and senecas suggestion that lucius should withdraw his nonexistent investments how did that square with what he had heard about the huge stake the philosopher had in the province no his father must have misunderstood later valerius dispatched lunaris to deliver the swords and shields to the militia armoury then you can take the shovels out to the second century on the venta road you should be back by nightfall get a good nights sleep were going hunting in the morning lunaris gave him an old soldiers look hunting you said you were bored mending roads that depends what well be hunting boar i think the legionary brightened and we get to eat what we kill where on the estate of lucullus the briton who is augustalis of the temple of claudius lunaris frowned are you sure its only boar youre after now it was valeriuss turn to look concerned why what have you heard the big man shrugged just tent talk you were out there the other day and the quaestor petronius was sniffing around asking questions you should have speared the bastard what kind of questions the kind of thing you toffs are interested in who your father is if you have any friends in high places ask julius i only got it from his clerk wholl lose the skin off his back if i have anything to do with it lunaris hid his smile he knew valerius wasnt the type of officer to have a soldier whipped the young tribune was an easy man to like and theyd become as close as people of their very different classes could become on the slow journey back from londinium valerius had tied his horse to the ox cart and theyd walked together for most of the way for all his ancient bloodlines and high education the tribune was a country boy at heart he had pointed out animals and sign of animals that lunaris who had been brought up in the festering backstreets in the valleys between the seven hills of rome would never have seen without his help a sleek otter gliding along the depths of a river pool with silver bubbles streaming from its flanks and shy fallow deer peering from the shadows of a roadside copse an old dog fox that crossed the road just ahead of them with one of his cubs in its mouth lunaris in his turn had told of surviving by his wits among the child gangs of the vicus bellonae in the subura stealing apples by sleight of hand or drawing a bakers attention while a fleetfooted accomplice lifted a loaf that would be shared later by the time they arrived outside colonias gates they had become friends which allowed lunaris a certain leeway when they were alone but he was a legionary and valerius was a legionary officer and there were limits that both understood id best be going if im to be back by dark sir he suggested valerius waved him away and set off in the direction of the west gate the goldsmiths shop formed part of a villa fronting the main street not far from luculluss townhouse it didnt look much from the roadway but looks could be deceptive a villa like this might take up an entire city block with a labyrinth of dozens of interconnecting rooms and courtyards behind the unimposing facade more likely it was less grand corvinus didnt strike him as a man who needed to parade his wealth but certainly enough to show that the former armourer had invested his pension and his talents wisely the thought brought lucullus to mind and from lucullus petronius no doubt he had his reasons for asking questions about a lowly visiting tribune but the quaestor s interest had planted a seed of concern corvinus awaited him inside the shop as they had arranged your business in londinium was concluded successfully i hope he said politely valerius mentioned the brandnew swords and shields he had prised from the quartermaster in the city and the goldsmiths face lit up you wouldnt have got away with that in my day but by marss beard i thank you for it thats a dozen rusty spikes that call themselves gladii ill never have to put an edge on again and a dozen shields only fit for the practice ground i can replace valerius smiled is the work complete he asked changing the subject it is corvinus said i have it here he reached up into the top row of a manydrawered cabinet behind him and pulled out a leather bag which he placed on the counter between them i hope it is to your satisfaction he picked at the drawstrings of the bag and poured the contents into his hand i could have fashioned something finer added a chain perhaps but the time he said apologetically no it is exactly what i wanted it was perfect hanging from a thin cord of soft leather was the tiny figure worked in gold of a charging boar a replica of the insignia which decorated the shields of the twentieth the craftsmanship was astonishingly delicate and valerius could barely believe it had been created by the massive workmans hands which held it the pendant shone with a lustre that belied its size and was an object of incredible beauty it had cost him a months pay and was worth every sestertius because it would not look out of place at a queens throat by tomorrow night he hoped it would be hanging at maeves i congratulate you valerius said the workmanship is the finest i have ever seen but how corvinus might have been insulted but he only laughed sometimes a man spends a lifetime battering swords on an anvil but knows deep inside that he has the skill to create finer things valerius paid the agreed sum and corvinus placed the necklace carefully back in its leather pouch your lady is very fortunate tell her to bring it back here and i will fashion a chain for it free of charge i have not forgotten your handsome new swords but of course she will be in rome valerius picked up the pouch and smiled his goodbye no he said she is not in rome when he was gone corvinus reflected on the tribunes final words and chewed his lip should he have said something no it was none of his business lunaris didnt suit the horse and the horse didnt suit lunaris it was valeriuss spare mount a gaulish mare with handsome thoroughbred lines and a playful nature made more playful by the fact that she hadnt been ridden for more than a week dont keep tugging on the reins she has a delicate mouth valerius admonished him wishing hed put the duplicarius on a pack mule instead ive got a delicate backside if i dont keep tugging on the reins shell be in brigante country and youll be hunting on your own i thought you said you could ride i said i had ridden lunaris announced with dignity i didnt say id ridden a horse this big valerius tried to imagine the legionary on anything smaller when was that when i was six or seven but there are some things you never forget valerius studied him again hunched low over the mares ears as if he could control her by sheer force of will yes there are some things you never forget he agreed we wont be hunting on horseback said lunaris worriedly i hope not they arrived at luculluss villa in the fine grey drizzle valerius had come to realize was britains standard morning welcome lunaris grunted with relief to see the hunting party waiting on foot but valerius suppressed a curse when he saw how they were dressed a roman officers dignity wouldnt allow him to appear before his barbarian host in anything but full uniform including his scarlet cloak the dozen men awaiting them he noted that they were all britons were dressed uniformly in clothing of brown and green heavy cloth shirts and trews that would fend off the largest bramble perfect for blending in with the landscape and thick with lanolin to keep out the rain at least well be able to find each other lunaris muttered from his side welcome my friends lucullus emerged smiling from the house and valerius was pleased to see he was accompanied by cearan the iceni nobleman he looked beyond the two men searching for maeve but she was nowhere in sight the trinovante continued you have eaten i hope good we will not eat again until the eighth hour but i have arranged to have food brought to us on the hunt we are civilized people you see valerius saw cearan studying him with a sympathetic smile he came close to the horses side and patted it on the flank a fine beast from gaul good for racing and fighting but not for hunting he lowered his voice like your uniform if you and your comrade follow me indoors i believe i will be able to find you something more suitable the two romans glanced at each other and the handsome celt recognized the look that passed between them do not be concerned your fine weapons and armour will be safe under luculluss roof we are not all thieves despite what your people seem to think valerius felt the heat of embarrassment on his face im sorry we did not mean to give that impression but we are soldiers and these things are precious to us as they are to us the iceni said graciously i will place your sword beside mine and your helmet with my arm and neck rings he led them to a room where they could change their clothes and showed them where to put their armour and weapons lunaris finished dressing first grunting as he squeezed into a pair of checked woollen trews which struggled to fit around his substantial backside im putting you on half rations for a month valerius joked get out there and find out whats happening ill join you in a moment the shirt and trews were of heavier cloth than the equivalent roman tunic and braccae but he could move much more freely than in chest armour and a helmet he left his gladius with his armour but retained his belt and the short dagger attached to it the belt also carried a small pouch and he carefully placed the leather bag with the boar amulet inside and ensured it was secure he felt outlandish in the unfamiliar celtic clothing and wished he had a mirror to see what he looked like a thought he immediately banished fool you look exactly like everyone else only with shorter hair and no festering moustache he hurried into the corridor and collided with someone rushing the other way his first sensation was of softness then of strength of warmth followed by fear maeve gasped when her body felt the touch of his and her eyes widened with surprise when she saw the handsome young man in the familiar celtic clothing it took a moment for her to recognize valerius the look was quickly replaced by another that was gone before he could decide what it was valerius willed his legs to move but for some reason they wouldnt obey his chest tightened and his flesh seemed to tingle in a way he had only experienced once before when he was caught outdoors in a lightning storm she wore her hair loose today and her long dress was of dark blue wool belted at the waist in a way that emphasized the weight of her breasts and the breadth of her hips he took a step back and bowed maeve she gave a little frown and lowered her head tribune he wanted to reach out and raise her chin so that she was looking into his eyes and tell her that his name was valerius but all he said was will you be joining us on the hunt today the creamy skin of her forehead wrinkled slightly and he knew she was smiling not all british women are the mighty amazons of your mysteries sir we cook and we weave but we do not hunt or fight i apologize they seemed to be forever apologizing to each other you must think me uncultured she raised her head and stared at him no i do not think that he reached for the pouch at his belt but she sensed his purpose and placed her hand on his the heat of her touch felt like a brand you must hurry they are waiting will i if the gods will it remember the owl a shout from the doorway summoned him he looked at her and nodded then he was gone she stared after him trying to divine the conflicting feelings that raged within her knowing they were the most dangerous of human emotions but not which would win the fight xvii lucullus led the way along the muddy thornlined trackways dissecting the fields of his estate most of the enclosures were devoted to raising sheep or pigs although a few were grazed by scrawny duncoloured cattle small farmsteads dotted the countryside each with a roundhouse and its pen for livestock and around these the currently barren spaces that would be planted with crops in the spring valerius and lunaris walked together and valerius wished cearan could join them a roman hunt would be governed by traditions dating back hundreds of years and he had little doubt a british hunt was the same but the iceni walked ahead with their host and it seemed unlikely theyd be enlightened by their closer companions the britons paid the two romans little heed apart from an occasional quizzical glance chattering excitedly in their own language behind the hunters came the servants and slaves each carrying a long spear what happened while i was inside the villa he asked lunaris mainly they wondered what was keeping you the duplicarius said what was keeping you there must have been something valerius allowed his impatience to show lunaris gave a shrug the little lord the fat one paired everyone off youre with him and im with the tall friendly one after that he gave a speech in that noise of theirs and they cheered him he glanced around him theyre a rum lot one minute theyre as docile as sheep the next theyre roaring like wolves i wished id had my sword valerius smiled remembering castuss similar comment were safe enough with lucullus in any case i used to hunt wolves on my fathers estate not these wolves you didnt watch your back when youre out in the long grass well look silly if we end up with some druid prodding at our livers to find out if its going to rain tomorrow by now they were approaching a broad stretch of woodland guarded at intervals by small groups of men each of whom held a pair of snarling hounds valerius heard lucullus call out his name and a guide ushered them forward he studied the animals remembering tales of british fighting dogs trained to rip out a mans throat lucullus noticed his interest my boarhounds the little man said proudly i bred them myself they have been out since dawn tracking down our quarry i instructed my forest wardens that only the largest beasts were of interest in your honour of course valerius bowed his thanks but there were other honours hed rather have received it seems they have penned a boar in this wood a few dogs have been lost and no doubt he will be rather torn but he will still provide us with good sport i think i have hunted this boar before but he has always bested me he tore up the green shoots in the spring and more recently he has destroyed the corn on the ear he has been an expensive guest so we wait until the dogs have cornered him properly and then surround him oh no lucullus said seriously this is not one of your arenas that would be much too simple and there would be little honour in it the boar must have his opportunity as we will you are different from us you see we esteem the birds and the beasts we hunt for each of them possesses a soul just as each man possesses a soul and the gods watch over them as they do us he smiled sadly let us hope that the gods both our gods are with us today the men split into pairs and lucullus accepted a team of hounds from one of the handlers valerius found cearan at his side you will take the first boar as the guest of honour he said quietly he stepped aside as a servant handed valerius a spear seven feet in length solid and heavy with a broad leafshaped blade and a wooden crosspiece a third of the way down its shaft the crosspiece is to ensure the boar cannot reach you with his tusks he explained lucullus will keep the dogs leashed until the last moment the boar will be deep in a thicket licking his wounds and the warden will place you where he is most likely to emerge when the dogs find him he will run they will stay with him but when he sees you it will be you he comes for he knows his enemy you see when he comes his head will be low that means you must be low too for the spear has to take him in the chest to kill him anywhere on the head and it will glance off his skull which is like iron on the flanks it will only anger him more remember only in the chest we are ready lucullus announced valerius hefted the spear and balanced it between his hands instinctively finding the most effective grip so that when the moment came he could place the point where it was needed without hesitation or thought he felt no fear only the suppressed excitement of the hunt his heart beat faster in his chest thudding against the ribcage and he willed himself to control it because he knew passion was his enemy he must clear his mind and concentrate every one of his senses on his quarry slowly he followed lucullus towards the escarpment of brown and gold the two dogs straining at the leash alternately snarling and baying as the scent of their prey carried to them on the light breeze when they reached the shelter of the trees valerius saw the forest was much less dense than it appeared from outside and as they penetrated deeper he realized that what he had thought untamed woodland had been carefully managed for generations gaps in the trees showed where the different types of wood had been harvested oak for house timbers and making shields ash pollarded to provide the long spears the britons wielded so effectively hornbeam yew and horse chestnut all had their uses each clearing quickly filled with scrubby bush and thorn that provided perfect cover for partridge and woodcock deer and wild ox and for the giant boar which raided luculluss fields by now the dogs were permanently on the scent and they threw themselves against their leashes almost strangling themselves in their eagerness to reach their prey lucullus must have been stronger than he appeared or he could never have held them they were massive beasts black and tan on the flanks standing as high as a mans belly with deep powerful chests big heads and jaws filled with fearsome teeth the britons eyes met valeriuss and he grinned the excitement of the moment as fierce within him as it was in the roman the forest warden ranged ahead of them and they froze as he halted before a large clump of thorn that spread in a broad halfmoon across their front valerius would swear the man sniffed the air and pointed like one of his dogs before he waved them up and spoke rapidly to valerius in his own language he says you should go there lucullus translated and pointed to a spot on the right about fifteen paces from the bushes he advises you to keep the spear low you will have only one chance before he is on you may taranis aid you and mercury speed your hand valerius nodded as lucullus and the warden moved away with the dogs leaving him alone he felt a fluttering in his chest not fear he thought just a few nerves and nerves gave a man an edge if he knew how to control them this was the moment of crisis in any hunt the moment when everything became clear and the only things that existed were the hunter and the hunted and nothing between he crouched low and held the spear in front of him his left hand well forward on the ash shaft and the right close to his body to ensure a steady direct thrust as he waited he stared at the bushes in front of him a wall of unbroken dangerous green where would it come surely lucullus should have unleashed the dogs by now he cursed his own impatience wait be ready the misty rain had stopped but his hands were damp and he prayed his grip wouldnt fail at the vital moment where were the dogs he glanced to his left and in the same instant a cacophony of barks snarls and unearthly squeals shattered the silence the green wall in front of him exploded as something enormous burst from the undergrowth his heart seemed to stop it was huge he had seen smaller oxen a black nemesis with burning red eyes and menacing curved sixinch tusks already bloodied by its battle with the dogs that now snapped at its flanks as he watched it swung its head almost casually and one of the hounds was tossed away howling with a fearsome gash in its side and its entrails hanging clear he recognized the instant the boar became aware of his presence the subtle change of direction it came unbelievably fast its short legs a blur as it crossed the ground between them low he dropped to one knee and forced the butt of the spear into the ground behind him keeping the point directly on the animals breastbone but was he low enough the massive snout was almost on its chest and he was close enough to see the long crest of erect quilllike black hair along the ridge of its spine and the old scars on its massive shoulders from past encounters with dogs he had no time to change the angle of the spear he could only hold and pray the boars size was its undoing it was so enormous that when the iron spearhead slipped just under the chin the animals own momentum forced it deep into the chest cavity punching through bone and muscle and delivering a mortal wound to the great heart valerius had braced himself for the shock but still the power of the impact astonished him the force of it surged along the spear and almost catapulted him free of the shaft he was shaken like a leaf in a thunderstorm tossed this way and that until he thought his neck would snap instinct told him the strike was true but the boar refused to die the red eyes still burned as it forced its way inch by inch up the ash shaft driving the blade ever deeper into its body until it was stopped by the crosspiece even then it fought on lashing right and left so that valerius feared he would lose his grip finally bright heart blood gushed from the gaping mouth and the boar gave an awful shudder and was still valerius slumped panting over the spear he sent a silent prayer to jupiter and minerva and willed himself to stop shaking the exhilaration of the kill would come later but for now there was only the familiar drymouthed aftermath of survival the remaining hound saved him it broke off from sniffing at the enormous carcass to give a sudden warning snarl a second boar almost as big as the first erupted from the bushes to his left where it must have lain silent while its brother drew the dogs away now it was here to avenge him no time to retrieve the spear which was buried two feet in the first animals chest valerius rolled to his right placing the mass of the dead pig between himself and the attack he was only just in time as he huddled in the lee of the boar attempting to make himself part of the earth a giant head appeared over the animals flank a ferocious apparition of gaping pink mouth snapping mantrap jaws and slashing yellowed tusks that came within a hairs breadth of disembowelling him he scrabbled for his knife knowing it would barely scratch the boars thick hide but it was trapped beneath his body how long would it take the beast to work out that it could reach him more easily from the side could he run no he had seen the speed with which it had crossed the clearing he frantically searched the area around him for some weapon but there was none he twisted his arm so he could reach his belt but the movement attracted the boar and now the tusks swung at his face the great mouth wide and putridbreathed in front of his eyes and the teeth chopping and gnashing another inch and he would be dead he ignored a stab of pain in his shoulder and concentrated on the belt at last his grasping fingers found the fastening and gradually he was able to work it round his body until the knife hilt lay in the palm of his hand one chance and one chance only he lay with his left side beneath the dead boars still warm belly and his head tight against the coarse hairs of its ribs his right arm was twisted behind him but at least he had the knife he screamed a mindless battle cry and with all the power he could call upon swung the knife at the beasts gleaming eye praying to any god who would listen that his aim should be good the boar squealed with pain and fury but he knew he had failed the point missed its target by a full inch ploughing a red furrow across the pigs broad forehead the thrashing above him took on an even more savage mindless quality and he knew that there was no escape no glorious end on the battlefield for gaius valerius verrens scion of a tribe with its roots in the very founding of rome he would die unremembered in this damp british forest with his nostrils filled with the musky stink of boar he thought of the golden amulet in his pouch and that in turn made him think of maeve her face filled his mind and he heard the sound of a familiar voice so one boar was not enough for you he looked up bemused to discover cearan staring at him over the second boars shoulder which had now sprouted the shaft of a throwing spear the great body shook spasmodically and tendrils of dark blood drooled from the beasts open mouth on to the flank of its sibling please the briton extended his hand valerius allowed cearan to help him shakily to his feet i thank you you saved my life his voice sounded hoarse in his own ears as he stared at the two boars between them they would weigh as much as a fully laden ox cart if the second hadnt been obstructed by his brothers body it would surely have ripped him to pieces he turned back to cearan if ever the iceni waved a hand dismissively we are friends you would have done as much for me in any case it was at my suggestion that lucullus invited you to hunt with him he became disoriented in the forest once the dogs were loosed therefore you were my responsibility it would have been discourteous not to say inconvenient if you had died valerius registered the word inconvenient as cearan stooped to crouch over the first boar studying the spot where the blade of the spear had penetrated its breast a fine blow well aimed he is your first valerius nodded the briton smiled and when he stood he reached out his fingers which were red with the boars blood and with quick practised strokes smeared it over the romans forehead and cheeks it is our custom he explained it marks a man as a man and only a man could have faced such a giant without flinching a commotion behind them announced the arrival of the rest of the hunting party led by lucullus and lunaris who stopped in his tracks when he saw the size of the kill by marss mighty arse ive never seen anything like it just one of them would feed the cohort with ham for breakfast every day for a month you could hitch them to a chariot and theyd haul you all the way to rome you could help us butcher them cearan suggested surely you would not put him to work before he has had the opportunity to best his officer lucullus admonished his cousin there is word of another spoor in a copse to the north he suggested that the rest of the hunt move on while valerius rested and the slaves butchered the two boars you have had your sport cousin i will leave you to take care of our guest lunaris looked suspicious but valerius nodded to him and the big legionary allowed lucullus to lead him off with the others as the slaves worked on the two carcasses with gutting knives and hatchets cearan reached into the pack he had dropped and retrieved a bulging goatskin here he offered you must be thirsty valerius put the skin to his lips expecting the contents to be water but the tepid liquid was some sort of sweet fruity beer that went straight to his head instantly reviving him he took another gulp cearan laughed not too much or the slaves will have to carry you home along with the boar it is honeyed ale but with an infusion of herbs singular to my own tribe the effect was remarkable this must be what your warriors drink before battle perhaps the catuvellauni cearan said seriously or the tribes of the west but the iceni do not need ale or mead to give them courage he walked to the edge of the clearing out of earshot of the servants and valerius instinctively knew he should follow when i fought the romans beside caratacus on the tamesa i realized a truth that he did not or perhaps i do him an injustice and he did realize it but refused to accept it that makes him a braver man than i but not i think a wiser one valerius stared at him where was this leading cearan went on thoughtfully caratacus would have had us fight until the blood of the last briton stained the earth the truth i learned is that we must find a way to live with rome or everything that makes us who and what we are will cease to exist our children and our childrens children will be brought up either as romans or as slaves our kings will serve rome or we will have no kings you will even take our gods and make them your own then you already have your wish valerius pointed out the name of prasutagus king of the iceni is spoken of with honour in the palace of the governor he retains his authority in the name of the emperor and you retain your british ways you prosper as no other tribe has prospered save the atrebates and you worship whom you will and no roman interferes a momentary glint of triumph flashed in the pale eyes but prasutagus is an old man what happens if prasutagus is no longer king valerius considered the question it had two answers or perhaps three first prasutagus would have appointed his own heir and if that heir were acceptable to rome he would have the support of the emperor if the governor felt the chosen heir was too weak or worse too strong he might appoint his own king from the iceni aristocracy but that would only be done with the aristocracys agreement the third answer was so unlikely and unacceptable to cearan that he would not voice it eventually he said the words he knew the briton wanted to hear then the iceni will need a new king cearan nodded emphatically a king who would maintain our present relationship with rome but there are some among my tribesfolk who believe the path prasutagus treads is the wrong path and would welcome a new caratacus to follow who may even wish to be the new caratacus they are encouraged in this foolishness by men who come to their farmsteads at nightfall and leave again before dawn men who preach a message of hatred against your people valerius stared at him remembering the meeting with castus in londinium was this what had stirred up the midland tribes who are these men druids valerius froze the governor gaius suetonius paulinus understands that the druids are penned on their sacred isle or in the mountains of the west the iceni are a client tribe of rome and if they welcome a druid at their fires then they place that status at peril if king prasutagus is aware of these visits he should hold the druid and send word to colonia prasutagus is a good king and a good man but his sword arm has weakened with age along with his mind his strength now lies not on the throne but beside the throne where sits his wife boudicca valerius remembered the name from the dinner at luculluss villa the painting of the surrender queen boudicca is not unsympathetic to the old religion even if prasutagus were to seek out the druids it is unlikely he would find them the roman shook his head this was the stuff of paulinuss nightmares celtic priests stirring the embers of rebellion in a subject tribe a weak king with his queen at his side whispering treason in his ear if as castus seemed to hint the cornovii and the catuvellauni were rearming all it would take was one spark to set the entire country ablaze there is a way cearan said and his eyes turned hard when prasutagus dies ensure the right king succeeds him now valerius saw it he almost laughed did this handsome barbarian truly believe a lowly tribune could help him secure the crown of the iceni but cearan had read his thoughts swords and gold the two things that together equal power with gold i can buy swords and the arms to wield them i will bring you your druid and you will persuade the governor that cearan would rule the iceni not only as a client of rome but as a true ally of rome he brought his face close to valerius you must believe me i want no more iceni sons gasping out their lives on some river bank for an impossible dream valerius took a step back as if distance would diminish the scale of his dilemma was the briton merely another powerhungry barbarian lord he would not be the first to try to bring down his chieftain with a subtle denunciation but something told him cearan was more than that from the first he had sensed a deep honesty in the iceni that set him apart he carried his honour like a banner and valerius had no doubt that he would die to defend it but what could he do you ask the impossible i have no access to the governor and even if i did he would dismiss this as a conspiracy against prasutagus who has served rome well you talk of plots but where is your evidence a few cowherds tales of strangers in the night paulinus would have me whipped from his office he expected cearan to protest but the iceni only nodded impassively you are right of course i have been too concerned for my peoples welfare and do not fully understand your roman ways there is time i believe prasutagus will see out the winter but even if he does not there will be no decision on his successor until after beltane this evidence you seek what would it be bring me the druid then i will find you your gold and your swords xviii afterwards he wasnt sure whether cearan had engineered it the briton seemed content with the conclusion of their discussion and settled down to supervise the butchering of the two boars but after a few moments he looked up at the sky which was still a pale watery grey my stomach tells me the eighth hour is close even if the sun does not he said they will bring the feast to the forest edge we are almost finished here why dont you walk ahead and make sure the wolves dont get to it first where food is concerned lunaris is more dangerous than any wolf go then and keep him at bay cearan urged cheerfully or i must eat one of these pigs raw valerius left the clearing and set off through the wood towards the rendezvous point he wasnt entirely sure of his direction and his head still spun with the effects of the ale and clamoured with images of slashing tusks and a gaping toothfilled maw snapping within inches of his face he tried to concentrate on what cearan had said the subtle nuances in his voice the messages in his eyes that had accompanied them these were not romans he was dealing with for all luculluss roman airs less than twenty years ago they had been sworn enemies of everything he believed in how could he trust them after only a few months acquaintance maeve stepped from the shadow of an ancient oak straight into his path and when she saw him her hand went to her mouth and her dark eyes opened wide in alarm the young roman who had set her heart fluttering at the villa had been replaced by a dishevelled mudstained vagabond in a torn shirt who stared at her with startled eyes she noticed something else youre bleeding for the first time valerius heard something more than polite concern in her voice she dropped her clothwrapped bundle and rushed towards him he let her come he would explain that it was the boars blood later she stopped two paces away wanting to take the next step but not quite knowing how to and they stared at each other for a few interminable seconds the long brown cloak she wore over the blue dress hid the curves of her body but couldnt disguise the way her breasts rose and fell sharply with each breath she had bound her soft chestnut hair in a long plaited tail that draped over her left shoulder valerius saw the confusion in her eyes and knew it must be mirrored in his own but he feared any decision he made would break the spell an image of the temple of claudius filled his head and he recalled the priests message the thought made him giddy and he swayed slightly a movement that made her instinctively step forward to support him then they were in each others arms for a moment each was surprised by the others strength he held her close so the softness of her body melted against the hardness of his and her head rested lightly on his shoulder at first that was enough but then warmth was transformed into heat and he felt her stiffen she raised her head and looked up at him in surprise so he could see the mysterious golden shadows deep in her eyes her lips were so close it would have taken only the slightest movement to meet them maeve felt the moment too but this unfamiliar heat deep within had disturbed her it conjured up feelings she hadnt realized could exist and halfflashes of something which couldnt be memory but which was remembered all the same her throat went dry and her heart pounded like the beat of a samhain drum another second and she would be consumed she stepped back youre bleeding she repeated but now her voice was a husky croak its boars blood valerius said cheerfully not your face she frowned your shoulder valerius glanced down and noticed for the first time the ragged tear in his tunic and a patch where the wool was considerably darker its a scratch he claimed gingerly touching the area how do you know if you havent looked at it her voice had recovered its authority now and overflowed with the resigned exasperation women use for men they think are idiots take your shirt off valerius hesitated this wasnt going the way he had imagined it would i am a celt valerius ive seen men with their shirts off before you havent seen me with my shirt off he protested it would not be seemly she gave an earthy laugh that drove all thoughts of staid roman maidens from his head what you seemed to have in mind for me a few minutes ago would not have been seemly either valerius felt a rush of heat in his face he was a twentytwoyearold roman officer and he was blushing or are romans different from celtic men if so i think i should find out especially if we are to see each other again she kept her face solemn but her eyes sparkled with gentle humour he caught her mood and grinned pulling the woollen tunic over his head and placing it on the ground beside him the breath caught in her throat yes she had seen men before in their many shapes and sizes but this was different the young romans torso was tanned a deep shade of honey and constant practice with sword and shield had given him heavily muscled shoulders and upper arms how could hands so powerful have felt so gentle when they held her earlier his deep sculpted chest narrowed towards the waist where a thin line of dark hair ran down a flat stomach to disappear somewhere she tried not to think about she noticed a fresh scar across his ribs and had to stop herself reaching out to touch it closer inspection showed other smaller scars indents and barely noticeable pale lines that spoke of narrow escapes from danger disturbingly the heat she had experienced earlier returned accompanied by a liquid feeling low in her body are you going to help me or sell me in colonias market valerius asked lightly conscious of but not unhappy with her inspection he knew the figure he cut and took pride in it but not to the point of arrogance all the muscle in the world wouldnt stop a wellflighted arrow or the edge of a blade she tossed her head swinging the plaited tail from left to right and reminding him of a colt he had once seen frolicking in a field you were right she said dismissively it is just a scratch but you were a fool to allow yourself to get so close to a boar two boars he announced just to see her reaction he wasnt disappointed two big ones enormous how big she demanded and the wound was forgotten as he described the hunt and how the second boar had come so close to avenging his sibling she made little mmms of concern at just the right places and her face came closer and closer to his as he talked eventually she was so close that it became impossible to do anything but kiss her when their lips met there was no resistance just a soft and entirely natural moulding as he tasted her sweetness and the clean tang of freshly torn mint that made him wonder if she had prepared for just this moment at first her lips stayed closed but as the seconds passed and the thunder in his head grew louder she opened her mouth to draw him deeper and he felt as if he were being swept away in a swollen river torrent it seemed right that his hands should move to her waist below the cloak and from there upwards stop she took a step away we cant it is not right how can it not be right he heard the frustration in his voice and knew that in another six words he would destroy everything he had won so far but the thunder was still pounding inside his head and his tongue seemed to belong to someone else we she gently placed the first finger of her right hand on his lips and with her left hand took his come she said and drew him beneath the boughs of the oak tree where the sod rose thick over the roots and the grass remained dry despite the rain she pushed him down and recovered the cloth pack among other items it contained a stoppered flask the contents of which she used sparingly to clean the wound on his shoulder dabbing gently with a corner of the cloth to clear away the dried blood a waste of good wine he protested reaching for the flask she held it away from him a man a woman and wine are not a good combination she said clearly speaking from a well of experience later later when we have found my father or cearan when it is more seemly he grinned and lay against the oak feeling the rough bark against the skin of his back her hands worked delicately around the wound and he found himself more at ease than at any time since he had landed on britains shores it was as if they had always been together or they belonged together your father is a fine man he said it purely for the pleasure of hearing her voice but her reply surprised him my father has forgotten who he truly is he embraces every new roman fashion and dismisses the old ways we sacrifice to roman gods and sleep under a roman roof on roman beds the wine he drinks is shipped from gaul but it is roman wine the look in his eyes when he talks of his ambitions frightens me he will never be satisfied you talk as if you hate rome but you are here with a roman she stared at him and he became lost in the depths of her eyes i am here with valerius a young man whose company i enjoy and whose origins i try to forget it seems to me that romans think strength is everything she reached out absently to stroke the muscle of his right arm it was a gesture of pure unthinking affection which instantly took the sting from her words when i was young i had a friend the son of one of my fathers tenants we grew up together played in these woods and swam in the river i shared my first kiss with dywel valerius instantly resented dywel and the time he had spent with maeve that he could never share he herded his fathers cattle took them out to pasture in the spring and kept them fed during the winter then the romans came my father had stayed at home when the young men rode off to join caratacus in the west so his estate was largely spared but eight years ago they divided up the land all around us they said the pasture was no longer my fathers to graze his beasts upon and that he could not water them at the dew pond my father had other pasture and other water but dywels farm was on the far edge of the estate and his father was poor he defied the romans what happened to him valerius asked already knowing the answer he remembered falcos words things were done when colonia was founded that do none of us credit they cut dywels throat with a knife i am sorry your father should have taken his case before the magistrate maeve gave a bitter laugh that is a very roman thing to say dywel was a celt roman justice is for the romans he could have protested that she was wrong that roman justice was the best in the world the product of a thousand years of lawyerly debate discussion and study but he didnt because he realized she was right a shout rang out from the woods to their left and maeves head whipped round like a frightened deer here she said urgently thrusting his shirt into his hands as he stood up to shrug it over his shoulders she poured most of the wine away and took a loaf from the bag she had been carrying and tore it in half throwing one of the halves into the bushes she did the same with a large piece of meat bite it she ordered pushing the portion shed retained into his mouth he did as he was told trying to speak as he chewed gghwy because i stumbled upon you when you were lost you were hungry and weak from loss of blood and we stayed until you were fed and felt strong enough to move quickly she gathered up the cloth bag and thrust the remains of the food inside when that was done she studied him critically brushed some leaves and grass from his back and turned to go maeve she turned back with a look of annoyance that faded when she saw the leather pouch he had retrieved from his belt he held it out to her and she hesitated for a moment before taking it but when she did she smiled and lifted her head to kiss him lightly on the lips he stood there grinning long after she disappeared into the trees xix while autumn lasted bela the darkhaired young thracian auxiliary commander kept his men on constant patrol in the forested areas to the north of colonia but although he reported occasional signs of disturbed ground and evidence of gatherings in woodland clearings he found no solid evidence of the subversion valerius suspected and castus feared he passed on the information without comment and drove his troopers all the harder when it arrived that year winter came quickly and it came hard frost turned the ground unyielding as stone and the cattle in the fields smoked as if they were on fire before the herd boys drove them into the huts where they and those who farmed them would provide mutual warmth during the following months the citys aqueduct quickly froze and valerius ordered a squad of legionaries to be on constant duty at the river below colonia breaking the ice as it formed to ensure a supply of water for the citizens nature was relentless and the centurions were forced constantly to rotate their shivering exhausted men the frost brought the firsts roadbuilding duties to an end and valerius and julius came up with endless fatigues and exercises to ensure their soldiers stayed fit and alert joint exercises with the militia became a regular feature and valeriuss respect for falco and his veterans grew with each passing week they even took part in route marches together though this was one area where the men of the first cohort understandably excelled both in speed and stamina i pray to mars and mithras that the governor doesnt ask us to join him in the spring falco said ruefully as his men stumbled past faces as red as a legates banner and breath steaming in the thin winter sunlight valerius smiled and wrapped his cloak closer around him he already has my report garrison duties only for the men of colonia but mention of suetonius paulinuss spring campaign made him uneasy was there anyone in britain unaware of what was about to happen not lucullus certainly that winter valerius developed a liking and a curious respect for the little trinovante when the frost was followed by snow unlike anything the young roman had ever experienced even the exercises ended and the legionaries huddled in their tents or around glowing braziers attempting to avoid the frostblight that first turned toes and fingers black and then caused them to fall off they prayed for the coming of spring or a posting to some paradise where the sun shone for more than four hours in a day preferably both with little of military value to keep him occupied he worked to repay the hospitality he had received during the previous months from colonias leading citizens it was surprising what a legionary cook could achieve given the time and ingredients and a string of dignitaries and their matrons complimented him on his table and the service provided by legionary servants prominent among whom was lunaris who would do anything to find some warmth falco and his fat little spouse came often as did corvinus accompanied by his very beautiful and very pregnant wife valerius even found time to entertain petronius though he was never able to like the quaestor who seemed obsessed by lineage and appeared to have a worryingly comprehensive knowledge of the various wellconnected branches of the valerian family colonias most influential briton was occasionally among the guests and what could be more natural than that he in turn should invite the tribune to his home on the slope across the river at first valerius had regarded lucullus as a figure of fun because of his terrier like pursuit of roman ways but as he came to know him better he discovered the ingratiating smile hid a shrewd intelligence and an unfailing generosity but maeve was right to be concerned about her fathers business dealings had the times been different he would have been rich successful and respected but the times were not and they and his ambition had despite his outward success combined to leave him floundering in a sea of debt a roman would have kept it his secret shame hidden in the papers in his tablinum but lucullus for all his airs was not a roman he was a garrulous unprincipled celt who laughed at his predicament and invited you to laugh with him valerius enjoyed his company very much lucullus normally visited colonia unaccompanied but when valerius rode out to the trinovantes villa maeve would invariably be waiting to greet her fathers guest in the portico the first time this happened her welcome was excessively formal and in that nervous way of a man in love he worried their relationship had already lost some of its lustre he was still fretting at the table when lucullus startled him by wondering how the governors advance troops would be faring in the mountains of the deceangli with the snow up to their necks and their toes turning black but everything else was driven from his mind when he became aware of maeves presence over her fathers shoulder the look she gave him sent a shudder of desire through his body and her right hand reached up to touch the golden boar amulet at her neck are you well lucullus asked his plump face filled with concern you have gone quite pale he picked up a plate and sniffed it that factor gereth its these damned oysters again it should have been impossible but they managed to make it only difficult snatched conversations in corridors and doorways clandestine touches as they brushed past each other on entering or leaving a room each encounter only served to inflame the thing growing between them though it created a frustration that grew in equal measure she persuaded him to brave the snow and her fathers estate wardens and contrived to meet him by chance on a forest ride at last they could talk unhindered and he found her quick of mind and quicker of temper she was like no roman woman he had ever met she had views on everything even military tactics which would have bored any other girl he knew and she was unafraid to speak her mind but always it came back to one subject her people she was also practical they repeated the encounter a week later a new fall of snow had thickened the glistening blanket enveloping the land to north and south transforming it into a world of wondrous sculpted humps and hollows large flakes still fell from a sky the colour of an old bruise turning the air around them into a whirling cascade of white petals valerius worried that they might become lost but maeve only giggled it will help cover our tracks she insisted come with me valerius reined back his big military horse to keep pace with the little skewbald pony she rode sidesaddle he found it difficult to keep his eyes off her and as they ventured further into the wood he found his natural caution replaced by a deeper more visceral anticipation and an outcome his mind shied away from here she said eventually laughing when she saw the look on his face he was staring at a wall of sheer grey rock help me down he dismounted and took her by the waist lifting her from the pony and delighting in the warmth of her body then tied the two animals to the nearest tree by the time hed finished she stood at the base of the wall where a large evergreen bush hung heavy with snow something in the way she stood gave him the first hint of what had become inevitable then he looked into her face and saw the message there and it felt as if a fire had been lit inside him the fathomless brown eyes were deadly serious but they contained an unmistakable challenge and her cheeks burned with colour that matched her lips which were sensual swollen and inviting when he walked towards her her eyes never left his and when he reached her she pulled the bush aside with a flourish that was only spoiled by the snow that fell from the branches on to her head welcome to my lair she said laughing it was a cave a narrow fissure cut into the rock formed the entrance which widened almost immediately into an area as large as a legionarys eightman tent it must once have been inhabited because niches and shelves had been cut into the rock walls where she had placed oil lamps that now turned their surroundings into a diamondstudded grotto tiny fragments set into the stone glittered in the lamplight like unquenchable sparks of blue green red and a dozen other colours he had no name for the atmosphere almost religious gave him a sense of wonder magnified a hundred times by the presence beside him smoke from the oil lamps disappeared into the darkness above and he had the impression of a great endless void but his eye was drawn to the back of the cave where two large fur rugs lay on the earth floor i wanted us to be warm she whispered do you like it yes her dark eyes stared back unflinchingly into his and she wiped a tear from her cheek and raised her lips towards his the kiss seemed to last an eternity with every passing second it grew in passion and intensity so that when they finally parted they were both breathless now maeves eyes filled with something that might have been fear but quickly faded to shocked surprise at the new emotions burning like wildfire deep within her body come she said and led him by the hand towards the furs thus far the day had been maeves to command now by unspoken consent it was valerius the more experienced who took control a shudder went through her as his fingers plucked at the tie of her cloak and when he had completed the task she lay back entirely still uncertain of what she should do or not do wanting what was to come but at the same time half fearful of it valerius sensed her hesitation very gently he reached down and pulled up the hem of her dress exposing the length of her ivorypale legs she immediately understood what was wanted of her and raised her bottom to allow him to take the rumpled wool underneath her body then sat upright and raised her arms so he could remove it altogether when she was naked he looked down on her with something close to wonder her breasts were full and rounded with tiny hard nipples of the most delicate pink between them hung the golden boar amulet and it somehow added to the eroticism of the moment she had a narrow waist which flowed into hips that were seductively wide but tapered again into long slim legs he reached out to touch her and then recoiled as if he had been burned her smooth skin resonated with life and heat impatient maeve took his hand and placed it on her breast then drew it down her body with agonizing slowness that made her draw in her breath sharply please valerius she tore at his tunic and when it was gone grasped him to her desperate for him now but valerius would not be hurried he fought her grip knowing how much better it would be for her if she would allow him to be patient much later when he gave her that which she had coveted but feared her cry of joy split the air there were other times but when he thought of the cave it was always the first he remembered afterwards they held each other drowsily in the silky warmth of the furs well satisfied with what had gone before but full of anticipation for what was still to come my father would kill you if he knew she whispered sleepily valerius opened one eye and looked into hers she wrinkled her nose in a way that made him smile well my father would try to kill you if he knew and you would have to let him i could never love a man who killed my father she talked of her world and the way it had changed camulodunum had been the capital of the trinovantes and the family of lucullus ranked high in the royal line but that was before cunobelin father of caratacus and king of the catuvellauni had usurped trinovante power and installed himself as their king luculluss father had been spared and exiled to the estate on the hill while cunobelin took over his palace when the romans came my father thought to win back his familys inheritance she said sadly but nothing has changed he asked her how women like boudicca and cartimandua could hold sway even over great warriors and she shook her head at his naivety because they are women she said and because even if cartimandua is a traitor they are wise and brave and have the aid of andraste andraste i do not know that name the goddess she explained as if to an infant the dark one who holds power over all men and women and breathes fire in her anger and turns the air to sulphur he told her about rome and he loved how her eyes opened in amazement at his descriptions of the palaces and the basilicas the great temples and forests of pillars topped with statues of gold and the way the whole city looked as if it was on fire when the sun shone in a certain way i would like to visit rome one day she said quietly and he answered you will she asked him what it was that made the roman legions so powerful and he explained about the siege weapons hed seen used against the celtic hill forts catapults and ballistas siege towers and even something as simple as ladders which the tribes had never thought to use for war she listened intently frowning when some fact eluded her and he loved her all the more for the obvious effort she was making to understand him occasionally maeve would be away visiting some needy tenant or pregnant estate workers wife when lucullus invited valerius to visit the villa on the hill ostensibly to discuss business matters or the politics of the province but these days would inevitably degenerate into marathon drinking bouts which the old man viewed as a challenge to the depth of his wine cellar and the breadth of falcos stock during one winesoaked afternoon lucullus allowed the clowns mask to slip the principia extended refurbished and unrecognizable now as the old legionary headquarters had just been dedicated to the god claudius with a lavish ceremony which the little trinovante had funded but it was its function as they sat well rested and on their second flask of one of his best calenian vintages that drew the sharpest barbs of luculluss blearyeyed bitterness for the principia stood at the centre of a vast bureaucratic network of officialdom that regulated every facet of british life which weighed measured and valued everything that was grown made or reared under its allseeing eye you romans you romans this from a man who worked every day and used every deception to try to become one you romans think you can rule everything in the world tree and field bird and beast man and woman everywhere there must be order everything must have its place and its price everything must be on a list it is not our way not the way of my people he shook his head to emphasize his point before you came we did not have things like this he waved an arm distractedly round the room but we did not need them we lived in huts with mud floors drank beer from clay pots and ate rough porridge from wooden platters but still we had more than we have now we had our honour he paused as if expecting an answer you are surprised that i a celt talk of honour yes valerius i know that even you whom i think of as my friend consider me a mere celt what was i saying honour yes honour you would be amazed at how much talk there is of honour in places not so far from here we have lost much but some people he said the words with that particular inflection that meant they were a significant some people some people believe it is not too late to restore it by now valerius was wishing the trinovante would stop lecturing him and call one of his slaves to bring more of the excellent wine from his cellar but lucullus in full flow would not be halted by anything less than a bolt of lightning your roads and your fortresses are like a boot across our neck and your temple is sucking us dry did you know that the cost even of being a member of the temple of claudius is ten times more for a celt than for a roman citizen ten times if i told you how much i borrowed to secure the priesthood your head would fall from your shoulders it is we celts who must pay back the loans taken out to build it we who pay for the sacrifices and the upkeep and for that great golden whore of victory they have placed upon its pediment while we sit here in this the arm was flung out carelessly once more there are men valerius great men proud warriors who live in the ruins of their burnedout huts and watch their children starve because they once had the temerity to stand up for what was theirs and there are other men who were once farmers and wanted only to keep what they had who now have nothing because you an accusing finger pointed disconcertingly straight into valeriuss face stole everything they had their land their cattle their women everything valerius shook his head no not me did he say it or only think it it did not matter lucullus ignored him in any case it could have been different did you really think you could grind into the dust with a single blow a people who have survived for a thousand years did you believe that men whose courage and prowess with sword and spear was their whole life would simply disappear after one defeat you could have used their skills you could have taken them into your service they would have fought even for you better even that you had killed them all or sold them into slavery but no you did not do any of that instead you did the worst thing possible you ignored them you left them to sit in their huts to see the bones in their little ones faces become more obvious every day and the breasts of their wives grow empty and dry and to hate they are out there now he said and the message in his voice was matched by that in his eyes he had seen them these romanhaters and they frightened him xx saturnalia passed and the snow vanished before the celts celebrated the rebirth of life in secret ceremonies at their festival of imbolc valerius hadnt forgotten the concerns of castus the londinium camp prefect by now he was a regular if reluctant attendant at meetings of colonias ordo and recalling luculluss words and cearans warning of the previous autumn he wondered aloud if it was worth checking on who attended the celebrations it does not matter who attends they will all be drunk quaestor petronius said dismissively and when they are drunk they play their childish fire games you are young tribune and must leave such concerns to those who understand them best the exchange was quickly forgotten valerius had other things on his mind soon probably in a matter of weeks his orders would come through to return the first cohort to glevum when he had completed his duties at the legionary headquarters it was certain the legate would send him directly to londinium and a ship to rome the thought sent an unfamiliar shiver of panic through him maeves face continued to haunt him and the need to be with her tantalized his nights he realized that whatever happened he couldnt leave her behind a few weeks after imbolc he set out north on the venta road to inspect the work his legionaries had carried out and check for any damage that might have been done by the winter frosts or by the floods that followed the great thaw he took a patrol of twenty led by lunaris and they rode from colonias north gate at dawn on a day when the wind tore in from the coast with the sting of a cracked whip and puffy white clouds scudded like invasion fleets beneath a canopy of leaden grey lunaris marginally more comfortable now on a horse docile enough even for him to control hunched down in his saddle and wrapped his cloak tightly about him roundly cursing the british weather i froze all winter and now the damps eating into my bones rotting my straps and rusting my armour why did we ever come here the people hate us even the veterans in colonia resent us being here eating their rations drinking their wine chasing their women and requisitioning everything we want knowing that the procurator will take six months to pay valerius smiled at an old soldiers grumbles if theyd been in cappadocia or syria lunaris would have been complaining that it was too hot the wine was sour and the women wouldnt leave him alone were here because were soldiers and we go where they want us to go this is where the emperor wants us to be enjoy it while it lasts youll be warm enough come summer when the black celts are chasing you round their mountains how far to the next bridge lunaris checked his map about six miles thats not what i hear what isnt that the emperor wants us in britain the word is that were pulling out soon valerius turned to stare at him where does that come from you know how it goes the procurators clerk tells the quartermaster that maybe we dont need to stockpile so much equipment the quartermaster tells the armourer to use up the iron hes got the armourer tells the smith we wont be needing so many pilum points and then its all round the province suddenly were moving out probably rubbish valerius nodded but he remembered the letter which was still in his chest in the townhouse why did you bring me the duplicarius asked shifting uncomfortably in his saddle because you have a nose for trouble and an eye for everything else the last big repair is just short of venta and i thought we would call on our old friend lord cearan you think therell be trouble lunariss hand instinctively sought his sword hilt valerius shook his head i doubt it but i have a feeling there are things going on we should know about in any case petronius as good as told me to mind my own business which is a good reason not to it was four days before they reached venta icenorum valerius took time to ensure every repair had been properly carried out and to arrange for any winter damage to be reported he also inspected the auxiliary unit manning the signal station which flanked the road between colonia and the iceni border the wooden tower with its pitchsoaked beacon stood twenty feet above the flat waterlogged countryside within a circular rampart topped by a palisade and surrounded by a sixfoot ditch its garrison consisted of eight surly unshaven tungrians who were as alert as he might have expected after three months watching the same piece of road in the dead of winter their commander a decurion with a hangdog expression made it clear he thought theyd been abandoned and begged him to send food and proper winter clothing though its too late for poor old chrutius there he pointed to a man with bandaged feet and a pair of makeshift crutches stood guard all night in a blizzard an lost six toes to the blight valerius asked if the man had noticed anything unusual in recent weeks the decurion smiled bitterly only you valerius reined in when he saw the smoke from ventas cooking fires dusting the northern horizon and lunaris drew up beside him why are we so interested in these people the duplicarius asked fifty miles from rest and rations and one lot of tame celts looks just like another to me valerius shrugged were here anyway its only right that we should pay our respects to cearan in any case i suspect he knows were coming he pointed to a small group of horsemen by a clump of trees about a mile away i wouldnt call the iceni tame but they are fortunate they fought with caratacus against claudius and might have ended up like the trinovantes and the catuvellauni with their young men slaves and their lands confiscated but thats where the luck came in their king antedios died in the fighting and by the time of the surrender hed been replaced by prasutagus who very quickly condemned antedios as a rebel and asked for romes mercy clever we didnt have enough troops to garrison this far north and fight in the west so claudius who was also clever agreed to make them clients of rome ten years ago they rebelled again or at least some of them did when scapula tried to disarm the tribes permanently but old prasutagus blamed it on a minority among the western iceni and the legions had enough on their hands with the dobunni and the durotriges so they were left alone again the lucky tribe then valerius smiled or their god favours them as valerius kicked his horse into motion lunaris frowned and touched the silver phallic amulet at his neck which god would that be andraste the road to venta icenorum ran along the west side of a winding stream edged by drooping willows and tall poplars the town itself lay forty paces beyond the far bank a strange mix of the old and the new the usual celtic community consisted of scattered roundhouses surrounded by fields and linked by walkways and drove roads at first sight venta could have been a provincial roman town it lay part hidden behind a wooden palisade and its streets appeared to be laid out on the familiar grid pattern with a gap in the roofscape which suggested a central forum only on closer inspection did valerius realize that the houses with their pitched roofs were constructed of wattle and daub and that where there should have been tiles there was thatch lunaris looked uncertainly at the river which was in spate and foamed a sickly reddish brown just below the trees but valerius pointed to a wooden bridge a little way upstream where cearan waited it is an honour to welcome you to my home the iceni sat comfortably on the back of a horse considerably larger than the british ponies with which valerius was familiar he managed the not inconsiderable feat of bowing gracefully from the waist and hanging on to a curlyhaired child of about three who wriggled in the crook of his right arm my grandson tor he explained lowering the boy to the ground where he scuttled off to chase a foraging chicken among the bushes by the gateway it is also unexpected the smile didnt falter but there was a definite question in cearans pale blue eyes we have been inspecting the road to the south valerius explained you invited me to see your horses but if it is not convenient cearans smile grew wider at the mention of his horses and he slapped his mount on the shoulder he sat on the animal as if he were part of it his long legs hugging its ribs and his hands light on the reins valerius had never met a king but if any man looked and acted like a king it was cearan his golden hair was tied at the neck with a band that matched the deep red of his softspun shirt and his long blond moustaches hung below his chin of course ride with me perhaps your troopers would like to water their horses he suggested diplomatically when they were out of earshot his face grew serious and he explained you must forgive me valerius my friend but you could not have come at a worse time king prasutagus survived the winter but it has taken its toll on his health he is close to death only the timing is in doubt and the stink of his dying draws the carrion birds they are all here beluko who has lands in the west mab whose territory you have just crossed and volisios who holds the border with the corieltauvi each thinks he has a better case than the others to succeed prasutagus and all have good reason to hate the romans and cearan gold and swords i fear it is too late unless you carry them with you and i doubt twenty riders would be enough in any case i never brought you your druid and my honour would not allow it the briton smiled sadly they passed under the north wall of venta and valerius looked up to see fifteen or twenty faces watching from the ramparts see cearan said loudly here is my herd now if your thracian would only part with that stallion of his for two days they were fine horses the finest valerius had seen on the island and each a replica of the mare cearan rode the herd grazed in a mass at the centre of a broad meadow which sloped down to where the river swept in a wide curve eastwards towards the sea if not cearan then who will lead the iceni boudicca the briton said emphatically boudicca but you said i was wrong cearan admitted i have spoken to her she understands her position and she sees the new reality as i do do not doubt me she despises everything rome stands for but she realizes that to serve her people best she must retain what they have better for emperor nero to take half the kingdoms revenues than to have a roman legion camped beneath our walls and colonias quaestor dabbling in our politics valerius turned towards the watchers on the wall somehow he knew the queen would be there as tall as any of the men around her she stood in the centre clad in a gown of emerald green her flamered hair dancing in the breeze he couldnt see her face which was silhouetted against the low sun but he had an impression of great strength and though her eyes werent visible he knew they would be as fierce as any eagles cearans voice was taut when the time comes you must tell the governor to favour her petition her daughters will be prasutaguss joint heirs but they are young and she will rule in their stead she will make a better queen than prasutagus is a king the governor will not regret it valerius nodded he would try and you cearan opened his mouth to reply but at that moment a shout came from behind them and valerius looked round to see two young girls watching shyly from the corner of the town wall cearan called them across and introduced them rosmerta he indicated the taller of the two a pretty redhaired child with a freckled face and an easy smile and this is banna the second girl must have been a year younger probably around twelve but valerius could already see the signs that would mark her as a true beauty she had a mane of blond hair and delicate features matched with startling green eyes both girls were dressed in light linen shifts and walked barefoot banna spoke to cearan in her own language with a look that made valerius wonder if she was about to stamp her feet i apologize the iceni bowed to his assailant she reminds me that she is princess banna and she wishes to be given a closer look at your horse which she says makes mine look like a pack mule valerius smiled in that case i would be obliged if they would walk her to cool her down after her long ride and perhaps they would provide her with some oats he said courteously banna took the reins even before cearan had completed his translation and the girls led the big cavalry horse away chattering together animatedly her daughters valerius asked cearan nodded they are very young that is why they need your protection he glanced towards the walls and valerius realized at least one of the men he had named was there your coming has placed me in great danger but i still have the kings favour and the queens support you need not fear for cearan of the iceni my friend valerius reached out his hand and cearan gripped his wrist in the roman fashion my oath on it the two men made a show of studying the individual horses of cearans herd before valerius retrieved his mount from the reluctant sisters offering them his thanks as they rode back they found lunaris and the other troopers watering their horses in a sheltered backwater of the swollen river under the hostile stares of a small group of unarmed iceni warriors a little way upstream cearans grandson now a muddy faced urchin only recognizable by his shock of golden hair teased a family of ducks with a stick by the edge of the river any trouble valerius asked eyeing the warriors by the gate lunaris grinned nobody ever died from a dirty look but ive had warmer welcomes we ride for colonia when the horses are rested the big man nodded but his face registered his disappointment valerius knew his troops had anticipated a hot meal even a feast and beer and a warm bed after four nights sleeping under their cloaks cearan disappeared inside the gate and returned with a bulging sack which he handed to the duplicarius perhaps this will make your journey seem a little shorter lunaris looked inside and smiled his thanks cearan turned to valerius farewe he was interrupted by a loud squeal of frustration from upriver and the two men turned to see cearans grandson tottering on the bank of the river as he leaned precariously to reach the ducks nest a moment later a sharp cry rang out the little boy disappeared in a fountain of dirty river water and the only evidence he had existed was a thatch of blond curls just visible in the torrent as it was carried towards them with incredible speed tor cearans anguished cry spurred valerius into action and he urged his horse towards the river the instant he reached the bank he leapt from the saddle into the water thanking the gods it was only knee deep at this point keeping hold of the reins for support and anchorage he hauled his protesting mount into the rushing flow immediately feeling the current plucking at his legs and threatening to pull his feet from under him the river was narrower here but also swifter and he knew if he went under in his armour he was unlikely to surface again he glanced upstream the boy was nowhere in sight all he could see was a gushing foamflecked brown torrent then he spotted it less than fifteen paces away and coming at him as fast as a galloping horse a dull hint of gold just beneath the surface with a thrill of panic he realized it would pass beyond his grasping hand and he hauled desperately at the reins to give himself extra reach he sent a silent prayer to mars and even as he gave up hope he plunged forward with an enormous splash reaching with his right arm and came up with a handful of blond curls followed by a squirming bundle that resembled a halfdrowned hare cearan flung himself from his horse and ran to the river just as valerius emerged dripping wet with the little boy clutched to his chest his eyes screwed tight shut and choking up river water in fountains the briton tenderly took his grandson from the romans arms and nodded his thanks now i am truly in your debt xxi gwlym knew he was being followed he had seen out the winter in a catuvellauni roundhouse close to the place the romans called durobrivae alternately starving and freezing and looked upon with increasing resentment by his hosts boredom had corroded his brain and he fought it by whispering to himself the epic history of his people from the time of giants and the great flood generation after generation of fighting and suffering and always moving westwards the endless namelists of kings and mighty champions tales of natural disaster and betrayal by peoples who were inferior but more numerous it was this prodigious memory which had been recognized by the druids when he was chosen at the age of nine to study among them and be trained in the rites he remembered the long days of repetition and testing as he prepared for the trials of taranis esus and teutates now he called on the same power that had carried him through that horror sometimes he felt so tired he suspected his body was dying from lack of will only his mission and the inner fire kindled on mona kept him alive for the past week hed noticed the forest gradually thinning as he travelled further east and he knew he must maintain his vigilance or hed end up in the hands of one of the roman cavalry patrols which seemed more numerous here strange romans darkeyed and heavybrowed seemingly part man and part horse for they never left the saddle that thought had brought him another vision a man with a horses face long and narrow with prominent nostrils and protruding teeth a memorable face and yet it was only now he remembered he had seen it twice at different gatherings separated by several weeks and many miles the thought sent a shiver through him he knew he wouldnt last a week without the silence of those who took him into their homes he entered an area of scrubby trees low and thintrunked but with broad canopies the trees told him he was close to a river or a stream and with the sun close to its high point he decided to stop to eat his meagre rations rest and above all think he realized belatedly that hed been careless over the past few days travelling in a direct line towards his next destination it was a sign of his tiredness but also of something more hed always known he was likely to die before he had completed his task now it seemed his mind had accepted it as inevitable and was reaching out to it he must become hard again rediscover the iron which had been tempered in the flames of monas fiery chamber careful not to disturb the vegetation he moved fifty paces away from the path and deeper into the trees and bushes he waited for an hour sitting in the shadow of a hawthorn bush with nothing in his ears but the buzz of flying insects and the crunch of his teeth on the gritty corn cakes hed been given at the last farm perhaps he was wrong but no he knew with certainty he was being trailed who were they roman spies it was possible every celt knew the eyes and ears of rome extended far and wide over this land it was why he had been so careful at first and why he now cursed himself for his stupidity more likely they were britons in the pay of a local petty chieftain anxious to gain approval with the romans handing over a druid would offset a year of taxes and more one thing was in his favour they hadnt yet reported his presence or the area would be swarming with patrols the sharp crack of a broken twig froze his blood the sound came from behind him with infinite care he turned his head and recognized horseface the man from the meetings less than a spears length distant thankfully scanning the trees to his left away from gwlyms hide unthinkingly gwlym slipped the long curved knife from his belt rose and with three quick strides wrapped his hand across his hunters mouth and plunged the blade deep into his back he had never killed before and it proved more difficult than he would have believed horseface was tall and strong and the sting of the knife point gave his strength a greater urgency he struggled and shook in gwlyms grasp emitting animal grunting sounds beneath the clasped hand at last gwlym found the gap between the ribs and forced the knife blade through it the movement accompanied by a warm flood of liquid over his hand horseface shuddered but still he twisted and squealed like a piglet being hunted for a feast somehow the dying man found the strength to turn wrenching the hilt from gwlyms grasp and breaking the grip over his mouth he let out a roar of agony as he clawed at the blade buried deep in his back at first gwlym froze but a shout of alarm from away to the right broke the spell he bolted into the trees in the opposite direction from the cry too late he could hear the sound of pursuit and when he risked a glance across his shoulder he saw that his hunter was less than thirty feet behind and carried a long sword gwlym knew his exertions of the past months had left him too weak to outrun the man but what alternative did he have he crashed blindly through the trees ignoring the snagging branches and the leaves that whipped his face his left foot hit thin air he was falling a shock like death itself knocked the breath from his lungs as he struck the freezing water of the river and went under desperate for air he fought his way to the surface only to find the spy towering over him with the sword raised to strike a grin spread across the mans face as gwlym attempted to burrow into the bank he was still grinning when his belly erupted in a fountain of blood and guts and he was catapulted over the druids head into the river with a spear shaft transfixing his body sheltered by the high bank gwlym allowed the current to carry him downstream into the shadow of an overhanging tree he gripped a low branch for just long enough to witness the roman auxiliary cavalryman retrieve his spear from the corpse and gleefully remove its head then his numbed fingers slipped and he found he didnt have the will or the strength to fight the river xxii for the first time she could remember maeve was frightened since her mother died when she was six years old her father had been the cornerstone of her life dealing with every girlish tantrum and adolescent obsession with the same good humour with which he laughed off the peaks and troughs of his everchanging fortunes even the arrival of her first red moon had been greeted only with a sharp tut and a call for catia her personal slave to explain the intricacies and burdens of a womans existence it was for her sake she knew that he had stayed on his farm and kept his fathers sword in its place on the wall when the young men followed caratacus to their deaths as she grew older she had seen the pain the decision had cost him and the damage to his honour that was so clear in the contemptuous glances of camulodunums women but he had been prepared to bear it for her when claudius declared camulodunum a roman colony and renamed it colonia lucullus had fought desperately to keep what was his he hadnt always succeeded he had mourned dywel as keenly as she had and some of the alliances he made had cost him more than he would ever admit but he had protected her when he took the roman name lucullus she had been ashamed but she never allowed it to show he was her father and she loved him yet now she barely recognized this shell of a man with empty staring eyes a fat man grown suddenly thin i am ruined the words were said in a whisper they will take everything and when they have it all i will still owe them more than i can ever repay i am ruined it had started when petronius the quaestor had arrived at the villa just before noon at first lucullus had been genuinely pleased to see his business partner believing this was at last the delivery of the outstanding rent money for the insulae in colonia but it took only a few moments for petronius to reveal the true reason for his visit i have had word from londinium the lawyer said solemnly handing over a wrapped scroll with a broken seal a few minutes later the quaestor left and her father retired to the room he called the tablinum from which he ordered his business she found him there four hours later amidst the innocent bills and records that concealed the labyrinth of his finances and she finally learned the bottomless pit of his debt that now threatened to swallow the celtic trader alive they sat together in the little room until the sun drifted below the horizon and they were left in darkness by then maeve had long given up her attempts at reassurance and the only words that passed between them from one hour to the next was the little mans shocked whisper i am ruined every attempt to move him was a wasted effort he had become a human shipwreck with the jagged rocks of failure buried deep in his belly and every wave dragging him closer to destruction her inability to help him left her feeling a sort of growing paralysis she had to do something anything lucullus had insisted she learn to read latin as well as speak it so she could assist him with his business affairs and eventually she left the tablinum to study the letter it was dated a week earlier and as she read it line by line she was overwhelmed by first fear then fury and finally dread the contents were almost beyond belief the letter contained a warning from the new procurator in londinium catus decianus to his friend petronius of fundamental changes in the way the province was to be governed and financed she had heard the name seneca hailed by lucullus as the great benefactor who had set him on the way to prosperity now this same seneca had decided to call in every loan he had made in the province with immediate effect catus decianus was commanded to maximize the return on all his investments convert them to currency and send them to rome and that wasnt all state subsidies loans and investments were also being withdrawn it took time for her to understand the true enormity of what she was reading now everything would belong to the imperial treasury and the native rulers of southern britain would be reduced to penury and their people with them robbed even of the chance to pay off the loans with the fruits of the earth they tended and farmed if that was not enough her outrage grew as she realized exactly why petronius had shown the letter to her father the quaestor had never hidden his greed from his trinovante business partner indeed that was what had made him an ideal foil for lucullus now he saw the opportunity to lay hands on the insulae in colonia and she gasped at his audacity the whole estate this house the farms and the hunting grounds at a bargain price from his friend decianus worse when she read the letter again she realized it contained another more sinister message it was an invitation to lucullus to commit suicide was that not the roman way to avoid disgrace by taking ones own life and how much more convenient for petroniuss transaction if the former owner was dead she felt like riding into colonia and confronting that thieving conniving no she could imagine the cold stare if a woman and a british woman at that dared to challenge the quaestor he might even have her whipped only one person could help her she called for one of the slaves go swiftly to colonia and seek out tribune verrens ask him to call on the trader lucullus as soon as it is convenient hurry now she fell asleep thinking of the young roman and when she opened her eyes she was lying on a couch in the room with the paintings of claudius the light streamed in through the gaps in the shutters creating intricate dappled patterns on the walls and floor the familiar setting reassured her and for the first time she felt hope valerius would protect them her father would normally have left for colonia by this time but when she checked his bed he was still in it the coverlet clenched to his chin and his eyes tight shut she guessed he wasnt asleep but decided to leave him in any case there would be time later to face the harsh new realities of their life she washed and dressed taking care with her appearance the blue dress today because it was the one valerius liked would he still love her now that she was poor with a sudden clarity she realized it didnt matter she saw that their relationship which had first smouldered then blazed into a white heat of an intensity she had never known was a fleeting thing and like the snows of winter must pass in its own time he never talked of it but she knew he would shortly be returning to his legion knew even thanks to her father that he was due soon to be recalled to rome in the first glow of their love she had dreamed of travelling there with him and becoming the mistress of a roman household but as the months passed she understood that it could never be her experience of the world was limited to colonia and the estate looking out over the river but she had seen the way petronius and the others of the citys equestrian class looked at her father the sneering glances and contemptuous smiles lucullus accepted their disdain because he had no other option hid his resentment and his anger behind the mask of his smile how much worse would it be in rome valeriuss family might tolerate her as his wife but they would never truly accept her and rome for all the wonders he described was an alien place this was her land these were her people two hours later she heard the sound of horses on the track from colonia and she rushed out to greet valerius her spirits lifted at the sight of the unmistakable figure of a mounted roman soldier outlined against the low sun this is the house of lucullus augustalis of the temple of claudius the voice was detached but the speaker managed to invest the simple question with a measure of threat that sent a shudder through maeve not valerius but who and why only now did she notice the other riders who accompanied the soldier along with four opentopped ox carts trundling along behind answer me i dont have time to sit here all day she stared up at the rider she might be frightened but she would not be cowed she was a trinovante maiden and mistress of this house it is the home of lucullus she confirmed trying to keep the anxiety from her voice and i am his daughter the legionary grunted and slid from his horse allowing her to see his face for the first time the eyes that stared at her were closeset and cold very deliberately he allowed his gaze to run over her body lingering on her breasts and hips it left her feeling somehow violated as if his eyes were his hands which were large and rough with long dirtcaked fingernails he had coarse angular features and at some point his prominent nose had been broken and poorly set pock marks dotted his sallow skin this man has been angry from the day he was born she thought good he pushed roughly past her fetch your father out here vettius get to work remember everything of value maeve watched in astonishment as the men trooped by her into the house each carrying a large basket they were a combination of soldiers and slaves and she had never seen a more brutishlooking group of individuals wait what are you doing she protested by whose authority do you act the soldier turned slowly and removed his helmet he looked at her with a slightly pained expression as if uncertain who she was in the same instant her world pitched upside down and she found herself on her back in the dirt staring at the sky every nerve in her body jangled and her vision was shot with lightning bolts it took a moment to realize shed been punched her face was a mass of pain beneath the right eye and she could already feel her cheek swelling tears blurred her vision as she struggled to sit up the pockmarked soldier stood over her and she wondered distractedly if he was about to kick her if i have to repeat myself he warned ill have you trussed up and scourged at last lucullus walked stifflegged from the villa with the bewildered air of a man woken in the middle of a nightmare he wore the fine toga presented to him when he had been voted to the priesthood and didnt seem to notice that the men were laughing at him they moved briskly back and forth between the villa and the carts loaded with the household treasures he had collected to make himself more roman now the romans were stripping him of everything maeve struggled to her feet and ran to her fathers side as the leader drew a scroll from a pouch on his sword belt and read from it in a disinterested drawl by the authority of the procurator this estate is now imperial property held as security for the repayment of one million two hundred and twentythree thousand sestertii loaned to the merchant lucullus by the senator lucius annaeus seneca you have seventytwo hours to repay the debt or such portion of it as you are able or face certain penalties deemed appropriate by the state signed catus decianus procurator maeve gasped at the magnitude of the debt and lucullus was jolted from his torpor but i cannot he whispered no man could raise such a sum in three days the roman came close enough for maeve to smell his foul breath he smiled and she was reminded of a festering sore three days old man i see no gold in those baskets so you must have it hidden somewhere else ive never come across a celt yet who didnt like the glitter of gold so dig up your treasure and sell everything youve got and bring the proceeds to the procurators office in londinium maybe you could even sell yourself he laughed we done yet vettius he shouted unless you want the furniture every stick and the slaves round them up if we leave them theyll only clear off they can all carry something come here fire streaked across maeves scalp as the soldier wrapped his hand in her hair and hauled her roughly towards one of the wagons she kicked out at him and screamed in fury but she was powerless against his strength her father shouted a protest which was instantly cut off and she felt a momentary panic that hed been harmed stay where you are you old fool the legionary warned vettius would like nothing better than to gut you but you cant pay up if youre dead you wont be tempted to run if you know shes keeping us company three days and youll get her back and she might even be in the same condition a hand slipped surreptitiously inside her dress and cupped maeves breast making her gasp in outrage or maybe not he said they tethered her hands to the rear of the wagon and as the soldiers and slaves completed their task it lurched off slowly in the direction of the londinium road she felt an agonizing tug on her wrists and stumbled helplessly behind with only time for a single glance back to where her father knelt in the mud with tears running down his cheeks her mind still whirled from the blow she had received but she willed it to think rationally there could be no question of escape she was too tightly bound for that and where would she run to in any case she was a hostage for her fathers return with the payment but he could never pay back the full amount and what if it was true and there was no money what would her fate be at the hands of these evil men she remembered the touch of the officers fingers on her body and her skin crawled she closed her eyes and a groan escaped her lips valerius why did you not come to me redeyed and almost sleeping in the saddle valerius led his men into the legionary tent lines at colonia two hours after dawn they had ridden through the night with the aid of a full moon which showed the road ahead like a shining silver pathway between its pair of ditches as he rode he had composed in his mind the report he would send to the governor cearan had convinced him that only by supporting boudicca could rome ensure lasting peace with the iceni but suetonius paulinus might not be so easily persuaded paulinus had the reputation of a man of bullheaded singlemindedness he was unlikely to appreciate being distracted from his campaign against mona by what he would regard as the political gossip of a disaffected iceni lord nevertheless the letter had to be written and when valerius dismounted he hobbled to the cohorts headquarters tent and called for a stylus and wax tablet before sitting down at the collapsible campaign table it wasnt until he finished that he realized how exhausted he was if he could only close his eyes for a few seconds it would help his last memory was of the golden boar amulet nestling against the opaque marble of maeves flawless skin an hour later the clerk found him slumped across the table and called for his centurion julius looked down at the sleeping figure with affection should we wake him the clerk asked julius shook his head leave him he deserves some rest lunaris reckoned they covered forty miles in the saddle last night there was the message yes there was the message julius reached towards valeriuss shoulder then hesitated no the message said he should call on lucullus at his convenience it would be more convenient when he woke let him sleep he said it cant do any harm xxiii by the time valerius rode up to luculluss villa it was past midday hed been surprised by the message from the trinovante but the opportunity to see maeve banished all thoughts of tiredness and he had another urgent reason to talk to her he had made his decision on the long ride back from venta he loved her too much to leave her behind they would be married and he would take her to rome he had thought long and hard about the effect the marriage must have on his career and the impact on his relationship with his father the old man might even disinherit him but someone who had faced death in a shield wall was old enough to make his own decisions if he couldnt survive on his legal work he could take up a commission in an auxiliary unit all that mattered was that they would be together the whitewalled building was clearly visible from some distance and it was just a feeling at first but a soldiers feeling hed learned not to ignore the fields stood empty when they should have been full of workers either ploughing or planting there should be smoke from the villa kitchen but there was none now he noticed the open door that would normally be shut he rode forward with his hand on his sword allowing the horse to make its own pace in front of the house he slid from the saddle and stood for a moment absorbing an almost breathless stillness that made him reluctant to breathe himself maeve his voice echoed from the walls the darkened doorway suddenly seemed very dangerous carefully he drew his gladius and walked towards it a sharp snap made him flinch and he looked down to see shards of a broken pot beneath his feet he recognized it as luculluss favourite bowl from gaul the red clay one with the gladiators fighting below the rim here membered discussing the design with lucullus the britons eagerness to be a roman had been tempered by an inability to comprehend a society which delighted in making two men fight to the death the inner door lay ajar by only a few inches and valerius carefully used the point of the sword to push it open and give him a view into the next room empty no it was more than empty the place had been stripped all luculluss fine busts and statues were gone the bare end walls puzzled him until he realized what was missing theyd even cut the paintings of claudius from the plaster leaving jaggededged cavities as the only reminder of their existence maeve he heard the nervousness in his voice please not that lucullus he moved through the villa methodically searching each room and in each finding the same story until he reached luculluss bathhouse lucullus had always been a tidy man even the second set of accounts he kept hidden from the tax collectors was maintained in the fussy meticulous latin handwriting he took such pride in each column of figures straighter than any temple pillar clearly he had wished to give whoever found him as little extra work as possible because he had opened his veins while he sat comfortably in the warm water of his bath now he lay back impossibly white in an obscene sea of dark vinous red quite dead strangely his face was fixed in a dreamy expression which seemed to hint he had not found his passing too unpleasant after all the harshness that preceded it valerius shook his head wearily he was far from unfamiliar with death but he struggled to equate this lifeless milkwhite corpse with the jolly little man whose restless mind had leapt from one hopeless moneymaking scheme to the next with the unrepressed vigour of a meadow full of grasshoppers what had made him do it and where was maeve the sharp crack as a foot stepped on another of the pot shards in the courtyard alerted him to a new danger he moved swiftly back through the house and reached the inner door just as a hooded figure entered the room at first his mind cried out maeve but he realized the frame was too small he placed the point of his sword at the intruders back and was rewarded with a squeal of fear from catia maeves maid what happened here he demanded where is your mistress she is gone the greyhaired woman cried they took her they took everything i hid in the apple store or they would have taken me as well i who took her when he interrupted when was more important than who but he needed all the information he could glean the soldiers they were led by the tall one and had carts four they took everything they took docca she broke down sobbing uncontrollably docca must be her husband but valerius didnt have time for sympathy he grabbed her by the shoulders and shook her roughly when and which direction did they take three hours ago the londinium road valerius released her and she slumped to the floor three hours and perhaps an hour to catch up with them if he rode hard there was still a chance whoever had taken maeve could only move as fast as the carts carrying their booty that meant two miles in an hour at most so eight miles he tried to visualize the road looking for somewhere he could intercept the convoy but he would need help he lifted the woman to her feet listen to me catia you must go to the soldiers camp at colonia ask for julius the centurion this is what you must tell him he chose a place where the londinium road crossed a narrow river about ten miles west of colonia and concealed himself in a copse of nearby beech trees to wait hed avoided the road but ridden hard across open country until he was certain hed overtaken his quarry now all he could do was wait and hope the truth was that he had very little idea what would happen next it seemed clear that the raid on luculluss villa had something to do with the trinovantes business dealings but what had prompted the drastic step and luculluss even more drastic reaction was a mystery all he knew for certain was that he must get maeve back catia had said the man leading the raiders was a legionary which meant that valerius almost certainly outranked him in that case he would use his authority to have maeve and the other prisoners freed it might take some argument but it should be possible on the other hand the expedition could be a piece of private enterprise by one of luculluss business rivals or a partner he had cheated who had hired the soldiers as enforcers to get their money back when he turned it over in his mind this seemed less likely they might show they had some legal right over luculluss slaves but not his daughter and kidnap was a capital offence to be tried before the governor or his deputy if it came to it he would fight for her but he couldnt fight alone as the minutes passed the heavy silence mocked him nothing but the rustle of the trees and they whispered that his quarry must have taken another road after half an hour the horse twitched restlessly beneath him and he sensed its urge to move on but moments later the creak of an unsprung ox cart brought him the warning hed strained for the urge to launch himself towards the sound was overwhelming but he willed himself to stay motionless only when he could hear voices did he urge the mare forward and sweep her round to face them the leader reined in sharply at the sight of the unexpected apparition blocking the road he had just reached the crossing with four riders at his back and behind them luculluss slaves walked disconsolately among the ox carts a further six legionaries who had been marching in the rear recognized the threat and doubletimed past the convoy to join the vanguard leaving two to make sure the slaves didnt run valerius scanned the carts for maeve and was rewarded by a flash of chestnutbrown behind the second wagon she had her head bowed and was partially obscured by the horseman in front of him he wanted to shout out to let her know hed come for her but realized that drawing attention to her might place her in more danger he bit his lip and waited allowing the tribunes uniform and his bearing to announce his authority thus far hed ignored the leader of the soldiers you the voice reverberated with disbelief and valeriuss heart sank as he recognized it crespo but all he could do was play the part he had created for himself and buy time this confrontation was all about power and rank and a legionarys natural inclination to obey a command he injected his words with a touch of paradeground authority centurion crespo you have exceeded your orders release the prisoners and ill escort them back to colonia any dispute over the ownership of the slaves will be settled in the courts crespo stared back at him gimlet eyes glittering he remembered the stinking awfulness of waking up on a londinium dung heap and the humiliation he had endured in the hut at the silurian hill fort this man had been responsible for both unfortunately he was also a tribune of rome which meant crespo had to curb his natural inclination towards violent retribution yet something wasnt right here you seem to be all on your own pretty boy i wonder whose orders you have if you have any at all he said thoughtfully valerius ignored the insult i dont need orders crespo this uniform carries the governors authority and flouting that authority will see you hung from a cross crespo nudged his mount forward and reached towards the belt at his waist valeriuss right hand shadowed the move hovering over his sword hilt the sicilian laughed and carefully retrieved the scroll bearing his mandate my instructions tribune centurion crespo is ordered to secure any or all of the property of lucullus augustalis of colonia on the instructions of the procurator catus decianus i think youll find that includes his slaves if you dont have something official countermanding my order ill ask you to step aside and ill be on my way the thin lips twitched in a humourless smile and his voice fell to a whisper and well have our reckoning another time because believe me pretty boy there will be a reckoning his property doesnt include his daughter valerius said it loudly enough for the men at crespos back to hear if he could plant a seed of doubt there was a chance crespos style of leadership was unlikely to have made him popular and if the soldiers who followed him could be swayed but crespo was a predator with a predators instinct for any weakness something in the way valerius spoke awoke the wolf in him he heard it howl and the smile transformed into a grin of anticipation his daughter so thats it you didnt come all this way to round up a few dirty old slaves did you pretty boy you came for the priests daughter full of surprises you are here was me thinking you only liked boys vettius bring the celt bitch up here one of the riders turned and rode to the second cart where he untied the rope holding maeve and used it to pull her stumbling to the flank of crespos horse valerius felt raw anger flare within him when he saw the bruise on her cheek and the halfshut eye he reached for the rope but crespo flicked it away from him not so fast pretty boy he leaned forward and swept maeve effortlessly on to the saddle in front of him whats she worth to you valerius froze he understood that crespo was trying to goad him into a fight the other soldiers edged closer and their hard eyes never left him if he reacted now against odds of a dozen or so to one he might take a few of them with him but probably not crespo and if he died crespo couldnt afford any witnesses to the murder of a roman tribune so maeve would die too whats she worth the centurion repeated as his captive struggled in his arms he ran his hands over her shoulders breasts and legs not bad i think i might have her for myself tonight and after ive had her vettius and his mules can have her too then shell only be fit for the dogs so maybe well give her back to you valerius went cold and his mind moved beyond anger to that place where only crespos blood would pay for the indignities maeve was suffering her eyes pleaded with him to act his heart told him to launch himself across the gap and ram his sword point beneath crespos chin and up into his brain his head said wait thunder filled his ears and he wondered if it was the thunder the british champions heard when they threw themselves against the roman shields perhaps the thunder of taranis that sent them to a warriors death without fear of what waited beyond but it was only the thunder of twenty galloping horses valerius didnt look round he heard the ragged snorts of mounts that had been ridden hard and knew that behind him was now lined up a troop of belas thracian cavalry wing crespos expression didnt change but the men around him backed away from the long cavalry spears five hundred denarii crespo frowned ill give you five hundred denarii valerius repeated take it or we take her and you get nothing he saw crespos eyes counting the spears behind him maeve sat very still with her head bowed and he couldnt read what was in her eyes eventually the centurion gave a sharp laugh he knew hed been outmanoeuvred but saw no sense in crying over it thered be another time he allowed her to slip to the ground you heard him five hundred denarii for the british slut he shouted if he doesnt pay his honour is mine and i will bury it in my latrine where it belongs march you lazy bastards weve wasted enough time here once the little convoy had moved out of sight valerius dismounted and helped maeve to her feet she stood motionless as he cut the rope from her wrists revealing a glistening band of bloody flesh her eyes had the unseeing stare so familiar in legionaries who had fought one battle too many on the way back to colonia she sat on the saddle in front of him and at one point her body began to shake uncontrollably she was still shaking when they reached the townhouse her father had once owned he knew he should tell her about luculluss death but feared the news would break her already fragile link with reality falcos wife was waiting for them and she cleaned and bandaged maeves wounds before putting her in valeriuss bed while she slept he sent word to cearan and waited xxiv when maeve finally woke two days later valerius sensed a deep change in her that he didnt have the wit to understand or the understanding to approach she emerged from the bedroom pale and exhausted still wearing the torn blue dress with dark shadows around both eyes her strength visibly returned with each spoonful of the thin soup the militia commanders wife had recommended but she would not meet his gaze and spent hours staring into the distance as if she were searching for something valerius fretted at his inability to reach her and in the evening he could bear no more he took her in his arms and held her deciding that now was the time to tell her of her fathers death but as he breathed in the sweet jasmine scent of her hair she stiffened and began to struggle in his grasp squirming and scratching forcing him to release her when she was free she backed away with a look of disgust that twisted her beauty into a parody of itself maeve he pleaded she shook her head wordlessly and a highpitched keening came from her throat with a single movement she took the front of her dress in two hands and ripped it to the waist this is what you want she hissed finally finding a voice that was as cracked and broken as one of the pots the despoilers had dropped in her fathers atrium you want these she took the twin bounty of her breasts in her hands and offered them to him you paid for them you paid for me no he said yes she spat you made a slave of me you bought me from that animal and now you own me with the last five words she tore the dress still further and she was naked her lovely body still bearing the marks of her ordeal the scratches and the bruises and the invisible stains of crespos assault so take me isnt that what romans do with their slaves take them whenever it suits them rut with them wherever it takes their fancy she was sobbing now but sobs of lifeconsuming fury your father he tried to say is dead or he would have come for me he would have saved me or died in the attempt not watched as some foulbreathed pig violated and ruined me she shook her head and he knew she was remembering each moment of her shame when i saw you in the roadway i knew i was safe i knew that you would fight for me and that if you died i would die by your side i would have been glad instead you watched while my honour was stripped from me coward she snarled and she threw herself at him nails tearing at his eyes coward coward coward valerius fought her off grabbing the flailing arms and avoiding the teeth snapping at his face her head whipped back and forward as if she were possessed but she was still weak and the savagery of her fury burned out in a few minutes she went limp in his arms he picked up her slight body and carried her back to his bed where he sat in the darkness listening to the sound of her fractured breathing at one point during the night she said quietly you may sell me again if you wish for i do not want to be a burden to you but you must call me by another name i am no longer maeve of the trinovantes i am a slave i am sorry he said because he could think of nothing else to say you would not understand she replied you are a roman next day in the misty stillness of the dawn valerius stood with falco as the little merchants body was carried from the villa to the burial ground beyond colonia where a square pit ten paces by ten had been dug maeve was still too weak to attend and did not hear the bard sing his praises or see the things he had loved placed around him by the people he had loved a few treasures at least had survived crespos ravages cearan was first carrying an amphora of the calenian wine lucullus had often shared with valerius then cearans wife aenid with an intricate gold torc discovered behind a loose brick in luculluss storeroom a slim darkhaired waif of a girl valerius didnt recognize carefully placed a gaming board and pieces beside his body his finest clothes and favourite stool and finally his fathers sword which he had kept hidden for seventeen years once a priest would have said the sacred words and made the sacrifices but the druids had all been driven from the east long ago instead an elder from the settlement by cunobelins farm performed the rites and as he did so valerius allowed his eyes to wander over the mourners apart from falco who was here to represent colonias council the roman merchants and traders who had profited from lucullus had discovered more pressing business today but the celts trinovante cousins had gathered to honour his passing to the otherworld they stood in a compact mass with cearan at their head tall sombre figures broadchested and proud their dark eyes sent valerius an unmistakable message as he stood slightly apart with falco it said they may have been long conquered but they still knew how to hate he remembered luculluss words on the night they were drunk together there are men great men proud warriors who live in the ruins of their burnedout huts and watch their children starve because they once had the temerity to stand up for what was theirs now he was seeing those men with his own eyes the heirs of caratacus unlike the compliant celts who frequented colonia they wore long belted tunics over tight trews and had thick plaid cloaks draped across their shoulders he could see how their hands itched for their weapons and their war shields all they needed to make them an army were their spears and a leader will there be trouble he asked the militia commander falco shook his head i dont believe so cearan is no fool and he has influence among the trinovantes as well as the iceni they are angry as they have a right to be but they are not organized valerius wondered if that was true but falco knew his business when do you leave for glevum the wine merchant asked my orders came through this morning the first cohort will march in a week and ill be with them and rome ill kick my heels for another month in londinium it doesnt seem to matter so much now have dinner with us on wednesday then just the old soldiers corvinus and the like no petronius on my honour how is she he thought for a moment how to describe the indescribable changed falco shook his head that man is a monster he promised me a reckoning and ive vowed to fulfil that promise falco placed a hand on his arm do not waste yourself pursuing crespo go back to rome and make a new life forget him valerius watched the final planks being placed over luculluss grave crespo was not the kind of man you could forget if you did you were likely to end up in a river with a knife in your throat but perhaps falco was right everything had changed all the certainties in his life had vanished with maeves love her reaction had shocked him somehow turned him inside out since then he had swung between extremes of pain and anger shame and regret how could she believe he was a coward he was a roman tribune and he had saved her life if he had been a briton they would both be dead now and crespo would still be in londinium with her fathers treasures in the end he was faced with the certainty that he had lost her so yes he would return to rome and leave the procurator and crespo to continue destroying other lives he shook his head it was time to go home before he left the burial ground he sought out cearan he knew the iceni would not want to meet him but also that he was too wellmannered to refuse he discovered the tall noble talking seriously with a group of trinovante elders and valerius again thought how kingly he looked cearan needed no golden circlet to prove his lineage it was written in the aristocratic planes of his face and in the quiet way he wielded his power if the gods had been kinder here was the true leader of the iceni cearan caught his eye and frowned but a few moments later he came to valeriuss side you were luculluss friend but i wish you had not come the icenis voice was taut it is difficult enough to soothe the passions your people have aroused without the sight of a scarlet cloak to inflame them further he shook his head sometimes i wonder if your emperor truly wants peace even as i try to douse the fires your procurator throws fuel on the flames with his demands for the repayment of subsidies that were accepted in good faith but he now claims were merely loans lucullus was the first and yes perhaps the most foolish but he will not be the last these people he nodded towards the trinovantes did not need another grievance against the romans they look towards the slope yonder and see the land they once farmed being worked by british slaves under roman masters now their leaders men who beggared themselves to ensure their tribe did not starve and accepted the roman way because it was the only means to retain their dignity are to be ruined their patience is at an end tell your governor that valerius studied his companion and what of your patience cearan will you abandon your people because of a single setback the iceni stiffened not a single setback there have been others while i counsel peace men meet in the forest at night and come back with talk of a return to the old ways and the wrath of the goddess the priests are among us again can you persuade the governor to endorse queen boudicca as regent and accept her daughters as king prasutaguss joint heirs valerius thought of the report he had written which was still with the clerk he would deliver it himself and risk paulinuss anger i can try you must what will become of her for a second cearan was puzzled by the sudden change of subject eventually he said i will take her north to share our home she will have a life it will not be the life she knew but it will be a life xxv gwlyms first indication that he wasnt dead was the scent of crushed marigold accompanied by a bitter liquid that burned in his throat and filled his body with a warm reviving glow warmth that was the true puzzle he had thought he would never feel warmth again the last thing he remembered was the chilly embrace of the river overwhelming his body and his mind and the sensation of surrendering to an allconsuming but not unpleasant numbness can he travel the voice seemed to come from a long distance away and the mumbled answer was unintelligible mentally gwlym tested the fibres of his limbs and came up with his own answer yes it seemed unlikely but he must have spoken aloud because a presence loomed over him and he opened his eyes to discover a distinguished silverhaired man of early middle age studying him intently his expression wary and respectful i am volisios lord of the iceni keeper of the northern marches and i have awaited your coming gwlym allowed his head to fall back and closed his eyes he was safe in truth the answer turned out to be premature it was another day before his legs recovered the strength to allow him to walk and another still before he felt confident enough to venture beyond the door of the roundhouse whose owner had discovered him beached and freezing whilst collecting stones from the river volisios rode ahead to prepare the way but before he left he provided gwlym with a pony and an escort of six men the roundhouse was within the stretch of disputed border land between the iceni and the catuvellauni and though an encounter with a roman patrol was unlikely it could not be ruled out only when they crossed a narrow muddy stream and he saw the guards relax did gwlym do the same but the instinct for selfpreservation honed during all the months in hiding had returned and his eyes constantly roamed the country around him he found it a depressing alien place low threatening skies bore down on a flat landscape that seemed more liquid than good solid earth the ponies squelched their way along soggy paths and through reed beds from one piece of dry ground to the next with a reassuring confidence but gwlym sensed the guards were nervous of him during the few halts he was left alone with a little food and his own thoughts the lands of the iceni had always been his ultimate destination if he lived long enough but his relief at reaching his goal was tempered by new concerns firstly volisioss apparent foreknowledge of his approach hinted at best of overenthusiasm amongst those he had left tending the smouldering fires of freedom in one of the villages behind him some catuvellauni lord had asked the question who will lead the rising in the east and come up with the name volisios from there it wasnt difficult to imagine a messenger being sent to advise the iceni to prepare a proper welcome for the wandering druid a breach of security and a concern but not the disaster it might have been no what truly worried him was the assumption of ownership immediately apparent in volisioss every word and gesture it seemed he was to be the icenis druid and no one elses and these guards were as much to ensure that as for his own security he had encountered this situation before of course many a lord had looked upon him and seen his own advantage even after the years of the great silence a druid still had the power to awe some coveted him as an ornament to enhance their own standing others as a weapon to strike fear he had dealt with them all but here and now the presumption had the potential to destroy everything he had worked for as he rocked in the saddle he pondered the dilemma of how to trap the hare without losing the rabbit already in the net dusk fell and with it came a damp lungclogging sea fog at the same time the land narrowed to a promontory little wider than the path they travelled gwlym peered ahead towards a ghostly wasteland of dangerous shaledark waters evilsmelling bogs and stunted mossgrown trees just as the ground was about to vanish beneath his ponys hooves a silent figure rose from nowhere to take the reins heart thundering he turned to his escort but the men were already riding back the way theyd come apart from one who gestured for him to dismount and once hed done so led the pony off into the murk a druid knows no fear he had been taught where a druid walks the gods walk at his shoulder well if this wasnt fear it was something perilously close the man who was now his only human contact in this dank wilderness was one of the ugliest he had ever set eyes on short but very broad he wore some kind of primitive garment made of halfcured animal skins his flat round face had a large upturned nose with the nostrils facing forward in a way that reminded him of a pigs and slanted eyes with irises of an unnatural translucent blue when he spoke his words were mere grunts but gwlym realized the man wanted him to follow the bulky figure moved off quickly and silently making no provision for any weakness or hesitation when he reached the darker area that must be the beginning of the true wetlands gwlym expected him to halt but he plunged on without stopping and surprisingly without making any kind of splash beneath his feet hidden by the swamp grass but above the water level gwlym found himself traversing a narrow walkway made up of short sections of branch as thick as his upper arm the branches were linked by lengths of plaited reeds which must have been stronger than they looked because the path wore the marks of frequent use and had obviously been here for some time as far as he could tell it led east towards the sea but it turned sharply here and there to avoid deeper pools and the odd stand of skeletal trees and occasionally a fork would veer off to right or left they walked in silence the short man through choice gwlym concentrating all his being on the next few paces of precariously narrow pathway to avoid falling into the ooze below he was sweating heavily now despite the chill of the night the air was unnaturally still and the stink of the mud foul a man careless enough to lose his footing here would drown in minutes his body would never be found and his soul would wander this dank and desperate place for the rest of time they had been travelling for an hour as near as gwlym could guess when the guide halted he listened carefully then cupped his hands to his mouth and gave what sounded like the call of a marsh harrier after the count of five he repeated the call a harsh screech followed by a less shrill yick yick yick which this time brought an immediate echo from the darkness as they continued gwlym noticed a mysterious muted glow in the mist ahead and the unmistakable sharp clang of metal upon metal the glow appeared to hang in the air and he assumed it must be on some elevated platform but as he approached he saw they were nearing a low island in the the centre of a sea of fog and that the light was emerging from behind a plaited reed screen erected around the perimeter volisios waited where the walkway met the island a torch in his left hand and a broad smile on his face welcome he said and my apologies for your inconvenience as you see we have prepared for your arrival most ingenious gwlym acknowledged volisios dismissed the guide and led gwlym through a gap in the screens to where a dozen forges blazed each with a smith hammering enthusiastically at a glowing piece of weaponry either a long crude sword or a socketed iron spear point in another area a group of men gathered the completed blades and dipped them into cisterns where they hissed and spluttered until they cooled still more fixed the spearheads to shafts or bound leather strips round sword hilts to create crude handgrips we are safe here but the romans patrol the coast and we must be careful not to provoke their interest in this volisios fluttered a hand at the fog you can see nothing beyond a hundred paces but if we want to work in daylight we have to light the forges before dawn when the fires reach their heat theres no smoke but until then it would betray our position from ten miles away see here he ushered gwlym towards one of the huts hundreds of swords lay stacked against the walls in bundles of twenty or thirty i can arm five thousand men with swords and another ten thousand with spears with you by my side and the validation of the gods i will lead the iceni against colonia tear down the temple of claudius stone by stone and slaughter every roman there the florid red of volisioss face grew deeper with each word he spoke and in the orange light of the forges his skin looked almost black gwlym could see beads of sweat on his forehead he understood that volisios had been manoeuvring for months to replace prasutagus and had seen a way to strengthen his cause by allying himself with the forces of rebellion but was that enough you have done well volisios better than i could ever have hoped he said artlessly and when you have burned colonia what then londinium the iceni hesitated it was clear he had not planned beyond the destruction of the roman colony yes he said slowly londinium and you will take the city with fifteen thousand men londinium is no colonia the walls are high and unbroken the main roman strength is in the west but the citys garrison is still large and what of the legion at lindum will your men face a full legion the tribes of the south will rally to my banner gwlym blinked could the man truly believe that the proud war chieftains of britain would follow some lord of a trackless swamp still for the moment volisios was all he had he allowed himself a show of enthusiasm you can lead them the trinovantes and the catuvellauni the parisi and the cornovii i must be sure he stretched out his hands and laid the palms against the sides of the icenis head at the same time closing his eyes and allowing a deep bass murmur to resonate from his chest yes i see it you have the ambition lord volisios but do you have the fire only one with the fire can unleash the wrath of andraste he removed his hands and stared into the noblemans eyes which were wide with fright but volisios had not held the northern marches of the iceni for twenty years without a wellspring of courage and resolve yes i have the fire he declared recovering some of his earlier bluster i have the fire to ignite the wrath of andraste gwlym nodded sternly as if he had no doubt volisios spoke the truth when the time comes he said you and only you will know until then gwlym druid of mona will be at your side to advise you volisioss eyes shone gwlym knew the iceni was seeing not just colonia and londinium but all of south britain under his thrall the new caratacus he had sown the seeds of doubt as he intended and he would nurture those seeds as the opportunity arose but how to bring the hare to the trap xxvi april ad the march west seemed much shorter than seven months before when the first cohort had made its way towards colonia under the dank grey clouds of autumn the very obvious manifestation of spring put a little more bounce in every mans step not even the sixtypound loads they carried could dent their spirits wherever they looked leaves fresh from the bud turned the hedgerows emerald green and buttercups dandelions and primroses studded the meadows with gold each farmers field had its flock of newborn lambs jostling playfully for position on the nearest hummock of grass and watched over by a shepherd boy ready to fend off any enterprising fox or buzzard or passing hungryeyed legionary as they marched through the hills towards glevum valerius heard a familiar bass voice take up the simple cadence of the first verse of the march of marius there was a mule he was no fool he had a girl in every fort another one in every port in allifae she was not shy by the time they reached the twentieths base above the severn the mule had shown much imagination and inventiveness and hed left a trail of wornout working girls from one side of the empire to the other lunariss voice never let up and he was still going strong valerius sang along with the rest he barely recognized the fortress as the place hed left the previous year supply trains carried a constant stream of equipment and provisions from the river to a separate temporary encampment protecting the mountain of stores gathered for the campaign ahead engineers had constructed a series of doubleditched annexes to house the various auxiliary units who would accompany the twentieth and the fourteenth to attack mona veteran infantry from frisia batavia and tungria a fivehundredstrong wing of sarmatian light cavalry scouts and another of raetian bowmen travelstained and legweary the men of the first cohort gathered on the parade ground to say farewell to their tribune valerius had never seen a unit more battleready or eager brick red dustcoated faces grinned at him from below their polished helmets and dark patches of sweat stained their tunics but every man was honed whip thin and tough as seasoned saddle leather war held no illusions for them but they had had enough of mending roads and mock fights he felt a wasp sting of guilt at the knowledge he wouldnt be going to mona and worse when they cheered him to a man as he dismissed them good luck julius look after them he said to the centurion ill announce our arrival at the principia and after that who knows theres a pretty whore called thalia in the brothel up by the gate on the prata flaminia say hello to her for me and give her a big kiss or something else julius laughed and took him by the arm looking up into the youngold face with the wary fighters eyes i cant imagine you in a law court valerius but youll scare the life out of the opposition afterwards valerius reported to the legate on the status and condition of his men he was pleased by the generals reaction i know i watched them march in they are a credit to you and their officers theyll have plenty of time to rest the fourteenth sets off in a week from their base at viroconium it will take a month to force a way through the mountains we go in after that thats when the first cohort will be needed when we reach mona valerius nodded his thanks and turned to the request that had been dominating his thoughts for the final five miles of the march i would like to ask for a meeting with the governor sir livius pursed his lips and tutted you wont change his mind valerius he wont keep you in britain i dont expect him to sir its another matter he knew he could ask the legate to pass on the information supplied by cearan but there was no guarantee it would reach the governor he owed it to the iceni to argue the case himself very well ill arrange it but i warn you hes in a dangerous mood he heard this morning that corbulo heaps success upon success in armenia the governors future rests on this campaign and the emperor is impatient for victory it will mean a triumph and a consulship if he wins but i hope its good news you are bringing him staff officers and messengers bustled to and from the governors headquarters with the regularity of bees supplying a hive a harassed aide ushered valerius inside where he found paulinus at a plain wooden desk writing unhurriedly in confident strokes across a piece of parchment it was undoubtedly an important report normal orders would be issued on the wax writing block at his right hand and transcribed by clerks valerius felt the first flutter of nerves this man had the power of life and death over every soldier and civilian in the province and he was a man to be feared in the silence he considered what he knew of the governor paulinus had spent his first campaigning season in britain in the southwest annihilating the last remnants of resistance from the dumnonii and their durotrige allies in the rugged peninsula where they had fled the swords of the second legion the governor counted it a great success reaping the double benefit of guaranteeing rome the tin it needed and spreading word of the new total war he had brought to these shores every king prince or warrior who resisted was butchered only widows and orphans survived to wail their funeral songs and spread the tale of his coming paulinus had plotted and conspired to win his position as governor but he hated this island and he despised its people he combined a hard unbending and utterly ruthless character with a forensic intelligence he was also a brilliant soldier who had been the first roman general to fight his way across the atlas mountains a sharp scrape announced he had completed his correspondence valerius drew himself up to his full height the shaven head lifted and he found himself being studied by two flat basilisk eyes squinting from beneath a heavy brow paulinus maintained his gaze for a full minute as if he was trying to define what species of life form had dared interrupt him valerius felt the first prickle of sweat in his scalp i am told you have important news for me the voice was as roughedged as the face it emerged from the accent from somewhere to the south of rome valerius repeated what cearan had told him about the likelihood of political upheaval among the iceni when king prasutagus died the clandestine meetings in the woods and his certainty that druids were spreading poison among his people when he had finished the governor snorted impatiently so in short i am expected to endorse the claim of this woman this boudicca over other worthy candidates on the word of some barbarian opportunist valerius took a deep breath sir it is my opinion that lord cearan is a man to be trusted if he has concerns then i think we should also have concerns the pebble eyes glowered in surprise you would give me advice young man i have so much advice that i am forced to sit at this table twelve hours a day considering it the emperor advises me how to squeeze more profit out of this benighted province my officers advise me their forces are not strong enough yet to take the druids isle my priests advise me that it is a fine day as if i cannot see that for myself and my doctor advises me that if i dont calm down my piles will burst paulinus slapped his palm on the table hard enough to make stylus and scroll airborne everything you say assumes that these iceni seek a war they would not be so foolish i would wipe this country so clean of any rebellious vermin that neither their children nor their childrens children would pose a threat to any roman again valerius suppressed a soldiers instinct to keep his mouth shut and used his lawyers experience to place a doubt where it would do most good perhaps we underestimate them sir he said thinking of the hatefilled eyes of the mourners at luculluss funeral paulinus stared at him lowly tribunes did not answer back to their commander in chief but then perhaps this tribune was not so lowly he cast his mind back in an attempt to fathom what political leverage valerius might have that made him so brave it did not occur to him that someone might be brave for its own sake the family valerii had once wielded influence on the palatine perhaps they would wield it again and one day that influence might be useful to him very well he would humour the boy i underestimate nothing the eastern tribes are a toothless leaderless rabble their kings have taken our gold and eat off our plates the warriors sit in the shade and watch their women plant seeds all day and they drink beer all night their swords are rusted to an edge that would not cut grass oxen pull their chariots and they use their shields to water their cattle am i to fear them does colonia fear them he thought for a moment king prasutagus still lives i will consider his queens case if and when he dies but it must wait until my return and the druids if what this cearan claims is true there would already have been attacks it is always the way we old men counsel patience but the young hotheads cannot keep their swords sheathed no even if a few druids are spreading poison their work is at an early stage they are no danger yet but they could be in future valerius suggested paulinus suppressed his annoyance it is possible but i will not jeopardize this mission on a possibility if the tribes were to combine to threaten colonia i would know of it no force of any size could gather without my knowledge in this province the ninth are only a few days march away they would be there before the rebels reached the gates and if they were not then colonia must be held by its people and if they cannot hold it then they do not deserve to keep it paulinus picked up his stylus valerius was dismissed he had failed he expected to be ordered to londinium immediately but the twentieths preparations were behind schedule and an extra pair of hands was not to be lightly discarded that day and each day thereafter the legate found some new logistical crisis for him to solve a supply line to unclog or a dispute to smooth over the armourer went sick and his deputy turned out to be incompetent and a new armourer must be found valerius thought of corvinus back in colonia but the distance was too far and the time too short eventually he bribed the prefect commanding the frisian auxiliaries to give him the use of a blond giant with a manic grin and latin that sounded like a bathhouse draining and so it went on on the ides of aprilis he watched with lunaris as governor paulinus and his personal bodyguard marched out with the auxiliaries to join the fourteenth legion the massed cornicens blowing a strident fanfare and the eagle standard glittering in the fresh morning sunlight his heart swelled as they passed rank after rank with their shields on their backs and their spears and equipment and a weeks rations already grating on their shoulders the letters to their loved ones had been sent their bellies were full and they were eager he could see it in the way they stepped out and in the determination on their faces behind them by the thousand came the mules of the supply train no ox carts on this campaign because no roads existed where they were going only precipitous mountain passes and boulderfilled valley bottoms that would snap an axle as if it were a toothpick the mules were followed by more auxiliaries than valerius had seen gathered together in one place the frisians and tungrians had been joined by vangiones and nervians from the swamps of germania gauls from every part of that vast land and lithe tanned hillmen from pannonia and moetia and dalmatia better them than me lunaris growled theyll have to clear the hills and force the passes a black celt on every ridge and a boulder on your helmet from every clifftop at least when we go that jobll have been done you think theyll fight valerius asked the legate of the fourteenth has been telling whoever wants to know that the druids will pull them back to the island theyll fight all right the big man said gloomily if the barbarians came to burn down the temple of jupiter would you sit and wait at the bottom of the capitoline no youd block the streets and have an archer at every window and a spearman at every corner and by the time they got to the temple there wouldnt be enough of them left to take it thats why hes taking so many of the country boys theyll do the dying and then the fourteenth and the twentieth will finish the job and take all the glory if theres any glory theyll have earned it valerius said considering the perils of a massed assault on a defended island any bridgehead would be paid for heavily in roman lives would you rather be staying behind with me lunaris shook his head no he said seriously ive been doing this for a dozen years mostly digging and marching and waiting lots of waiting fighting is the best part of it even with all the torn guts and the tentmates who dont make it back because its what were paid for and trained for and because we always win because were the best the next day they heard that prasutagus of the iceni was dead valerius considered riding out after paulinus and pressing him for a decision on the iceni succession but reviewing his interview with the governor convinced him that it would do more harm than good he thought of cearans earnest handsome face and felt the hollow emptiness of having failed a friend yet there was always a chance queen boudicca would prevail without the governors sanction paulinus had dismissed her as a mere woman but valerius had sensed a formidable presence when he had seen her at venta in any case he had done everything he could another week passed and although the legate kept him busy enough he began to have a strange detached feeling of not belonging each man in the legion had a definite aim and a place in the battle line but not him what they did they did for a purpose to ensure they reached mona with the equipment they needed in a condition that would allow them to use it to the best effect all he did was fill gaps he was considering asking the legate for leave to go when he received the legionary commanders summons livius received him in the principia with the harassed look of a man with too many problems and not enough time nonsense he snapped throwing a scroll on to the campaign desk in front of him we are not ready but i am commanded to march within fortyeight hours so march we must he frowned you have done good work here valerius for which i thank you and if i had my way you would be going with us but he glanced at the scroll in front of him and gave a bitter smile orders are orders however you can do me a last favour your replacement is due in londinium from rome in one week on the ship that will take you back there mars aid me but we need him hell be wet behind the ears and i cant have him wandering around these mountains on his own or some silurian will eat him and have his skull for an oil lamp choose a dozen experienced men from the first cohort as an escort and take them with you once they have picked up your replacement they are to follow us as they can judging by the governors dispatches we wont have gone too far we appear to have underestimated the obstinacy of the celts defending the passes of course sir it will be my pleasure which was true he couldnt think of better company than lunaris and his comrades from the second century they might not relish the march but if they werent marching east theyd be marching west into the arms of the druids at least theyd be safer with him xxvii crespo stared at the thatched roofs of the walled town across the river hed made no attempt to conceal the approach and he knew they knew he was here because he could feel their fear he heard a sniff behind him and felt a twinge of annoyance are you certain we will be safe among these savages catus decianus asked in his nasal drawl safe as if you were back in rome your honour they would have been safe with half the force he had at his back but it made the job all the easier the men he could always depend on vettius and his gang of thieves and bullies plus a few slave dealers who smelled a quick profit formed the nucleus of the unit but this was a big operation and hed used decianuss authority to strip the londinium garrison and form a force of a thousand men they werent frontline troops mostly legionaries nearing retirement and the remnants of shattered auxiliary units only fit for fetching and carrying but they looked formidable enough which was the point very well you have your orders crespo called his centurions forward first five centuries with me inside the town the rest fan out and surround the place as we agreed anyone who tries to run you hold or kill i dont really care once weve made our point you march to your assigned sector along with your units slaves and carts and strip every farm and every home if you dont find any gold give the owner a tickle with a spear till he tells you where it is because it will be there but dont kill too many it wasnt compassion purely business this was the emperor neros land now and the emperor would need people to work it the pragmatic king prasutagus had left half his kingdom to nero and had named his daughters heirs to the rest relying on his wife boudicca to rule until they came of age but nero didnt want half he wanted it all and crespo was going to get it for him which was why queen boudicca was about to be taught a lesson cearan stood in the main square of venta beside his queen and waited for the romans to enter through the double gateway boudicca wore a long dress of plaid belted at the waist with a chain of gold links she held her noble head high and her long russet hair had been carefully combed to a fine sheen falling over her shoulders in a fiery cascade a gold band circled her forehead and a torc of the same precious metal shone at her neck she looked magnificent he thought but in his heart he wished it otherwise this was not a day for a display of queenly splendour he was not sure yet what it was a day for but it was a day he had done his best to ensure would end peacefully word had reached him of the roman advance several hours earlier and he had puzzled over it a force of such strength could only be the escort for the governor or one of his senior officials was this suetonius paulinus on his way to endorse the queens proposal and confirm her daughters as prasutaguss heirs it seemed unlikely the iceni were romes clients not its subjects a separate entity outwith the province of britain the endorsement of rome was needed for the succession yes but a simple courier would have sufficed such a show of power sent out a message which was disturbing if not frightening worse this was the best reading of the situation he could arrive at when he had informed boudicca of the romans approach the colour had flared in her cheeks they seek to cow us her voice shook but i will not be cowed as long as i am queen of the iceni i will rule as queen no roman will dictate to boudicca what she can or cannot do but she turned to him and for the first time he saw the flicker of uncertainty in her eyes i cannot place my people at risk there are a thousand romans he replied give me two days and i could have five thousand warriors at your call the lords of the iceni had travelled from their estates to venta to discuss the succession and it would have been a simple matter for them to return and rouse their fighting men but but we do not have two days in any case it would still not be enough what arms do we have to face their swords and their spears nothing but knives scythes and a few hunting bows we cannot afford a confrontation there are swords a voice volunteered to a growl of approval volisios so his suspicions about the lord of the northern marches had been correct not enough and not here lord volisios he stared at the queen a question in his eyes she looked away and his heart sank then she turned to meet his gaze and nodded he sighed with relief you must take the young men to the secret places and conceal them there if you have swords he nodded to volisios then now is the time to sharpen them then you must wait a buzz of disapproval greeted his words and he raised a hand for quiet we cannot fight the romans here and we cannot fight them now they are too many and they are too well armed they will come and they will swagger and they will make their demands and then they will leave when they leave we will resume this discussion there is a time for swords and a time for words i do not believe it is a time for swords yet so why when the roman officer with the arrogant pockmarked face rode in at the head of his men did he wish more than anything on earth that he had a sword in his hand a scuffle from behind distracted him and he saw a flash of gold in the corner of his eye as tor his grandson darted from the crowd and pleaded to be lifted cearan picked the little boy up and tenderly kissed his head remembering the last romans to visit venta and wishing that valerius was among these men the thought of valerius made him think of maeve who was safe in one of the huts and he prayed she wouldnt emerge to retrieve the child but it was a pretty girl with her mothers red hair and the leggy confidence of a young colt who took tor from his arms boudiccas daughter rosmerta he smiled his thanks and turned to face the romans again and froze the officer was staring past him at the girls retreating back and the naked undisguised lust on his face sent ice water cascading down cearans spine beside him he felt boudicca stiffen crespo studied his surroundings who did these people think they were the town might have been roman if it hadnt been made of straw and mud rectangular buildings with narrow fronts facing the streets shops and workshops a marketplace that aped a forum and a large building at the far end of the square that was probably prasutaguss palace he had noted the handsome aristocratic briton standing with the tall redhaired woman in the centre of the square but his attention had been diverted by the girl perhaps today wasnt going to be such a chore after all decianus who had naturally waited until he was certain he faced no danger rode in with his escort at last they could get on with it crespo turned to his officers first century separate the men from the women and children and herd them outside make sure they understand what will happen if they dont behave third and fourth centuries search the houses for valuables but leave the big house at the end to the procurator and his staff that was where the records would be if these people kept records and the most valuable possessions the rest of you stand fast if theres any sign of trouble you know what to do a few women cried out as the legionaries advanced into the crowd selected the adult males and pushed them towards the gate he noted the absence of men of fighting age someone had sent them away and he thought he knew who he studied the iceni noble at the queens side so much the better decianus slid gingerly from the saddle and crespo dismounted with him together they marched towards the little group and halted three or four paces in front of them the procurator pulled a thin tablet of bronze from the sleeve of his toga and immediately began reading crespo saw the woman frown decianus truly was a fool at least he should have found out if she understood latin the tall man began whispering urgently in the womans ear translating as the procurator continued will of prasutagus heretofore known as king of the iceni clients of rome is repudiated and its terms annulled designated sole heir and all others hereby disinherited all monies lands properties minerals crops livestock revert to the emperor nero claudius drusus germanicus all profits from said goods revert to the emperor nero claudius drusus germanicus all future profits from the sale of said crops livestock minerals and revert to the said emperor nero claudius drusus germanicus cearan was appalled he could barely believe what he was hearing the words seeming to tumble in his head but somehow he managed to maintain the sense of what the longnosed bureaucrat was announcing boudiccas breasts rose and fell with increasing force and he felt her anger grow as she began to fully understand what the little piece of bronze plate signified nero was stealing her nation no she screamed spitting a wall of celtic invective that made decianus back away before the intensity of her fury cearan attempted to translate as she demanded a meeting with the governor justice from a roman court and the rights of a queen crespo laughed at the procurators fear and allowed boudicca to rave for a further minute for his own amusement before he struck the fullblooded punch took the iceni queen on the side of the skull sending the gold circlet she wore spinning into the air boudicca collapsed to the ground stunned and when she attempted to rise crespo placed his foot in the small of her back and forced her into the dust vettius he called to his second in command bring my whip this bitch needs teaching some manners please cearan rushed forward instinctively defending his queen crespo drew his gladius and turned in one movement bringing the razor edge of the sword down in a savage diagonal blow across cearans face the iceni shrieked and reeled back with his hands to his eyes the blood already spurting scarlet between his fingers aenid who had been among the crowd of women screamed and rushed to her husbands aid but one of crespos legionaries kicked the legs from under her and stabbed down with his sword not so pretty now crespo laughed vettius wheres my fucking whip decianus shuffled uncomfortably at the violence being displayed before him the procurator had served his six months with the legions but hed never been at home among men whose first instinct was to strike a blow he disliked crespo indeed found him disgusting but he had a distasteful mission to accomplish and a man like the centurion was a useful means to that end he looked down at the iceni queen wriggling in the dust beneath the soldiers sandal and fought back the urge to intervene no she had defied rome and if she was not taught to fear it there was a danger she would defy it again he turned away and walked past the bloodied kneeling figure of the goldenhaired celt scarcely noticing the dead woman at his side his mind focused on the more urgent problem of discovering the extent of king prasutaguss wealth crespos bluntfaced deputy handed him a whip but the centurion knocked it away not that one get me my flagellum the flagellum was the heavier whip made of ox leather boudicca would not only feel the pain of her punishment but bear the scars of it till she died he felt the queen struggling harder now and realized she was recovering from his punch she was a big woman and strong which might be awkward he looked around the square and his eye settled on a post used for tying up livestock on market days truss her up to that he ordered hauling boudicca to her feet two men dragged her to the post her red hair and clothing now matted with dust and her cheeks dirty and tearstreaked she struggled and twisted between them but her green eyes blazing with the fire of her hatred never left crespo she unleashed a string of curses each predicting a worse death but crespo only laughed now well see what a queen is made of boudicca had been tied with her hands above her head and her face against the splintered wood of the post and he took hold of the neck of her dress and with all his strength ripped it apart until her back was bared still not content he half turned her and tore the garment from her front leaving her naked to the waist and visible to all he hesitated for a moment to admire his handiwork the sight of her breasts heavy milk white and darknippled ignited something within him liquid fire flooded his loins and he felt a roaring in his ears he raised the whip and slashed it down on the pale flesh of her back boudicca screamed for the first time rosmerta and banna had watched their mothers ordeal with increasing horror now they rushed to her side from the crowd of howling women and children imploring crespo to show mercy crespo watched them race towards him his mind already framing the possibilities so not one juicy little peach but two he threw the whip to vettius who was standing by grinning make sure she feels it and when youve had enough come and take your turn he took each girl by the arm and dragged them to the nearest hut kicked in the door and threw them inside they stared at him terrified cowering against the wall their eyes showing wide and white in the darkness of the interior the knowledge of their fear only intensified his desire he stared at them prolonging the moment and anticipating the pleasures to be discovered beneath the plain shifts now he said his eyes moving lazily between them who is going to be first even through her pain boudicca heard her daughters screams xxviii valerius emerged from the low building that served as the port commanders office and shook his head every ship thats docked this week has been at least three days late apparently there have been poor winds in the bay the galley bringing our man isnt expected until the end of the week at the earliest lunaris nodded his knowledge of ships was limited to the transport that had brought him to britain but he understood enough of the vagaries of the wind to accept the delay without complaint so what do we do now he pointed with his thumb to the men lounging among the bales along the wharf by the tamesa if we dont keep them busy theyll get up to mischief ill report to the camp prefect and have you put on the ration strength three days isnt long but ill try to make sure youre on light duties watch your back crespo might still be around the duplicarius warned if crespos around hes the one who needs to be watching his back two hours later they met on the wharf and valerius gathered the legionaries around him youve been excused duties for the rest of the day the news raised a small cheer but ive been made responsible for your behaviour and youre to be on parade for inspection before dawn tomorrow the cheers faded as they realized there would be no night of debauchery in londiniums inns and brothels when the men had dispersed lunaris approached valerius with a scowl i sent the mules out to ask around about crespo know your enemy right valerius nodded the word is that he left eight or nine days ago to do the procurators dirty work and took half of the garrison with him valerius whistled thats a lot of dirty work thats right but he must have finished the job because most of them are back now which is why we arent up there patrolling the walls did anybody say what it was lunaris hesitated only that it was up somewhere in iceni country valerius froze he thought of maeve and cearan in the little township at venta if crespo harmed her the hut stank of fish maeve had bandaged cearans shattered face as best she could but was barely able to look at the torn flesh and splintered bone created by crespos sword now she sat with her back to the thatch wall cradling his head as his body shook uncontrollably she had little medical knowledge but enough to know that if he did not receive help soon he would die little banna lay slumped against the opposite wall her eyes were closed but maeve doubted she was sleeping beside her a darkhaired woman spoke quietly as rosmerta sobbed against her breast maeve shuddered as she thought of the horrors they had endured the romans had eventually tired of the two girls but so many she knew they would never be the same again she had been certain she would be killed and every man woman and child in venta along with her the roman commander was the tall pockmarked officer who had kidnapped her the man valerius called crespo and she had known better than to expect mercy she brushed away a tear what she had suffered was nothing compared with the suffering of the iceni when crespo eventually left the square with the bulk of his men she had rushed from her refuge to cearans side aenids lifeless blue eyes had stared uncomprehendingly but cearan still breathed and somehow she managed to raise him to his feet the roman guards had averted their eyes as she supported him away and maeve sensed that some of the soldiers with the procurator were ashamed of what theyd been ordered to take part in it gave her hope she would survive but did not quench the fire of her anger later she returned to the square with a small party of women and cut boudicca down and recovered the girls they had left venta and journeyed eastwards the darkhaired woman leading them along secret paths to this isolated community among the endless reed beds and swamps of the coast now the queen sat alone a coverlet across her scarred back and breasts staring south through the open doorway her eyes filled with unnerving savagery as the hours passed the heat became oppressive and the unceasing buzz of insects filled the salt air dark clusters of flies settled on cearans bloodstained bandages and maeve was kept busy brushing them away at one point she must have fallen asleep when she awoke the queen hadnt moved from her position from time to time she heard her whisper to herself a garbled litany of fury maeve could distinguish only a single word andraste in the late afternoon voices outside alerted them maeve reached for cearans dagger which was the only protection they had but it was the iceni lord volisios who entered accompanied by a stooped figure in dark clothing a young man with pale almost translucent skin that clung to the bones of his face and eyes that knew you in an instant he carried no weapon but wore a belt studded with loops holding short cattlehorn containers each about three inches long and stopped with birch bark he took in the occupants of the hut at a glance and immediately crossed to where maeve sat with cearan i am said to have some healing skills he said perhaps you would allow me to look at his wounds he deftly unwrapped the bandage and studied the iceni without emotion he will lose the eye i think but one eye will suffice he heard maeves gasp and without turning said a mans looks are but an outward decoration it is what is inside that makes him who he is our first task is to fend off the spirits that would enter him and set the wound afire he reached into one of the containers at his belt boil water and place this in it and when it has cooled sufficiently make him drink it every drop he left the hut and returned an hour later with a cloth bag this is a poultice which you must place over the wound the drink will ease his suffering the poultice will begin the healing process see you place it like this he manoeuvred the bag which was damp and gave off an unusual earthy smell directly over cearans ravaged face taking care to leave the mouth clear when he was satisfied he lit a small fire in the centre of the floor then he unstoppered another of the horns at his belt took out a handful of what appeared to be dust and scattered it in the flames where it hissed sparked and crackled instantly the room filled with a suffocating evilsmelling smoke that battered maeves senses and left her head reeling the thin man bowed his head over the fire and began to chant a rhythmic sonorous incantation and maeve felt the hut spin around her at one point she was certain she was taken by the hand and drawn into the sky to look down upon the land of britain and all who dwelt there strange that she thought not of her father or cearan but of the roman valerius when she woke for a second time she felt as refreshed as if she had spent a long night in her own soft bed rather than a few minutes on a hard earth floor the healer sat by cearan but like her he could not ignore the heated conversation between volisios and boudicca i have swords shields and spears and the warriors to wield them the nobleman insisted and i am boudicca queen of the iceni selfwill kept her voice controlled but maeve could almost feel the physical force of boudiccas suppressed rage boudicca queen of the iceni was dispossessed by the romans volisios persisted boudicca laughed mirthlessly and you volisios if you were brave enough to return to your estate would no doubt find a roman in your bed i am boudicca queen of the iceni and if i were not you would not be here with your talk of warriors and spears i came here to assure myself of your safety you came here to assume my authority to raise yourself above the rest volisios flinched at the undeniable truth but he held her gaze and do i have it no then who does i am boudicca queen of the iceni she repeated and her words rang through the little hut like a voice from another world no man among the iceni has suffered greater wrong than i i will take the fight to the romans with sword and spear i will destroy them with fire and with iron i will have my vengeance go now and call the war bands every man be he warrior youth or elder must play his part i will wipe the romans and any who stand with them from this land or i will die in the attempt volisios stared at her overwhelmed by her presence and her anger he snatched a startled glance at gwlym now he understood the wrath of andraste the druid rose to his feet and boudicca glared at him you are no longer boudicca of the iceni the priest declared ignoring the fierce eyes that hooked him like an eagles talons the spirit of andraste lives within you the spirit of the hare and the horse and now of the wolf and who is it who is so impudent as to gainsay a queen the stoop vanished and the young mans paleness took on an almost mystical light so his skin shone in the gloom i am gwlym druid of mona and i am here to guide you he was finely muscled with long brown hair drawn together by a red ribbon at his neck gwlym watched from his place beside the queen as the guardian of the sacred pool led the young man forward he had been carefully chosen for his untarnished character no stain sullied his past or his present he was a prince of his tribe and he had come willingly to this place and to his death the druids of britain knew they had one last opportunity to drive the romans from their land and they had sacrificed themselves and their sanctuary on mona to achieve it but there had to be other sacrifices nothing could be left to chance gwlym had sent word by swift horsemen to north and west and south now now was the time and from each place as the forces of free britain assembled a messenger would be sent a messenger of such status as to impress even the most bloodweary deities so they had gathered here beside the forest pool in a place sacred to the iceni and their forebears since antiquity gwlym led the chants his powerful voice ringing out through the glade and they were taken up by each of the elders of the tribe in turn once these men had been acolytes and the keepers of the groves but they had lost their way when the druids were driven into the west but they still remembered a thin cord attached the victim to the guardian a warrior dressed in a red tunic and plaid trews the others formed a loose circle on the firm ground by the waters edge as he sang gwlym watched the moon as it made its unflinching arc across the night sky when the glowing orb reached the exact centre of the circle in the tree canopy he raised his arms high at the signal the sacrifice threw off his cloak to stand naked in the firelight swaying in time to the rhythm of the chanting gwlym hid his relief the drug had been administered in the exact quantities he slipped his hand into the folds of his robe this was his time this was what all the years of tests and trials on the sacred isle had been for he allowed the others to continue the chant and walked forward talking reassuringly to the young man as he would to a nervous colt and as he talked he circled round behind him when he was in position gwlym swung up the shorthandled metal axe and brought it down on the boys head with such force that everyone round the pool clearly heard the sharp thunk as the blade bit into the bone the blow would have felled an ox but incredibly the victim still stood swaying wildly until a second blow of the axe knocked him to his knees now the young druid stood back to allow the warrior with the red tunic to take his place above the prince with both hands the man took hold of the noose with which he had led his captive twisted it round the helpless boys neck and pulled it until it bit deep into the flesh of his throat but still he would not die without relaxing his grip the warrior dropped on one knee on to his victims back with such violence they clearly heard a rib break then he used the extra leverage to twist the ends of the noose until the boys head suddenly flopped forward as his neck snapped the warrior rose his job done but two deaths were not enough three gods needed to be appeased volisios his face a mask of determination lifted the dead princes lolling head by his gorethick hair and in a final act of mutilation drew the edge of a dagger slowly across his throat while the guardian carefully weighted the body and placed it in the sacred pool gwlym breathing heavily strode to where boudicca stood in a hooded cloak the three deaths had been administered exactly as ordained by aymer and in accordance with all the edicts of the sect the gods would accept the sacrifice it is done he said unfurl the wolf banner unleash the wrath of andraste xxix crespo rolled the dice seven he announced all right vettius the one with the big tits is yours but take her into the other room im sick of seeing that great arse of yours bulling up and down vettius grinned and walked across to where a group of young iceni women huddled fearfully against the back wall of the main hall of prasutaguss palace a plump girl of about fourteen squealed as he grabbed her by the hair and hauled her roughly through a doorway her sobbing pleas not to be hurt could be heard clearly through the thin wall before a sharp slap silenced them but such sounds had become so familiar that crespo barely registered them they had been here for almost two weeks now supervising the collection of iceni wealth and cataloguing the extent of iceni lands by day and drinking and playing dice for the use of the captured women each night he reflected on a job well done the procurator now back in londinium had promised to commend him in his report to the emperor crespo prided himself on being a man who took each day as it presented itself but such recognition opened doors he certainly didnt intend to return to the legion no need to as long as the prettyboy tribune kept his promise to pay up he didnt have any doubt valerius would pay why did the honest always have to be so pious fool then there was the bonus hed managed to hide away the golden torc the queen had worn at her neck the sale of that would make his retirement much more pleasurable pity about the girl though he would have liked to tup her just to see the look on that bastard valeriuss face yes it was all very satisfactory he lay back and closed his eyes still remembering the way the whip had raised bright red welts against the paleness of boudiccas skin and the taut youthful flesh of her daughters he felt himself stir perhaps he wasnt too drunk after all smoke he came instantly alert at the shout vettius emerged from the room at the rear and pointed at the roof crespo looked up to see the slim streamers of smoke replaced by a flare of light as a portion of thatch caught fire and the flames quickly spread to a nearby beam vettius and a few others reacted quickly grabbing swords and armour and making for the doorway but most of the men just stared at him in confusion get out he barked gather your gear and leave the women he knew how quickly a thatched house could turn into an inferno hed burned enough of them in the past they might only have seconds fuck vettius was the first man to the door and he screamed and staggered backwards clutching in disbelief at the ragged gash in his belly he extended one hand towards his leader in a despairing plea for help before collapsing on his face in the dirty straw crespo stared at the dying man for a split second his mind racing given time they could cut through the walls but they didnt have time the flames had already spread across the entire roof and the hall had begun to fill with choking white smoke for the first time he felt panic the gods only knew what awaited them outside but better to go down fighting than to burn he made his decision out he repeated if we stay here were all dead a collective wail from the british women was followed by a rush towards the door a legionary took a cut at one of them as she ran by and she fell howling to the floor leave them crespo ordered swords and shields we go as one man and when were clear of the door we form testudo its our only chance he picked up a shield and hefted his gladius in his right hand he wasnt sure where it had all gone wrong but it had and now there was only one choice on my order now the little group burst from the doorway as the roof of the palace collapsed behind them but when he saw what awaited him crespo stumbled to a dazed halt behind a circle of spear points an unbroken ring of silent vengeful faces glistened in the dancing light of the flames shit he said as his nerve failed him and he fell to his knees he tried to manoeuvre the gladius so he could drive the point below his ribs but his hands were suddenly clumsy a spear shaft knocked the sword from his grasp and another smashed him into unconsciousness the ship should arrive tomorrow valerius told lunaris so make sure everyones accounted for with their equipment all present and correct we dont want you making a poor impression on your new tribune lunaris laughed like as not he wont know one end of a sword from the other how long before it sails again a couple of days maybe three lunaris nodded im sorry you wont be coming with us to mona valerius stared out across the river to the settlement on the south bank one thing ive learned lunaris is that you cant fight the fates when i came to britain i barely knew one end of a sword from the other but i think i became a good soldier maybe even a good officer part of being a good soldier is obeying orders theyve ordered me back so back ill go still id like to have fought alongside you he turned to the big man and offered his hand before lunaris had time to take it they heard a shout from the quayside and a legionary ran up to them sir youve to report to the procurator he said belatedly remembering to salute valerius frowned what does he want with me the iceni have risen maeve witnessed queen boudiccas terrible revenge one by one warriors nailed the men of crespos command to the doorposts along ventas main street with their arms and legs broken in a mockery of roman crucifixion crespo himself was last to be fixed they stripped him naked and carried him to the main gate as he struggled and protested pleading for a mercy he would never have given they stretched his arms brutally to left and right and when the carpenter hammered the first of the big iron nails through the palm of his right hand into the wooden boards of the gate he shrieked in agony and called out to mithras for aid by the time they had fixed his feet in similar fashion he was delirious with pain but still aware enough to understand what was happening boudicca stood before him as he hung from the gate with every sinew of his body reminding him of his torment when they brought the cudgels to break his bones she held up her hand to stop them she had a more appropriate refinement in mind for the man who had led the rape of banna and rosmerta he was very proud when he removed my daughters innocence remove his pride she ordered crespo was still conscious when the executioner approached with the gelding knife his screams split the night it was still not enough this place is a stain upon my honour and the honour of the iceni burn it and let the flames which consume venta be the start of a fire which cleanses all of britain as the town blazed and his men with it they pulled crespos broken body down and staked it out on the roadway outside the gate he still lived when the ironrimmed wheels of boudiccas chariot crunched across his bones but by the time the last warrior of her avenging army had passed over him the only evidence of his existence was a smear of blood and bone in the dirt catus decianus did not inspire confidence his long nose twitched as he studied the scroll pinned to the desk in front of him and a sheen of sweat glistened on a forehead creased by worry lines disdain for the world about him was carved into every line of his pasty underfed face he looked up as valerius entered but immediately resumed his reading of the document after a few moments he sighed inconvenient he said i beg your pardon sir i said this is terribly inconvenient you are verrens am i correct tribune gaius valerius verrens yes sir late of the twentieth legion and bound for rome the procurator emitted an audible sniff and his pained expression grew more pained still yes on the ship which should also have carried my report of the successful annexation of the iceni into the province of britain but that report cannot be sent now he paused not until this regrettable misunderstanding can be resolved valerius wasnt sure if hed heard correctly misunderstanding decianus peered at him with beady sharpset eyes of course i have here a request from colonia to provide reinforcements for the local militia it is the quaestor s belief that a section of the iceni have risen in armed insurrection against the empire this belief i am certain is based on rumour and speculation you served a recent posting in colonia i understand six months over the winter valerius agreed i found the quaestor to be most capable and not a man to be diverted by rumour and speculation it wasnt entirely true hed found petronius to be arrogant divisive and venal but he was also at the centre of a spy network which spread far up the east coast if those spies reported trouble valerius couldnt allow decianus to dismiss it which seemed to be his inclination i also received information of agitators working among the iceni which i passed on to the quaestor he added to reinforce his point the procurators lips compressed in a tight smile yet i myself spent time in the iceni capital not more than two weeks ago and found it peaceful and the people quiescent in any case our standing treaty with the iceni only allows them such weapons as are required to defend their borders only one in ten even owns a sword he ended triumphantly valerius knew that was true but treaties could be broken he could tell where the interview was going now he was to be part of an expedition against the iceni it was not a fight he would have chosen but it was a fight he was going to have if the rebellion existed nevertheless decianus continued i propose to send a force which i consider proportionate to the threat under the most senior commander available these are your orders he handed valerius the scroll he had been reading valerius hesitated his only independent command had been the first cohort on the winter road detail still he could hardly refuse he studied the orders which commanded him to march to colonia with all speed and deal with the situation as he saw fit which if he knew the army was as good an invitation to put his neck in a noose as hed ever seen it meant any decision was his and his alone any mistake would be his responsibility he pointed out the elementary error this doesnt say how many cohorts ill have under me cohorts i do not believe we need think in terms of cohorts decianus sniffed you will have one hundred and fifty men from the londinium garrison and such other troops as are on leave or in transit enough to provide a stiffening for the militia and stay the panic in the quaestor s heart until such time as the governor considers it necessary to move a vexillation of the ninth legion to colonia he smiled disdainfully you see verrens i take no chances the governor is informed a solution suggested and a reinforcement sent what more should i do sir with respect two hundred men is appropriate to the threat and as many as you will receive am i to understand that you are refusing this command valerius shook his head he could protest that a force of two hundred men was as much use for defending a place like colonia as two hundred sheep but the procurators mind was made up if the iceni came he would have to depend on falco and his veterans no sir i will accept the command but id like to request that the men of the twentieth who formed my escort accompany me decianus frowned and valerius continued quickly they know the area around colonia well and have worked with the militia there the procurator nodded reluctantly very well this interview is at an end so were not going to mona valerius shook his head no were going back to colonia lunaris sucked his teeth and looked longingly westwards over the rampart of the londinium wall mona could make a big difference those druids are troublemaking bastards thats true enough but if the iceni really have risen well be needed in colonia two hundred of us lunaris scoffed if nothings happened all well have done is waste caliga leather and if theyve really decided to try to kick us out falco will be glad to see us the duplicarius shrugged i suppose orders are orders the mules will miss us in mona though were marching at dawn have the men ready with these buggers lunaris nodded gloomily at a pair of garrison rats leaning against the parapet of the nearest watchtower by the time we get there ill be carrying them xxx three days later after a forced march of sixty miles valerius recognized the familiar low outline of camulodunums turf walls on the far horizon they were as impressive as any fortifications hed seen on the island yet he knew theyd been given up without a fight when claudiuss invasion force arrived he believed he understood why to properly defend walls of that scale would demand a garrison far beyond the capabilities of the trinovantes who had held camulodunum then even if they had possessed the will to fight for them on the way from londinium hed given much thought to the problems of defence and he had come to one devastating conclusion the town of colonia could not be held against any reasonablesized force by the veterans whose duty it was to protect it that conclusion was reinforced when he rode up the hill towards the familiar arch of the towns west gate with the two hundred weary men of his tiny command in tight formation behind him he noted again the enormous gaps in the walls and the warren of streets behind where an enemy could turn a flank or launch an attack from the rear he saw only one possibility to defend part of the town and it could only be considered as a last resort he thought he could rely on falco petronius and his council were likely to be a different matter the quaestor stood in the shadow of the arch along with half the town and the cheering began while the legionaries were still a hundred paces away valerius bit his lip in frustration a civic welcome was the last thing he needed horns blared and someone had brought out a drum that beat in time to the soldiers marching feet when he reached petronius and falco standing side by side a dozen yards in front of the crowd valerius could barely hear their greeting relief was written clearly on their faces you have come at last petroniuss narrow face wore a wide smile but it was strained and he had aged since valerius had last seen him the council has voted to select a fine bull to be sacrificed in your honour and to thank divine claudius for our salvation valerius exchanged glances with falco who had been straining for a glimpse of something in the far distance he shook his head imperceptibly and the older mans eyes widened i fear you may be premature sir he told the quaestor quietly we are all the procurator has seen fit to send you petronius looked as if he might faint and falco took valerius by the arm and whispered furiously this is all but we asked for four cohorts at least and cavalry fifteen hundred men what good is two hundred against the entire might of the iceni the cheers gradually subsided to a confused murmur as the crowd realized no legion followed valeriuss pathetic little band a male voice demanded to know what was happening and petronius glanced over his shoulder valerius saw that the quaestor was frightened in petronius that didnt surprise him but it was a shock to see his expression mirrored by falco who had fought his way across the tamesa and led the charge which had brought about caratacuss final defeat i need to know everything he said they met five minutes later in an anteroom of the basilica looking out over the forum from the open window valerius could see groups of veterans practising their swordplay while others watched shouting advice and laughing at their efforts and children waved short sticks to mimic their fathers and grandfathers petronius stood talking animatedly to a short sturdily built celt whose bristling grey moustache gave him the look of a surly dog otter this is celle petronius introduced the newcomer he makes what living he can hunting and fishing in the wetlands by the coast he is one of my informants and was able to approach close to the iceni camp where their queen invokes the spirit of the wolf the hare and the horse to preach painful death to all romans not close enough he admits to gain full knowledge of this boudiccas thoughts and strategies he aroused the suspicions of an iceni scout and was forced to kill him but close enough to gain worthwhile intelligence upon her strength valerius studied the man who looked out of place in a travelstained cloak and ragged trews against the stark cleanliness of the white walls can he be trusted petronius scowled as if his own loyalty had been questioned celle has no reason to love the iceni he said five years ago his children were taken as slaves and his wife killed when they raided his camp in some dispute over fishing rights he has never failed me he made a sign to celle who spat out an unbroken stream of sentences in a dialect valerius couldnt understand falco translated and his words fell into the silence like stones into a tomb he says you should know that the army of boudicca is reckoned to be fifty thousand strong fifty thousand warriors valerius felt the blood drain from his face it wasnt possible the entire iceni tribe numbered fewer than forty thousand even fielding every man and boy and arming them with scythes and hoes there could not be more than twentyfive thousand falco saw the disbelief on his face this is the message we sent to the procurator the catuvellauni and the trinovantes have rallied to boudiccas cause kings and princes chiefs nobles and warriors even the workmen from the fields and more arriving every day including from the brigantes in the north friendship apparently is less binding than the scent of loot now do you understand why we are afraid we asked catus decianus to send us enough soldiers to hold off the iceni until the governor could return to meet the threat instead he sent you the grizzled veteran smiled bitterly i am happy to see you again valerius but i would have preferred a more substantial gift the governor is not coming decianus will not disturb him falco grimaced and petroniuss face went even whiter if that were possible but why petronius asked my message was plain he does not believe you while petronius called a full meeting of the ordo and senior militia officers valerius walked a circuit of what remained of the walls with lunaris hed learned that only days before the council had belatedly agreed the city defences were more important than the feelings of the property developers who had torn down the walls to make way for their villas and gardens the duplicarius shook his head too late it would take a thousand men months to make this place defensible again wed have to tear down houses rebuild the walls and demolish every hut for two hundred paces to give ourselves a clear field of fire even then i dont think wed have enough men to defend a perimeter of this size valerius grunted agreement falco reckons he can scrape together two thousand of his veterans and a few hundred ablebodied civilians who will be more trouble than theyre worth bela has had his cavalry patrolling the north road but ive told him to pull back and form a screen ten miles north of here they should give us a reasonable amount of warning of any attack and when they withdraw it will give us five hundred more but i think theyll be more useful on horseback than manning a wall what about the signal station on the venta road they stay where they are and fight their way out at the first sign of trouble valerius said decisively we both know what that means valerius nodded he had just sentenced eight men to death the iceni would overwhelm them in minutes but the warning they gave could be decisive he tried to put the image of the disgruntled tungrian commander out of his mind but he was haunted by the legates words of a few months before there will be a day valerius when your soldiers are mere coins to be spent well the day had come sooner than hed believed possible how are the men our people gracilis luca paulus messor and the rest are good and the lads from londinium are prime soldiers but youve heard the stories that rubbish about the sea turning red and the statue on top of the temple falling over pushed over is more likely valerius said dismissively most of the local trinovantes may have disappeared to hide or join the rebellion but there are enough left to cause trouble it wouldnt have taken more than two men with a couple of ropes lunaris grinned youre right but you know what soldiers are like superstitious his hand rose to touch the amulet at his neck tell them what i said and the next time someone whispers in their ear have them arrested for spreading rumour and dissent its time lunaris reminded him yes its time they were too many even for the curia so colonias hundred leading citizens and a hundred more packed into the main meeting room of the temple precinct corvinus was there his dark eyes concerned and seeking out valerius didius the moneylender sleek and calculating but nervous for once and a dozen others he knew the men who had driven the citys development since claudius agreed its foundation and the men who had profited from it since perhaps a third of them were in their militia uniforms the rest in the purplestriped togas that marked their office valerius knew his message wouldnt be palatable for any of them i am going to give up the city the announcement was greeted with uproar men clamoured to be allowed to speak demanding precedence from petronius who sat slumped in his seat looking bewildered and defeated even the veterans conditioned to a lifetime of authority appeared close to mutiny and falco stood among them as grimfaced as any valerius raised his voice above the dissent there is no choice he said we cannot defend this city against fifty thousand warriors or even half that if the walls were unbroken i would not attempt it with the force we have you must prepare the old the sick and the women and children to leave at dawn tomorrow for londinium provide them with enough food and water for four days requisition every cart and carriage in the city but keep the baggage to a minimum lives are more valuable than treasure are we cowards that we flee before a rabble of celts whose arses we kicked twenty years ago the voice came from the far end of the room and valerius had to crane his neck to see who had spoken a gnarled greybearded farmer who had been a legionary officer and was now centurion of the second cohort of the militia not cowards marcus saecularis and i for one will not flee if we run they will be on our necks like a pack of jackals if we try to defend the city they will cut our little army into a hundred pieces and hunt us through the streets like rats what then it was falco valerius nodded acknowledgement he needed this mans help more than any other without falcos cooperation colonia was doomed there is a chance we can convince them to bypass colonia if we make a show of force in the right place and appear to have enough strength they will be wary the rebellion is in its infancy and its leaders need a quick victory to cement the loyalty of their followers they wont relish attacking what they believe is a full legion and if that doesnt work valerius allowed his eyes to wander over the crowd of faces so each man would believe he was speaking to him and him alone we will do what a legion does best he said and he saw falcos eyes flash with comprehension we will fight them on our ground and our terms when we receive word of the barbarians approach we will march out to meet them i intend to use the river in place of the walls we do not have our greatest strength is our unity and our discipline we will remind them of the price that must be paid for defying rome are there enough of us the militia commander asked less than three thousand against fifty thousand valerius hesitated unsure of his next words then a familiar hardedged voice from a few short weeks earlier gave him his answer if the militia cannot hold colonia its people do not deserve to keep it the words were met with a disbelieving silence he saw the shock on falcos face and a moment later a roar of fury filled the room a militia centurion surged towards him and was only held back from physical assault by two of his compatriots they hated him now but that was good if he could only channel that hatred against the iceni then perhaps they had a chance petronius called for order they did not like it but no one wanted a debate valerius carried the procurators authority and to disobey him meant mutiny still some argued against evacuation those who wanted to stay with their wives and children and defend what was theirs but they were in a minority everyone in the room knew of celts no longer in colonia who were now in the north sharpening their swords they remembered the humiliations that had been meted out to their neighbours fear of their return and valeriuss calm authority did the rest when the issue was settled he explained how the exodus must be organized who would lead the convoy who would command the escort how much baggage would be allowed when he had their agreement petronius issued his orders and they filed silently out of the room each man considering how he would tell his wife how much she would be able to carry and where he would bury what she could not as they were leaving valerius drew falco aside you were right he apologized we do not have enough men but that wasnt what they needed to hear falco studied him his expression thoughtful ive heard many calls to arms valerius but none quite so direct caligula could have learned much from you valerius smiled a doubleedged compliment if it was a compliment at all but he sensed no lasting damage had been done there is one thing you should know primus pilus he said formally when we have fought them and fought them again when their bodies lie in heaps before our swords but still they come at us then i will retire here to this temple precinct to make a last stand the priests will complain that it is sacrilege but i am a practical man and i believe i have the support of the gods we will stock the temple with what supplies and water we can if you or any of your men are isolated in the fighting make for the temple you will be among friends now we have much to do what followed was a night of chaos such as the province had never witnessed they poured into colonia in their thousands bewildered families torn from the security of their homes terrified of what might be to come rich or poor they were all the same class now homeless refugees fleeing before an avenging army which would show them no mercy of course there were not enough carts to take them all valerius ordered that those available be used to transport the youngest children the sick and the old who could hardly put one foot in front of the other but what mother would willingly be separated from her child what daughter from her aged father in the midst of the pandemonium he came across lunaris attempting to separate two women as they fought screaming and cursing for places on the transport for their children at another time valerius would have laughed at the look of bewilderment on the legionarys face what am i supposed to do with them lunaris demanded holding the pair at arms length as they tore at each others hair and ripped dresses from breast and shoulder throw them in the river valerius suggested he said it loud enough for the combatants to hear the real intent in his voice and the struggling subsided lunaris grinned and the two women separated still spitting at each other and retreated to opposite ends of the convoy valerius helped a blind man separated from his carer for the first time in ten years as he wandered along the line arms outstretched politely asking if anyone had seen julia a little later he witnessed two of colonias hardbitten prostitutes giving up the space they had paid for in gold to a distraught young mother with a squealing baby in her arms and a wideeyed snotnosed infant pulling at the skirts of each leg but he couldnt be everywhere in the first of many accidents a bewildered fiveyearold girl perched on the rim of an open wagon already doubly overburdened tumbled into the path of an ironshod wheel and shrieked as the bones of her legs were shattered they did what they could to comfort her but she died within minutes her eyes still wide with shock three hours after midnight luca one of the young legionaries who formed his escort called valerius forward to where an angry crowd had gathered by one of the carts whats happening here he demanded the wagon had a raised oilskin canvas secured so the contents were invisible but the body was settled low over the axles and it was clearly heavily loaded a bulky woman with her face hidden by a hood sat on the rim holding the reins luca shrugged at the suspicious faces around him they say somethings not right about this cart they asked the woman to take one of their children but she wont let them near it all she does is shake her head maybe shes a mute valerius studied the figure at the reins and noticed that her hands shook as she held the leather straps noticed something else too by marss sacred beard didnt he have enough to do he reached out and pulled back the hood to reveal bassus atilius one of colonias most successful merchants fat unshaven and glaring in a womans grey dress sickened valerius took the terrified trader by the neck and threw him on to the ground kill him the shout came from the rear of the crowd keep them back valerius ordered untying the straps on the wagon to reveal bassuss wife huddled among several large boxes he helped the woman down and picked up one of the boxes and tipped it over the side where it burst open to reveal dozens of pieces of fine copperware other boxes followed each filled with similar items including silver plate and ornaments bassus grovelled among them as his wife hid her face please they are everything i have i must save them valerius held up a sack such as a farmworker might use to carry his midday meal marvelling at the weight of it he looked inside to see hundreds of gold aurei winking back at him each coin glowing as if the owner spent long hours polishing them when he saw the sack bassus cried out kill him the voice repeated valerius drew his sword and stared in the direction of the voice now bassus cowered at his feet pleading for mercy if you want him dead kill him yourself a growl went up from the crowd but no man moved at least take his gold no we are not thieves do you want to sink as low as this man who would have sacrificed you and your children for a few pots and pans he looked out over them women and boys mostly but a few older militia men not many would meet his eyes his is the greed that is bringing the iceni to your door the kind of greed that does not know the meaning of the word enough he tossed the gold down at bassus where it landed with a hefty clink the trader grasped the sack to him luca find a place in the wagons for the woman then take this man to the bridge and set him over it well see how many gold pieces it takes to buy boudiccas mercy for the rest of the night the legionaries were thrown about like dry leaves in an autumn gale reassuring bullying and pleading sometimes lashing out with fist and boot until the first purple hint of dawn bruised the inkblack sky above the city and a semblance of order appeared from the mayhem bela the thracian cavalry commander appeared with thirty of his troopers who lined up on their big horses on each side of the convoy it would be a frustrating journey for the men restricted to the speed of the slowest ox cart but at least valerius thought it would spare their horses for what was to come fighting back exhaustion he walked along the line of carts checking everything was in its place and that hed dealt with all the tiny niggling dangerous problems which had arisen through the night a welldressed woman he thought might be petroniuss wife glared at him as he passed as if he was to blame for her plight but many thanked him and not just those he would necessarily have expected it from others still looked to him for some reassurance they wanted to know that they would be coming back that everything would be as it was before he smiled and nodded but it was a lie these women were leaving their lives behind along with their husbands and nothing would ever be the same again he watched a hundred last goodbyes longing kisses and unchecked tears heartbreaking pleas to be allowed to stay behind and brave whatever was to come together a father clutched his newborn babe to his breast until his wife took it from his arms for fear he would hurt it when the sun came up and he reached the front of the convoy where bela waited he knew the cries of the children would stay with him until he died the young thracian stood at his horses neck holding his burnished helmet carelessly in one hand his shaledark hair ruffled and untidy bela had the look of a young alexander and the confidence to match but his eyes were solemn and as valerius approached he sniffed the air the roman shot him a questioning look smoke bela explained but only the smoke of your cooking fires when they come the smoke will be different because they will burn everything valerius nodded your instructions are clear the cavalryman smiled of course i deliver my precious cargo and then return but not before making a personal visit to the procurator where you will forcefully express my concerns where i will forcefully express your concerns at the risk of my career and the other messages i ordered to be sent janos will carry your personal letter direct to the governor but it will take some days and i fear he is unlikely to be of help petur should reach the camp of the ninth by tonight if they have not already marched let us pray they have go then and may mars protect you bela took his hand and his gaze swept back over the milelong line of wagons yesterday we sacrificed a foal to heros the chief of our own gods it was a good sacrifice but i will accept any help i can get xxxi valerius watched the tail of the convoy lumber down the hill towards the gap in the ancient trinovante walls and the long journey to londinium when the road was finally empty he waited for a few moments before turning and walking slowly back through the arch into colonia will you inspect my men tribune falco stood on the main street outside the goldsmiths shop alongside corvinus normally a hundred people would be in this section even at this hour buying or selling or just looking now it was eerily silent an empty wicker birdcage rolled back and forth outside one of the other shops and the curtain flapped in an empty doorway it would be my privilege primus pilus valerius bowed and perhaps you would do me the honour of inspecting mine the militia commander looked pleased at the compliment strange that the years seemed to have dropped away from him during the long punishing night while the goldsmiths burden appeared to have doubled they walked towards the forum past luculluss townhouse and valerius remembered the day hed read his fathers letter pleading for his return to rome a shiver ran through him and he looked up at the sun rising strong and bright over the roof of the great temple it brought back memories of other suns fierce tuscan suns and suns glittering on the azure sea at neapolis the sun on his back when he had made love to his first woman and the sun that had highlighted the stark bones on his mothers face a week before she died there had been so many suns would this be his last falco said sadly my slaves buried the amphorae with my best wines in a pit outside the east gate i didnt have the heart to smash them and watch all those years of effort go to waste a pity you didnt arrive a few days earlier we could have given them the sendoff they deserved anything is better than leaving them for the celts corvinus said bitterly and valerius wondered what hed done with the accumulated treasures and profits of nine years buried most likely somewhere safe where he could recover them if he realized hed not seen the goldsmiths wife among the women in the carts but then there had been so many they reached the temple precinct where lunaris and the soldiers from the londinium garrison were already working to reinforce the main gateway i want every spare weapon brought here spears swords bows even stones anything that can stop a man petronius has the key to the armoury falco pointed out valerius called for his clerk he scrawled something quickly on a wax tablet and handed it to the wine merchant this is my order to open the armoury and empty it if he refuses or attempts to delay break down the doors lunaris he roared the big man laid down the baulk of timber he was carrying towards the gate and jogged across to them sir he acknowledged his broad face shining with sweat water lunaris frowned theres a well in the far corner and a tank in one of the buildings on the north side thats fed by a bucket chain from the river only mithras knows how long we can depend on them not for long get some men and gather every amphora you can find i need them filled and sealed and then stored inside the temple with a guard over them food too have every house searched and what food there is brought here he studied the sun again its heat was already making the redtiled roofs of the temple complex shimmer and make sure every man has a full water skin i dont mind if they die but i dont want them dying of thirst he saw lunaris hesitate what the temple weve been having a problem with the priests they dont want to let us near the place and the mules are frightened they offend the god we cant even get into the offices and stores he nodded to the buildings of the east range where two whiterobed men stood outside a doorway watching the soldiers suspiciously something else he ought to have thought of valerius realized he should have insisted the augurs and their masters were evacuated with the convoy leave the priests to me he said and marched off towards them lunaris grinned suddenly he felt a little sorry for the bloodsucking chicken murderers whod been making his life difficult all morning valerius recognized the younger priest as the augur who had refused payment for telling his future seven months earlier what was it the man had said you have much to gain but more to lose if you continue along the road you have chosen well he had gained maeve and then lost her he had followed his road here where there was more to lose still he knew the perils of meddling with the imperial cult retribution was more likely to be earthly than divine and the punishments were very specific very painful and very permanent but he had a more immediate concern he had been ordered to defend colonia and defend it he would even if it was only this small portion of it at any cost you are in charge of the temple he asked the older of the two a bulky man with thinning fair hair and frightened eyes that never stayed still marcus agrippa the priest said as if his name should be familiar i have responsibility for the temple of divine claudius and i must protest at the highhanded manner in which your soldiers are desecrating this sacred ground i intend to write to rome sir he blustered and i will mention your name valerius smiled coldly and looked around to where lunaris was now jogging up the temple steps with an amphora under each arm the younger priest recognized the dangerous change in the atmosphere and stepped away from his colleague by order of the governor this temple and everything and everyone in it are now under military authority he had no orders from the governor but compared with sacrilege it seemed a minor offence im sure divine claudius as a military man will understand you are obstructing a vital military operation and under military law may be subject to summary justice whats inside here he pushed between the two men and shook the door which was solid and obviously locked that is a private area the older priest cried there is nothing of military value there let me be the judge of that valerius put his foot to the wooden panel and the lock snapped allowing the door to swing open he looked inside you will take every piece of furniture and every carpet every statue and every wall hanging and carry them to the temple tell the tall soldier there that i want the area between the columns fortified around the area of the pronaos but this is the priest protested valerius very deliberately slid his sword from its scabbard the gladius came free with an ominous whisper and the edge glinted blue in the morning sunlight perhaps you did not understand the meaning of summary justice the priests mouth dropped open and he scuttled through the door from where there came the satisfying sounds of furniture scraping on the mosaic floor what are you waiting for he growled at the young augur i wondered where i could find a sword sir the boy said nervously eyeing the gladius valerius almost laughed but he knew that would have shamed the lad courage could be found in the most unlikely places and he had need of all the courage he could get he had another warrior well fabius sir the boy volunteered well fabius when youve finished here talk to lunaris at the temple tell him i said to station you in the pronaos he walked the seventy paces back to the temple studying his surroundings seeking out anything that could give the defenders an advantage or any vulnerable point where the enemy could gain one in their turn the front wall with the gateway in the centre was the most obvious weakness and therefore the most likely place the britons would attack so when the time came if he was still alive that was where he would place his strongest force and he would use that wall to wear them down he would keep a strong reserve he shook his head how could he use a word like strong in a situation like this as strong as he could afford then by the temple steps ready to react if the barbarians broke through anywhere yes he was satisfied he could make them pay dearly for the front wall but there were four walls what about the east west and north he considered the east first sturdy singlestorey offices and storerooms beneath a tiled roof that pitched upwards and ended where it met the wall which on the sheer outer face was higher by far than the combined height of two men the north he realized there was a gap in his knowledge and abruptly changed direction and marched out of the front gate to make a circuit of the outer walls the inner wall was a continuation of the covered walkway which also included the west side of the precinct but outside he noted with satisfaction it backed directly on to the slope which fell away to the flat meadows that edged the river an enemy without siege equipment would have to be very determined to climb the slope and then take on a surface without the slightest hold for hand or foot he gazed down towards the meadow where the thick sweet grass ended so abruptly against the silver ribbon of the water that was the key this was an enemy without climbing ladders and siege towers or the knowledge to manufacture them an enemy who favoured frontal attack above all else yes it would do but when he rounded the corner he discovered something that wouldnt do at all along the outer west wall an almost continuous line of crude leanto shacks had been built which on closer inspection were being used to store building materials any of them could make a ready platform for an enemy assault he stopped at the gate on his way back to the temple where gracilis the twentieths hardcase wolf hunter from the campanian mountains was supervising the strengthening of the defences take some men and tear down the huts along the west wall and while youre at it clear everything for a javelin throw in front of this gate i want a killing ground from there to about there gracilis grinned and saluted like all legionaries the only thing he liked better than fighting and drinking was destroying someone elses property should we burn them sir he said hopefully valerius shook his head no point in creating smoke to warn the enemy just break them up and add them to the barriers a line of legionaries passed water jars into the interior of the temple as lunaris watched the final pieces of the barricade around the pronaos being put into place between the massive pillars the pronaos formed the outer area of the temple and behind it lay the cella the inner sanctum of the cult of claudius kind of you to send me the reinforcements the big man said valerius was puzzled until lunaris pointed to where fabius peered from behind a padded couch propped against one of the columns someone had provided him with a helmet several sizes too large and it sat on his head like a cooking pot you may thank me for him later lunaris looked thoughtful maybe they wont come valerius stood back as one of his men carelessly threw a bust of the emperor augustus on to the top of the barricade in that case you can join me in the sack when they throw me into the tiber he looked up at the temple above them do we have any archers not among our lot that i know of a few of the veterans may be hunters and ive seen some of the auxiliary cavalry practising with bows why valerius pointed to the temple roof if we can get a dozen men up there they could cover the whole perimeter i dont see how the britons can make a direct assault anywhere but the southern wall but he was interrupted by a shout from the direction of the gate and turned to see falco at the head of a line of veteran militia each with a bundle of pila in his arms the wine merchants round face glowed pink with indignation enough to supply an army he fumed that damned man enough spears for every soldier and this is whats left shields and swords too bright as when they were forged and for years we have made do with and how is our good quaestor valerius asked mildly will he take his place in the line vanished he hasnt been seen since the meeting just as well if i could lay my hands on him hed wish he was with the rebels i doubt well miss his presence come we need a stockpile of spears thirty paces behind the south wall and another by the steps falco looked at the bustle of preparations going on around him so you mean to defend the temple i thought no we will fight them first beyond the walls i am sorry valerius apologized i should have kept you better informed the wine merchant shook his head the last of the militia wont come in from the outlying farms for a few hours yet time enough then we would have heard from the cavalry pickets if there was any immediate threat we will place any civilians who are willing to fight here in the temple with a stiffening of my men i want only hardened soldiers in our battle line valerius imagined the terrified merchants craftsmen and servants facing battlecrazed british champions the bloody chaos of a splintered shield wall i doubt theyd stand for long and who could blame them if the britons do not take fright at the sight of us falco laughed that was a pretty fantasy you spun for the council i almost believed it myself they walked from the temple precinct back to where the ground fell away towards the river below them was the meadow where valerius had inspected falcos militia during his first week in colonia it seemed a lifetime ago the river encircled it in a long curve wide and deep enough thanks to the recent rains to provide an effective barrier against an advancing enemy with a need to move fast i will burn the bridges all but one he pointed to the main crossing that carried the road from colonia north to venta that will be our bait they are fighters the britons but not soldiers they will be drawn to the bridge because behind the bridge is where we will make our stand and their first instinct will be to annihilate us utterly but what if valerius understood his plans weakness the cavalry will patrol the near bank to ensure we are informed of any general crossing but i do not think it will happen if they want colonia they must destroy us falco by offering ourselves to boudicca we can buy enough time for paulinus to countermarch his legions from mona failing that the ninth is only five days away in lindum its possible they are already on their way to join us if we cannot save colonia at least we may be able to win time for londinium a shout from one of the legionaries working on the temple defences interrupted them valerius instinctively turned to the northeast and saw the flare as a beacon blazed at the signal tower on the ridge he knew the men in the tower would also be straining their eyes to the north and that twenty miles away on the far horizon they could see a tiny echo of the flame they had just lit it would only be seconds before it was extinguished he was sure but it had done its job he closed his eyes and said a silent prayer for the tungrian auxiliaries at the station on the venta road who had stayed at their posts to the end they would not be the last she is coming then falco said solemnly did you ever doubt it the older man shook his head at least the women and children are safe bela rode in an hour later slumped over the neck of a blown horse near crippled by the vivid red slash where a sword had sliced its haunches and groaning with the agony of an iron spear point still embedded in his ribs two of the thracians held their commander upright in the saddle long enough for him to make his report to valerius cowards they ambushed us in a wood belas face shone with sweat and he flinched with the pain of each word they blocked the way with a felled tree and were on both sides of the road spears arrows and slings out of hiding and we had no reply at first our women stayed among the wagons but what could they do when one after the other they saw their little ones spitted by arrows or spears in their terror they sought any way out of the trap but there was no way we his body shuddered at the memory we could hear the screams from among the trees he raised his head to look valerius in the eye they will have spared none valerius thought of all the escapees he had helped into the wagons less than twelve hours before the sad grateful smiles on the faces of mothers torn between the hurt of being separated from their husbands and gratitude that at least their children would be safe he wondered about the fate of the blind old man and the whores who had given up their places in the cart were they picked off one by one by their faceless enemy did they rush into the woods to be butchered it didnt matter he had failed them all this was his fault in his arrogance and his pride but there were things he needed to know before he could mourn them bela who were they and how many were there was it possible boudicca had already bypassed colonia and was making for londinium the thracian was on the point of collapse but this was no time for pity he had to know he laid a hand on belas shoulder and felt the two men holding him stiffen protectively tell me he demanded a few hundred no more the cavalryman coughed and a thin line of blood ran from the corner of his lip to his chin locals i think scum taking advantage of the chaos and lured by the prospect of blood and gold his head slumped forward and valerius released him in a flat voice the trooper on belas left said we charged them six times and six times they repulsed us we are all that is left he would have stayed and died with the rest if we had not carried him away i know valerius said patting him gently on the arm take him to the infirmary and get some rest say nothing of this to anyone he sent for falco who read the look on his face and turned pale all he asked quietly valerius nodded the thracians did what they could but there were not enough of them falco closed his eyes and swayed on his feet and valerius knew he was thinking of his plump wife as courageous as any soldier as she sat stiff and erect with their nineyearold son in the first wagon but he could not be allowed to think for too long will your men fight better for knowing or not knowing the wine merchants eyes snapped open and his nostrils flared you forget yourself tribune he rasped and valerius had a glimpse of the old falco who had terrorized the twentieth legion for two decades the colonia militia will fight and that is all you need to know i need them to fight with fire in their bellies not tears in their eyes valerius kept his voice hard this man was his friend but he could not afford to show weakness if i can fight with both they can fight with both falco said fiercely the answer is that i have served with these men for a lifetime they are my comrades and they deserve to know the veterans of the colonia militia will stand they will fight and they will die tribune and you will go on your knees and seek my forgiveness before the end he turned and walked stiffly away an old man carrying all the burdens of a life on the march on his shoulders in a single moment xxxii late in the afternoon valerius gathered his officers in the long room in the temples east wing the one with the painting of claudius accepting the surrender of britain he doubted whether they saw the irony of it what wouldnt he give now for even one of those four legions displayed there on the wall their armour and their spear points glinting with a full legion at his back he would have marched northwards to meet boudicca and left the rebellion stillborn her army either shattered or so mauled that she would have no choice but to turn back and regroup but he didnt have a full legion he had two thousand of falcos veterans the two hundred men he had brought from londinium and a few hundred of belas cavalry the young thracian lay back stiffly on a padded couch recovered from the temples barricade with his chest heavily bandaged and his eyes fever bright with whatever drug hed been given to ease the pain he had insisted on attending the final briefing even though he could barely stand falco stood among his cohort commanders with his face set in a mask of grim intent and refused to meet valeriuss eyes the men surrounding him took their mood from their leader but there were those who couldnt hide the signs of their grief or their nervousness he searched for any other suggestion of weakness but found none these men still had their pride even though time had marked them as it had marked the uniforms they wore he knew some resented his youth but with falcos support he had no doubt they would accept his authority lunaris leaned against the side wall his tall frame relaxed and his face expressionless i have had word from our scouts valeriuss voice silenced the subdued murmurs if the britons march hard their vanguard will be here well before dawn it is difficult for one man to judge but the trooper who carried the message believes that petroniuss spy did not exaggerate their strength he paused and waited to see if any of them reacted to that terrible truth there were no doubts now they would be enormously outnumbered yet any man who has studied history knows that sheer numbers need not guarantee the outcome of a battle alexander had only half as many troops as the persian darius when he triumphed at issus caesar himself defeated pompey the great at pharsalus when he was outnumbered by more than two to one not twenty to one though valerius was surprised at the intervention from corvinus whose support he had assumed no he admitted not twenty to one but these were soldiers fighting soldiers we are soldiers fighting barbarian warriors does any man here doubt that ten legionaries are worth a hundred of these britons no at least half of them growled the reply and valerius smiled two to one then to a man they laughed even falco he allowed them their moment and then continued seriously i do not intend us to fight fifty thousand or even ten thousand we will burn every bridge but one and the rebels will be drawn to the remaining crossing like wasps to a rotting peach only a few thousand will be able to cross at one time and those thousands will die before our swords he didnt allow any arrogance to creep into his voice these men were not fools no i do not expect to win he answered their unspoken question i am no caesar or alexander and there are too many of them even a veterans arm must tire we will bleed just as they do that is why i have fortified the temple at the last we will withdraw here and here we will die they all knew it no one needed to say it why not fight from the temple in the first place corvinus demanded and was rewarded with a rumble of support with close to three thousand men and enough food and water we could hold the grounds for a month valerius shook his head and watch boudicca burn your city to the ground around you she will burn it in any case yes but she wont just leave a few thousand warriors to starve us out and march on londinium with her army intact if they are fifty thousand strong now how many will rally to their cause if they destroy all that is best of roman britain a hundred thousand perhaps more enough even to overwhelm paulinus and his force it would be the end of the province we cannot allow that by forcing her to do battle we have the opportunity to tear the heart from the rebel army here at colonia why do we exist if not to fight corvinus falco agreed his voice was tight with emotion were all those days on the exercise ground just for sweat no i have lost everything i loved today and i will not watch idly as the woman responsible marches past to bring the pain i feel to thousands more valerius knew falcos was the decisive opinion time was running out there could be no more debate send engineers to burn the bridges prepare your cohorts we will move into position before dark he had deliberated long and hard whether it was better to subject the veterans to a night in the open and the stiffening of ageing limbs or risk the confusion of deploying in the darkness an hour or two before dawn bela the cavalry commander raised his head with a grimace of pain pull your horse soldiers back they can do no more now as the officers filed out he called lunaris across i want you in the temple and you are promoted to decurion the big legionary opened his mouth to protest but valerius raised a hand no arguments i need a man i can trust in command of the place where we will make our stand we dont know how things will be when we fight our way back here he smiled sadly at least with you in command i know i will have somewhere to run as dusk fell he stood by colonias north gate listening to the evening sounds and staring north it was a blessing to have time to stop and think after a day of constant decision the night was warm and the air still and pairs of bats chased unseen insects between the buildings and the trees down by the river he heard the unmistakable shriek of an owl and felt a sudden deep melancholy where was she now he remembered the sweet scent of her silken hair and the softness of her flesh the tenderness of lips he had never had the opportunity to kiss often enough and dark eyes that flashed like wildfire the wonder of a knowing like no other she would support the rebellion he guessed her fathers death had given her enough reason to hate but would she join it no cearan would keep her safe honest dependable cearan who would now be torn between his duty to his queen and his determination to prevent his people from suffering how different things would have been if he had taken the throne for himself with a conscious effort he put the iceni nobleman from his mind this was no time to be feeling sympathy for a warrior he might face on the battlefield in a few hours had he done enough that was the question he must ask himself was there any detail however small he had not considered that might save one legionarys life or cost one of boudiccas warriors theirs he felt a twinge of doubt boring into his left temple like a carpenters drill doubts of course he had doubts even caesar must have had doubts on the night before a decisive battle but like caesar he had to hide his doubts from everyone he could have withdrawn the veterans back to londinium with the convoy of women and children and saved thousands of innocent lives it would have cost him his career and his honour but that would have been a small price to pay was that why he didnt do it to save his honour he shook his head no boudicca had to be stopped or at the very least tested if he could stop her here or even make her check for a day londinium might be saved and with it the entire province he was right to fight here right to leave the town and the temple and make her attack him on his own ground and his own terms he looked at the sky the light was dying soon the sound of marching feet on the metalled road behind him echoed from the houses lining the street iron nails crunching on the compacted surface he turned to watch them pass the veterans of colonia each one a son of empire first falco at the head of his command his sturdy figure hidden beneath a scarlet cloak and his eyes lost in the shadow of his helmet brim at the last moment the proud head turned and the chin lifted and the old soldier gave valerius a nod that told him more than any words he answered the gesture with a salute his fist clashing against his armour and he saw falco smile behind their standardbearers five militia cohorts followed him parading down the slope with their pila on their shoulders and a precision that would have graced an emperors triumph each of them had lost a loved one today and he felt shame that hed believed they would be diminished by it everything about the way they marched could be encapsulated in a single word resolve behind the veterans came the bulk of the men he had brought from londinium minus the fifty who remained with lunaris at the temple complex to strengthen the garrison of civilian volunteers they must be wondering what gods had brought them to this place and this fate when they could still be back in their barracks and what of himself did neptune laugh when he called up the storm that delayed the ship carrying his replacement if things had been different he would have been halfway home by now and maeve apart would he have given the island another thought he followed in the columns wake as falco dispersed his men and then wrapped his cloak around him and lay down among the londinium vexillation on the damp grass beside gracilis who had marched with him all the way from glevum there had never been much likelihood he would sleep but his choice of partner guaranteed wakefulness the campanian muttered unintelligibly through clenched teeth and from time to time he cried out as if he were already fighting the battle that would come in the morning eventually valerius could take no more and wandered in the dark down towards the bridge the last of belas saddleweary cavalry troops rode across from the north bank as he reached it guided by the torches of two of falcos veterans the units commander rode with his head bowed and looked to be almost asleep in his saddle what is the latest news of the rebels valerius reached up and shook the riders arm taking in the rank scent of hardridden horse the eyes snapped open and the man stared down at him he had been one of those who had helped rescue maeve from crespo but for a few seconds there was no recognition in his eyes the rebels valerius repeated when we left them they were six miles away beyond the ridge yonder i think we were on the armys right flank but it was impossible to say for certain they are like a swarm of bees just when you think you understand their route and their purpose a section will break away for no good reason and march off in a completely different direction we lost two good men that way trapped when they got too close their numbers the cavalryman shook his head i can give you no numbers all i can say is they are too many valerius frowned insubordination or just plain truth the horse shook its head spraying him with sweat and he caught the bridle to steady it the troop commander leaned low to retrieve his reins so there could be no mistaking his whispered words take your little army away tribune if you stand against them they will crush you into the dust and not even notice valerius looked round to see if anyone else had heard a man could be whipped for saying such things he said the thracian smiled wearily a man does not need to fear the whip when he will be dead tomorrow will you fight that is what you romans pay us for then take your troop and spread them out along the bank to the east get what rest you can but i need to know if the enemy plans a crossing elsewhere wait until an hour past first light and return here bela will have further orders for you the cavalryman held out his hand matykas decurion of the first squadron it was good advice tribune at least youre a roman worth dying beside a few minutes after the thracians had ridden away valerius noticed a glow in the sky above the ridge as he puzzled over it falco joined him at the bridge the rebels the militia commander asked perhaps theyve camped for the night a small cooking fire for a large army valerius grunted noncommittally he was remembering the two lost thracian cavalrymen and the tales he had heard of the wicker men the great humanshaped baskets caesar had written of into which the celts threw their sacrifices to be burned alive he hoped the two troopers were already dead they waited and valerius knew without looking round that every eye in the meadow by the river was focused on the ridge to the north there a voice cried the first was to the east just a dot of flame that as they watched flared into something much larger a moment later it was followed by a second further west this time and a third lower down the slope within minutes the dark blanket of the slope was dotted with flames like fireflies on a neapolitan night theyre burning the farms falco said unnecessarily valerius didnt reply but kept his eye on one particular spark at the top of the slope and to his left where luculluss farm maeves home was blazing the fact that it now belonged to petronius and had been stripped of everything she owned provided only a small consolation thank you falco said suddenly valerius looked at him in surprise and shook his head you have nothing to thank me for if i had done things differently perhaps he thought again of the scared faces and the crying children whats done is done the militia commander said if they had stayed they would have died in any case you came to our aid when no one else would help us catus decianus he spat set a flame to a tinderdry thicket and left his people to burn paulinus too where is our governor when we need him or the ninth legion who could have been here now if our warnings had been heeded they thought we were just panicking old men but you came valerius and even when you saw your commission was impossible you stayed we are grateful i have a desertion to report he said before valerius could reply corvinus the armourer he shook his head sadly one of our bravest and best it is hard to believe valerius remembered the goldsmiths nervous manner earlier in the day or was it yesterday in any case he couldnt find the anger or the outrage befitting a commander who had been betrayed how much difference would one man make can you blame him falco looked at him seriously we are soldiers tribune we fought together in the legions and sweated together in the militia when the people of colonia laughed at us as we exercised with our rusty swords we ignored them because it was our duty we may be old men but we still believe in duty and comradeship and sacrifice so yes i blame corvinus though he is my friend and if he is caught i will nail him to a cross though he is my friend if at the end all i can do is die together with these men i will count it a privilege he turned away but valerius called him back and held out his hand i too will count it a privilege as falco returned to his veterans valeriuss eyes were drawn back to the hillside where luculluss farm still burned and boudiccas horde gathered in the darkness xxxiii a dull hint of ochre on the far horizon was the first evidence of the new day and with it came a subdued murmur that seemed to shiver in the air and which puzzled valerius until he recalled the words of the thracian cavalryman on the bridge bees he had said they are like a swarm of bees and that was it the sound which grew in volume with each passing minute resembled an enormous beehive unseen but omnipresent a danger but not yet dangerous then beginning in the east second by second and yard by yard the darkened slope opposite was illuminated as the sun rose gently from the far end of the valley between colonia and the ridge and on the slope they saw their deaths each of them had heard the figure of fifty thousand but it was just that a figure now they saw the reality and their minds rebelled against the evidence of their eyes boudiccas host covered the rise like a vast living blanket of multicoloured plaid and still they came in their multitudes tribes and their subtribes and their clans each identified by its brightly coloured banner and led by a chief on horseback or a warlord in one of the small twowheeled chariots of the britons valerius studied them attempting to discern some pattern or guiding mind but he couldnt tell one tribe from another in the shifting throng the iceni must be a force among them with their wronged queen somewhere at the centre of that great mass the trinovantes come to regain their homes and their land and the catuvellauni to avenge the insults of a decade men of the brigantes and the other northern tribes sickened by cartimanduas betrayal of caratacus and inevitably given these numbers even from romes allies the atrebates and the cantiaci drawn by the scent of blood and loot like carrion birds to a new kill through them and around them wove hundreds more chariots carrying the halfnaked champions who would take their place at the front of the battle line in the position of greatest danger most of the warriors though were on foot trudging through the meadows and the fields with their shields on their shoulders weary now after their long march from venta but still eager many would be trained fighters armed with the best their people could provide but more would be the farmers tradesfolk and servants who had picked up anything with an edge or a weight that would kill the hated enemy all had hungered for seventeen long years for the chance to drive the romans from their lands rest could wait they would be fearful because there could be no turning back but that would only make their hate stronger and more dangerous among them loped the huge attack dogs trained to tear out an enemys throat with a single bite behind them each identified by a single column of smoke lay the way posts of their coming the villas and farms the veterans and the settlers who followed them had taken years to build now nothing but smouldering rubble the militiamen watched with disbelief as a constant dark stream of humanity flowed upriver from the coast out of the woods and over the ridge to swell the numbers opposite them this was not an army it was a nation on the move valerius attempted to study the enemy with a detached soldiers interest but soon he felt his mind begin to vibrate and his ears fill with a pounding he recognized as the first signs of panic despite the coolness of the morning a trickle of sweat ran slickly down his spine further along the line he heard a man vomit and another mutter a low prayer to a god who was not listening nothing in his imagination had prepared him for this all his plans and stratagems were shown up for what they were pointless diversions which would no more harm this enemy than a flea on an elephants back he took a deep breath and scanned the slope again but could still find no apparent sign of organization or leadership the first britons halted a quarter of a mile north of the river not through fear but through confusion and suspicion he knew what they were seeing and he could understand the reaction they would have expected the veterans to defend the city or to retreat with their loved ones and their possessions along the londinium road instead they were confronted by this tiny force like a sickly lamb staked out to trap a marauding wolf and they wondered where the net was primus pilus falco trotted from his position in the centre of the line to where valerius stood on the left sir he saluted the militia commanders face was the colour of weekold ash but his eyes held a glint of iron and his features were set and determined march the first cohort forward to within forty paces of the bridge and keep the others in station he had formed his force into three strengthened cohorts of just over six hundred men each now those cohorts marched in lines two hundred legionaries wide and three deep one behind the other towards the bridge and he strode at their side the gap between each cohort was ten paces it was the standard deep defensive formation of the legion if on a smaller scale it had advantages and disadvantages but his choice of battlefield suited it as long as conditions didnt change the short advance brought a concerted growl from the mass across the river but still there was no general movement the bridge was the key and the river the bridge stood less than a spears throw to his front now with the road from colonia to venta curving from the left over the meadow towards it then continuing across to disappear among the massed ranks on the north bank it was a sturdy structure built of oak seven or eight paces in width and surfaced with thick planking a wooden rail had been added at waist height on each side to prevent the unwary from falling into the water ten feet below he walked forward until he could study the river keeping a wary eye for any enemy spearmen close enough to do him harm it wasnt wide he could toss a stone across it without any great effort but it was deep and here and for as far as he could see the banks were steep and overgrown with trees and thorn bushes making them an obstacle even if the water itself could be crossed the line of flotsam told him the spate level of the past two days was falling but it was still too deep and the current too fast for a fording to be attempted with any likelihood of success of course it could be done especially to the west where the river narrowed but it would take time that was why he had given her the bridge look falco pointed to the ridge where a line of chariots flanked by horsemen cut their way diagonally through the crowd they came at a steady trot taking no account of those who stood in their way and gradually word spread of their progress and the cheering began fifty thousand voices rose in acclamation swords spears and fists clashed against wooden shields with a crash to rival a thunderstorm and a hundred of the britons animalheaded horns joined the clamour she was here the leading chariot burst clear of the mass of warriors and reined to a halt opposite valerius quickly followed by the others it was too far away to be certain but the roman had an impression of hair the colour of burnished copper and a long skirt of azurite blue she waited allowing the cheering to build and standing in front of the pathetically thin ranks of the leading cohort valerius sensed her scrutiny he remembered the day below ventas walls and the impression of power she had given he sensed she was studying him now and for some reason he tensed as if he were trying to stop her from stealing his soul minutes passed and the feeling of being dissected from within grew almost unbearable his legs told him to walk away and he turned to find falco at his side i dont think they will want to talk the wine merchant was forced to shout to be heard above the noise valerius almost laughed before a battle the celtic champions were always willing to challenge a rival leader but he agreed it was unlikely to happen today a pity he said i could have used the exercise and it would have eaten up a little more time how are the men nervous but not afraid they wish it would begin valerius looked across the river to where the british leaders were holding some kind of discussion it will be soon enough as he said the words he saw a spear raised above the lead chariot and a ripple ran through the barbarian ranks like the wind rustling through a field of ripening corn a moment later the first of the champions appeared big men in the prime of life naked to the waist and of proud bearing with their hair limed and spiked to make them seem taller they carried long swords or irontipped spears and their oval shields were brightly painted with the emblems of their tribes or their clan they were the elite of their people bred to war and eager for the fight for years they had been forced to accept the bitter taste of subjugation and a place at the plough or in the field but their elders men who had last fought the romans on the tamesa had kept the old traditions alive trained in secret in the lonely places their conquerors never visited they had honed their skills and worked their muscles waiting for the day now the day had come valerius and falco rejoined the militia the wine merchant taking his place behind the front rank of the lead cohort and valerius continuing to the rear from where he would conduct the battle as he passed through the ranks he had a word of encouragement for every man he knew and many he didnt and they smiled momentarily before their faces resumed the mask of grim concentration that marked a battleready legionary he remembered the first time he had seen these men on the day he had inspected them on this very field he and lunaris had laughed at their ancient weapons and worn uniforms their pot bellies and the scrawny arms that looked as if they could barely carry a spear let alone throw it the faces ran through his mind old marcus saecularis the sheep farmer in the centre of the front rank with the horsehair of his crested helmet announcing his rank to any enemy didius scratching his nose distractedly at the head of his century who would lend money to any man as long as the rate of return was high enough but whose last act before donning his armour had been to annul each and every debt bearded octavian named for an emperor who had stood in the line against lunaris and his legionaries and had taught them a lesson in humility and corvinus who had never struck him as a coward but whose position with the fourth century of the second cohort was left unfilled where was he now when his comrades were about to theyre coming strange that the pulsating crash of sword against shield had calmed him to the point where he could watch without emotion the british champions sprint in a great surging crowd towards the bridge thousands of them across a front of almost a mile each racing to be first to reach the romans on the far side of that narrow barrier as they advanced and the mass of warriors began to take on individual identity he felt his heartbeat increase and his breathing deepen spears he roared each man had two of the ironpointed pila embedded in the soft grass at his side and a further pair in reserve in the space between the cohorts now they chose one and hefted it in their right fists balancing the weapon for the cast the first of the champions were still a hundred paces from the bridge good they would be the fastest the strongest and the bravest he saw that many of them had thrown away their shields in their eagerness and their momentum was taking them ahead of their rivals he counted down in his head ten seconds at most until they reached the bridge then two more heartbeats and ready bare feet thundering on wooden planking two one now throw four hundred javelins hissed through the still air for a flight that lasted a split second the hands that held the spears might be wrinkled and the arms might have lost the awesome power of a quarter of a century before but they could still throw and at forty paces the target was unmissable more than two hundred warriors had crowded on to the bridge eager to be the first to strike a blow against the romans instead they were the first to die heavy spears capable of punching through light armour slammed the champions in the forefront of the attack back against those behind as they took the points in chest belly or throat valerius had known some of the precious weapons would be wasted but he had to be certain the entire bridge must be covered in that first cast falco had snorted disdainfully and pledged his fortune on it and the wine merchant was as good as his word only a handful of the men on the wooden planking survived the rain of spears and most of those were wounded or disabled the others were pinned by one two or even three of the weighted pila already two hundred bodies writhed and groaned and stained the boards of the narrow bridge with their blood but behind them came thousands more ready valerius was well pleased with the result of the first throw every warrior now attempting to cross would be impeded by the bodies of the men who had preceded them he waited until the first of the second surge of warriors stepped on to the dirt of the south bank throw with each cast another few hundred joined the corpses on the bridge floor until a literal wall of dead and dying obstructed the attack in their fury those who came behind frantically bundled the bodies of brothers friends comrades and rivals over the barriers and into the river in an attempt to clear a path they clawed their way forward snarling like attack dogs only to die in their turn second cohort to the front in a carefully choreographed movement the cohort behind stepped forward to take the place of those who had exhausted their supply of spears ready throw ready throw third cohort to the front ready throw it could not last he knew it could not last inch by inch the britons edged their way across the barrier of their dead they were the invincibles but even invincibles would use a shield if it was the only way to survive this slaughter as the veterans arms tired the volleys of spears became more ragged allowing still more to cross a dozen turned into a hundred and a hundred into two soon valerius knew unless he stopped them hundreds would turn into thousands shields up draw your gladii form line forward it took time too much time the respite from the spears had given another four or five hundred a chance to cross and still more were crowding behind them hampered but not halted by the dead and dying now the cohorts deployed in single line each six hundred strong and as they marched towards the bridge he saw with relief that they still overlapped the british bridgehead but only just where were belas cavalrymen he matched step with the outer man of the second cohort and turned to grin encouragement it was one of the younger soldiers from the londinium garrison he tried to remember his name but couldnt only that he should have been back in barracks baking bread for his century the boy grinned back and in the same instant his right eye exploded like an overripe plum and he dropped to the ground as if he were a sack of river sand shit valerius looked up to see where the missile had come from but a howl announced that the britons who had survived the bridge were halfway across the open ground and about to fall on the front rank of the roman battle line so far the veterans casualties had been light now there was dying to be done as well as killing xxxiv they died well the gladii hacked down the first shock of the british attack and the second but for every celt who fell another ten rushed forward to take his place by now only the mound of corpses and the narrowness of the bridge limited the numbers reaching the near bank a crack like the sound of a giant axe signalled that the side rails of the structure had given way throwing dozens to their deaths in the swollen river even so thousands had already crossed and the veterans were only just holding them something whirred past valeriuss head reminding him of the fate of the young legionary the britons had no formal units of archers but many skilled hunters swelled the ranks of that great mass and now they lined the bushes of the far bank picking their targets with bow or sling the centurions steady cry of close the gaps rang with increasing regularity as the veterans dropped three burly celts pulled octavian bodily from the roman formation and hacked him to pieces didius took a spear point in the throat and went to his gods without a murmur of complaint for now the casualties in the first cohort could be replaced by the men in the second line but the old soldiers were beginning to tire and the pressure was so great he couldnt gamble on resting a single man he stepped on a body and looked down to see the baker from londinium staring up at him with his single eye it was the first indication that the line was moving back where was bela the sound of a horn gave him his answer and with relief he stepped out of the line and ran back to the higher ground where the cavalry had formed up not bela but matykas the trooper from the bridge who had advised him to take his little army away the man must have been in the saddle for more than fortyeight hours and he led only half the horsemen valerius had expected your commander the thracian lifted his head and valerius saw that only his spirit kept him upright dead and the rest there must have been a hint of unintended accusation in his words because the mans eyes flared momentarily dead too no one ran tribune all fell you put too much faith in the river valerius fought off a wave of despair another mistake how many crossed he asked matykas shrugged it didnt matter now nothing mattered he groaned and straightened your orders every thracian bled from at least one wound their spears were splintered or gone and the coats of their wornout cavalry mounts were flecked with foam how could he ask any more of these men i need you to take pressure off the flanks the troop commander frowned and looked across the seething horde in front of the bridge as if for a few seconds hed forgotten the battle existed eventually he nodded and gave the order in his own language valerius saw the reluctance in the mens faces and the decurion snapped another spate of words then he looked down at the roman i told them that tonight we ride with the stars i hope it is true the trooper replaced his helmet and tightened the chin strap i hope so too when they were gone valerius took a moment to survey the battle from his slightly elevated position he was by the north gate with the bridge two hundred paces away to his right front by now it was impossible to count the britons who had crossed several thousand pressed the thinning wall of falcos legionary veterans and thousands more streamed away to east and west keener to be among the first to colonias spoils than to die on the point of a gladius the roman line curved like a hunting bow now and was edging inevitably back towards him with its outer wings threatened three four five celts hammering at each roman shield he watched the thracian cavalry formation split and ride in a wide halfcircle that brought the horses of the two depleted squadrons smashing into the british flanks at the same instant for a moment a flash of bright metal showed as the long cavalry swords smashed down on exposed british skulls but it couldnt last and the next time he looked they were gone a hundred lives snuffed out like the flame of an oil lamp but those lives had not been wasted a momentary confusion in the celtic throng allowed falco to restore his line and gave valerius time to run to the militia commanders side we have only one chance he shouted to make himself heard above the clash of iron against iron there are too many now we must form testudo and fight our way to the temple falco turned to him and valerius saw that though he breathed like an overworked ox his right arm was bloody to the elbow and his eyes shone bright with the elixir of battle that made a man think he was immortal the lined face was set in a feral snarl and he shrugged off valeriuss hand as if it were a strangers and turned to go back to the line testudo valerius shouted again we have to form testudo for a moment comprehension appeared on the tired features and falco looked around at the diminishing band of his veterans valerius recognized the moment of decision the little wine merchant sucked in his belly beneath the battered chain mail and came to attention i fear that this is an order i must disobey tribune he said we pensioners have walked as far as we can today we will stay where we stand and give you as much time as we can buy with our lives gather your beardless children and take them where they can do more good no valerius shouted desperately as his friend turned away falco looked over his shoulder and said very deliberately get them out valerius hurry you only have minutes i can give you no longer than that he wanted to stay and die with them but there was still another battle to fight and lunaris would need his help londinium vexillation form testudo on me the response was automatic and immediate the shell of the tortoise coming together over and around him perhaps a hundred and thirty of them were left all of them breathing hard and many of them bloodied or limping before he joined the front rank of the formation he took a last look about him the veterans could barely hold their shields now and any mans sword arm would tire after forty minutes of hard fighting but falcos militia battled on the britons had pushed the flanks back until what had been a line was now a small pocket of hacking grunting bloodsoaked survivors at the south end of the pocket one opening remained like the neck of an amphora but rapidly shrinking twenty feet away from him falco formed a small squad of a dozen wounded and exhausted men in the mouth of the opening valerius heard him shout for one final effort and as he took his place at the front of the testudo the old wine merchant caught his eye and with a last salute led his men in a desperate charge that forced the opening back a few precious feet now valerius yelled north gate at the trot we stop for nothing as one a hundred and thirty pairs of legs began pumping with all their remaining strength and the armoured carapace smashed through the screen of warriors towards colonia to be inside the testudo after the ceaseless clamour of the battle was to enter a shadowworld where the carnage beyond the shields was of only mild interest to those within the noise of the fighting and dying was reduced to a muffled roar and the atmosphere was like a crowded sauna shared with wildeyed bloodied madmen stinking of fear and the contents of their fouled underwear coughing and retching and cursing the gods and themselves here even as your feet tripped over the faces of dead friends it was possible to believe in a survival that a few minutes before had seemed preposterous will they get out valerius looked over his shoulder and saw that the man behind him in the tortoise was gracilis the tough campanian a sword blow had badly dented his helmet and a ragged wound scored one cheek probably the edge of a spear that had been aimed at his eyes it was still bleeding copiously but gracilis ignored it no he grunted as something crashed against the outside of his shield he heard gracilis whisper what might have been a prayer but he had no time for prayers the grass beneath his feet turned to metalled road surface and he made a quick calculation half left he called and the formation altered direction by fortyfive degrees keep your shields up and your legs moving momentum was everything they were on the shallow slope up through the gate into colonia if he was right and the fighting had kept the britons clear of the gate they should be able to reach the top of the hill where theyd be only two hundred paces from the temple complex but every step was agony now a fire burned in his calves and thighs and his lower back felt as if it were broken the shield never light seemed to have a dozen men sitting on it and he had lost all feeling in his left arm and shoulder around him men groaned and cried out as they called on their bodies for an effort that should have been beyond human capability flat he almost shouted out in relief the road was flat twenty paces and half left his voice was a rasping wasted thing not far now my mules just one last effort he risked a glance between the shields to his front and the horror of what he saw almost stole the last strength from his legs hundreds of rebel fighters streamed from the direction of the west gate towards the temple complex they were trapped he fought back panic as his mind raced for another way out but there was none they couldnt turn back if they stood and fought they would be annihilated there was only one answer it was impossible but it was try or die theyre in front of us and if they stop us were dead he shouted step up the pace and slaughter any bastard who gets in the way now the britons on the decumanus maximus were not the elite warriors the veterans had faced at the bridge they were the farmers and wheelwrights carpenters potters and smiths who made up the heart of boudiccas army ordinary men not fighters but willing to fight and not the shirkers and backstabbers who would come after when the dying was done thousands of them had crossed the river and bypassed the battle in the meadow and now they sought revenge on colonia for the years of humiliation they had suffered at the hands of the romans they destroyed everything that was capable of destruction regardless of its use or value in their rage they would batter something innocuous an old couch or an abandoned bed as if by destroying the inanimate object they were killing the brain that created it the hands that made it and the body that had lain upon it strangely although many carried torches and there was a strong acrid smell of smoke in the air not many of the citys buildings were burning yet the tiled roofs and limeplastered walls of the barracks and the houses defied any casual attempt to ignite them it would take more than a carelessly thrown brand to turn colonia into an inferno but nothing drew them more strongly than the temple of claudius symbol of roman power and roman domination defiler of sacred ground and usurper of true gods ruiner of kings and destroyer of hopes the testudo hammered into the rear of the first scattered group and the swords of the front rank hacked down any man who stood before them or simply battered them to the ground where ironshod sandals smashed into disbelieving upturned faces it was called the tortoise but to those watching astonished from the doors and windows along the street it appeared more like an armoured galley cutting its way through a human sea leaving in its wake a flotsam of dead and dying bodies and accompanied by an unearthly clattering as if a hundred shields were being battered simultaneously against a hundred trees closer to the hated temple the street became more crowded and logic dictated that the sheer mass of british tribesmen must slow the testudo but the power of legs hardened by thousands of miles of marching and driven by an insatiable urge to survive somehow maintained its momentum behind his shield in the oven of the interior valerius felt his mind empty and his exhausted body accept the tempo of the battle line a screaming unshaven face appeared and disappeared in a welter of blood a spear thrust was met by an unbroken wall of shields a dying man squirming beneath his feet was dispatched with a swift thrust to the throat the world slowed but his own reactions quickened and it seemed that the gods marched at his side because he was beyond suffering now in a place where no man could harm him his body was a weapon of war yet at its centre was only peace it was the most wonderful feeling in the world and it seemed to last a lifetime but only moments later a voice he didnt want to hear shouted in his ear sir the temple unwillingly his mind returned to the real world the world of pain and he realized that there was nothing in front of them to his left the wonderful tortured creak of a gate opening sounded like the gift of life still in formation with their shields raised he led the survivors of the battle of the bridge through the walls of the temple of claudius xxxv inside the gate the testudo disintegrated into a slumped huddle of exhausted men valerius lay back against a wall with his eyes closed he could hear the shouts of acclaim but he really didnt care he was alive for the moment that was enough he removed his helmet and ran his fingers through the damp thickness of his hair relishing the feel of the cool air on his head and neck sweat ran in a stream down his back and his tunic felt as if hed been swimming in it someone thrust a water skin into his hand and he suddenly realized how thirsty he was when was the last time hed drunk or eaten his brain didnt want him to know but when he placed the skin to his lips the tepid musty liquid seemed to be instantly absorbed by his brain and the skin was empty before his dustdry mouth could benefit he opened one eye lunaris stood over him silhouetted by the sun which was still low and in the east it didnt seem possible it was less than two hours since dawn bread a hand like an engineers shovel emerged from the glare to offer a big quadrant of panis castrensis the rough peasant bread of the lower ranks he took it and bit into it ignoring the wheat grains hard as road grit which threatened to break his teeth more water he mumbled and tossed the skin at the dark mass looming over him he knew they were only delaying the inevitable but all he wanted to do was rest here against this wall with the sun on his face let someone else do the leading lunaris handed him another skin and he drank eagerly this time savouring the feel of the water in his mouth and allowing it to run slowly down his throat he looked around at the men hed brought back from the bridge in the testudo falco had saved them all with his suicidal charge a fat merchant who could barely fit into his armour had never stopped being a soldier none of them had what was it falco had said you will go on your knees and seek my forgiveness before the end well not now and mores the pity he would have done it gladly just to share one more cup of wine with the old man he closed his eyes again and his head was filled with flashes of incidents he barely remembered witnessing the briton with a gladius buried in his guts growling like a dog and trying to tear with his teeth at the man whod stabbed him the unarmed veteran whose name hed never know who had thrust himself into a gap in the line and held it with his dying body until hed been chopped into ruin matykas the thracian riding off to die when he could have run because thats what rome paid him to do dead all dead yet he lived why his plan had never been to hold the rebels only to hurt them yet he felt a terrible sense of failure and guilt there was no blame he understood that paulinus and the legate would have applauded his actions he was a commander who had used the forces at his disposal to do the most possible damage to the enemy when the time came he had been strong enough to throw them into the abyss he felt like weeping but he had no time for selfpity are you going to stand there all day or are you going to give me your report he used the wall to push himself to his feet it was an effort the armour on his back seemed to weigh three times as much as normal and his body felt as if every inch of flesh was bruised thought you were asleep sir the duplicarius grinned but his relief was clear hed had more than enough of the burden of command three hundred and fifty effectives if you count civilians disabled veterans and the ration thieves from the armoury but not including the women and children in the temple that surprised valerius hed thought everyone had gone with the convoy another problem he didnt need lunaris continued enough food and water for a week if we go easy defences built and manned as ordered but were down to the last two hundred javelins the statistic made valerius flinch though he kept his face immobile he had seen how effective the spears had been at the bridge they could be the difference between holding out for hours or days lunaris continued i tried to get rid of the chicken murderer who runs the temple but he didnt want to go you could have heard him whine in glevum when the lads started dumping supplies all over his pretty sanctuary and tearing up curtains for bandages youd think hed be grateful we were here to save him from the barbarian hordes but he as good as accused me of treason godbotherers are worse than politicians valerius managed a tired smile youve done well lunaris he considered the meagre forces at his disposal in his heart hed always known it would be like this he had no choice but to defend what he could and be wary of what he could not well put two hundred and fifty men across here in two ranks he pointed to an area a dozen paces inside the gate organize four squads of ten and position them to deal with any breakthroughs they will be my strategic reserve i know its not much but it will have to do he looked over to where the young priest fabius stood uneasily with the other civilians alongside a few resting legionaries like sheep amongst a pack of wolves the rest well leave in the pronaos redoubt and when we are finally forced back they will cover us until we can join them in the temple he said it matteroffactly as if he were discussing the price of grain in the forum but the words sent a chill through lunaris it did not matter how long the defenders held them he was saying or how many they killed defeat was as inevitable as the next dawn valerius replaced his helmet and the two men walked towards the south wall of the complex and the gate which bisected it they kept their pace unhurried aware the eye of every defender was upon them two legionaries were placing the last of the timber baulks to block the arched gateway the wall on either side of the gate was only shoulder height valerius looked beyond it to where the celts waited in a sullen compact mass half filling the area of gardens and vegetable plots there were no taunts or challenges now only a brooding hatefilled silence that seemed to make the air around him hum with energy from beyond them came the howls and cries of those looting the city and the thousands more trying to reach the temple through the choked streets when they first appeared we were certain that you had been wiped out lunaris said quietly and valerius realized how difficult it must have been for the temples defenders listening to the sound of battle but able to do nothing there were only a few hundred but they tried to attack the gate and we had to use half of our reserve of spears to see them off theyve been warier since then maybe we killed their leader now they seem content to wait they wont attack until boudicca is here to witness it valerius said with certainty she will not only want to see her revenge shell want to feel it and taste it we still have time time to wait and while they waited the legionaries talking quietly among themselves and dictating last messages to the more literate valerius watched colonia die it was no haphazard destruction it was organized directed and designed to wipe the city from the face of the earth the rebels had already discovered a stoutly built roman home was not easy to burn a torch thrown on to a tiled roof only burned itself out leaving a blackened scorch mark on the ochre but they learned quickly first they cleared the far slopes of the hillside across the river of the tinderdry oilheavy gorse bushes that filled the spaces between the farms and dragged great bundles into the city while this was done others were busy on the roofs stripping tiles from the insulae the former barrack blocks the basilica and the villas in their fine gardens and baring the pitchcovered wood now the torches could do their work while inside the walls the gorse burned with all the intensity of greek fire from within the temple precinct it appeared innocuous at first just a few tendrils of smoke rising above the roofline but in minutes the tendrils turned into great writhing columns with the bright red and gold of the fires at their heart reaching high into the sky speckled with millions of infinitesimal dancing sparklets that lived and died in a second house by house and street by street the city was consumed by the flames of boudiccas vengeance the wrath of andraste had come to colonia but valerius knew it would not be enough for her she came as the sun reached its peak carrying a long spear but this time without fanfare because no chariot could make its way along the choked main street which was one of the few not yet burning valerius watched the crowd of warriors part to allow the flamehaired figure to emerge from their midst for the first time she was close enough for him to study properly she looked older than hed imagined perhaps in her late thirties and her features were striking rather than beautiful which he found oddly disappointing a wide forehead and a nose any roman would be proud of a plaid cloak covered her shoulders held at the breast by a large golden brooch which was outdone by the thick neckring of the same metal that graced her throat but it was her eyes that made her who she was glittering like translucent emeralds with the raging fires of her desire for vengeance burning in their depths he remembered his earlier feeling of being stripped bare and experienced it again her hatred projecting itself to shrivel and unman the defenders boudicca stood stern and erect surrounded by her advisers and the british nobles who had risked everything to join her valerius found himself drawn to one a warrior with his head swathed in bandages possibly a survivor of the action at the bridge supported by a thin man in a grey cloak which shimmered in the sunlight he saw the spear rise make ready he shouted and ran back to the double line of legionaries they came in waves twenty deep and if valerius had more spears they would have died in waves instead only the first two hundred champions were thrown back as they clambered to the top of the wall and the needle points punched through bare flesh muscle and bone and then flesh once more but for all the impact the slaughter made on the attackers the legionaries might have been throwing rose petals forward valerius accepted a shield and placed himself in the centre of the roman front rank there would be no directing this battle from behind the sweatstained legionaries marched ten paces in tight ranks behind the protection of their shoulderhigh shields and rammed the iron bosses in the faces of the first men to cross the wall valerius felt the impact on his left forearm and punched his gladius through a gap at a fleeting seam of bronzed skin all along the line he could hear the familiar almost animal grunts as his legionaries forced the short swords into pliant flesh and the shrieks as the points bit home at first not enough warriors could breach the precinct to force the defenders back and the soldiers pinned them against the wall while at the same time ensuring those who attempted to cross behind them had nowhere to land but on top of their fellows the men on the wall pranced and raged attempting to find a way to reach the enemy and howling their hate but their antics exposed them to the few archers lunaris had managed to place on the temple roof and one after another the wellaimed arrows plucked them from their perches for the moment valeriuss legionaries more than held their own but a hail of spears from beyond the wall landed without distinguishing friend or foe and took their toll on the defenders a legionary in the second rank screamed and staggered from the line as one of the broadbladed points pierced him through the thigh in almost the same instant the man beside valerius was blinded by a spear thrust from one of the trapped warriors and reeled back with his hands to his face and blood spurting through his fingers valerius found himself facing three of the heavily tattooed rebels the first long sword wielded by a snarling greyhaired ancient who should have been too old to fight came at him in a curving arc designed to take his head off at the shoulders with a desperate parry he managed to block it forcing the blade upwards and leaving the mans naked belly exposed to a sword point that flickered out of the second roman line the briton went down with a disbelieving howl just as the second warrior battered valeriuss shield aside with his own any blow would have brought the roman down but with screaming sweating bodies crowding on every side his opponent could only make an awkward overhead stroke that gave valerius the heartbeat he needed to drive the gladius under the britons chin and into his brain still there was no respite the killing stroke left him open to a howling redeyed figure who burst from his left and chopped down twohanded with a massive woodsmans axe valerius cursed knowing he couldnt turn quickly enough this was where his neighbour now blinded and coughing his life out among the trampling feet should have covered him the axe was angled to strike his left shoulder and he knew his armour would be no protection against such a fearsome weapon the great blade would cleave collarbone breast and ribs he screamed in desperation just as a bulky figure stepped into the gap at his side to lock shields with a crunch and an instant later the blade of the axe appeared through the three layers of seasoned oak of lunariss scutum the big man grinned hauled the shield sharply to one side and stabbed with his short sword he was rewarded with a groan valerius nodded his thanks and returned to the task of staying alive the din of the fighting was fit to burst his ears screams of pain howls of triumph and the terrible rhythmic grunting all punctuated by the clang of iron against wood and the spinetingling zuuppp of arrows flying inches overhead his movements became automatic and it gave his mind the opportunity to rove over the battlefield some deepburied sense tasting the scent and sound and feeling the movement of everything around him the right he shouted to make himself heard and lunaris croaked acknowledgement but shrugged as if to say what do you want me to do about it as he fended off a series of blows from the front we have to reinforce the right you want me to do it myself the duplicarius asked conversationally what about the reserves valerius ducked as a spear clattered against his helmet and skidded into the rank behind every instinct told him that the pressure on the right flank was growing gracilis is in charge he knows what to do i hope the howl of triumph from behind could not have come from any roman throat and suddenly the right didnt matter at all because the britons had done what they should not have been able to and climbed the east wall in enough force to attack valeriuss diminishing band of legionaries from the rear he glanced over his shoulder and was just in time to see graciliss section of reserves smash into a mass of warriors racing from the northeast corner of the complex back he screamed back to the temple with even three feet of respite he would have ordered the testudo but there wasnt even an inch every man was shield to shield and sword to sword with two or even three opponents the only chance was to stay in formation and retreat one step at a time to the temple steps the efforts of the archers on the temple roof kept the crisis on the right flank from becoming a rout but he doubted that gracilis would hold the attack from the rear for more than a few seconds when he was overcome the only romans outside the temple would be dead men foot by agonizing foot valerius allowed the line to be pushed back the pressure on his shield was growing unbearable the scything blows of the british swords threatening to smash even the scutum s sturdy structure beside him lunaris snarled and sweated cursing his inability to fight back every step they retreated allowed more of boudiccas warriors to pour over the wall the soldiers of any other army would have broken but these were romans roman legionaries they knew how to fight like no other and they knew how to die only a single tattered rank remained those left behind the dead and the injured were trampled under the feet of celts whose battle frenzy increased with each step closer to the temple that symbolized everything they had grown to hate in the long years since claudius set foot on their land by the time valerius felt the cool shadow cast by the temple roof less than a hundred men remained exhausted each bleeding from multiple cuts scarce able to hold the heavy shields which were the only things keeping them alive then a roar from his left told him the inevitable had happened and gracilis and his men were gone in the same moment the line broke it did not really break it disintegrated where a second before there had been a battered but disciplined defence now a hundred individual legionaries fought for their very existence trying desperately to stay alive as they backed up the steps towards the temple that was their only hope in the maelstrom of flailing sword arms and falling bodies valerius shieldless now battled with the rest he could still see lunaris close by with paulus luca and messor fighting at his side the big legionary had lost his helmet and was bleeding from a cut on his scalp but the discipline of a dozen years of service never left him he cut and thrust with paradeground efficiency never using more energy than was necessary and killing or wounding with every stroke the men he faced had long since learned to respect his blade and that respect allowed him to move upwards one step at a time towards the temple and sanctuary valerius sliced at a barbarian face and moved towards his friend before he had taken a step a pulse seemed to surge through the group of warriors facing him and from their midst burst the biggest celt he had ever seen he was one of their champions over six feet tall his body covered in blue tattoos intricately woven into whorls and vague animal shapes and he was drunk on blood and possessed by the battle rage wounds scarred his torso but the urge to kill had overwhelmed his senses and drove him up the steps with his spear held before him in two hands valerius saw him come and his mind automatically worked out how to kill him the spear outreached the sword by several feet but he knew if he could get past the point he could pluck the giant warriors life as easily as plucking a rose a simple parry to send the spear point past his left shoulder and a back cut to chop the jaw from the snarling face it was all about speed and timing and he had practised the move a thousand times but hed been fighting all this long day and maybe he got careless or maybe hed used up all his luck when the moment came the iron nails of his sandals slipped on the bloodslick marble below his feet and he fell helpless on the steps as the tattooed briton screamed his victory cry and rammed the leafshaped blade at his throat paulus saved his life the signifer launched himself across the stairs and diverted the blow with a cut of his gladius then standing protectively over valerius he screamed insults at the britons daring them to try again with a roar the big warrior took up his challenge and darted forward jabbing the long spear at the romans eyes valerius scrabbled for his sword as a second briton attacked from the left forcing paulus to half turn his shield to fend off the danger it was only a momentary distraction but in battle moments are the difference between life and death the jab to the eyes was a feint and valerius watched in horror as the spear point dropped and slipped past pauluss defences before he could parry it still his armour might have saved him but the angle of the attack was such that the iron point found a gap between the plates to take him below the ribs and the big warrior used his enormous strength to force and twist it deeper as the romans eyes bulged and he gave a grunt of shock the barbarian loomed over valerius so close the tribune could smell the rank sweat of unwashed body the muscles of the warriors massive neck bulged and he growled like an animal as he rammed the spear home still further into pauluss body only now did valerius realize his hand held his sword with all his strength he stabbed upwards into his enemys exposed throat until the point jarred against the bone where his spine met his skull crimson blood spurted from the gaping wound and vomited in gouts from the open mouth before the briton finally let go his death grip on the spear paulus was down but he still lived whimpering quietly with that long shaft buried deep in his guts valerius staggered to his feet and stood protectively over his dying comrade but before the britons could renew their attack hands pulled him backwards and lunaris and messor charged screaming down the steps in an attack that made the enemy hesitate the momentary respite gave another pair of legionaries the chance to pick up their fallen tentmate and drag him past the statues and the outer columns towards the temple they had one chance but it was fading with every second crazed mobs of warriors gathered where valeriuss legionaries had fought to the last hacking at the things on the ground until they were no longer recognizable as human a briton raised a still twitching heart in triumph letting it drip blood on to his face before he tore a piece from it with his teeth valerius staggered towards the coppersheathed doors of the temple with the first pursuers close on his heels and then with a final glance at the noble head of claudius that was the centrepiece of the entrance threw himself inside lunaris and messor were the last to escape backing in side by side and parrying the swords and spears that slashed at them the work was so close that three barbarians forced their way inside before the men at the doors could bar them shut the celts died screaming under a dozen swords at last they were safe and trapped in the temple of claudius the god xxxvi paulus was dying agony contorted the signifer s face and his flesh had taken on the waxy yellow pallor that told only one story the british spear was still buried deep in his stomach and valerius knew any attempt to remove it would only increase his friends suffering he knelt at pauluss side and took his hand the great strength was fading but he felt a tightening of the legionarys fingers on his and looked down pauluss eyes had been screwed tight shut but now he opened them and a tear ran from one corner down his dirtcaked cheek he tried to say something and valerius was forced to bend his head to make out the words im sorry i let you down the voice was only the barest whisper should should have had the bastard you didnt let me down you saved my life im sorry i brought you here it was a mistake ive made a lot of mistakes there was no reply and for a moment valerius thought the signifer was gone but the grip tightened and paulus cried out a long drawnout groan when the legionary eventually spoke again the whisper was even weaker and valerius barely heard the words i cannot he said when he realized what he was being asked a soldiers death sir the standardbearer gasped a good death weve both seen men die like this not for me please valerius hesitated then bent low and spoke into the young soldiers ear so there was no doubt the words would be understood wait for me on the other side at the same time he placed his sword point below pauluss chin and thrust he felt the legionary shudder and perhaps it was his imagination but there was a moment when he believed he could see the mighty spirit leave the body and fade into the darkness above him for rome he whispered he waited crouched over the body as the world threatened to overwhelm him he had seen too much blood too much death and with each friend who passed he felt a weakening of resolve but he knew he couldnt allow that he had to defend this temple to the last not for catus decianus who had sacrificed colonia or the governor who had abandoned the city to its fate but for falco and bela and paulus who had died to give him the opportunity every day he kept boudicca here was a days respite for londinium at last he raised his head and took in his surroundings this was the place of secrets the inner sanctum of the cult of divine claudius it was perhaps twenty paces long by fifteen wide with a floor of tiled marble it had a single doorway the one through which they had entered and no other an enormous bronze statue of the emperor in his guise as jupiter dominated the interior from its position by the far wall and in niches along the side walls stood other lesser statues of members of his family lunaris and the exhausted soldiers slumped to the ground close to the entrance where they knew they would soon be needed across the floor and by the walls civilian refugees sprawled or huddled in little family groups their pale frightened faces visible in the light of a single spluttering oil lamp at first the sheer number astonished him there must be a hundred or more here either because they had been too late to join the illfated refugee convoy or for reasons that became clearer as he began to identify individuals petronius who had refused the militia the arms they needed to defend themselves wore his sword but had decided his life was too precious to be wasted on the battlefield he sat with a blank almost disinterested expression beneath the statue of claudius among four or five chests that must contain his records but the true grounds for his defection was undoubtedly the pretty girl young enough to be his daughter who nestled protectively in his arms numidius the engineer had sought sanctuary in the temple he had built and could not abandon but his scared eyes never left the butchered remains in the doorway and it was clear he was having second thoughts about his decision now valerius was pleased to see fabius the young augur had survived artlessly displaying the sword lunaris had provided him with now bloody to the hilt with an expression of dazed wonder on his face the sight of agrippa the temple keeper was less welcome he could already imagine the list of complaints he would have to fend off later two of the women appeared to be comparing dresses and a small group of britons who had worked for the roman authority sat slightly apart as if they werent certain whether they were part of this tragedy or not and others men who had stayed with their families out of greed or necessity or stupidity then his eye fell on corvinus the goldsmith sat with his back against the east wall and his face lost in the shadow but valerius saw that he wore his militia uniform beneath his cloak and from his posture his right hand rested on his sword hilt he had his left arm around his beautiful darkhaired wife who in turn held their weekold son if falco had lived he would have killed the former legionary armourer on sight but valerius had had more than enough killing for the day corvinus was a problem that would have to be dealt with but he could wait lunaris i want an inventory of all food water and equipment numidius he called to the engineer who scuttled to join him with a look somewhere between concern and outright fear you built this place i need to know everything about it how solid are the walls he stared into the void above the construction of the roof is there any way apart from this door that they can get in or we can get out numidius quickly destroyed any faint hopes of an alternative escape route the walls are constructed of square blocks of stone fronted with marble the roof is of wood with marble tiles i suppose its possible that with time and the right tools you could break through but as you see it is thirty feet above you and without ladders and scaffolding is inaccessible he said mournfully valerius tried not to show his disappointment well if we cant get out at least it means they cant get in he sniffed the musty rank air we need a latrine area there he pointed to the furthest corner if we cant dig a hole at least we can provide the women with a little privacy raise some sort of curtain between the statues lunaris brought him the list he had asked for and he studied it carefully nothing in the equipment he didnt know about with enough rope he might have been able to reach the roof but there was little hope of escaping in full view of fifty thousand britons and there was no rope in any case the food lunaris had stockpiled consisted of basic legionary rations ironhard sheets of buccellatum biscuit salt pork olive oil garum and a few loaves of bread and was sufficient for just over a week water was the problem just thirty amphorae for a hundred and twenty people probably four days supply at most again he kept his thoughts to himself but he ordered a guard put on the water whats the point when were all going to die the truculent voice came from a group at the centre of the cella floor and valerius recognized gallus a balding young shopkeeper sitting with the mousy little wife who didnt know about the mistress he kept in one of luculluss apartments we might as well eat and drink our fill valerius put his hand on his sword any man who attempts to take food or water hes not entitled to will certainly die quickly but the rest of us still have a chance to live we have enough water for at least four days if we ration it carefully and the ninth legion could be here in two the announcement brought a murmur of surprise boudicca is unlikely to keep her entire force here to deal with less than two hundred people if we can hold out until then the ninth will drive them off they wont stand against a full legion he stared at the man who had spoken and was rewarded with a grim nod i an enormous crash rattled the massive oak door and echoed around the chamber followed by a pandemonium of women screaming in terror and men shouting in alarm valerius rushed to join his men at the door the crash was repeated and the bar jumped but was held in place by the supports battering ram valerius shouted put your shoulders to the door the four closest legionaries responded to his cry again the crash was repeated and the men recoiled from the door holding their upper arms he called them away realizing hed made a mistake the impact of the ram could shatter bones and he couldnt afford any more casualties he found numidius by his side we have time i think said the older man the doors are six inches of solid oak and the outer surface is sheeted copper i have had a thought the final words were whispered as if the waiting britons might hear them valerius drew him into a corner it was the latrine you see numidius explained you said we could not dig a hole valerius stared down at his feet where the floor was composed of marble tiles each eighteen inches square we cant dig through that he pointed out and even if we could you said the foundations of the temple are massive it would be impossible yes numidius frowned the foundations are but when we built the cella we made certain compensations for the british winter compensations numidius nodded and it was clear he was embarrassed to talk about his innovation it is not usual but we incorporated a hypocaust system it was possible you see because the columns carry the weight of the architrave and the pediment directly to the foundations peregrinus was most reluctant until he endured his first winter here but afterwards he was positively enthusiastic valerius felt his excitement grow a hypocaust was a system of underfloor flues to carry heat through a building depending on the space beneath the marble floor it could provide a potential escape route so how do we reach this hypocaust the only way is to remove a tile they bent to study the tile between them it was mortared solidly into place and when valerius took his dagger and chipped at the cementing he barely made a mark he looked up at numidius how deep are they precisely two inches and youre sure this will provide an opening the engineer sniffed i built this temple sir trust me to know it i have carried out what measurements i could the rhythmic boom of the battering ram interrupted the conversation accompanied by the muted shouts and curses of the men wielding it valerius ignored the noise and looked at the tile again he turned to face the civilians i need volunteers to help loosen this tile it will take time but it may give some at least a chance it would also keep them occupied and their minds off the fate which awaited them if the chance did not materialize four or five of the men stood and one who claimed to have building experience took charge valerius noticed corvinus didnt move from his position by the wall deal with it now he told himself no point in delaying armourer join me at the door corvinus looked up with raw emberstrewn eyes he exchanged a glance with his wife and valerius detected a nod of approval before he raised himself from the floor so that was the way of it well it changed nothing no privacy existed within the crowded confines of the cella but valerius gave the goldsmith what he could he took him to one side of the door away from the soldiers who sat conserving their energy against the west wall you may consider yourself under arrest for desertion and cowardice he said when we return within imperial jurisdiction i will see you stand trial for failing your comrades corvinus flinched as if hed been struck but shock was swiftly replaced by a bitter knowing smile the only thing that will return to imperial jurisdiction is our bones tribune if the iceni leave us even them your threats mean nothing to a man who is already dead he started to walk away but valerius caught him by the arm beneath the cloak he felt the goldsmith half draw his sword you would fight me but not the britons he said shaking his head in disbelief there is death and there is death with honour corvinus you could have been among the honoured dead by the river but instead you chose to desert your comrades and friends and hide with the women and children what will you tell them when you reach the other side what excuse will you give for abandoning men you fought beside for twentyfive years corvinus went pale and when he spoke his voice shook sometimes there are more important things than playing soldiers his eyes strayed to his wife who was watching anxiously with the baby on her shoulder duty does not always mean duty to the emperor valerius brought his face close so corvinus could feel his contempt do not talk to me of duty legionary i saw an old man walk into a wall of swords in the name of duty that old man saved my life and the life of every proper soldier in here two thousand men your tentmates died in the name of duty while you were counting your gold mention the word duty again in my presence and ill ram that sword down your throat now get back among the women where you belong corvinus turned away with a look of sheer hatred but valerius didnt care falco had been right he should have killed him only then did he notice the battering ram had stopped and that the silence was more ominous than anything that had gone before xxxvii fire lunaris pointed to the narrow gap below the door valerius looked down and saw a glowing red line along its length and at the same time the room began to fill with choking black smoke he knew it was something he should have anticipated when it became clear that no amount of battering would defeat the massive temple door they would have stripped the copper away along with the mask of claudius to give the flames a better chance to work on the oak it didnt matter how thick the wood was first it would char then it would glow eventually it would burn it was only a matter of time at the first sign of flames corvinuss wife let out a terrified scream and clutched her son tighter to her breast like a ripple across a pool the scream spread panic among the other women turning the inside of the chamber into a smokefilled tartarus inhabited by wailing furies valerius shouted for calm but his voice was lost in the echoing cacophony of sound blinded by fear gallus rushed from his place on the floor and began beating at the door and scrabbling desperately at the bar seeking some way out of this hell lunaris reacted first he knew that if gallus succeeded they were all dead he stepped up behind the shopkeeper and smashed the pommel of his sword down on the mans skull dropping him like a stone if anyone else tries to open the door ill kill them he said and no one disbelieved him gradually the screams lost their intensity galluss wife crawled across the floor to her husband and began wailing over him until numidius and another man dragged his unconscious body back to its position in the corner corvinus whispered urgently to his woman alternately stroking her hair and his sons head valerius placed the palm of his hand against the inner surface of the door attempting to gauge the heat so far it was only warm but that would change from time to time over the next hours he repeated the exercise eventually it became too hot for him to touch and he ordered an amphora of precious water poured over the wood and under the gap at the base of the doorway where it hissed and steamed petronius ignored by the wall stirred himself and attempted to reassert his authority by protesting at this misuse of their most valuable resource but valerius snapped back at him all protocol forgotten dont be a fool if this door does not hold do you think any of us will live long enough to die of thirst at intervals the besiegers tested to see if the flames had weakened the doors sufficiently for the ram would begin its work again but always they were forced to return to the fire at first it seemed those trapped must be suffocated by the fumes or driven into the arms of the enemy fortunately the temple roof was so high that the smoke rose to be lost in the gloom above and apart from the initial terror and some mild discomfort it did no lasting harm but as the hours passed the heat in their crowded tomb became stifling and there was so little air they lay gasping like fish stranded in a driedup pond fighting for each breath even valerius slumped exhausted against the wall by the door his energy close to spent it seemed only minutes before a sharp cry woke him from his stupor his hand immediately went to his sword but it was numidius and the engineers eyes were bright with triumph its done he crowed exultantly the tile is ready to lift valeriuss fatigue vanished and he felt a resurgence of hope he followed numidius to where a little group stood around the loosened tile as if they were attending a burial with the former builder in pride of place we thought wed leave the last bit to you your honour thick lines of dust surrounded the marble where it had been chipped away he could see a distinct gap now wide enough to take the blade of a knife or a sword valerius accepted a dagger from the man who had spoken and knelt placing the point of the knife deep in the gap and attempting to gain some leverage when he found it he placed all his weight on the hilt the stone rose a hairs breadth and the knife blade snapped at the hilt a massed groan followed the failed attempt and valerius looked up to discover he was now surrounded by twenty or thirty anxious faces get me two swords he said urgently we need stronger blades one to each side this time it was luca and messor who did the lifting and the marble tile gradually rose clear allowing valerius to push it to one side and reveal the gap below the effort was greeted by disbelieving silence the opening they had created was eighteen inches square where the tile had fitted but below it the sootcoated tunnel of the hypocaust flue narrowed by two or three inches a child might fit into the gap but no child would ever overcome the terror of slipping into that stygian gloom and where would a child go if it could certainly no adult could pass through valerius looked down into the darkness and saw a mirror of the despair in his heart i will try he looked up into messors youthful determined features was it possible the young legionary quickly stripped off his uniform to reveal the skinny ironmuscled physique that had led his comrades to nickname him after the silver fish they caught from the wharfs at ostia and neapolis and paestum if he could get his shoulders inside the entrance there was a chance but valerius studied the gap again and felt a wave of claustrophobic panic what if the tunnel narrowed at some point he shook his head i cant order you to go pipefish messor steadily returned his gaze i would still like to try sir he repeated and valerius wondered at the courage it took to say those words still he hesitated but if the boy could reach roman territory very well he said as messor crouched over the intimidating black square valerius passed on the information numidius had given him youll eventually reach a small room at the rear of the temple podium where the fire pit is it is probably two full hours till dark and if you make it before then you must wait messor nodded in understanding eyes bright in the boyish face valerius handed him a small tightwrapped bag the contents of which had been persuaded from one of the trapped britons celtic clothing and a dagger there will be many thousands of the rebels still out there but in the darkness you should be able to pass among them freely pick up a weapon if you can it will make you less conspicuous but do not risk discovery make for the gate that is where you will be in most danger but once you are through it you should head north not west north until you reach the far side of the ridge only then can you make for londinium or verulamium the country must be thick with roman cavalry patrols by now and with luck you will run into one within a few hours tell them they must hurry colonia holds but it cannot hold for much longer he scoured his mind for anything that would help the boy messor sat with his legs over the edge of the hole it seemed impossible that even his slim body could fit into the constricted space below wait lunaris the olive oil the thick viscous oil would help protect messors body from the abrasive sides of the tunnel and perhaps ease his way through the shaft the young legionary waited until his comrade had covered every inch of his skin with the liquid and when he looked up valerius could see him struggling to conquer his fear he met the boys eyes and nodded may fortuna guide you he said messor slipped forward into the darkness at once it seemed the attempt would be futile for his shoulders became wedged between the two surfaces the chamber held its collective breath but with a wriggle messor was gone slipping away like a pale gleaming eel until finally the soles of his feet disappeared they waited what seemed an eternity for the inevitable shouts when he became trapped the screams for help as he fought the implacable force that held him which would turn to shuddering gasps as his strength ran out each of them endured the awful reality of being buried alive in the suffocating darkness below the temple of claudius but the shouts never came and as the hours passed they allowed themselves to feel something they believed had deserted them for ever hope valerius ordered a ration of the precious water distributed before the remaining contents of the amphora were poured over the door and the bar which had turned dark with the intense heat the state of the doors increasingly worried him they must be badly weakened by now by the twin onslaught of fire and the relentless hammering from the battering ram but perhaps claudius watched over them after all barely had the thought formed in his mind when the priest agrippa appeared at his side he had faded markedly in the past two days and in the pale light of the oil lamp his face took on an unearthly opaque quality and his eyes burned fever bright the god came to me in a vision he announced in a voice quavering with exaltation he advised me that the time has come to appease him for our presence in his house only by making a sacrifice of great value will we be released from our torment and the rebel horde wiped clean from the precinct of this temple we dont have anything of value valerius pointed out wearily not unless corvinus has something hidden under his cloak the goldsmith raised his head at the sound of his name and speared a venomous look in the direction of the doorway we have food and water the priest insisted failing to heed the warning in valeriuss voice what could be more valuable in our perilous position valerius was suddenly death sick of priests and temples and gods if agrippa was right it was romes gods who had failed to stand before boudicca and her gods and had allowed them to be trapped in this dreadful place he had always had at least a little faith in the gods but now with death six inches away behind that oak door he doubted his faith had been repaid perhaps their lives were the price that must be paid for using claudius to fleece men like lucullus of their fortunes he had a sudden thought i wont give up our bread and water for claudius because where he is they have all the food they need but if you insist i will make a sacrifice of something even more valuable agrippa looked around him at the sparseness of their cramped surroundings i see nothing else of great value he said frowning what could be of greater value to claudius than you priest valerius drew his sword slowly from its scabbard where the polished blade glinted in the glow from the fire and extended it until the point was an inch from agrippas throat he raised his voice so everyone in the chamber could hear it i give you a choice we can sacrifice our food and our water or we can sacrifice the priest here who will no doubt go willingly to his god if it will ensure the survival of his fellow men food or the priest priest urged the weary chorus from the floor valerius noticed that the loudest call came from young fabius the augur well for a long moment agrippa stared at the sword as if it were a snake about to strike perhaps a sacrifice is no longer necessary he said in a choked voice and returned to his place on legs that were a little more unsteady than before the priest had barely departed when valerius heard his name called from the far end of the chamber petronius didnt he have enough to concern him without the quaestor s intervention keep testing the door he ordered the legionary on guard at the first sign of charring use two amphorae to damp it down he made his way through the prone bodies wondering what petronius wanted their position here posed an inherent difficulty and one he would have expected to raise itself before now as the senior military officer he commanded the defence of colonia and therefore the temple but petronius was the senior civil presence and his position gave him a certain amount of authority even in this situation as quaestor he would have been entitled to demand control of the food and water supplies true he had put up surprisingly little fight when valerius insisted on using the water to damp the door but still this summons for that was what it was undoubtedly meant trouble petronius looked more careworn than normal but had made himself as comfortable as possible in his straitened circumstances while inches separated everyone else in the chamber from his neighbour the quaestor had created a small outpost using the chests containing colonias official records which gave him and his companion not only room to move but the relative luxury of something to sit upon on closer inspection the girl was even younger than valerius had imagined probably somewhere in her midteens with haunting dark eyes and a body on the brink of womanhood he realized he recognized her it was the girl from luculluss funeral the gnawed end of a chicken bone protruded from beneath the hem of petroniuss cloak a sign not only of a degree of preparation but also that the records or at least some of them were not all they appeared how may i be of service to you quaestor he asked warily the answer came as a surprise come now my boy i think we might be a little less formal i thought you might appreciate somewhere to rest awhile petronius indicated one of the boxes valerius was tempted to turn down the offer but it seemed genuine enough and it would have been bad manners to refuse when hed made himself comfortable he said now tell me the true reason you wanted me petronius smiled i underestimated you valerius i believed you were another of those haughty young aristocrats merely using the legion as a stepping stone to greater things he raised a hand do not be insulted after all i was one myself but i saw you and your men fight against impossible odds today and you are a true soldier a warrior and a leader it was a remarkable action which cost our rebel queen dear i doubt she will rest until she burns you out of your lair the ninth that is why i called you petronius interrupted the papers in these chests could be very valuable to her intelligence sources and lists of friends of rome some of whom are not what the britons believe they would be in great danger if the boxes survive and we are taken of course if the ninth legion is truly coming to our rescue i need not be concerned there was a question in the last statement but valerius looked at the girl and hesitated i have no secrets from mena the quaestor assured him she is the reason i am here he saw valeriuss startled look and gave a tired smile i met her mother four months before i was due to return to rome following the invasion she was a trinovante luculluss sister in fact when we found she was with child i discovered to my surprise that i had a greater duty that word duty again valerius found himself torn between admiration and contempt for petronius it was difficult to believe that behind the cold and calculating bureaucrat was a lover who had given up his career so that he could be a father to a native girl yet this was the same petronius who had deprived falco of the arms he so desperately needed destroy them he said quietly destroy the papers for a moment petroniuss face lost its urbane certainty your legionary if he escaped messor will ensure the story of colonias last stand is known but beyond that the door may last until morning or it may not even if he reaches the ninth i doubt they will be able to fight their way to us in time petronius smiled sadly at his daughter and reached for her hand thank you he said but valerius wasnt sure who the words were intended for he stood up and walked back to his place beside the door where the base was now clearly glowing water he ordered more brusquely than he had intended his admission to petronius was the first time he had allowed himself to acknowledge that all hope was gone it must have been close to midnight when the fire outside the door was doused valerius saw the tense white faces as everyone in the chamber waited for the first crash of the battering ram and prayed the seasoned oak would hold once more but the crash didnt come instead a few moments later they heard the sharper rap of a heavy hammer accompanied by a scream that froze the blood of every man woman and child in the temple of claudius when valerius put his ear to the door he heard the sound of muffled laughter and a rasping agonized breathing the hammer struck again followed by the scream and he had to take a step back because he feared the agony of the tortured soul on the other side of the oak would unman him messor poor brave pipefish who had endured the suffocating hell of the hypocaust only to be taken when he must have been almost clear the second scream was replaced by the childlike pleading of a man tested beyond endurance the pleas drew valerius back to the door but he could think of no words of solace nothing that would reach beyond the barrier of pain to the young soldier he had sent to his death what could he say that he wished he could take his place that he wished it was he who prayed for his mother and to be released from his agony he leaned his head against the solid comfort of the wood and prayed in his turn for messors easy death when the smoke began billowing into the chamber and the glow beneath the door resumed he knew beyond a doubt that the gods no longer existed not for him not for messor not for anyone inside this temple to a false god that was when they realized that the first screams hadnt really been screams at all in the hours that followed the walls of the chamber seemed to close in and conditions became even more intolerable the very air thick with smoke and the stench of roasting flesh involuntary shit daysold sweat and the unique rancid scent of human fear grated on the throat as if it were something solid the latrine area had long since overflowed and those sunk deepest in the lethargy that accompanies lost hope were content to lie in their own waste with their children sobbing beside them the certainty of death affected people in different ways many simply succumbed to despair but for others valerius among them it had a curiously liberating effect ordinary concerns were no longer of consequence when he thought of rome and his father and the cousin who would inherit everything that should be his it was in the abstract as if he were a third party looking in on all the pointless drama even maeve had faded to a vague beautiful memory a kind of comforting presence who would see him safely to the other side petronius had brought writing materials along with his papers and valerius spent two hours composing a report of colonias defence and the courage of the citys militia of lunariss unflinching bravery pauluss heroics and messors final sacrifice when he completed the final line he read it over we live on in the hope of rescue and in the knowledge that the temple of claudius must be defended to the last breath he shook his head it hardly captured the moment but by now the words were blurring together and his exhausted mind demanded only rest he wrapped the scroll tight around his knife crawled to the hole in the floor and threw it as far into the recesses as possible when hed completed the task he puzzled over the rebel attack on the rear of the compound that had broken the defence it should have been impossible but plainly was not he thought he understood how it happened but not why but it didnt matter now nothing did maeves face swam into his mind as he slumped into a delirious sleep and he woke trembling uncertain of the hour or even where he was eventually parchedmouthed and with a pounding head he roused himself enough to order lunaris to issue a ration of water but the legionary shook his head the last amphora was empty thirst affected the old and the young most of all for hours numidius rocked back and forth on his haunches moaning pathetically accompanied by a wailing of babes in arms that cut the air like a knifeedge scraped on a brick sometime in the night corvinuss wife capitulated to the cumulative torture of her babys cries and held him so tight to her breast that the child suffocated when she discovered the boy was dead she stood in the middle of the room still holding his lifeless body and howled like a wolf eventually corvinus took her gently by the arm and speaking soothingly to her ushered her to a dark corner where he cut her throat then lay down beside the still warm corpses opened his wrists and slowly bled to death valerius watched the tragic drama unfold and was surprised how little it affected him perhaps his mind had been overwhelmed by all that had gone before and all that was undoubtedly to come could a mans stock of emotions be used up in the way he had seen a brave man run out of courage corvinus might have been his friend he remembered how proud the armourer had been of the golden boar amulet he had produced for maeve and the good grace with which he gave lunaris his lesson in humility he had never truly believed the goldsmith was a coward corvinus had betrayed the men he had served with for half a lifetime to protect his wife and child but did that make him a better man or a worse valerius he pushed himself to his feet to answer lunariss call a large area in the centre of the door glowed bright red in the dark and flames had begun eating through the gap between the two oak panels the bar which had saved them for so long was charred black one blow from the ram would clearly smash it in two ready yourselves he said solemnly lunariss eyes shone from his blackened face like twin beacons redrimmed and raw from his constant vigil but valerius saw something in them not a message not a belief a quality he would never have understood if he didnt know it was mirrored in his own the ability to die without regret to savour those final moments as a warrior in the knowledge that you were surrounded by other warriors he remembered a piece of graffiti hed once seen on the walls of a gladiator school a sword in my hand and a friend by my side and for the first time realized its true meaning it could have been different he said you could have been a hero on mona and i could be drinking wine in rome lunaris looked into the orangetainted darkness around him i wouldnt have it any other way valerius took a deep breath to stifle the thing welling up inside him and nodded to lunaris to rouse the surviving legionaries he stripped off his armour and laid it carefully beside his helmet the others followed suit no protection on earth would save them now they would fight to the end but better a fatal wound and a quick death than being captured by boudiccas rebels messors screams still rang in their ears and not one among them intended to share his fate like them all valerius had considered killing himself to ensure it didnt happen but he was a soldier and soldiers didnt die like sheep and now as he stood among them he knew he had made the right choice he lined them up in two ranks and made a play of tugging at sword belts and chiding them for their unwashed uniforms as he did he took each of them by the hand and their lean savage faces grinned back at him teeth shining in the darkness and he felt the pride well up inside him it has been an honour to serve with you he said they cheered him a hoarse hurrah from throats cracked with thirst that echoed from the walls of the chamber and startled the civilians lying in their subdued huddles he felt a boiling surge of emotion and he loved them for it the anticipation of battle beat like a giant drum on his ears if a man had to die he could not die in better company a figure stepped to his side and he turned to find petronius with a naked sword in his hand the blade bright with blood i could not let them take her he choked and valerius nodded the door exploded inward in a shower of sparks and flame followed instantly by a howling wave of warriors valerius killed the first man with a single thrust but the sword blades and the spear points were too many to resist and they came at him from every angle in a flurry of bright metal he heard petroniuss death cry at his side as a blade hammered his ribs roaring with pain and mad with fear and rage he smashed his sword hilt into a screaming wildeyed face the blow left his right side open and as he backswung in an attempt to parry a blur of metal that hacked at his eyes he knew he was an instant too slow a lightning flash of brilliant colours exploded in his head and he felt himself tumbling into the darkness death reached out to him and he welcomed it the last thing he remembered was a face from his worst nightmares xxxviii the face that greeted him in elysium was different he knew it must be elysium because it existed in a constant haze where pain was only a distant memory and soft hands soothed his brow and washed his body elysium came and went but the face remained just occasionally earthly matters invaded the idyll that was the afterlife a gnawing sense of responsibility or an unaccountable sadness but they were small intrusions and always the face would be there to make them go away time in elysium was an irrelevance and the bodys needs an illusion it existed and valerius existed within it his first indication that elysium might not be permanent came in a voice from the darkness in a language he knew but didnt understand and a name that was his own name the voice was a rumbling fractured thing and it was accompanied by a sensation alien to the happy fields of the afterlife fear it opened a door through which images marched like the dazzling flashes from the spear points of a distant legion he saw savage pitiless faces a woman crouched and weeping over the body of a dead husband swords that rose and fell with merciless precision and blood rivers of blood lakes of blood blood spattered across a wall and blood that poured down the steps of a great temple screams echoed in his head and though he knew they were his own screams he couldnt stifle them valerius the name again but this time it was another voice accompanied by the touch of a gentle hand on his shoulder he opened his eyes and for the first time the face appeared in sharp focus something metallic was put to his mouth and a pleasant liquid ran down his throat just before he lost consciousness he remembered her name maeve for a time it became difficult to distinguish where dream ended and reality began once he heard a strange whistling sound and woke to find a hooded figure watching over him with a morbid threatening presence and he knew he must be back in the otherworld on another occasion he felt a sharp pain as he fought for his life in a congested chamber but moments later opened his eyes to find himself staring through a window at familiar stars in a room that smelled of old smoke and had scorch marks on the limewashed walls he knew he was alive the next time he came awake because the stars were in the same place and he could see a tall slim figure with a mane of dark hair silhouetted against them maeve the name came out as a growl from a weekold puppy she didnt move and at first he feared it was another dream but eventually she turned and moonlight part illuminated her face she had changed he saw immediately his unconscious mind had painted her as she once was but hunger and grief had melted the flesh from her bones now dark shadows and deep hollows stood out in sharp contrast against the milky paleness of her skin highlighting each plane and giving her the forbidding unsmiling appearance of a much older woman she is still beautiful he thought but beautiful in a different way the way a fine sword can be both beautiful and dangerous he lay on a hard wooden bed with a mildewed blanket of rough wool pulled up to his neck and he didnt realize how weak hed become until he tried to raise himself his bandaged head throbbed as if it were about to burst open and every limb weighed more than he could lift she noticed his struggles and quickly crossed the room to pour liquid from an earthenware jug into a cup but when she raised the cup to his lips he caught the scent of the herbinfused beer cearan had given him in the wood and he knew instinctively that this was what had kept him asleep he turned his head to one side no he whispered tell me a veil fell over her eyes and at first he thought she was going to refuse him but after a moments hesitation she began to talk quietly her eyes fixed on some distant point beyond the window she told how boudicca had ridden south at the head of an army thirty thousand strong burning and slaughtering anything in her path which was tainted by contact with the despised romans and how their ranks had been swelled by warrior bands from the catuvellauni and trinovante each fought to outdo the other in their prowess on the battlefield and in their cruelty for each felt they had suffered most at the hands of your people maeve explained as if it somehow excused the excesses the impalings and the burnings and the rapes of all roman works the temple of claudius symbolized the shame of occupation and boudicca had used that symbol to fan the flames of her followers hatred into an inferno of unthinking and unquestioning rage she ordered them to desecrate the gods image and pull down the temple stone by stone and cast it into the river it is an abomination on this land she told them and we will wipe it from memory as we will wipe the romans from memory when they reached the slope north of colonia and looked down upon the pathetic force facing them boudiccas warriors had laughed at the prospect of meeting the old men of the militia others more experienced in war counselled caution but it was the young men who prevailed so boudicca had sent them over the bridge to their deaths three thousand killed and three thousand more with wounds that will keep them from the fight for many weeks maeve lamented they were the mightiest champions of the three tribes and she can ill afford their loss by the time boudicca reached the temple she expected to see it in flames and the statues toppled she raged and tore her hair and demanded that it be taken by nightfall and destroyed by dawn but the romans in the temple denied her for two more days and frustrated she had led her army towards londinium before she could witness its destruction you know the rest maeve said they spared none he had many questions but none stayed in his mind long enough to form completely in the end he realized there was only one thing he truly needed to know why do i live when everyone else died maeve gave him a strange fey look and he became aware of a third presence in the room a hooded figure rose from the shadows close to the door and limped towards the bed valerius recognized it from his dreams and felt a shiver run through him the hood fell slowly back and he looked into the face of a monster crespos sword had taken cearan high on the left side of his forehead splitting scalp and skull before it cut diagonally across his face the force of the blow destroyed the left eye socket and turned the eye into a red pulp that was like looking into the mouth of a volcano relentlessly the swords edge had carved through the bridge of the icenis elegant nose shattering bone and cartilage and leaving a gaping pinklipped cavity through which his breath whistled noisily finally the blade stripped the flesh from his upper right lip and removed three teeth before breaking his lower jaw which now hung unnaturally low giving his face a permanent sideways tilt the result was an abomination of the human visage when he spoke it was in the british tongue and only the left side of his mouth moved so the words emerged as a guttural unintelligible mumble that still managed to convey the force of his anger maeve translated the words for valerius he has vowed that your language will never cross his lips again and he wishes you to know first that you are his enemy to the death she hesitated as cearan continued when boudicca offered you half of her kingdom you took it all when she offered you peace you brought swords you have killed his wife and his sons ruined his tribe and defiled its women valerius attempted to raise himself again despite the blinding pain it caused driven by an irrational need to deny it all even though he knew every word was true maeve put a hand on his shoulder and forced him gently back his own injuries are of no consequence it is the injury to his people which must be avenged that is why he refused to stay behind when boudicca took her army to bring down the temple of the false god he exulted as colonia burned and in the final attack on the temple his hate and his desire for vengeance drove him even in front of the champions he recognized you among your soldiers and took his sword to you when you fell he thought to kill you but at the last his blade was turned aside by the memory of past friendship and the life he owed you valerius had a vision of the goldenhaired child swept away in the river at venta he forced himself to look into cearans ravaged face the single eye burned like a dying ember in a blacksmiths forge and he realized the damage to the briton went much deeper than the physical disfigurement of his features still you might have been cut piece from piece as your comrades were your limbs hung from the trees like fruit but cearan stayed the swords saying he wanted you for his own pleasure to destroy you a little at a time in the name of revenge two of his men carried you from the temple and then more secretly here to my fathers farm your enemy the roman crespo is also dead valerius winced as she related the details of crespos terrible end it was difficult to believe any man however cruel deserved such a death yet if what she said was true the centurions treatment of boudiccas daughters was as much the cause of the rebellion as druid plotting or decianuss greed no amount of pain could make amends for the blood of tens of thousands of innocents in the long silence which followed valerius tried to reconcile the conflicting thoughts and memories and feelings that whirled through his head logic said he should hate them both because they had helped destroy everything in which he believed instead all he felt was a melancholy so powerful it threatened to crush him flat he didnt understand how he could still love maeve yet somewhere beyond the pain his feelings for her were as strong as ever nothing could change what had happened but neither could anything wipe away what they had shared did she feel it too if she did she gave no hint from the first moment he regained consciousness she had never once met his eyes what will happen now he asked she turned away and he knew she was hiding tears when you are well enough to travel we will help you return to your people he nodded his thanks but you should know that life comes at a price valerius she took his right hand and pulled it towards her as he heard the hiss of cearans sword clearing its scabbard with a thrill of horror he realized the significance of the blazing fire and the stink of boiling pitch the sword flashed down and a sting of exquisite agony was the last thing he knew xxxix when they rode west in the wake of boudiccas army cearan led on one of his horses and valerius and maeve followed side by side valerius was still barely conscious and he only stayed upright in the saddle with her help they had dressed him in the celtic fashion and he rode with the hood of his cloak raised to disguise his features the way took them past the smouldering remains of colonia and in a moment of semilucidity valerius saw the city as if through twenty feet of water shimmering and swaying and never staying still for a moment the arch of the west gate remained solid as ever though the statues which had adorned it lay smashed around its foundations beyond for half a mile where houses had once stood tall and shopkeepers hawked their wares nothing remained except a broad field of thick grey ash interrupted only by the odd charred stump or remains of a wall which had proved too solid even for boudiccas unbalanced hatred no living thing moved within the sterile cordon of destruction no dog nor cat nor bird they had killed them all valerius doubted if even the citys rats survived so total was the destruction but the truly remarkable sight lay beyond the swathe of burned ground because the temple of claudius still stood fire and smoke had scarred the white walls and the proud fluted columns the roof was gone the thousands of marble tiles torn away and thrown down to shatter on the ground around it but the sum of the most potent symbol of the roman domination of britain remained massive and enduring in the centre of the ruined compound valerius had been unable to hold he remembered numidiuss boast that it would stand for a thousand years and wondered if it might indeed be true they tried to burn it but of course stone cannot burn maeve explained even when they used every ounce of their strength to try to pull it down it defeated them they smashed everything they could but those tasked with its destruction gave up and left in search of easier employment valerius veered towards the building but maeve took his bridle and pulled him away i do not think you want to see what is inside she was right the memories were too fresh but sometimes the gods do not grant wishes or perhaps they are as cruel and as capricious as their detractors say when they passed through the gap in the great turf rampart west of the city valerius noticed a long avenue stretching into the distance as if someone had set up a fence on each side of the roadway closer the avenue became an endless row of posts each topped with a round object the crows alerted him to what was to come thousands of them wheeling in dark clouds above the road ahead and then the wind carried the smell to him the unique oversweet scent of rotting flesh his first thought was that someone had taken a great deal of time and trouble each stake stood precisely the same height as its neighbour and each severed head stared directly at the centre of the roadway the final roll call of the colonia militia some were so mutilated as to be unidentifiable but others he recognized instantly falco saecularis didius and even corvinus united once more with his comrades he searched without success for lunaris farewell old friend for rome for a mile they rode in silence between the serried ranks of the dead and valerius felt every blank eye accusing him why of all of them had he been saved swallows swooped between the poles emitting sharp excited cries their jaunty flight patterns and scarlet cheeks inappropriately festive as they feasted on the swarms of flies which in their turn feasted upon the faces of his friends maeve looked to neither right nor left but he noticed that the colour had drained from her face and a tiny muscle in the corner of her jaw twitched with the effort of keeping her teeth clenched exhaustion or the effects of his wounds played games with his mind he remembered cearan taking the rein of his pony and guiding it away from the road and the trees closing in around them the branches tugging at his cloak like clutching hands quiet forest paths echoing with the sound of birdsong the comforting warmth of maeves shoulder leaning against his as she struggled to keep him in the saddle two obscenities with vaguely human shapes hanging from the charred doorway of a burnedout roman farmstead they travelled mainly in silence although cearan riding slumped over his horses neck whispered incessantly to himself through his destroyed lips and once he let out a sharp cry that made maeve rush to his side by the second morning valerius could barely stay in the saddle but constant draughts of maeves elixir somehow gave him the strength to continue at dusk they halted close to a copse of trees in the lee of a conical hill and even before she spoke something in the way maeve positioned her pony beside cearans told valerius they were abandoning him you must find your own way now she said and although she struggled to keep her voice harsh there was a catch in it that told its own story a gleam of gold at her throat gave him hope come with me lack of use made his speech thick and clumsy and he had to clear his throat and repeat the words before she understood them come with me and i can save you both he wasnt sure whether it was true but he did not want to live without her the dark eyes turned liquid but her determination never wavered you were always a roman valerius and i was always a trinovante for a time we lived a beautiful lie but no one can live a lie for ever and now we are enemies he shook his head no they would never be enemies have you ridden with your eyes closed she cried things have been done terrible things that can never be forgiven by you or by me you want me to come with you but the only way i will visit rome will be in chains you cant win boudicca defeated the militia but it was an expensive victory now paulinus is coming with his legions and when they meet there can only be one victor cearans guttural growl interrupted them maeve listened and pointed to the hill above them which was silhouetted against a bright orange glow somewhere another city was burning he says that londinium is destroyed and with it romes hold over this island andraste watches over boudicca and every day thousands more flock to the wolf banner even your legions cannot kill us all valerius remembered a silurian hill fort on an autumn afternoon when the relentless legionary swords had harvested one life after another and he wondered if that was true he made one final attempt i love you he said and you returned that love tell me it is no longer returned and i will go she closed her eyes and for one moment he believed he had reached the old maeve he knew she was thinking about the cave in the woods and the hours they had spent there but it couldnt last her head came up and she turned her pony away keep north and stay away from the roads she threw him the water skin and he caught it with his left hand use it sparingly it dulls the pain but take too much and you may not see another dawn he watched her ride off with cearan they were almost out of sight when he remembered the question he had wanted to ask you told them about the ladders didnt you without the ladders they would never have taken the temple she turned her head to look back at him but he couldnt see her expression they are my people valerius whatever i felt for you they were always my people he sighed and all the strength went out of him she had betrayed him yet on this day it seemed a small betrayal among all the others but she had one more message for him at the top of the rise she turned in the saddle avoid verulamium valerius on your life avoid verulamium when he looked up she was gone he rode north in the gathering darkness allowing the pony to steer its way across pasture and through woodland instinctively choosing the path of least resistance the spirits of the night held no fears for him because night was the colour of his soul endurance kept him in the saddle that and occasional pulls at the water skin while he rode he dreamed of maeve the colour of her hair and the texture and firmness of her skin in the dream he took her to rome and she marvelled at the wonders there but the farther he travelled the hotter the fire in his right arm burned and the pounding inside his head increased until it became unbearable he gambled on a longer draught of the liquid but he must have fallen asleep in the saddle because at one point the pony stopped snickering gently in alarm still with his eyes closed he dug his heels into its flanks urging it on it took a few faltering steps but eventually it would go no further as the world began to spin and he felt himself roll from the saddle he had the presence of mind to wrap the reins around his left hand when he opened his eyes his mind was clear but his body felt as if it had been used for sword practice by a legionary cohort every muscle ached and his right arm was a savage throbbing trial delaying the moment when he must move he stared up at a sky of perfect eggshell blue through branches thick with leaves that rustled and creaked in the light breeze something was missing though and he had a stab of panic before he felt the pull of the reins on his left wrist surprisingly his head rested on an object that was soft and pliant that he couldnt remember placing there a thick scent hung in the air around him but it had become so familiar that his brain took time to react to it he rolled over careful to protect his injured arm and stared at the thing beside him a human leg the body the leg belonged to lay two or three feet away the flesh white as the marble that clad the temple of claudius except for the obscene red gashes where the limbs and head had been hacked away unwillingly he allowed his eyes to scan the scene around him his first impression was of a shoal of dead fish on a beach ivory pale scattered random and utterly lifeless the corpses lay on the grass and among the trees and bushes some with heads and some without others with stomachs torn open or genitals removed each corpse had been stripped of everything of any value but what little clothing remained told him they were roman soldiers either auxiliaries or legionaries he struggled to his feet and vomited a thin spew of yellow bile momentarily overwhelmed by the enormity of what surrounded him but duty and a soldiers instinct for survival told him he must try to make sense of it at first the distribution of the bodies hundreds perhaps even thousands of them confused him however as he walked further he began to discern a pattern they had been marching south which made them part of the ninth and the lack of a baggage train said they were travelling light and in a hurry he tried to imagine the order of march mounted scouts ranging in front flank guards to the side legionaries trudging in the van of the column auxiliaries eating their dust behind and the cavalry there must have been cavalry accompanying a force this size ready to react to any attack yet all their precautions had counted for nothing when their commander had brought them through this broad wooded valley he reached a point where the dead appeared more numerous and lay in untidy ranks yes it had begun here the destruction of a legion he studied his surroundings carefully before moving warily into the nearby trees crushed bushes and dead grass showed where the ambushers had sat and the many blackened piles of excreta told of a long patient wait a large force and more if he was correct on the opposite side of the valley the attackers had struck here first along a quartermile front and forced the legion to adopt its favoured defensive line there would have been no panic if they had feared the numbers facing them they would have formed a square and fought their way to a more suitable position but there was no sign they had done so with their flanks and rear properly protected it should have been a simple matter of shield against shield and gladius against sword and spear a battle the legionaries must win but somehow a force of similar size had attacked from the rear making the second line turn and face them how had the cavalry been drawn off by some ruse certainly few of them had died here he had seen at most four dead horses probably the mounts of the cohort or auxiliary commanders and finally the fatal blow a crushing attack on the left flank which had started a rout or not quite a rout he followed the line of withdrawal and it was possible to see where small knots of legionaries had fought to the death to defend their comrades but they became fewer and fewer as they were driven inexorably back the bodies led him into an isolated clump of trees with a giant oak at the centre the oak formed the bastion for their final stand he could see it now the launch of the last pila the signiferi protecting their unit standards hacking and chopping at the multitude surrounding them until only one remained who had fought to his last breath he knew all this because unlike every other corpse this small cluster of bodies had been left untouched they even retained their armour one a leatherskinned giant still in his wolfskin cloak lay a little apart beneath his shield which showed the distinctive charging bull of the ninth on its metal boss at first valerius believed the attackers had been disturbed before they could desecrate the corpses but there was something almost reverential about the manner in which the last man had been laid out the britons esteemed courage and valour above all else was this their chief or their kings way of honouring a fellow champion he sat by the dead men for a few minutes attempting to understand the scale of the disaster which had overtaken them the whole of the south must have risen against rome an entire legion had been smashed here had they died fighting for their eagle it would account for the ferocity of the defence but a full legion at the hands of barbarians it didnt seem possible yet he had seen the results with his own eyes and he remembered the warriors who had fought their way across the piled bodies to reach the colonia militia there could be three or four thousand dead lying in and around the valley the loss of an eagle would taint every legionary who had ever marched with the ninth worse the disgrace of a defeat on this scale would be felt in rome paulinus too would be touched by it even if he was a hundred miles away when it happened he searched the dead men for personal identification or some weapon to give him at least a chance of fighting back against any wandering band of rebels he encountered but he found nothing when he was certain he swung himself painfully into the saddle and retraced the legions tracks towards the north where the forces of retribution gathered xl the cavalry patrol found him just as the sun reached its highest point and they would have killed him if he hadnt had the presence of mind to cry out the name of his unit as they approached at the gallop their long spatha swords gleaming and their eyes bright and nervous the decurion in command circled him warily before in a thick germanic accent ordering him to dismount valerius shook his head wearily i have urgent news for whoever is the senior commander in this area take me to see him at once on whose authority the german demanded valerius shook off his cloak and heard the exclamations of dismay at the sight of his wounds i need no authority but my own i am tribune gaius valerius verrens last commander of colonia only survivor of the temple of claudius and you will take me or i will go alone who commands the cavalryman hesitated suetonius paulinus with the fourteenth and the twentieth then take me to the governor but first give me a drink valerius said i have had nothing but some druids piss since dawn by the time they reached the main column the legions had settled into their marching camp for the night and it took a few minutes before they tracked down paulinuss pavilion at the heart of the fourteenths entrenchments valerius noticed a number of men with freshly bandaged wounds so they hadnt had it all their own way on mona lunaris had been right about that at least the camp of the twentieth was considerably smaller than that of the fourteenth which told him paulinus had left part of the legion in the west to consolidate whatever gains hed achieved would he have made that decision if hed been aware of the scale of the rebellion the german cavalryman handed him over to a senior tribune on paulinuss staff an officer valerius vaguely recognized gnaeus julius agricola at your service the governor wishes to see you immediately but valerius swayed on his feet and struggled to keep the resentment from his tone im sorry i left my uniform at colonia along with everything else no you mistake me please do not apologize agricola protested its just that i fear you might fall down and i would be in trouble if i lost you now the governor has grave need of you the tribune ushered him past the guards to paulinus who was staring as if hypnotized at a map of southern britain pinned to a wooden frame a second man in a legates sculpted bronze cuirass stood beside him eventually the governor turned and even through his exhaustion valerius registered the change in the man the granitechip eyes were sunk deep the heavy brow was furrowed and his skin had taken on a sickly grey pallor emphasized by white stubble that made him look ten years older paulinus stared back at him equally perplexed his mind clearly attempting to put a name to the unkempt figure in the ragged celtic clothing and bloody bandages valerius could hardly blame him after all he would remember a whole young man in the prime of youth not a haggard spectre with only one hand it had been the price of his life you will never bear arms against my people again maeve had said before cearan raised the sword and removed the right hand with a single clean stroke midway between elbow and wrist they had used hot pitch to stem the bleeding but valerius remembered nothing bar the smell of roasting flesh and the vague knowledge he was no longer whole during the ride north the maggots breeding in his mind had been as corrosive as the wounds in his flesh at first he wished hed died along with the rest what use was a partman his soldiering was finished he could no longer hold a sword or add his weight to a shield wall of course his father would support him but in his heart he would be little different from the cripples begging hopefully along the clivus argentarius the last stand of the ninth had rekindled his pride and restored his sanity the standardbearers could have run but they had fought driven by duty and honour and courage the code they shared with falcos veterans if they had suffered death for those values could he not suffer a life paulinuss reaction surprised him my boy my poor dear boy it is you i could scarce believe it you have endured so much could any man have sacrificed more for rome valerius thought of the six thousand and more who had sacrificed everything for rome but the time to remind the governor of that would come later paulinus was clearly a man living on the daggers edge and the slightest push could throw him off balance but some things could not be avoided tribune gaius valerius verrens begs to report the loss of colonia and the failure of his mission he said formally he would commend to you the conduct and leadership of the veteran militia which was in the highest tradition of roman arms they fought to the last man and the last spear and no blame should attach to them for the citys fall if blame there is it is mine yet you delayed them for two days and defended the temple of claudius to the end the second man combined natural authority with a hangdog expression and he grasped at the positive like a drowning man clutching at the last branch before a waterfall i had the privilege to command the defence valerius admitted no men could have done more memories of lunaris and messor flooded back and he staggered slightly as a wave of nausea flooded through him a chair for the tribune quickly and water paulinus called to one of his aides valerius sat and the governor stared at him intently cerialis is correct he said the name confirmed valeriuss suspicion and explained the air of defeat which cloaked the other man quintus petilius cerialis commanded the ninth legion and was ultimately responsible for the massacre valerius had stumbled upon it also answered his question about the eagle if the ninth had lost its eagle cerialis would be dead paulinus would have insisted the governors voice regained some of its old fire as he continued since i took mona we have experienced betrayal disaster and defeat thanks to that fool catus decianus whose greed and ambition placed this province in deadly peril and sent you valerius into the very gates of hades colonia at least was a defeat with honour as has been confirmed by our spies and the celts who are already deserting to us the praises of its defenders are sung even by the followers of the rebel queen and the defence of the temple which they desired most eagerly to overthrow sung loudest of all and you you alone fought your way clear valerius opened his mouth to deny it but paulinus raised a hand for silence you are a true hero of rome it took time to penetrate but when it did valerius felt the room spinning around him the way paulinus said the words with the emphasis on hero indicated this was more than praise it was eternal fame a hero of rome would receive the corona aurea the gold crown of valour from the emperors own hands he would be feted throughout the empire and have access to the centre of power it was second only to the corona graminea awarded for saving an entire legion and he did not deserve it he shook his head but paulinus was already continuing now i must know everything for the next hour valerius related the story of the veterans stand against boudiccas fifty thousand and the final terrible hours of the temple of claudius paulinus grunted in approval at the use of the bridge to draw the british champions on to the killing ground and his eyes grew moist when he heard of messors courage and sacrifice but when valerius tried to describe his own escape he was dismissive i do not need the details it is enough that you have survived when he reached the ambush of the ninth the two listeners looked away as he related the discovery of the mutilated bodies you were correct cerialis confirmed grimly four cohorts two thousand legionaries and the same number of auxiliaries just before we entered the valley our scouts sighted a sizeable force to the south and i rode to investigate with the cavalry they struck while we chased shadows by the time we returned the infantry had been overrun and we were fortunate to escape with our own lives paulinus looked at him in a certain way and valerius realized cerialis still had a reckoning to face but for the moment the governor needed every man he could get to hold britain for rome and to avenge the thousands of roman citizens who had already died valerius had heard from agricola how paulinus had been forced to abandon londinium to its fate the governors features had turned white when valerius described the horrors he had seen but now the veins in his temples stood out like octopus tentacles and his face glowed red we do not face warriors he fought for breath these people are animals and like animals we shall slaughter them the ninth and the veterans of colonia will be avenged fifty thousand you say and growing every day he shook his head and turned to the map murmuring to himself too many i must fight them on ground of my choosing but where where will she turn now that londinium burns where will her thirst for blood take her east and back to the flatlands no because only victory keeps her army together west possible if she can bewitch the silures she will control the gold and postumus and the second are already marching from isca to join us the south easy victories and control of our communications with rome or north valerius felt his stare to destroy us she must fail he said an army must eat she has no supplies and such a swarm cannot live off the land for many weeks they will be eating their sword belts long before harvest but it is not enough for her to fail she must be destroyed and all who follow her must be destroyed along with her i swear on the blood of mithras that i will annihilate her but where north the word echoed in the silence and valerius felt the sour taste of betrayal on his tongue she will march north to destroy verulamium maeves warning had been intended to save his life now it would be boudiccas ruin paulinus disposed his forces as valerius rose to leave verulamium and its people would be sacrificed he could not reach them in time or fight boudicca while protecting a column of helpless refugees in any case verulamium for all its roman pretensions was the catuvellauni capital let them make terms with their iceni cousin if they could he would use his auxiliaries the light quickmarching infantry to lure her on at a pace that would draw the fangs of her warriors then he would fight her and beat her but where agricola intercepted valerius outside the tent i am to take you to the governors personal physician did he tell you valerius nodded aware the tribune referred to the honour hed been given i mean to refuse it because i did not win it it is what i told them you would say but i fear you have no choice it is your duty to accept and you do not strike me as a man who would shirk his duty the room seemed to move beneath valeriuss feet and agricola stepped forward and put out a hand to steady him come he said gently we have delayed long enough i dont understand there are a dozen men who deserve the corona aurea more but they are all dead i lived but my mission failed and i am no hero you were brave you fought and you hurt them valerius shrugged and agricola took it as acquiescence then you are a hero and my governor needs a hero tonight he will draft a report to rome detailing the happenings of the past month it will reflect well on no one it will cost some their positions and it may cost others their lives you may not have heard but postumus who is camp prefect refuses to leave isca with the second he fears the emperor more than he fears paulinus but he fears boudicca more than both so defeat and disarray paulinus needs a victory and if he cannot have a victory he will have a glorious defeat you would not deny the veterans their glory valerius shook his head they fought like lions and they died like heroes they deserve to be remembered agricola took him by the shoulders and stared into his eyes then make sure they are remembered through you by now they were on the threshold of the camp hospital valerius paused before walking through the flaps your logic defeats my argument tell the governor i will accept inside the tent a small man with sharp features and quick restless hands rushed up to him like a mother hen a dark beard and a mottled balding head made him seem older than he probably was but the eyes were lively and intelligent tiberius calpurnius he introduced himself late of athens now of this godsforsaken mudpatch he immediately began unwinding the bandage which covered the wound above valeriuss right eye explaining his reasoning as he did so you may feel your arm is more in need of my assistance young man but i can assure you it is not i have seen men who appeared perfectly healthy drop dead at my feet hours after the merest bump with a sword but a man with a severed arm may last a month without treatment if the blood flow is curtailed and the wound remains uninfected calpurnius deftly probed the sword cut with his fingers fortunate indeed a glancing blow almost flat another inch to the left and you might have lost an eye a little more of the edge and it would have been the top of your head contusions but no sign of fracture and the wound is healing well as i would expect in a man of your years fainting spells blurring of the vision yes to be expected but if they continue return to me and i will supply you with a draught now the arm valerius winced as calpurnius removed the thick cloth bandage to reveal a marbled purpleyellow stump that reminded him of a piece of rotting meat vomit rose in his throat but the physician had anticipated his reaction and placed a bucket at his feet into which he retched copiously calpurnius whistled soundlessly to himself as he inspected the stump closely from every angle when he reached out to touch it for the first time valerius grunted in pain yes it would hurt the little man gave a tight smile which quickly transformed to puzzlement again you have been fortunate i have never seen a battle injury like this the cut is at the perfect angle the weapon almost surgically sharp valerius gave a little cry as he probed the blackened weeping face of the wound a few bone splinters which i will deal with in a moment the burned flesh must be removed or it will mortify but the unguent though primitive has kept infection at bay for the moment he looked directly at valerius and there was curiosity in his eyes not quite suspicion but certainly a question if a saw had been used i would have been quite proud of this myself as you say i was fortunate more so than the man who treated me he is dead the lie came easily there had been a militia physician but he had been among the first to fall on the field at colonia calpurnius shrugged plainly the dead held little interest for him a pity now as for treatment in a moment i will administer a tincture of poppy seed which will render you unconscious and dull the pain in other circumstances i would suggest that you rest for a few days before surgery but i sense you are a man of strong heart and healthy lungs and will survive he studied the stump again and sucked his teeth i plan to reamputate two inches above the present level which will allow me to stitch a flap of skin across the wound thereby protecting it from dirt and disease it is by far the most effective procedure he added sensing resistance to his suggestion no ill keep what i have stitch it up or do what you have to do but i need to be back on my feet tomorrow ha calpurnius grumbled another young man in a hurry it will be the death of you but i will do what i can he paused and his face brightened a leather cover cowhide for thickness and wear i have the very thing and then who knows will i be able to carry a shield calpurnius looked offended one hundred and fifty years ago marcus sergius grandfather of the odious catilina was fitted with an iron hand after his amputation returned to battle within the week and captured twelve enemy camps medicine has progressed considerably since his day now lie here while i prepare the tincture xli valerius rose early on the day of the last battle mist disguised the dawn the way a veil hides an ageing womans fading looks it came as a pale suggestion of gold lost in a drifting curtain of smoky groundlocked cloud and with it came boudiccas host she had picked up the trail paulinus had left for her while the ashes of verulamium and the blackened bones of its inhabitants were still hot for a week the auxiliaries had led them on first north then west day after day of forced marches and occasional tantalizing glimpses of the enemy the red cloaks and polished armour always on the next hill or beyond the next river they were like wolves now the britons with the roman scent as thick in their nostrils as the taint of blood from a mortally injured deer as it stumbles towards its final refuge thirty days of constant movement fighting and killing had worn them thin but the hunger still remained and with it the hatred the wrath of andraste and boudiccas need for revenge never diminished she had spilled enough blood to fill a lake and sent enough souls to the gods to satisfy even their legendary appetite but still it wasnt sufficient only by smashing the legions and killing the man who led them would she and her people find peace as the ghosts of trees appeared a few hundred paces to his left valerius knew it would be soon the rebel camp fires had been visible on the horizon when paulinuss legions bedded down in their positions for the night they would have been on the move for more than an hour now ready for another day chasing shadows but the shadows were no longer going to run from the murk the familiar inhuman sound the buzz of a million bees filled the air then the weak sun staggered above the eastern horizon and the mist shredded and burned away the buzz faded to a confused unnerving silence and from his position at the governors side valerius looked out over countless thousands stretching into the distance in a sinuous black column of humanity paulinus had spent days manoeuvring towards this position so that boudicca would be drawn behind him funnelling her army into the killing ground the five thousand men of the fourteenth legion formed a triple defensive line across the narrow valley at the head of a long gentle slope five cohorts of the twentieth who accompanied paulinus anchored his flanks against the valley walls among them he set up his shieldsplitters the ballistas which could fire heavy metaltipped arrows a quarter of a mile beyond them the cavalry ranged to discourage attempts to bypass or attack the vulnerable flanks behind the legions the auxiliaries waited in reserve ready to exploit any success or to die in their turn for there would be no retreat this is my weakness and my strength paulinus had explained as he laid out his battle plan we will have only one opportunity to destroy her even if we win a great victory but leave her army intact we will be so mauled as not to be able to fight for another thirty days while she would scarce need to draw breath our end would be long and slow but inevitable we must fight her to a standstill draw every warrior on to our javelins and our swords kill and keep killing until no man stands the position i have chosen means that my soldiers must fight or die but her confidence and the vast host she leads ensures that boudicca will never turn back agricola broke the silence that followed but if we hold them and she does decide to withdraw then we all die it took the rebel queen time to bring her forces to battle valerius could make no estimate of their numbers but his eyes told him the army had swelled enormously since he had first seen it on the slope above colonia perhaps even doubled in size covering an area a thousand paces wide and three times as deep they seemed as many as the birds in the air or the fish in the sea the silence had vanished now replaced by a muted roaring akin to standing too close to an enormous waterfall a relentless surging rise and fall that seemed to shake the very air his lack of emotion surprised him he sat on his horse with the reins still unfamiliar in the grip of his left hand and watched boudiccas forces deploy with the dispassionate detachment of a spectator at a cockfight who had already gambled his last sestertius fear had no hold on him because a man could only die once and he had died at colonia but how could a soldier fight without passion maeve had robbed him of his hand had she also deprived him of his soul he drove her from his head and studied the scene again a visible thickening was apparent in the numbers at the base of the slope as more and more warriors joined the throng edging its way towards the roman line a mile distant a few chariots forced their way to the front and he recognized the glitter from the torcs and armrings of the rebel chieftains but of boudicca herself there was still no sign beyond the mass of fighters he noted the dust cloud as the rebel baggage train and camp followers caught up with the main force deploying to the left and right for a better view of the battlefield determined to witness the destruction of the red scourge that had blighted their lives for almost two decades maeve was out there somewhere he was certain of it cearan had been determined to rejoin his queen and where he went she would follow in the knowledge that only she stood between his sanity and the total disintegration of that shattered mind he closed his eyes attempting to visualize her among the great swathe of humanity when he opened them another glint of gold from the van of the rebel army stirred a memory if you didnt love me why do you still wear the boar pendant i gave you by now it was midmorning and paulinus watched in silence as the rebel forces filled the slope in front of him his shoulders hunched forward eyes glowering from below the goldembossed brim of his helmet he had made his decisions and given his orders he had no thought of failure because failure was death the massive head came up as a new figure entered the stage boudicca her fiery mane flowed behind her in the breeze and she stood tall and proud in her chariot as she emerged from the chanting sea of warriors and spun to a halt on the green sward twenty paces ahead of her army she had her back to the roman line and valerius could feel the dismissive contempt in her gesture as he watched a brown blur flew from beneath her feet and scampered across the field to his right at first he was puzzled but then he remembered one of boudiccas emblems was the hare the omen must be positive because an enormous snarling roar greeted her that sent a shiver through every roman at the same time hundreds of banners proud symbols of the combined might of the tribes of southern britain were raised in acclamation he heard her voice for the first time deep and almost manly and caught snatches of speech carried on the wind but could make nothing of the words paulinus must have heard it too but if he did the governor dismissed it come he ordered and valerius and agricola joined him as he rode along the front of his legionaries who stood silent and motionless you fought well on mona my mules but i have brought you here for a little more javelin practice the words carried along the line and valerius could see men grinning at the unlikely familiarity those who stand before you have murdered tortured and raped roman citizens men women and children innocents whose only crime was to attempt to bring civilization to this land they butchered and mutilated your comrades of the ninth and the brave veterans of colonia who fell defending the temple of divine claudius he paused and the silence was filled by a growl like an enormous dog gathering itself for the attack we offered them our friendship our trust and our aid and they took all with smiles of thanks but when we turned our backs they reached for the knife and the sword and the spear as is their way they believe you are already defeated no the massed roar carried across the valley and echoed from the banks they are the true face of barbarism they are your enemy they show no mercy and they deserve no mercy give them none for rome for rome the words erupted from ten thousand throats and valerius felt the ice in his belly melt and the first stirrings of life return to his heart for rome he whispered an enormous clamour of horns signalled the enemy advance and the roman ranks opened to allow paulinus and his aides through to relative safety from behind the rear cohorts of the fourteenth valerius watched as the britons surged up the slope towards the waiting legionaries the slope was long and it took time for the first warriors to reach the small stakes the centurions had placed forty paces ahead of the line the optimum killing range of the pilum within that narrow corridor no legionary would miss his target as the britons charged the ballistas tore gaping holes in the front ranks the big arrows gutting two or three men at a time before they spent their power four cohorts made up the first of the roman lines including the elite reinforced first more than two thousand men they had time only for a single cast before the howling mass of britons fell upon them but that single cast scythed down the vanguard of the attack as if it were made of summer grass and not flesh blood and bone yet boudicca had an endless willing supply of fighting men and those men it seemed had an unlimited supply of courage only the wealthy were equipped with shield and sword most fought with spears when one fell he was replaced in an instant and when he fell in his turn two or three more fought to take his place celtic iron and roman shields met with a clash like the combined fury of the gods and celtic iron still outnumbered roman by ten to one but once more valerius witnessed the way the very numerical superiority of the attackers played against them when they met men determined to stand their ground behind the shoulderhigh shields those in the vanguard of the assault were forced directly on to the roman line by the weight and numbers of those behind how can a man fight when he barely has room to breathe the legionaries grunted and snarled insults as the long swords and widebladed spears sought them out and the britons grunted and snarled back as they heaved and battered at the impenetrable wall in front of them but it was the britons who were dying between each pair of shields a gladius punched with the speed of a striking cobra and every blow took its toll with murderous precision from behind the front line the cohorts of the second and third lines hurled volley after volley of javelins into the packed ranks in front of the shields in the first fifteen minutes of the attack valerius estimated that boudicca lost five thousand dead and injured the wounded pleaded squirmed and wriggled amidst their own gore beneath the feet of the uninjured only to be trampled and suffocated centurions ranged behind the roman front line shouting themselves hoarse and ordering replacements for men badly wounded or too exhausted to raise their shields one by one these fell back to ease parched throats and grab a crust of bread before they were kicked and bullied back into the killing machine the rotation kept the shield line from cracking and the little swords jabbed out relentlessly killing or maiming with every thrust as long as their supply held out the nearly three thousand men of the six supporting cohorts kept up the rain of spears the heavy leadweighted missiles plunging down on the mass of flesh below by noon the british casualties were already enormous but paulinuss battle line had weathered every crisis an hour later valerius sensed a weakening of the british resolve it was nothing tangible the pressure on the front rank was as relentless as ever but hour after hour of pushing at the backs of their comrades to no apparent purpose had doused the fire in the hearts of those in the centre and rear paulinus noticed it too and his head came up like a deerhound hitting the scent he looked out over the battlefield and saw his enemy at a standstill the rearward ranks lethargic and neutralized this was the moment he realized when the battle was his to win or lose if he didnt act the certainty was that he would eventually be defeated his men could wield a sword and bear a shield for only so long a legionarys strength was finite like that of all men the alternative was a gamble but a gamble he must take sound form wedge he ordered the cornicen at his shoulder put his horn to his lips and the distinctive call rang out along the line with swift orchestrated movements the centuries of the first two lines transformed into the devastating arrowhead attack formations and launched themselves into the face of the celtic attack the wedges carved great swathes through the rebel ranks and behind them came the roman reserves still in their disciplined lines their shields beating down any who escaped between the arrowheads send in the cavalry paulinus ordered and the auxiliary horsemen smashed into the british flanks adding to the carnage valerius held his breath now was the time for boudicca to withdraw her forces and save what she could only twenty thousand or so had been involved in the actual combat the rest were spectators if she retired paulinus would have to fight her again tomorrow and the day after that but it was not within her power to do so the thousands of bootyladen ox carts and chariots of the rebel baggage train acted like a dam against which the romans forced back the great seething pool of boudiccas followers if one man fell ten fell with him and all were crushed beneath the feet of their comrades as they milled and wheeled looking for somewhere to run or someone to fight paulinus turned his horse away spare none he said boudicca watched the roman wedges smash into her stunned forces the shock waves of their coming fracturing resolve even in the rear where she stood by her chariot with banna and rosmerta helpless to alter the course of a battle she had wanted to fight on another day in another place in that moment she recognized her defeat andraste had deserted her she turned to the two girls and they were surprised to see her eyes damp with tears it was the first time she had wept since the romans came to venta neither of them had shared her frightening hunger for vengeance but they had never left her side now they prepared to share her fate she reached for the vial which hung at her throat below the golden torc it was blue and made of fine roman glass but she found no irony in that the contents were a poison of her own manufacture tested on roman prisoners who were among the fortunate few to meet a quick and painless end she found her hand shaking as she raised it to bannas mouth but the blondhaired girl raised her own hand to steady her mothers before swallowing deeply from the container rosmerta swiftly followed suit her face a mask of determination belied by the frank terror in her eyes boudiccas heart swelled to bursting how she loved them gwlym looked on emotionless untroubled by sorrow or pity or fear like him they were all tools of the gods victory or defeat had never been of consequence what mattered was that boudiccas name and deeds would live through the ages before she consumed the last of the poison boudicca called him to her when it is done take us to a place they will never find us bury us deep if i cannot defeat the romans in life i will defeat them in death she put the vial to her lips and drank then raised her hands to touch each of her daughters on the cheek for the last time farewell she said we will meet again in the otherworld life will be better there the sun dipped low towards the western horizon as valerius allowed his horse to pick its way warily through the dead he didnt know how many there were only that a man could walk from the top to the bottom of the slope and from east to west across the valley without ever placing his foot upon the earth he rode like a blind man the memory of a single face anchoring him to reality his senses had long since been overwhelmed by the sights and sounds and smells of butchery on a scale beyond the imagining of any who had not witnessed it a spectral miasma hung over the battlefield like a low thin fog and he imagined he could taste death on his tongue and feel it clogging his lungs the slaughter had continued all through that long hot afternoon and paulinuss thirst for revenge had proved as unquenchable as that of boudicca when his officers reported that their men could no longer go on killing because they lacked the strength to wield their swords he had replied let them use their daggers and when the last celtic warrior bled out his life beside his comrades and the exhausted legionaries lay down thankfully to rest among their victims he had stormed from his tent and pointed to the thousands of women and children cowering where they had been rounded up by the cavalry soon the screaming began again valerius realized the futility of his quest when he reached the thousands of abandoned carts and carriages their contents strewn about them in a frenzy of looting by the auxiliary cavalry but something stronger even than the knowledge that his own sanity depended on the outcome kept him in the saddle it was near dark when he recognized the long chestnut hair fluttering like a fallen banner below the overturned ox cart in the distance he imagined he could hear the cry
