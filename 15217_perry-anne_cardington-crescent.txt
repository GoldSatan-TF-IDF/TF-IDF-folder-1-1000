anne perry cardington crescent mrs peabody was hot and out of breath it was midsummer her stays imprisoned her unyieldingly and her gown with its fashionable bustle was far too heavy to allow her to go chasing down the pavement after a willful dog that was fast disappearing through the wroughtiron churchyard gates clarence mrs peabody cried out furiously clarence come back here at once but clarence who was fat and middleaged and should have known better squirmed through the gap and shot away into the long grass and the laurel bushes on the other side of the railings mrs peabody gasping with annoyance and clinging on to her broad hat with one hand sending it rakishly over her eyes tried with the other to force the gates open far enough to allow her extremely ample form to pass through the late mr peabody had preferred women of generous proportions he had said so frequently a mans wife should reflect his position in life dignified and substantial but it took more aplomb than mrs peabody possessed to remain dignified while caught by ones bosom in a churchyard gate with ones hat askew and a dog yelping like a fiend a dozen yards away clarence she shrieked again and drawing in her breath gave a mighty heave which had the opposite effect from the one desired she let out a wail of desperation and struggled through her bustle now alarmingly closer to her left hip clarence was barking hysterically and scuffling in the laurel bushes the ground was dry after a week without rain and he was sending up spurts of dust but he had his prize a very large soddenlooking parcel wrapped in brownish paper and tied securely with twine under clarences determined efforts it was now torn in several places and beginning to come undone drop it mrs peabody commanded clarence ignored her drop it she repeated wrinkling her nose in distaste it was really very unpleasant it appeared to be kitchen leavingsunusable meat clarence the dog ripped off a large piece of the paper wet with blood and coming away easily then she saw itskin human skin pale and soft she screamed then as clarence exposed more of it she screamed again and again and again until her lungs were bursting and she could not find breath and the world spun round her in a red haze she fell to the ground unaware of clarence still tugging at the parcel and passersby forcing their way through the stuck gate in alarm inspector thomas pitt looked up from his desk strewn with paper glad of the interruption what is it police constable stripe stood in the doorway his face a little pink above his stiff collar his eyes blinking im sorry sir but theres a report of a disturbance in st marys churchyard in bloomsbury an elderly person avin ysterics quite respectable and locally knownand doesnt touch the gin usband was temperance afore e died never bin a nuisance in the past perhaps shes ill pitt suggested doesnt need more than a constable does it maybe a doctor well sir stripe looked distressed seems er dog ran away and found this parcel in the bushes an she thought it was part of a person thats what gave er ysterics what on earth do you mean part of a person pitt demanded irritably he liked young wilberforce stripe he was normally keen and reliable this vague story was unlike him whats in this parcel well thats it mr pitt sir the constable on the beat says e asnt touched it moren necessary afore you get there sir but by is reckoning thats just what it isa part of a womans body theer he was clearly embarrassed he did not wish to be indelicate yet was aware that a policeman should be precise he placed one hand across his waist and the other across his neck the top alf sir pitt stood up papers cascading off his lap onto the floor and remaining there in spite of his seventeen years in london where the sumptuous and elegant heart of the empire disported itself a stones throw from slums that teemed with poverty so intense rotting tenements stood stacked against each other fifteen people to a room living and dying together he had not ceased to be shocked by the savagery of crime he could not grasp the massthe mind refused but the pain of the individual still had power to move him then wed better go and see he replied ignoring the disarray around him and leaving his hat on the stand where he had thrown it on arriving in the morning yes sir stripe fell in behind him following pitts familiar disheveled figure along the corridor down the steps past several other constables and into the hot and dusty street an empty hansom clattered past them not believing pitt with his coattails flapping and his tie askew to prove a likely fare stripe in uniform was not even worth considering pitt waved his arm and ran a few steps cabbie he shouted his anger directed not at the personal slight but against all crime in general and this one he was going to pursue in particular the cabbie drew rein and looked at him with disfavor yes sir st marys churchyard bloomsbury pitt scrambled in and held the door for stripe behind him will that be the east side or the west side the cabbie inquired the back gate off the avenue stripe put in helpfully thank you pitt acknowledged then to the cabbie get on with it man the cabbie flicked the whip and made encouraging sounds and they moved off rapidly increasing to a trot they rode in silence each absorbed in his own speculations as to what they might find this ere where you wanta be sir the cabbie leaned down and asked dubiously yes pitt had already seen the little knot of people and the harassed constable in the middle it was an ordinary rather seedy suburban churchyard dusty grass dry with the summer heat gravestones uneven and ornate marble angels and over on the right before the yew trees a clump of dark laurels he climbed out paid the driver then crossed the pavement and spoke to the constable who was obviously overwhelmed with relief to see him what have you got pitt asked dourly the constable jerked his elbow towards the high spiked railings but did not turn his head his face was pale and there was a heavy beading of sweat on his lip and across his brow he looked wretched top alf of a womans body sir he swallowed hard pretty orrible it is it was under them bushes who found it and when a mrs ernestine peabody out walking er pekingese dog by the name o clarence he glanced down at his notebook pitt read from it upside down th june pm called to st marys churchyard woman screaming where is she now pitt asked sittin on the seat in the church vestibule sir shes took pretty bad an i said as soon as youd spoke to er she could go ome its my opinion sir as she wont be much use to us probably not pitt agreed where is this parcel where i found it sir i didnt touch it moren to make sure she wasnt avindelusions like on the gin pitt went to the gates heavy wrought iron and stuck fast a little over a foot apart wedged in the ruts of the dried mud he squeezed through and walked along the inside of the railing till he came to the laurel bushes he knew stripe was immediately behind him the parcel was about nineteen inches square lying where clarence had left it paper torn and pulled away to expose the meatlike flesh and several inches of finegrained white skin smeared a little with blood there were flies beginning to gather he did not have to touch it to see that the portion showing was part of a womans breast he straightened up feeling so sick he was afraid he was going to faint he breathed deeplyin and out in and outand heard stripe blundering away choking and retching behind a gravestone carved with cherubs after a moment of staring at the dusty stones the trodden grass and the tiny yellow spots like pinheads on the laurel leaves he forced himself to turn back to the dreadful parcel there were details to note the kind and color of the paper the twine that wound it the type of knots people left their marktied string loosely or tightly length or width first made slipknots running knots tied at each crossover or merely looped and there were a dozen different ways of finishing off he blanked from his mind what was inside it and knelt to examine it turning it over gingerly when he had seen all he could from the top it was thick paper a little shiny on the inside two layers of it he had often seen such paper used for tying parcels of linen it was strong and usually crackled a little if touchedonly this was wet with blood and made no sound even when he turned it inside the brown paper was clear greased kitchen paper another two layers the sort butchers sometimes use whoever had wrapped this hideous thing must have imagined it would hold the blood the string was unusualcoarse hairy twine yellow rather than white wrapped lengthways and widthways twice and knotted at each join and finally tied with a loop and two raw ends about an inch and a half long he took out his notebook and wrote it down though it was all something he would like to forgetwipe totally from his memory if he could stripe was coming back awkwardly embarrassed by his loss of composure he did not know what to say pitt said it for him there must be more wed better organize a search stripe cleared his throat more yes mr pitt but where should we start could be anywhere wont be very far pitt stood up knees stiff you dont carry that sort of thing longer than you have to certainly not further than you can walk even a lunatic doesnt get into a hansom or a public omnibus with a bundle like that under his arm should be within a radius of a mile at the outside stripes brows went up would e walk a mile sir i wouldnt more like five undred yards if that five hundred in each direction pitt answered somewhere five hundred yards from here he waved his arm round the compass in each stripes blue eyes were confused pitt put the thought into words must be a whole body altogether thats about six parcels roughly this size he couldnt carry them all at once unless he used a barrow and i doubt hed draw attention to himself by doing that he certainly wouldnt be likely to borrow one and who owns barrows except tradesmen and costers but well check for any seen in this area either yesterday or today yes sir stripe was intensely relieved to have something to do anything was better than standing there helplessly while the flies buzzed round the appalling heap in the grass send a message back to the station that we need half a dozen constables and the mortuary cart and the surgeon yes sir stripe forced himself to look down once more perhaps because he felt somehow callous disregarding the enormity of it walking away without some acknowledgment it was the same instinct that makes one take off ones hat at the sight of a hearse passing in the street even though one has no idea who is dead pitt walked between the gravestones curled and decorated marred by weeds and came to the graveled entrance to the church the door was open and it was cool inside it took a moment for his eyes to adjust to the gloom and the hazy colored splashes on the stones from the stained glass a large woman was collapsed half prostrate on a wooden seat her hat on the floor beside her the neck of her dress undone the sextons wife holding a glass of water in one hand and a bottle of ammonia smelling salts in the other was muttering something comforting they both looked round startled as pitts footsteps sounded on the floor a gingercolored pekingese dog was asleep in the doorway in the sun and ignored him completely mrs peabody she stared at him with a mixture of suspicion and anticipation it was not entirely displeasing to be the epicenter of such a dramaproviding of course that everyone understood she had no connection with it but that of an innocent woman drawn in by chance i am she she said somewhat unnecessarily pitt had met many mrs peabodys before and he knew not only what she felt now but what nightmares were to come he sat down on the bench beside her a yard away you must be extremely distressedhe hurried on as she drew in a gasp of breath to tell him precisely how muchso i will trouble you as little as possible when was the last time you walked your dog past the churchyard her carefully arched eyebrows shot up into her rather sandy hairline i dont think you understand young man i am not in the habit of finding such such she could frame no words for the quite genuine horror that seized her im sure pitt said grimly i assume that if it had been there the last time your dog would have found it then mrs peabody in spite of her shock was not without common sense she saw the point immediately oh i came this way yesterday afternoon and clarence did not she trailed off not liking to complete such an unnecessary remark i see thank you do you know if clarence pulled the parcel out from under the bushes or was it already out she shook her head it did not matter except that had it been in the open it would probably have been noticed earlier almost certainly whoever had put it there had taken the time to hide it also there was really nothing else to ask her but her name and address he left them and went outside again into the heat and began to think about organizing a search it was half past four by seven oclock they had found them all it was a grim business going down the steps into disused areaways sifting through refuse in rubbish cans that could be reached from the street poking under bushes and behind railings parcel by parcel the rest were retrieved the worst was in a narrow and fetid alley just over a mile from the churchyard in the sour tenements of st giles it should have provided the first clue to her identity but as with two of the others feral cats had discovered it first led by scent and their ever devouring hunger there was nothing recognizable now but long fair hair and a crushing injury to the skull the long summer day did not darken till ten in the evening pitt trudged from door to door asking pleading occasionally bullying an unfortunate servant into an admission of guilt for some domestic misdemeanorperhaps an illicit flirtation that had held them on the back steps longer than usualbut no one admitted to having seen anything remotely relevant there had been no costermongers but those on long known and legitimate business no residents or strangers carrying mysterious parcels no one hurrying furtively and no one reported missing pitt was back at the police station as the sun set cherryred over the roofs and the gaslights came on in the fashionable thoroughfares like so many straying moons inside the station smelled of closed doors heat the sharpness of ink and brand new linoleum on the floor the police surgeon was waiting for him shirt sleeves still rolled up and stained his waistcoat done up on the wrong buttons he looked tired and there was a smear of blood across his nose well pitt asked wearily young woman the man sat down without being asked fair hair fair skin as near as one can tell she might have been quite goodlooking she certainly wasnt any beggar hands were clean no broken nails but shed done a bit of housework my first guess would be a parlormaid but its only a guess he sighed and shed had a child but not within the last few months pitt sat down behind his desk and leaned on his elbows how old for gods sake man how do i know the doctor said angrily his pity disgust and sheer helplessness spilling over at the only victim available you present me with a corpse in half a dozen pieces like so much offal from some bloody butcher and you want me to tell you who she was well i cant he stood up knocking his chair over she was a young woman probably in domestic service and some lunatic murdered her by hitting her on the back of the head and then god knows why cut her into pieces and left her strewn around bloomsbury and st giles youll be damned lucky if you ever find out who she is still less who did that to her i sometimes wonder why you bother of the thousand different ways to murder people a crack on the head might be less cruel in the long run than some of the ways we ignore have you been in the tenements and lodging houses in st giles wapping mile end the last corpse i looked at was a twelveyearold girl died in childbirth he stopped his voice thick with tears he was only half embarrassed for he glanced at pitt savagely and strode out slamming the door pitt stood up slowly righted the chair and went out after him normally he would have walked home it was only a couple of miles but it was nearly eleven and he was tired and hungry and his feet hurt more than usual he took a hansom and ignored the expense the front of the house was dark and he let himself in with his key gracie the maid would long have gone to bed but he could see a light on in the kitchen and he knew charlotte would be waiting for him sighing he took off his boots with relief and walked along the corridor feeling the coolness of the linoleum through his socks charlotte was in the doorway the gas lamp behind her shining on the auburn in her hair and catching the warm curve of her cheek without saying anything she put her arms round him and held him surprisingly tightly for a moment he was afraid something was wrong that one of the children was ill then he realized she would of course have seen an evening newspaper if it had not mentioned his name she had guessed from his lateness that he was involved he had not intended to tell her in spite of all the cases she had concerned herself with part of him still believed she should be protected from such horror most men felt their homes were a retreat from the harshness and frequently the ugliness of the outside world a place to refresh both body and spirit before returning again to the fray women were part of that gentler better place but charlotte had seldom done the expected even before she had appalled her wellbred family by marrying into the police a descent so radical she was fortunate they had not disowned her now she loosed herself a little and looked up at him her face puckered with concern you are on that case arent you thomas that poor woman found in st marys churchyard yes he kissed her gently then again hoping she would not talk about it he was so tired he hurt and there was nothing to say as she grew older charlotte was learning when to keep her own counsel a little more but this was not one of those occasions she had read the extra edition of the newspaper with horror and pity cooked two dinners for pitt and had to abandon them both and she expected at the very least that he would share with her the thoughts and some of the feelings that had possessed him during the day are you going to find out who she was she asked pulling back and starting for the kitchen have you eaten no of course i havent he said wearily following her but dont bother cooking anything now her eyebrows shot up but this time she glanced at his face and bit her tongue behind her on the blackened and polished range the kettle was billowing clouds of steam would you like cold mutton pickle and fresh bread she asked sweetly and a cup of tea he smiled in spite of himself it would be easier and pleasanter in the long run to surrender yes i would he sat down putting his jacket over the back of the chair she hesitated then decided it would be wiser to make the tea before saying anything more but there was a little upward quirk at the corner of her mouth five minutes later he had three slices of crumbly bread a pile of homemade chutneycharlotte was very good at chutney and marmaladeseveral slices of meat and a breakfast cup full of steaming tea charlotte had contained herself long enough are you going to find out who she was i doubt it he said filling his mouth with food she stared at him solemnly wont somebody report her missing bloomsbury is quite a respectable area people who have parlormaids notice if theyre gone in spite of their six years of marriage and all the cases she had one way or another found herself involved in she still carried with her remnants of the innocence in which she had grown up protected from unpleasantness imprisoned from the harshness and the excitement of the world as young ladies of gentility should be to begin with charlottes breeding had awed pitt and in her blinder moments angered him but mostly it disappeared in all the infinitely more important things they shared laughter at lifes absurdities tenderness passion and anger at the same injustices thomas my darling charlotte she doesnt have to have come from bloomsbury and even if she did how many maids do you suppose have been dismissed for any number of reasons from dishonesty to having been caught in the arms of the master of the house others will have eloped or been supposed to haveor lifted the family silver and disappeared into the night parlormaids arent like that she protested arent you even going to ask after her we have done he replied with a tired edge to his voice had she no idea how futile it wasand that he would already have done everything he could did she not know that much of him after all this time she bent her head looking down at the tablecloth im sorry i suppose youll never know probably not he agreed picking up his cup is that a letter from emily on the mantelpiece yes emily was her younger sister who had married as far above herself as charlotte had descended she is staying with greataunt vespasia in cardington crescent i thought greataunt vespasia lived in gadstone park she does theyre all staying with uncle eustace march he grunted there was nothing to say to that he had a deep admiration for the elegant waspish lady vespasia cumminggould but eustace march he had never heard of nor did he wish to she sounds very unhappy charlotte went on looking at him anxiously im sorry he did not meet her eyes but fished for another piece of bread and the chutney dish but theres nothing we can do i daresay shes bored this time he did look up fixing her with something approaching a glare and you will go nowhere near bloomsbury not even to visit some long lost friend either of yours or of emilys is that understood charlotte yes thomas she said with wide eyes i dont think i know anybody in bloomsbury anyway emily was indeed profoundly unhappy in spite of the fact that she looked magnificent in a shimmering aquamarine gown of daring and elegant cut and was sitting in the marches private box at the savoy on stage in all its delicious lyrical charm was messrs gilbert and sullivans opera iolanthe of which she was particularly fond the very idea of a youth half human and half fairy divided at the waist normally appealed to her sense of the absurd tonight it passed her by the cause of her distress was that for several days now her husband george had taken no pains at all to hide the fact that he very evidently preferred sybilla marchs company to emilys he was perfectly civil in an automatic kind of way which was worse than rudeness rudeness would at least have meant he was sharply aware of her not dimly as of something blurred at the edge of his vision it was sybillas presence that brought the light to his face it was she his eyes followed she whose words held his attention whose wit made him laugh now he was sitting behind her and to emily she looked as gaudy as some overblown flower in her flamecolored gown with her white skin and peatwaterdark eyes and all that opulent mass of hair in spite of the hurt and the foolishness of it emily glanced sideways at him often enough to know that george barely looked at the stage the heros plight did not move him in the slightest nor the heroines winsome flirtations nor the fairy queen nor iolanthe herself he did smile and move his fingers gently in time to the peers song which surely would move anyone at all and his attention was caught for a moments sheer pleasure in the dancing trio with the lord high chancellor kicking his legs in the air with abandoned glee emily could feel the misery and panic growing inside her everything around was color gaiety and sound every face she could see was smilinggeorge at sybilla uncle eustace march at himself sybillas husband william at the fantasy on stage his youngest sister tassie only nineteen thin as her mother had been and with a shock of hair the color of sunlight on apricots was definitely smiling at the principal tenor old mrs march her grandmother was twitching the corner of her tight lips upward in spite of herself she did not care to be amused greataunt vespasia tassies maternal grandmother on the other hand was delighted she had a marked sense of the ridiculous and had long ago ceased to care a jot what anyone else thought of her that left only jack radley the single nonfamily guest of the evening currently also staying at cardington crescent he was a ravishingly handsome young man with excellent connections but unfortunately no money worth mentioning and a highly dubious reputation with women he was another outsider and for that alone emily could have liked him regardless of his grace or his humor it was fairly obvious that he had been invited with a view to arranging a marriage for tassie the only one of the ten march daughters still unmarried the purpose of this liaison was not yet plain since tassie did not appear to be fond of him and had considerably more substantial expectations than he although his family was related to those who held power he himself had no prospects william had said unkindly that eustace hungered for a knighthoodand in time perhaps a peerageas the ultimate accolade to his familys rise from trade to respectability but that was surely an observation more malicious than truthful there was a tension between father and son a sharpness that intruded like a sudden splinter of glass every now and then small but surprisingly painful at present william was behind emilys chair and he was the only one she could not see during the interval it was he who brought her wine and a chocolate bonbon not george george was standing in the corner laughing at something sybilla had said emily forced herself to make some sort of conversation knowing it was a failure even as the words fell into hot silence and the minute after she wished she had not said them she was relieved when the curtain went up again i cannot think where mr gilbert gets such ridiculous plots old mrs march drummed her fingers irritably when the final applause had died there is absolutely no sense in it at all there is not meant to be grandmama sybilla said with a dreamy smile mrs march stared at her over her pincenez the black velvet ribbon dangling down her cheek someone who is foolish because nature has so designed them i pity someone who is foolish by intention it is beyond me to understand she said coldly that i can well believe jack radley murmured behind emilys ear and id swear mr gilbert would find her equally incomprehensibleonly he wouldnt care my dear lavinia he is no more foolish than some of the romances by madam ouida which i see you reading under brown paper covers mrs marchs face froze but there were pink spots in her cheeks where rouge would have been on a younger woman she deplored the vulgarity of painting ones face women who did that were of a certain sort you are quite mistaken vespasia she snapped it is a pity your vanity prevents you obtaining a pair of spectacles one of these days you will fall downstairs or otherwise make an unfortunate exhibition of yourself william you had better give your grandmama your arm i dont wish to be the center of attention as we leave she rose to her feet and turned to the door especially of that kind you wont be vespasia retorted not as long as sybilla insists upon wearing scarlet very suitable for her emily said before she thought she had intended it to be inaudible but just at the precise moment everyone around them stopped speaking and her voice came clearly into the pause there was a touch of color in georges face and she looked away instantly wishing she had bitten her tongue till it bled rather than betray herself so nakedly im so glad you like it sybilla answered quite calmly rising also there seemed no end to her aplomb we all have colors which flatter us and those which dont i doubt i should look as well as you do in that shade of blue that made it worse instead of spitting back she had been charming even now george was smiling at her almost as if some invisible current had designed it they were swept out of the box into the eddy of people pressing to reach the foyer george next to sybilla offering his arm as if anything less would have been uncivil emily found herself hotfaced and stumbling being pushed and jostled forward with jack radleys arm about her and greataunt vespasias beautiful silver head in front once they reached the foyer it was inescapable that they should meet with people they knew and be obliged to exchange opinions and inquiries as to health and all the other chitchat of such an occasion it swam over her head in a senseless bedlam she nodded and smiled and agreed with everything that penetrated into her mind someone asked after her son edward and she replied that he was at home and very well then george nudged her sharply and she remembered to inquire after the family of the speaker it all babbled on around her delightful performance have you seen pinafore how does that piece go again shall you be at henley i do love regattas such a delightful thing for a hot day dont you agree i prefer goodwood there is something about the racesall the silks dont you know but my dear what about ascot i rather care for wimbledon myself i havent a thing to wear i must see my dressmaker immediatelyi really need an entire new wardrobe wasnt the royal academy too frightful this year my dear i do agree perfectly tedious clumsily she survived nearly half an hour of such greetings and comments before at last finding herself alone in her carriage with george beside her stiff and more distant than a stranger what on earth is the matter with you emily george said after they had sat in silence for ten minutes while carriages ahead of them picked up their owners finally the way ahead was clear down the strand should she lie evade the moment of commitment to the quarrel which she knew he would hate george was tolerant generous of an easy nature but he wanted emotion only at times of his own choosing and most certainly not now when he was full of the echoes of such civilized enjoyment half of her wanted to face him let all her scalding hurt burst out demand he explain himself and his wounding and outrageous behavior but just as she opened her mouth to reply cowardice overcame her once she had spoken it would be too late to draw back she would have cut off her only retreat it was so unlike hershe was usually mistress of herself so coolly with such measured reaction it was part of what had first drawn him to her now she betrayed all that and took the easy lie despising herself and hating him for reducing her to it i dont feel very well she said stiffly i think perhaps the theater was a little hot i didnt notice it he was still annoyed nor did anyone else it was on the tip of her tongue to point out how profoundly he had been otherwise engaged but again she avoided the crisis then maybe i am feverish spend tomorrow in bed there was no sympathy in his voice he just wants me to stay out of the way she thought before i become even more of a nuisance and an embarrassment to him tears prickled in her eyes and she swallowed hard painfully grateful to be in the close sharp darkness of the carriage she said nothing in case her voice betrayed her and george did not pursue the subject they rode through the summer night their way lit by the hundred yellow moons of the gas lamps hearing nothing but the steady clopclop of the horses hooves and the rumble of the wheels when they reached cardington crescent the footman opened the doors and emily climbed down and went up the steps under the portico and in through the front door without even glancing to see if george was behind her it was customary to attend a dinner party before the opera and a supper party afterwards but old mrs march did not feel her health equal to bothalthough in fact there was nothing whatsoever wrong with her except ageso they had forgone the supper now a late meal was served in the withdrawing room but emily could not face the laughter the bright lights of the chandeliers and the probing eyes if you will excuse me emily said to no one in particular it has been a delightful evening but i am rather tired and i would prefer to retire i wish you all a good night not waiting for a reply she continued straight on to the foot of the stairs before anyones voice held her back it was not george as she ached for it to be but jack radley only a pace behind her are you all right lady ashworth you look a little pale shall we have something sent up to you already he was at her elbow no thank you she said quickly i am sure i shall be quite well when i have rested she must not be seen to be rudeit was so childish she forced herself to turn and look at him he was smiling he really did have the most remarkable eyes he contrived to look intimate even when she barely knew him and yet it was not quite enough to be intrusive she could see quite well how he had gained his reputation with women it would serve george right if she fell as much in love with radley as george had with sybilla are you sure he repeated quite she answered expressionlessly thank you and she went up the stairs as rapidly as she could without appearing to run she was only on the landing when she heard the conversation resume the laughter peal again the gay lilt of people who are still in the spell of totally carefree pleasure she woke to find herself alone and the sunlight streaming in through a crack in the imperfectly drawn curtains george was not there nor had he been his side of the enormous bed was immaculate the linen crisp she had intended to have her breakfast sent up but now her own company was worse than anyone elses and she rang sharply for her maid refusing morning tea and sending her off to draw a bath and set out emilys clothes for the morning she put a wrap round her shoulders and knocked sharply on the dressing room door after several moments it was opened by george looking sleepy and rumpled his thick hair falling loosely his eyes wide and dark oh he said blinking at her since you werent well i thought id not disturb you so i had them make up the bed in here he did not ask if she was better he merely looked at her at her milky skin with its faint blush and her coil of pale honey hair came to his own conclusion and retreated back to prepare himself for the day breakfast was grim eustace as always had thrown all the dining room windows open he was a great believer in muscular christianity and all the aggressive good health that went with it he ate pigeons in jelly with ostentatious relish and piles of hot buttered toast and marmalade and barricaded himself behind the times ironed and given him by the footman which he did not offer to share with anyone not of course that any man offered his newspaper to women but eustace also ignored william george and jack radley vespasia to eustaces eternal disapproval had her own newspaper there has been a murder in bloomsbury she observed over the raspberries what has that to do with us eustace did not look up the remark was intended as a criticism women should not have newspapers let alone discuss them at breakfast about as much as anything else that is in here vespasia replied it is to do with people and tragedy nonsense old mrs march snapped probably some person of the criminal classes who thoroughly deserved it eustace would you be good enough to pass me the court circular i wish to know what is happening that is of some importance she shot a look of distaste at vespasia i trust no one has forgotten we have a luncheon party at the withingtons and that we are playing croquet at lady lucy armstrongs in the afternoon she went on glancing at sybilla with a frown and a faint curl of her lip lady lucy will be full of the eton and harrow cricket match of course and we shall be obliged to listen to her boasting endlessly about her sons and we shall have nothing to say at all sybilla colored a stiff painful red her eyes were bright she stared straight back at her grandmotherinlaw with an expression which might have been any of a dozen things we shall have to see whether it is a boy or a girl before we consider a school she said very clearly william stopped his fork halfway to his mouth incredulous george drew in his breath in a little hiss of surprise eustace lowered his paper for the first time since he had sat down and stared at her with amazement then slow dawning jubilation sybilla my dear girl do you mean that you are er yes she said boldly i would not have told you so soon but i am tired of grandmotherinlaw making such remarks you cannot blame me mrs march defended herself sharply youve been twelve years about it it is not surprising i despaired of the march name continuing heaven knows poor william has had his patience strained to breaking point waiting for you to give him an heir williams head came round to glare at his grandmother his cheeks burning his eyes hot blue that is absolutely none of your affair he said abruptly and i find your remarks inexpressibly vulgar he pushed his chair back rose and walked from the room well well eustace folded his newspaper and poured himself another cup of coffee congratulations my dear better late than never mrs march conceded although i doubt you will have many more now sybilla still looked flushed and now thoroughly uncomfortable for the only time since her arrival emily felt sorry for her but the emotion was shortlived the next few days passed in the customary fashion of society during the season in the mornings they rode in the park at which emily had taught herself to be both graceful and skilled but she had not the outrageous flair of sybilla and since george was a natural horseman it seemed almost inevitable that they should more often than not end up side by side at some distance from the others william never came preferring to work at his painting which was his profession as well as his vocation he was gifted to the degree that his works were admired by academicians and collected by connoisseurs only eustace affected to find it displeasing that his only son preferred to retire alone to the studio arranged for him in the conservatory and make use of the morning light rather than parade on horseback for the fashionable world to admire when they did not ride they drove in the carriage went shopping paid calls upon their more intimate friends or visited art galleries and exhibitions luncheon was usually at about two oclock often at someone elses house in a small party in the afternoon they attended concerts or drove to richmond or hurlingham or else made the necessary more formal calls upon those ladies they knew only slightly perching awkwardly around withdrawing rooms backs stiff and making idiotic chatter about people gowns and the weather the men excused themselves from this last activity and retired to one or another of their clubs at four there was afternoon tea sometimes at home sometimes out at a garden party once there was a game of croquet at which george partnered sybilla and lost hopelessly amid peals of laughter and a sense of delight that infinitely outweighed emilys who won the taste of victory was ashes in her mouth not even eustace who partnered her seemed to notice her all eyes were on sybilla dressed in cherry pink her cheeks flushed her eyes radiant and laughing so easily at her own ineptitude everyone wished to laugh with her again emily drove home in bitter silence before going leadenfooted up the stairs to change for dinner and the theater by sunday she could bear it no longer they had all been to church in the morning eustace insisted upon it he was the patriarch of a godly family and must be seen to be so dutifully because they were guests in his house they wenteven jack radley to whom it was far from a natural inclination he would much rather have spent his summer sundays in a good gallop in the park with the sun sparkling through the trees and wind in his face scattering birds dogs and onlookers alikeas indeed so would george normally but today george seemed positively happy to sit on the hard pew next to emily his eyes always wandering to sybilla luncheon was spent discussing the sermon which had been earnest and tedious dissecting it for deeper meaning by the time they came to the fruit eustace had pronounced that its real subject was the virtue of fortitude and of bearing all affliction with a stiff upper lip only william was either sufficiently interested or sufficiently angry to bother to contradict him and assert that on the contrary it was about compassion nonsense eustace said briskly you were always too soft william always for taking the easy way out too many sisters thats your trouble should have been a girl yourself courage he banged the table with his fist thats what it takes to be a manand a christian the rest of the meal was eaten in silence the afternoon was spent reading and writing letters the evening was even worse they sat around striving to make conversation suitable to the sabbath until sybilla was invited to play the piano which she did rather well and with obvious enjoyment everyone except emily was drawn in singing ballads and occasionally more serious solos sybilla had a very rich voice a little husky with a slight catch in it upstairs at last her throat sore with the effort of not crying emily dismissed her maid and began to undress herself george came in and closed the door with an unnecessarily loud noise couldnt you have made more of an effort emily he said coldly your sullenness was verging on bad manners it was too much the injustice of it was intolerable bad manners she gasped how dare you stand there and accuse me of bad manners you have spent the entire fortnight seducing your hosts daughterinlaw in front of everyone even the servants and because i dont care to join in with you you accuse me of being illmannered the color flamed up in his face but he stood perfectly still you are hysterical he said quietly perhaps you would be better alone until you can collect yourself i shall sleep in the dressing room the bed is still made up i can perfectly easily tell everyone you are not feeling well and i dont wish to disturb you his nostrils flared very slightly and a flicker of irritation crossed his face they wont find that hard to believe good night and a moment later he was gone emily stood numbed by the monstrosity of it it was so utterly unfair it took several moments to assimilate it then she threw herself onto the bed punched the pillow with all her strength and burst into tears she wept till her eyes were burning and her lungs ached and still she felt no betteronly too tired to hurt so fiercely anymoreuntil tomorrow emily woke very early in the morning even before the housemaids were up and reviewed the situation last nights crisis had swept away the paralysis of indecision the fending off of the knowledge which she knew must come with all its misery she made a resolution she would fight sybilla was not going to win simply because emily had neither the wit nor the strength to give her a battle however far it had gone and she was obliged to admit briefly and painfully that it had probably gone all the waywitness georges alacrity in provoking an excuse to sleep in the dressing room even so emily would use every skill she possessed to win him back and she had a great deal of skill after all she had won him in the first place against considerable odds if she were to continue to appear as wretched as she felt she would embarrass the rest of the household and lay herself open to a pity that would not comfortably be forgotten even when the affair was over and she had won most important it would not be in the least attractive to george like most men he loved a gay and charming woman who had enough sense to keep her troubles to herself an excess of emotion especially in public would make him acutely uncomfortable far from winning him away from sybilla it would drive him further into her arms therefore emily would act the role of her life she would be so utterly charming and delightful george would find sybilla a pale copy a shadow and emily again the true substance for three days she kept up her charade without noticeable failure if she felt close to weeping again she was sure no one else saw itexcept perhaps greataunt vespasia who saw everything but she did not mind that behind the ineffable elegance and the radical humor aunt vespasia was the one person who cared for her however it had proved so difficult at times she was all but overcome with the futility of it she was bound to fail she knew her voice sounded flat her smile must be sickly but since there was nothing else with any hope of success after a moments solitudeperhaps merely in walking from one room to anothershe had renewed her effort trying with every strength she possessed to be amusing considerate and courteous she even forced herself to be civil to old mrs march although she could not resist exercising her wit on her in her absence to the rather exuberant laughter of jack radley by dinner on the third day it was becoming extremely difficult they were all most formally dressed emily in pale green sybilla in indigo sitting round the monstrous mahogany table in the dining room rust red velvet curtains heavily swagged and draped and too many pictures on the wall made emily feel suffocated it was almost unendurable to force the smile to her lips to dredge up from a weary and fearful imagination some light and flippant remark she pushed the food round her plate without eating and sipped more and more wine she must not do anything as obvious as flirting with william that would be seen as retaliationeven by george uninterested as he wasand certainly by everyone else old mrs marchs needle eyes missed nothing she had been a widow forty years presiding over her domestic kingdom with a will of iron and an insatiable curiosity emily must be equally entertaining equally delightful to everyoneincluding sybillaas befitted a woman of her position even if it choked her she was careful not to cap other peoples stories and to laugh while meeting their eyes so as to appear sincere she searched for the appropriate compliment just truthful enough to be believed and listened with attention to eustaces interminably boring anecdotes about his athletic exploits when younger he was a great and vociferous believer in a healthy mind in a healthy body and had no time for aesthetes his disappointment was implicit in every phrase and watching williams tense face across the table emily found it increasingly hard to hold her peace and keep her expression composed in polite interest after the sweet with nothing left on the table but vanilla ice raspberry water and a little fruit tassie said something about a soiree she had been to and how bored she had been which earned her a look of disgust from her grandmother it struck a sudden chord of memory in emily she looked across at jack radley with a tiny smile they can be fearful she agreed on the other hand they can also be superb tassie who was on the same side of the table and could not see emilys face was unaware of her mood this was a large soprano singing rather badly she explained and so terribly serious so was the best one ive ever been to emily felt the memory sharper in her mind as the scene came back to her charlotte and i once took mama it was marvelous indeed mrs march said coldly i had no idea you were musical emily continued to keep a sweet expression ignoring the implication and stared straight at jack radley with a stinging pleasure she knew that she had his attention as deeply as she would like to have had georges and with precisely the same nature of excitement go on he urged whatever can be marvelous about an overweight soprano singing earnestly and badly william shivered like tassie he was thin and sensitive with vividly red hair although his was darker and his features sharper etched with an inner pain that had not yet touched her emily recounted it exactly as it had been she was a large lady very ardent with a pink face her gown was beaded and fringed practically everywhere so that it shivered when she moved miss arbuthnot was playing the pianoforte for her she was very thin and wearing black they huddled together for several minutes over the music and then the soprano came forward and announced that she would sing home sweet home which as you know is heavy and extremely sentimental afterwards to cheer us up she would give us yumyums delightful lighthearted song from the mikado three little maids much better tassie agreed that goes along at a lovely pace although she hardly sounds like my idea of yumyum and she hummed a bar or two cheerfully marvelous is overstating it rather a lot eustace said critically good song ruined emily ignored him she faced us all she continued composed her features into lines of deep emotion and began slowly and very solemnly with a blast of sentimentonly the piano bounded away with the trills and twitters of a rollicking rhythm only jack radleys face registered understanding be it ever so huumble emily mimicked sonorously at once savage and doleful dadididumdum da da deeee jack sang with delight oh no tassies eyes lit with joy and she started to giggle sybilla joined in and even eustace smiled in spite of himself they trailed off scarletfaced emily said enthusiastically the soprano stammered her apologies wheeled round and charged to the piano where miss arbuthnot was fumbling wildly through sheets of music scattering them to the floor they gathered them all up muttering fiercely together and wagging their fingers at each other while we all sat and tried to pretend we had not really noticed nobody said anything and charlotte and i dared not look at each other in case we lost control finally they came to some agreement new music was set up on the piano and the soprano advanced purposefully to the front of the floor again and faced us she took an enormous breath her beads jangled at her throat and all but broke and with tremendous aplomb she began a spirited rendition three little maids from school are we filled to the brim with girlish glee she hesitated a moment staring straight into jack radleys dark blue eyes unfortunately miss arbuthnot was crashing out the ponderous chords of home sweet home with a look of intense longing on her face this time even the old ladys mouth twitched tassie was helpless with giggles and everyone else chortled with pleasure they struggled on for a full three minutes emily said finally getting louder and louder trying to outdo each other till the chandeliers rattled charlotte and i couldnt bear it any longer we stood up at precisely the same moment and fled through the chairs falling over peoples feet till we collided in the doorway and almost fell outside clasping each other we gave way and laughed till we cried even mama when she caught up with us didnt have the heart to be angry oh how that takes me back vespasia said with a broad smile dabbing at the tears on her cheeks ive been to so many ghastly soirees now i shall never be able to listen to an earnest soprano again without thinking of this there are so many fearful singers i should like such a thing to happen toit would be such a mercy for the rest of us so should i tassie agreed starting with mr beamish and his songs of pure womanhood i suppose with a little foresight it could be arranged she added hopefully anastasia mrs march said with ice in her voice you will do nothing of the sort it would be quite irresponsible and in the worst possible taste i forbid you even to entertain the idea but tassies smile remained radiant her eyes faraway and shining who is mr beamish jack radley asked curiously the vicar eustace said frostily you heard his sermon on sunday greataunt vespasia smothered a deep gurgle in her throat and began to take the stones out of her grapes assiduously with a silver knife and fork placing them with elegant fingers on the side of her plate mrs march waited impatiently at last she stood up rustling her skirts noisily and tweaking the tablecloth so the silver rattled and george snatched at a swaying glass and caught it just as it overbalanced it is time the ladies withdrew she announced loudly fixing first vespasia and then sybilla with a stony stare she knew tassie and emily would not dare disobey vespasia rose to her feet with the grace she had never lost the air of moving at precisely her own speed and the rest of the world might follow or not as it chose reluctantly the others rose also tassie demure sybilla svelte smiling over her shoulder at the men emily with a sinking feeling inside her a taste of pyrrhic victory fast losing its savor im sure something could be contrived aunt vespasia said quietly to tassie with a little imagination tassie looked confused about what grandmama mr beamish of course vespasia snapped i have longed for years to take that fatuous smile off his face they swept past emily side by side whispering and on into the withdrawing room spacious and cool in pale greens it was one of the few rooms in the house olivia march had been permitted to redecorate from the old ladys taste which was dictated at a time when the weight of ones furniture indicated the worthiness and sobriety of ones life later fashion had changed and status and novelty became the criteria but olivias taste flowered during the oriental period around the international exhibition of and the withdrawing room was gentle full of soft colors and with only sufficient furniture to afford comfort quite unlike old mrs marchs boudoir the other downstairs sitting room was all hot rose pinks with drapes over mantel and piano and jardinieres photographs and antimacassars emily followed them and took her seat after offering token assistance to old mrs march she must keep up the act every moment until she was alone in her room women especially notice everything they would observe the least flicker of expression or intonation of the voice and they would interpret it with minute understanding thank you mrs march said tersely rearranging her skirts to fall more elegantly and patting her hair it was thick and mouse gray elaborately coifed in a fashion common thirty years before during the crimean war emily wondered fleetingly how long it had taken the maid to dress it like that there was not a wisp out of place nor had there been at breakfast or luncheon perhaps it was a wig she would love to have knocked it and found out so kind of you mrs march went on too many young people have lost the consideration one would wish she looked at no one in particular but the tightening at the corners of her mouth betrayed an irritation that was not in the least impersonal emily knew tassie was going to receive a curt lecture on the duties of a good daughter the moment they were alone foremost among them being obedience and attention to ones bettersand doing everything possible in aiding ones family to obtain for one a suitable marriage at the very minimum one positively did not get in the way of such efforts and sybilla also would come in for some grim correction emily smiled warmly back at her even if it was amusement disguised not sympathy i daresay they are merely preoccupied she said sententiously they are no more preoccupied than we were mrs march retorted with a waspish glare we also had to make our way you know being with child is an excuse for fainting and weeping but not for sheer inconsideration i have had seven children myselfi know what i am talking about not that i am not pleased goodness knows it is more than time we were beginning to despair such a tragedy for a woman to be barren she glanced at emilys slender waist with implied criticism she has certainly caused great disappointment to poor eustace he so much wanted william to have an heir the family you know the family is everything when all is said and done she sniffed emily was silent there was nothing to say and that curious pity came back violently unwelcome she did not want to remember that sybilla also had been an outsider in this family a failure in the one achievement that mattered to them mrs march settled a little deeper into her chair better late than never i say she repeated now she will stay at home and do her duty fulfill herself instead of all this ridiculous chasing of fashion so shallow and unworthy now she will make william happy and create the kind of home for him he should have emily was not listening of course if sybilla was pregnant it might account for at least some of her behavior emily could quite clearly remember her own mixture of excitement and fear when she was expecting edward it was a total change in her life something that was happening to her and was irreversible she was no longer alone in a unique way she had become two people but for all georges pleasure it had set a distance between them and sharp in the middle of all of that was her fear of becoming ungainly vulnerable and no longer attractive to him if sybilla in her middle thirties were facing this confusion of emotionsand perhaps also a fear of childbirth the pain the helplessness the utter indignity and even the vague possibility of deathit might well account for her selfishness now her compulsion to draw all the masculine attention while she still felt she could before matronliness made her awkward and eventually confined her but it did not excuse george fury choked emily like a hot lump in her chest all sorts of actions careered through her mind she could go upstairs and wait until he came and then accuse him outright of behaving like a fool of embarrassing and insulting her and offending not only william but uncle eustace because it was his house and even all the rest of them because they were fellow guests she could tell him to restrict his attentions to sybilla to those courtesies which were usual or emily would leave for home immediately and have nothing more to do with him until he made full apologiesand amends then the rage died a feud would bring her no happiness george would either be cowed and obey which she would despiseand so would heand her victory would be bitter and of no satisfaction or else he would be driven even further in his pursuit of sybilla simply to show emily that she could not dictate to him and the latter was far the more likely damn men she gritted her teeth and swallowed hard damn men for their stupidity their pigheaded perversenessand above all for their vanity she could feel the lump growing larger in her throat impossible to swallow there was so much in george she loved he was gentle tolerant generousand he could be so much fun why did he have to be such a fool she shut her eyes opening them again only with effort aunt vespasia was staring at her well emily she said briskly i am still waiting to hear an account of your visit to winchester you have told me nothing there was no escape she was drawn into conversation she knew aunt vespasia had done it intentionally and she did not want to let her down by being defeatist aunt vespasia would never have given up and gone away into a corner to cry certainly she said with artificial eagerness and she plunged into a story largely invented as she went along she was still involved in its ramifications when the gentlemen rejoined them rather earlier than usual all evening she managed to keep up the charade and when it was finally time to retire she had the small victory of having lived up to the task she had set herself she saw the flash of approval in aunt vespasias silvergray eyes and something in tassies face that could have been admiration but only once had george looked at her and his smile was so artificial it hurt more than a scowl because it was as if he did not see her at all the sense of closeness had come from a direction she had learned to expect but when she thought about it not really to welcome it was jack radley who joined her laughter whose quick humor followed hers and who at the end of the evening walked up the broad stairs with his hand at her elbow she stopped on the landing almost oblivious of him waiting for georges step but hearing instead the rustle of silk against the bannisters below her she knew it would be sybilla and yet compulsion a thread of hope kept her looking till they came into sight just in case it was not george was smiling the gas bracket on the wall shone on his dark hair and the white skin of sybillas shoulders george moved away from her as he saw emily the spontaneity dying out of his face and faint embarrassment taking its place he looked back at sybilla good night and thank you for a most delightful evening he said awkwardly caught between the ease of intimacy the moment before and the faintly ridiculous formality he now finished with sybillas face was glowing she was completely enclosed within whatever they had been sayingor doing for her emily did not exist and jack radley was merely a shadow part of the decor of the weekend words were superfluous her smile said everything emily felt sick all her efforts had been so much waste of time she had been an actress in an empty theater performing only for herselfas far as george was concerned she had not been there at all her behavior was immaterial to him good night mr radley she stumbled over the words and reaching out for the handle of her bedroom door she opened it went in and closed it firmly behind her at least she could shut them out until tomorrow she could have nine hours of solitude if she wanted to weep no one else would know and when she had let go of some of the confusion and pain bursting inside her there was the refuge of sleep before the necessity of decision the maid knocked emily sniffed hard and swallowed i dont need you millicent her voice was strained you may go to bed there was a moments hesitation then very well mlady good night good night she undressed slowly leaving her gown over the back of the chair then took the pins out of her hair it was a relief not to feel the weight of it on her head why was it something about sybilla her beauty her wit her charm or was it some failure in herself had she changed lost some quality that george had loved she searched trying to recall what she had said and done recently how was it different from the way it had always been in what way was she less than george wanted or needed she had never been cold or illnatured she was not extravagant she had never been rude to his friendsand heaven knows she had been tempted some of them were so facile so incredibly silly and yet they spoke to her as if she were a child it was a futile exercise and in the end she crept into bed and decided to be angry instead it was better than weeping angry people fight and sometimes fighters win she woke with a headache and a rush of the memory of failure all the energy drained out of her and she stared up at the sunlight on the plaster ceiling finding it colorless and hard if only it were still night and she could have more time alone the thought of going down into the breakfast room to face all those bright smilesthe curious the confident the pityingand having to pretend there was nothing wrong what everyone else could see of george and sybilla was of no importance she knew something the others did not something that explained it all she curled up smaller hunching her knees and hid her head under the sheet a few moments more but the longer she stayed the more thoughts crowded her head imagination raced away giving reality to every threat every possible misery till she was drowned with wretchedness her head throbbed her eyes stung and it was past time she got up millicent had already knocked at the door twice morning tea would be cold the third time she had to let her in emily took extra trouble with her appearance the less she cared the more it mattered she hated color out of a pot but it was better than no color at all she was not the last down sybilla was absent and mrs march had elected to have breakfast in bed as had greataunt vespasia you look well my dear emily eustace said briskly of course he was perfectly aware of the situation between george and sybilla but deplore it as she must a wellbred woman bore such things discreetly and affected not to have noticed he did not approve of emily but he would give her the benefit of the doubt unless she made such a charitable view impossible i am thank you emily forced herself to be bright and her irritation made it easier i hope you slept well too excellently eustace helped himself with a lavish hand from several of the chafing dishes on the massive carved oak sideboard set his dish in his place then went over and threw open the windows letting in a blast of chill morning air he breathed in deeply and then out again excellent he said disregarding everyone elses shivering as he took his seat at the table i always think good health is so important in a woman dont you emily could think of no reason why it should be particularly but it seemed to be largely a rhetorical question and eustace answered himself no man especially of a good family wants a sickly wife the poor want it even less tassie said bluntly it costs a lot to be ill but eustaces pontification was not to be interrupted by something so irrelevant as the poor he waved his hand gently of course it does my dear but then if the poor dont have children it hardly matters does it it is not as if it were a case of succession to a title of the line so to speak ordinary people dont need sons in the same way he shot a sour look at william and preferably more than oneif you wish to see the name continue george cleared his throat and raised his brows and his eyes flickered first to sybilla then william and lowered to his plate again williams face tightened sharply being sickly doesnt stop them having children tassie argued spots of color in her cheeks i dont think health is a virtue it is a good fortune frequently found among those who are better off eustace took a deep breath and let it out in a noisy expression of impatience my dear you are far too young to know what you are talking about it is a subject you cannot possibly understand nor should you it is indelicate for a girl in your situation or indeed any wellbred woman your mother would never have dreamed of it but im sure mr radley understands he smiled across at jack and received a stare of total incomprehension tassie bent her head a little lower over her toast and preserves the pinkness deepened in her face a reflection of a mixture of frustration at being patronized and embarrassment because her fathers reference to her was obviously infinitely more indelicate than anything she had meant but eustace was relentless he pursued the subject obliquely throughout breakfast to food and health were added delicacy of upbringing discretion obedience an even temper and the appropriate skills in conversation and household management the only attribute not touched upon was wealth and that of course would have been vulgar and it was a matter of some sensitivity to him his mother was of a fine family who had squandered its means obliging her either to reduce her style of life or marry into a family which had made its fortunes in the industrial revolution in the mines and mills of the north the trade she had chosen the latter with some distaste the former was unthinkable he nodded his head in satisfaction as he spoke when i think of my own happiness with my beloved wife may heaven rest her i realize how much all these things contributed to it such a wonderful woman i treasure her memoryyou have no notion it was the saddest day of my life when she departed this vale of tears for a better place emily glanced across at william whose head was bent to hide his face and accidentally caught jack radleys eyes filled with amusement he rolled them very slightly and smiled at her it was a bright disturbing look and she knew without doubt that although the monumental effort she had made over the last three days might have failed with george it had succeeded brilliantly with him it was a bitter satisfaction and worth nothingunless unintentionally she should finally provoke george to jealousy she smiled back at him not warmly but with at least a shred of conspiracy george was drawn in curiously enough by eustace eustace spoke to him with friendliness seeking his opinion expressing an admiration for him which emily found singularly inopportune at the moment george was the last person in the house anyone should have consulted about married bliss but eustace was pursuing his own interests with jack radley and tassie and oblivious of anyone elses feelings least of all their possible embarrassment emily spent the morning writing letters to her mother a cousin to whom she owed a reply and to charlotte she told charlotte everything about george her pain the sense of loss which surprised her and the loneliness that opened up in a gray flat vastness ahead then she tore it up and disposed of it in the water closet luncheon was worse they were back in the heavy rust red dining room and everyone was present except greataunt vespasia who had chosen to visit an acquaintance in mayfair well eustace rubbed his hands and looked round at all their faces in turn and what do we plan for the afternoon tassie mr radley tassie has errands to do for me mrs march snapped we do have our duty eustace we cannot be forever playing and amusing ourselves my family has a positionit has always had a position whether this remark was purely a piece of personal vanity or a reminder to jack radley that they were quite unarguably his social equals was not clear and tassie always seems to be the one keeping it up george said with a waspishness surprising in him mrs marchs eyes froze and why not may i ask she has nothing else to do it is her function her calling in life george a woman must have something to do would you deny her that of course not george was getting cross and emily felt a lift of pride for him in spite of herself but i can think of a lot more amusing things for her to do than upholding the position of the marches he finished i daresay the old ladys voice would have chipped stonestombstones by the look on her face but hardly what one would wish a young lady even to hear about much less to do i will thank you not to injure her mind by discussing it youll only upset her and cause her to have ideas ideas are bad for young women quite eustace added soberly they cause heat in the blood and nightmares he took an enormous slice of chicken breast and put it on his plate and headaches george was caught between his innate good manners and his sense of outrage the conflict showed in his face he glanced at tassie she put her hand out and touched his arm gently i really dont mind going to see the vicar george hes awfully smug and his teeth are wet and stick out but hes really quite harmless anastasia eustace sat bolt upright that is no way to speak of mr beamish he is a very worthy man and deserving of a great deal more respect from a girl of your age tassie smiled broadly yes papa i am always very nice to mr beamish then sudden honesty checked her well nearly always you will go to call upon him this afternoon mrs march said coldly sucking at her teeth and see if you can be of assistance there must be several of the less fortunate who need visiting yes grandmama tassie said meekly george sighed and for the time being gave up emily spent the afternoon with tassie doing good works if one cannot enjoy oneself one might as well benefit someone else as it turned out it was really quite agreeable since emily liked tassie more and more each time she saw her and their visit with the vicars wife was actually very brief considerably more time was taken up in the company of the curate a large softspoken young man called mungo hare who had chosen to leave his native western invernessshire to seek his living in london he was full of zeal and very forthright opinions which were demonstrated by his acts rather than his words they did indeed offer some real comfort to the bereaved and to the lonely and emily returned to cardington crescent with a sense of accomplishment added to this was the knowledge that sybilla had spent the time paying afternoon calls with her grandmotherinlaw and must have been bored to distraction but emily did not see george on her return nor when she changed for dinner there was no sound from the dressing room except the valet coming in and then leaving and the feeling of desolation returned at the dinner table it was worse sybilla looked marvelous in a shade of magenta no one else would have dared to wear her skin was flawless with just a touch of pink on the cheekbones and she was still as slender as a willow in spite of her condition her eyes were hazel at times they seemed brown at others golden like brandy in the light her hair was silken black and thick as a rope emily felt washed out beside her a moth next to a butterfly her hair was honey fair softer delicate rather than rich her eyes quite ordinary blue her gown was very fashionable in cut but by comparison the color was pallid it took all the courage she possessed to force the smile to her lips to eat something which tasted like porridge although it appeared to be sole roasted mutton and fruit sorbet everyone else was gay except old mrs march who had never been anything so trivial sybilla was radiant george could hardly take his eyes off her tassie looked unusually happy and eustace held forth with unctuous satisfaction on something or other emily did not listen gradually the decision hardened in her mind passivity was not succeeding it was time for action and there was only one course of action that she could think of there was little she could begin until the gentlemen rejoined them after the meal was over the conservatory stretched the full length of the south side of the house and from the withdrawing room there were glass doors under pale green curtains which opened onto palms vines and a walk quite out of sight between exotic flowers emilys patience was totally exhausted she moved to sit beside jack radley and took the first opportunity to engage him in conversation which was not in the least difficult he was only too delighted in other circumstances she would have enjoyed it for against her will she liked him he was too goodlooking and he knew it but he had wit and a sense of the absurd she had seen it gleaming in those remarkable eyes a dozen times over the last few days and she thought there was no hypocrisy in him which in itself was enough to endear him to her after three weeks at cardington crescent mrs march seemed very nervous of you he said curiously when you mentioned the word detecting i thought she was going to take a fit and slide under the table there was a shadow of laughter in his comment and she realized just how much he disliked the old lady a whole region of unhappiness opened a fraction to her guess perhaps family and circumstances were pressing him into a marriage for money perhaps he wanted such a union no more than the young women who were so mercilessly maneuvered by their mothers into marrying for position so as not to be left that most pathetic of all social creatures the unmarried woman past her prime with neither means to support herself nor vocation to occupy her years it is not my ability which alarms her she said with the first smile she had genuinely felt it is the way i came by it came by it his eyebrows rose was it something frightful worse her smile increased shameful he pursued terribly what he was on the edge of outright laughter now she bent closer to him and held up her hand he leaned over to listen my sister married appallingly beneath her she whispered her lips close to his ear to a detective in the police he shot upright and turned to face her in amazement and delight a detective a real one a peeler scotland yard and all that yes all thatand more i dont believe it he was enjoying the game enormously and there was a touch of reality in it that made it all the better she did emily argued didnt you see mrs marchs face shes terrified ill mention it its a disgrace to the family ill bet it is he chortled with delight poor old eustacehell never recover does lady cumminggould know aunt vespasia oh yes in fact if you doubt me ask her she knows thomas quite well and whats more she likes him in spite of the fact that he wears clothes that dont fit him and perfectly dreadful mufflers of most violent and unseemly colors and his pockets are always bulging with notes and wax and matches and bits of string and heaven knows what else and hes never met a decent barber in his life and you like him too he interrupted happily you like him very much oh yes i do but hes still a policeman and he gets involved in some very gruesome murders the memory of them sobered her for a moment he saw it in her face and immediately took her mood you know about them now he was truly intrigued she had his total attention and she found it exhilarating certainly i do charlotte and i are very close ive even helped sometimes his bright eyes clouded with skepticism i have she protested it was something she was obscurely proud of it had really something to do with life outside the suffocation of drawing rooms i practically solved some of themat least charlotte and i did together he was not sure whether to believe her or not but there was no criticism in his face his wide gaze was quite genuine were she a few years younger she could have lost herself in that look even now she was going to make the best of it she stood up with a little twitch of her skirt if you dont believe me he was at her side immediately you investigating murders his voice was just short of incredulous inviting her to convince him she accepted walking half a step ahead of him towards the conservatory doors and the hanging vines and sweet smell of earth inside it was hot and motionless among the lilies dim as a tropical night we had one where the corpse turned up on the driving seat of a hansom cab she said deliberately it was quite true after a performance of the mikado now you are joking he protested no im not she turned her widest most innocent look on him the widow identified it it was lord augustus fitzroy hammond he was buried in the family plot with all due ceremony she tried to keep her face straight and stare back into his eyes with those incredible eyelashes he turned up again in the family pew in church emily youre preposterous he was standing very close to her and for the moment george was not paramount in her mind she knew she was beginning to smile in spite of the fact that it was perfectly true we buried him again she said with a hint of a giggle it was all very difficult and rather disgusting thats absurd i dont believe you oh it wasi swear very awkward indeed you cant expect society to turn up to the same persons funeral twice in as many weeks it isnt decent it isnt true it is i swear it we had four corpses before wed finishedat least i think it was four and all of lord augustus whatever he was trying to control his laughter of course notdont be ridiculous she protested she was so close to him she could smell the warmth of his skin and the faint pungency of soap emily he bent and kissed her slowly intimately as if they had all the time in the world emily let herself go stretching her arms up round his neck and answering him i shouldnt do this she said frankly after a few moments but it was a factual remark not a reproach probably not he agreed touching her hair gently then her cheek tell me the truth emily what she whispered did you really find four corpses he kissed her again four or five she murmured and we caught the murderer as well ask aunt vespasiaif youve the nerve she was there i just might she disengaged herself with a shadow of reluctanceit had been nicer than it should have beenand began her way back past the flowers and the vines to the withdrawing room mrs march was holding forth on the chivalry of the preraphaelite painters their meticulousness of detail and delicacy of color and william was listening his face pinched and pained it was not that he disapproved but that she totally misunderstood what he believed to be the concept she missed the passion and caught only the sentimentality tassie and sybilla were so positioned that they were obliged either to listen or to be openly rude and long habit precluded the latter eustace on the other hand was master of the house and owed no such courtesy he sat with his back to the group and discoursed upon the moral obligations of position and george had on his face his look of polite interest which masked complete absence of attention he was gazing towards the conservatory doors he must have seen emily and jack radley emily felt a sudden rather alarming sense of excitement it was a crisis provoked at last she walked a fraction ahead of jack but was still conscious of him close behind her of his warmth and the gentleness of his touch she sat down next to greataunt vespasia and pretended to listen to eustace the rest of the evening passed in a similar vein and emily hardly noticed the time until twentyfive minutes to midnight she was returning to the withdrawing room from the bathroom upstairs passing the morning room door when she heard voices in soft fierce conversation youre a coward it was sybilla her voice husky with anger and contempt dont tell me you may believe what you like the answer cut her off emily stopped almost falling over as hope and fear choked each other and left her shaking it was george and he was furious she knew that tone precisely he had had the same welling up of temper when his jockey was thrashed at the race track it had been half his own fault then and he knew it now he was lashing out at sybilla and her voice came back thick with fury the door of the boudoir swung open and eustace stood with his hand on it any moment he would turn and see emily listening she moved on swiftly head high straining to catch the last words from the morning room but the voices were too strident too clashing to distinguish the words ah emily eustace swiveled round time to retire i think you must be tired it was a statement not a question eustace considered it part of his prerogative to decide when everyone wished to go to bed as he had always done for his family when they all lived here he had decided almost everything and believed it his privilege and his duty before she died olivia march had obeyed him sweetlyand then gone her own way with such discretion he was totally unaware of it many of his best ideas had been hers but they had been given him in such a way he thought them his own and he therefore defended them to the death and put every last one into practice emily had no will to argue tonight she returned to the withdrawing room wished everyone good sleep and went gratefully to her room she had undressed dismissing her maid with instructions for the morning and was about to get into bed when there was a knock on the dressingroom door she froze it could only be george half of her was terrified and wanted to keep silent pretend she was already asleep she stared at the knob as if it would turn on its own and let him in the knock came again harder it might be her only opportunity and if she turned him away she would lose it forever come in slowly the door opened george stood in the archway looking tired and uncomfortable his face was flushedemily knew why immediately sybilla had made a scene and george hated scenes without thinking she knew what to do above all it would be disastrous to confront him the last thing he wanted now was another emotional woman hello she said with a very small smile pretending this was not an important occasion a meeting that might turn their lives and all that mattered to her he came in tentatively followed by old mrs marchs spaniel which to her fury had taken such a liking to him that it had abandoned its mistress he was unsure what to say fearful lest she were only biding her time before launching at him with an accusation a justified charge he could not defend himself against she turned away to make it easier as though it were all perfectly ordinary she struggled for something to say that would not touch on all that was painful between them i really quite enjoyed my afternoon with tassie she began casually the vicar is terribly tedious and so is his wife i can see why eustace likes them they have a lot in common similar views on the simplicity of virtueshe pulled a faceand the virtue of simplicity especially in women and children which they believe to be roughly the same but the curate was charming george sat down on the stool before the dressing table and she watched him with a tiny lift of pleasure it meant he intended to stay at least for a few minutes im glad he said with an awkward smile fishing for something to continue with it was ridiculous a month ago they spoke as easily as old friendsthey would have laughed at the vicar together now he looked at her his eyes wide and searching but only for a moment then he looked away again not daring to press too hard afraid of a rebuff ive always liked tassie shes so much more like the cumminggould side of the family than the marches i suppose william is too for that matter that can only be good emily said sincerely youd have liked aunt olivia he went on she was only thirtyeight when she died uncle eustace was devastated after eleven children in fifteen years i should imagine she was too emily said tartly but i dont suppose eustace thought of that i shouldnt think so she turned to him and smiled suddenly glad he had never even implicitly expected such a thing of her for a moment the old warmth was back tentative uncertain but there then before she could take too much for granted and be disappointed she looked away again ive always thought visiting the poor was probably more offensive to them than leaving them decently alone she went on but i think tassie really did some good she seems so very honest she is he bit his lip although shes not yet in charlottes class thank heaven but perhaps thats only a matter of time she doesnt have as many opinions yet he stood up wary lest he overstay and risk the precious fragment regained between them he hesitated and for a moment the indecision flickered on his face dare he bend and kiss her or was it too soon yesyes it was still too fragile sybilla too recent he reached out and touched her shoulder and then withdrew his hand good night emily she looked at him solemnly if he came back it must be on her terms or it would only happen again and she would not willingly suffer that good night george she replied gently sleep well he went out slowly the dog pattering after him and the door clicked shut she curled up on the bed and hugged her knees feeling tears of relief prickle in her eyes and run smoothly and painlessly down her cheeks it was not over but the terrible helplessness was gone she knew what to do she sniffed fiercely reaching for a handkerchief and blew her nose hard it was loud and unladylikedistinctly a sound of triumph emily slept well for the first time in weeks and woke late with the sun filling the room and millicent rapping on the door come in she said hazily george was still in the dressing room there was no need to think of privacy come in millie the door opened and millicent swept in balancing the tray on one hand while closing the door behind her she then carried the tray to the dresser and put it down what a mess there is in that there upstairs pantry mlady she said pouring the tea carefully never seen anything like it one moment everybodys there the next kettles filling the ole place wi steam and not a soul to take it off such a fuss all cause is lordship likes coffee instead o teaalthough i dont know ow e can drink it first thing anyhow albert took it to im quarter of an hour since an saw e d got that little dog of mrs marchs lying up there too taken a proper fancy to is lordship it as makes the old lady ever so cross she came over and held out the cup emily sat up took it and began to sip it tasted hot and clean already the day felt promising whatd you fancy to wear this morning mlady millicent drew the curtains briskly ow about the apricot muslin right pretty shade that is and not everyone as can get away with it makes some look sallow emily smiled millicent had obviously made up her mind good idea she agreed is it warm outside it will be mlady and if youre going calling this afternoon what about the lavender millicent was full of ideas and the white wi the black velvet trim this evening very fashionable that is and ever such a good swish to it when you walk emily conceded finished the tea and got up to begin her morning toilette today everything had an air of victory about it when she was ready and millicent had gone she went to the dressing room door and knocked there was no answer she hesitated on the point of knocking again but suddenly becoming selfconscious what was there to say except good morning she should not behave like a simpering bride she would only embarrass george and make herself ridiculous far better to be natural anyway he had not answered no doubt he was already downstairs but there was no sign of him in the breakfast room eustace was as usual moonfaced and beaming with good health he had thrown the windows open as was his habit regardless of the fact that the room faced west and was decidedly chilly his plate was piled high in front of him with sausages eggs deviled kidneys and potato his napkin was tucked in his waistcoat and round him on the table were a rack of crisp toast a dish of butter the silver cruet of condiments and the milk sugar and silver queen anne coffeepot old mrs march was taking breakfast in bed as usual other than that everyone was present except georgeand sybilla emilys heart sank and all her happiness was cut off like a candle flame someone has pinched her hand felt numb on the back of the chair as she pulled it out and when she went to lift the device for slicing the top off the boiled egg the parlormaid placed in front of her she fumbled and had to steady herself she had not dreamed itgeorge had quarreled with sybilla the nightmare was over of course things would not be repaired between them instantly it would take a little while maybe even two or three weeks but she could manage thateasily good morning my dear eustace said in exactly the same tone he used every day i trust you are well it was not a question merely an acknowledgment of her arrival he did not wish to hear about womens indispositions they were both uninteresting and indelicateespecially in the morning when one wished to eat very emily said aggressively i hope you are also the question was totally unnecessary in view of the abundance upon his plate most certainly i am his eyes widened under his short rounded eyebrows he let his breath out through his nose with a slight sound and his glance flickered over the rest of the table vespasia eating a boiled egg delicately and silently tassie looking as pale as her freckles and flaming hair would allow shadows under her eyes jack radley staring at emily brow furrowed two spots of color on his cheeks and william his whole body tight his face pinched and his hands gripping his fork as if it were a life belt someone might jerk away from him i am in excellent health eustace reiterated with a note of accusation im so glad emily was determined to have the last word she could not fight sybilla and she did not want to fight george eustace would serve very well eustace turned to tassie and what do you intend to do with the day my dear before she could reply he continued compassion is most desirable in a young woman indeed your dear mother may the lord rest her was always about such things he reached for the toast and buttered a pile absently but you have other duties as wellto your guests for a start you must make them feel welcome of course your home is primarily an island of peace and morality where the shadows of the world do not penetrate but it should also be a place of comfortable entertainment seemly laughter and uplifting conversation he disregarded tassies growing discomfort as if he were totally unaware of it as indeed perhaps he was emily loathed him for his sheer blindness i think you should take mr radley for a carriage ride he went on as if the idea had suddenly occurred to him it is excellent weather for such a thing i am sure your grandmother vespasia will be happy to accompany you you are nothing of the kind vespasia snapped i have my own calls to make this afternoon tassie is welcome to come with me if she likes but i shall not go with her no doubt she would find mr carlisle of interestas would mr radley if he cares to come as well eustace frowned mr carlisle is he not that most unsuitable person who occupies himself in political agitations tassies head came up in immediate interest oh eustace glared at her vespasia did not quibble over the description but her cool dove gray eyes met emilys for an instant with a flash of memory images of excitement of appalling poverty and murder and emily found herself blushing hotly as the much closer thought of yesterday evening in the conservatory returned she had begun by telling jack radley of precisely that same affair in which she had met somerset carlisle most unsuitable eustace said irritably there are better ways of serving the unfortunate than making an exhibition of oneself trying to undermine government and alter the whole foundation of society the man is quite irresponsible and you should know better than to involve yourself with him mamainlaw sounds fascinating jack radley looked away from emily for the first time and towards vespasia which particular foundation is he working on at the moment lady cumminggould suffrage for women vespasia replied immediately ridiculous eustace snorted dangerous timewasting nonsense give women the vote and heaven only knows what kind of parliament wed have full of hotheads and revolutionaries i shouldnt wonderand incompetents the man is a threat to all that makes england decent all that has created the empire we raise great men precisely because our women preserve the sanctity of the home and the family stuff and nonsense vespasia said smartly if women are as decent as you suppose them they will vote for members who will uphold exactly what you value so much eustace was thoroughly angry he controlled himself with a visible effort my dear good woman he said between his teeth it is not your decency that is in question it is your sense he took a deep breath the fairer sex are designed by god to be wives and mothers to comfort to nurture and uplift it is a high and noble calling but they do not have the minds or the fortitude of temperament to govern and to imagine they have is to fly against nature eustace i told olivia when she married you that you were a fool vespasia replied and over the years you have given me less and less reason to revise my opinion she dabbed her lips delicately with her napkin and stood up if you think i am an unsuitable chaperone for tassie why dont you ask sybilla to accompany her presuming she gets out of her bed in time and without even glancing behind her she swept from the room the parlormaid opening the doors and closing them behind her eustaces face was scarlet he had been insulted in his own domain the one place in the world where he was the absolute authority and should have been inviolable anastasia either your sisterinlaw or your grandmother march will accompany you he swung round you emily will not you are scarcely better than your greataunt such of your past behavior that i know of has been deplorable but that is georges problem i will not have you misguiding tassie i wouldnt dream of it emily snapped back with a blinding smile im sure sybilla is much better suited to be an example to tassie as to how a decent and modest woman should behave than i could ever be tassie choked into her handkerchief jack radley tried frantically to find something to occupy himself with looking at and failed william white to the lips rose awkwardly dropping his napkin and rattling his cup in its saucer im going to work he said brusquely while the light is so good without waiting for comment he left emily was sorry by allowing her temper to reveal her own pain she had also hurt william he must be feeling somewhat the same as she was confused rejected terribly alone and above all humiliated but to seek him out and apologize now would only make it worse there was nothing to do but pretend not to have noticed she forced down enough of her breakfast to make it appear she was quite normal then she excused herself and went determinedly upstairs to find george and demand he exercise at least discretion even if he could not or would not exercise morality she knocked briskly on the dressing room door and waited there was no answer she knocked again then when nothing happened turned the handle and went in the curtains were open and the room full of sunlight george was still in bed the sheets rumpled the morning coffee tray sitting on the table obviously used in fact there was an empty saucer on the floor near the foot of the bed where he must have shared his coffee with the old ladys spaniel george emily said angrily she did not even wish to think what he had been doing all night that he was still asleep at nearly ten in the morning george she was standing beside the bed now staring down at him he looked very white and his eyes were sunken as though he had slept badly if at all in fact he looked ill george now she was undeniably frightened she put out her hand and touched him he did not move there was not even a flutter of the eyelids george she was shouting which was ridiculous he must be able to hear her she was shaking him roughly enough to waken anyone but he was motionless even his chest did not seem to rise and fall appalled her mind already guessing at the impossible and terrified of it she ran to the door wanting to cry out for someonebut whom aunt vespasia of course aunt vespasia was the only one she could trust the only one who cared for her she flew down the stairs and across the hall almost pitching into a startled housemaid and threw open the morning room door vespasia was writing letters aunt vespasia her voice was shaking and was far louder than she had intended aunt vespasia george is ill i cant wake him i think she took a choking breath she could not form the words that would make it real vespasia turned from the rosewood desk where her paper and envelopes were spread her face grave perhaps we had better go and see she said quietly laying the pen down and rising from the chair come my dear heart pounding scarcely able to swallow for dread of what she would find this time emily followed her back up the stairs to the landing with its peonypatterned curtains and bamboo jardiniere full of ferns vespasia tapped smartly on the dressing room door and without waiting opened it and walked over to the bed george was exactly as emily had left him except that now she saw the white stiffness of his face more clearly and wondered how she could ever have deceived herself into imagining he was alive vespasia touched his neck gently with the backs of her fingers after a moment she turned to emily her face weary her eyes brimming with sorrow there is nothing we can do my dear i think from my very little knowledge it was his heart i daresay he felt little beyond a moment you had better go to my room and i will send my maid to help you while millicent gets you a stiff brandy i must go and tell the household emily said nothing she knew george was dead and yet she could not grasp itit was too big she had experienced death before her own sister had been murdered by the cater street hangman everyone was used to loss smallpox typhus cholera scarlet fever tuberculosis all were commonplace and too frequently bringers of deathas was childbirth but it was always someone else there had been no warning of thisgeorge had been so alive come vespasia put her arm round emilys shoulder and without emilys realizing it she was walking along the landing again past the ferns and into vespasias room where her ladys maid was making the bed lord ashworth is dead vespasia said frankly he appears to have had a heart attack will you stay with lady ashworth please digby i will send someone up with a stiff brandy and inform the household the maid was an elderly north country woman bright of face broad of hip in a lifetime of service she had seen many bereavements and suffered a few of her own she made only the briefest of replies before taking emily gently by the arm sitting her on the chaise longue with her feet up and patting her hand in a fashion which at any other time would have annoyed her profoundly now it was human contact and absurdly reassuring a memory of safety more real than the sunlight in the room the elaborate japanese silk screen with its cherry blossom the lacquer table vespasia left the room and went downstairs slowly she was filled with griefmost of all for emily of whom she was deeply fond but also for herself she had known george since he was born she had watched him through childhood and youth and she knew both his virtues and his faults she did not condone all he did by any means but he was generous tolerant quick to praise others and within his own parameters honest the obsession with sybilla was an aberration a piece of stupid selfindulgence which she did not forgive but none of that altered the fact that she had loved him and she felt a profound sorrow that he should have been robbed of life so young barely yet half her own age she opened the breakfast room door eustace was still at the table with jack radley eustace i must speak with you immediately indeed he was still nursing his affront and his face was cold he made no move to stand up vespasia fixed jack radley with a glance and he saw that there was something deeply wrong he rose excused himself and left closing the door behind him i would be obliged mamainlaw if you would be more courteous to mr radley eustace said with ice in his voice it is very possible he may marry anastasia that is extremely unlikely vespasia cut him off but that is far from important at the moment i am afraid george is dead eustace swung round his face blank i beg your pardon george is dead she repeated he appears to have had a heart attack i have left emily in my room with my maid i think you had better call the doctor he drew breath to say something but found it inadequate the normally ruddy color had vanished from his face vespasia rang the bell and as soon as the butler appeared she spoke to him disregarding eustace lord ashworth has had a heart attack in the night martin and he is dead lady ashworth is in my room will you send someone up with a stiff brandy and call the doctordiscreetly of course there is no need to put the house into an uproar i myself will inform the family yes my lady he said gravely may i say how extremely sorry i am and i am sure the rest of the staff will wish me to say the same on their behalf thank you martin he bowed his head and left eustace stood up awkwardly as if he were suddenly rheumatic i will tell mama it will come as a terrible shock to her i dont suppose theres anything that can be done for emily poor creature i expect i shall send for charlotte vespasia answered i admit i feel most distressed myself of course you do eustace softened a fraction after all she was well over seventy but there was another thought uppermost in his mind i really dont think we need to send for her sister i gather she is a rather unfortunate creature whose presence would be anything but helpful why not send for her mother or better yet take her back to her mother as soon as she feels well enough to travel surely that would be the kindest thing to do possibly vespasia said very dryly but caroline is on the continent so for the time being i shall send for charlotte she fixed him with such a glare the protest died on his lips i shall dispatch my carriage for her this afternoon vespasia left the room and went back upstairs there was one more duty to perform which was bound to be arduous and because in spite of the young womans inexcusable behavior over the last few weeks she was fond of sybilla she wanted to tell her herself rather than let her hear from the servantsor worst still from eustace she knocked on the bedroom door and opened it without waiting for a reply the breakfast tray finished with sat on the side table sybilla was propped up in the large bed laceedged shawl thrown carelessly round her peach satin nightgown sliding a little off one pale shoulder and her black hair coiled at the nape of her neck and falling over her shoulder and down her bosom even at a moment such as this vespasia was struck by what a beautiful woman she was it was a little overpowering sybilla she said quietly entering and sitting down on the edge of the bed uninvited i am sorry my dear but have some very sad news for you sybillas eyes opened wider with fear and she sat upright william no george what sybilla was obviously surprised confused her first thought had been for william and she had not adjusted whatever threat had been in her mind what has happened vespasia reached forward and took the white hand that was closest to her holding it hard george is dead my dear i am afraid he had a heart attack some time early this morning there is nothing you can do except to behave with the discretion you have so singularly failed to display so farfor emilys sake and williams at least if not for your own dead sybilla whispered as if she did not understand he cant be he was so so healthy not george i am afraid there is no doubt vespasia shook her head now i suggest you have your maid draw you a bath get dressed and remain in your room until you feel you have composed yourself sufficiently to face the family then come down and offer your assistance in whatever way it may be useful i assure you it is the best way in the world of overcoming your own distress sybilla smiled so slightly it was barely a shadow is that what you are doing aunt vespasia i suppose so vespasia turned away not wishing to betray the pain that was so close beneath the surface that should surely recommend it to you she heard the slither of sheets as sybilia got up and then a minute later the movement of the bellpull it would ring in the servants hall and in her maids room and wherever the girl was she would come i must go and tell william vespasia continued trying to think what else there was to do and no doubt there will be arrangements letters and so on sybilia started to say something it was going to be about emily but her nerve failed her before the sentence was complete enough to be spoken aloud and vespasia did not press her the doctor came a little before noon and eustace met him and conducted him to the dressing room where george was still precisely as emily and vespasia had found him he was left alone but for a footman to attend to any requirements he might have such as hot water or towels eustace had no wish to be present for such a distressing matter and he awaited the doctors remarks in the morning room with vespasia emily and sybilla were still in their respective rooms tassie had returned from the dressmaker and was in tears in the withdrawing room old mrs march was in the hot pink boudoir which was her special preserve being comforted by jack radley whose attention she demanded william was in the conservatory the corner specially cleared for him to use as a studio he had returned to his painting pointing out that there was no purpose to be served by his sitting wringing his hands in the boudoir and he found it more relief to his feelings to be alone and struggling with brush and color to translate some of his emotions into vision he had two pictures in progress one a landscape commissioned by a patron the other a portrait of sybilla for his own pleasure today he was working on the landscape spring trees full of april sunlight and sudden stabbing cold it was a mood evoking the frailty of happiness and the eternal imminence of pain the morning room door opened and the doctor returned he had a deeply lined face but they were all agreeable lines marks of mobility and good nature at the moment he looked profoundly unhappy he closed the door behind him and turned from eustace to vespasia and back again it was his heart as you supposed he said gravely the only shred of comfort i can give you is that it must have been very quicka matter of moments that is indeed a comfort eustace acknowledged i am most obliged i shall say so to lady ashworth thank you treves but the doctor did not move did lord ashworth have a dog a small spaniel for heavens sake what on earth does that matter eustace was astounded by the triviality of the question at such a time did he the doctor repeated no my mother has why i am afraid the dog is also dead mr march well that really hardly matters does it now eustace was annoyed ill have one of the footmen dispose of it with an effort he remembered his position and thus his manners im obliged now if you will do whatever is necessary we will make arrangements for the funeral that will not be possible mr march what do you mean not possible eustace demanded the pink mounting up his cheeks of course its possible just do it man vespasia looked at the doctors grim face what is it dr treves she said quietly why do you mention the dog and how do you know about it the servants did not call you to see a dead dog no my lady he sighed deeply the lines of his face dragging downward in acute distress the dog was under the foot of the bed it died of a heart attack also i should judge at about the same time as lord ashworth it appears he fed it a little of his morning coffee from the tray served him and drank some himself in both cases a very short while before death the color fled from eustaces face he swayed a little good god man what on earth do you mean vespasia sank very slowly into the chair behind her she knew what the doctor was going to say and all its darkness was already crowding in upon her mind i mean sir that lord ashworth died of a poison that was in his morning coffee nonsense eustace said furiously absolute nonsense the very idea is preposterous poor george had a heart attackandand the dog must have got upsetdeath and all thatand it died as well coincidence just awretched coincidence no sir of course it is eustace spluttered of course why on earth would lord ashworth take poison for heavens sake you didnt know the man or you wouldnt suggest such a damnable thing and he certainly wouldnt try it out on the dog first george loved animals the damn creature was devoted to him irritated my mother its her dog but it preferred george he wouldnt dream of hurting it bloody silly thing to say and i assure you he had no reason whatever to take his own life he was a man ofhe gulped glaring at trevesevery possible happiness wealth position a fine wife and son treves opened his mouth to attempt again but vespasia interrupted him i believe eustace that dr treves is not suggesting that george took the poison knowingly dont be idiotic eustace snapped losing his selfcontrol entirely nobody commits suicide by accident and no one in this household has any poison anyway digitalis treves put in with quiet weariness quite a common medicine for heart complaints i understand from the ladys maid that mrs march herself still has some but it is perfectly possible to distill it from foxgloves if one wishes eustace collected himself again and his eyebrows rose in superb sarcasm and lord ashworth crept out at six oclock in the morning picked foxgloves in the garden and distilled some digitalis he inquired heavily did he do this in the kitchen with the scullery maids or in the upstairs pantry with the ladys maids and the footmen then if i understand your implication correctly he went back to his bedroom waited till his coffee came accidentally poisoned the dog then poisoned himself you are a raving fool treves a blithering and incompetent ass write a death certificate and get out vespasia felt unaccountably sorry for eustace he was not going to be able to cope he had never been as strong as he imaginedperhaps that was why he was so insufferably pompous eustace she said quietly and firmly dr treves is not suggesting that george took it accidentally as you observe it is absurd the inevitable conclusion is that someone else put it in his coffee while it was in the pantryit would not be difficult since everyone else takes tea and poor george had no idea it was poisoned either when he gave it to the dog or when he drank it himself eustace swung round and stared at her suddenly hot with fear his voice was hoarse and came with a squeak but that would be murder yes sir treves agreed softly i am afraid it would i have no alternative but to inform the police eustace gulped and let out his breath in a long sigh of pain the struggle was obvious in his face but he found no resolution of course vespasia acknowledged perhaps if you would be so kind you will call an inspector thomas pitt he is experienced andand discreet if you wish my lady treves agreed i really am very sorry thank you the butler will show you the telephone now i must make arrangements to have lady ashworths sister come to be with her good treves nodded for the best as long as she is a sensible woman hysterics wont help how is lady ashworth if you wish me to call on her not yetperhaps tomorrow her sister is extremely sensible i shouldnt think shes ever had hysterics in her life and shes certainly had cause good then ill call again tomorrow thank you lady cumminggould he bowed his head very slightly emily would have to know telling her would be most painful first vespasia would see old mrs march she would be outraged and that was about the only gossamerthin thread of perverse satisfaction in all that had happened mrs march would have something other to do than embarrass tassie she was in her boudoir the downstairs sitting room was reserved for ladiesor it had been in the days when she ruled the house as well as her daughters two nieces and an impoverished and thus dependent female cousin she had clung on to her dominion of this strategically placed octagonal room renewing the suffocating pink decor keeping the drapes on the mantelpiece and the pianoforte the banks of photographs of every conceivable family group and keeping the numerous surfaces ornamented with dried flower arrangements wax fruit a stuffed owl under glass and multitudinous pieces of embroidery doilies runners and antimacassars there was even an aspidistra in the jardiniere now she was sitting here with her feet up on the pink chaise longue if she had remained in her bedroom she would have been too far from the center of the house and might have missed something vespasia closed the door behind her and sat down on the overstuffed sofa opposite shall i send for a fresh dish of tea mrs march asked eyeing her critically you look extremely peakedquite ten years older i shall not have time to drink it vespasia answered i have some extremely disturbing news to give you you can still take a dish of tea mrs march snapped you can drink and talk at the same timeyou always have your face is decidedly pinched you always favored george regardless of his conduct this must come very hard to you it does vespasia replied curtly she did not want to discuss her pain least of all with lavinia march whom she had disliked for forty years however when i have told you i shall have to tell others prepare them for what must happen for goodness sake stop talking in circles mrs march said sharply you are ridiculously selfimportant vespasia this is eustaces house and he is quite capable of dealing with the arrangements and as for emily of course whatever you wish to do about her is your affair but personally i think the sooner she is sent back to her mother the better on the contrary i shall send for her sister this afternoon but rather before that i fancy we shall have her brotherinlaw here mrs marchs eyebrows rose they were round and a little heavy like eustaces only her eyes were black has your bereavement robbed you of your wits vespasia you will not have a vulgar policeman in my house the fact that he is related to emily is unfortunate but it is not a burden we are called upon to bear it will be the least of them vespasia said baldly george was murdered mrs march stared at her for several seconds in silence then she reached for the flowered porcelain bell on the table and rang it instantly i shall have your maid attend you you had better lie down with a tisane and some salts you have taken leave of your senses let us hope it is temporary you should take a companion i always said you spent too much time alone you are a prey to unfortunate influences but i am sure you are more sinned against than sinning it is all most unfortunate if the doctor is still in the house ill send him up to you she rang the bell again so furiously she was in danger of cracking it where on earth is that stupid maid can no one come when they are told for heavens sake put it down and stop that racket vespasia ordered treves says george was poisoned with digitalis nonsense or if he was then he took his own life in a fit of despair everyone can see he is in love with sybilla he was infatuated with her vespasia corrected almost without thinking it was only a matter of fact and almost irrelevant now it is not at all the same thing men like george dont kill themselves over women you should know that he could have had sybilla if he wanted her and probably did dont be coarse vespasia vulgarity is quite uncalled for he also killed the dog vespasia added what are you talking about what dog who killed a dog whoever killed george what dog what has a dog to do with it your dog im afraid the little spaniel im sorry that proves youre talking nonsense george would never kill my dog he was extremely fond of itin fact he practically took it from me that is my point lavinia someone else killed them both martin has sent for the police before mrs march could find a retort to that the door opened and a whitefaced footman appeared yes maam vespasia stood up i do not require anything thank you perhaps you had better bring a fresh dish of tea for mrs march she walked past him and across the hallway to the stairs emily woke up from a sleep so deep at first she was confused and could not remember where she was the room was very oriental full of whites and greens with bamboopatterned wallpaper and brocade curtains with chrysanthemums the sun was off the windows and yet the air was full of light then she remembered it was afternooncardington crescentshe and george were staying with uncle eustace it all came back in an icy wave engulfing her george was dead she lay and stared at the ceiling without seeing her eyes fixed on the scrolls of the plasterwork it could as well have been waves of the sea or summer leaves on a branch emily she did not answer what was there to say to anyone emily the voice was insistent she sat up perhaps replying would provide a diversion an escape from her thoughts she could forget for a few moments aunt vespasia was standing in front of her vespasias maid a little behind she must have been there all the timeemily could remember seeing her white cap and apron and her black dress last thing before she closed her eyes she had brought her a drinkbitterit must have had laudanum in it that was why she had slept when she had thought it impossible emily yes aunt vespasia vespasia sat down on the bed and put her hand over emilys on top of the smooth embroidered edge of the sheet it looked very thin and frail an old hand blueveined and spotted with age in fact vespasia looked old there were hollows of shock round her eyes and the finegrained skin that had for so long been blemishless was somehow shadowed i have sent for charlotte to come and be with you vespasia was talking to her emily made an effort to listen to understand i have sent my carriage for her and i hope she will be here by this evening thank you emily murmured automatically it would be better to have charlotte here she supposed it did not seem to matter a lot nobody could change anything and she did not want to be forced into doing things making decisions feeling vespasias grip was tighter on her hand it hurt before that my dear thomas will be here vespasia went on thomas emily repeated with a frown you shouldnt have sent for thomas theyll never let him intheyll be rude to him why on earth did you send for thomas she stared had aunt vespasia been so shaken by grief she had lost all her common sense thomas was a policemanin the eyes of the marches little better than one of the less desirable tradesmen on a level with other such necessary evils as a ratcatcher or cleaner of drains she felt a sudden rush of pity for her and anger that aunt vespasia whom she admired so much should be reduced to foolishnessand in the marches house of all places she gripped her hand tightly aunt vespasia my dear vespasias voice was very soft as if she found it difficult to speak and her eyes with their magnificent hooded lids were full of tears my dear george was murdered he can hardly have known it or felt pain but it is indisputable i have sent for thomas in his office as policeman i pray that it will be he who comes murdered she formed the word with her lips but her voice made no sound george poor george but why should anybody want to then the answers came flooding in wave after wave of horror sybilla because he had rejected her in whatever quarrel emily had half overheard last night or william in jealousythat would be so easily understandable or worst of all jack radley if he had some insane idea after the ridiculous scene in the conservatory that emily meant something more than a stupid flirtationthat she could possiblythat thought was obscene hideous she would be responsible for deluding him for encouraging the man to murder george she closed her eyes as if she could shut out the thought with darkness but it persisted ugly and violently real and the hot tears trickling down her face washed nothing away even when she bent her head on vespasias shoulder and felt her arms tighten round her and at last let herself go in the weeping she had held within too long pitt returned along the hot dusty street amid the clatter of hooves the hiss of wheels and the shouting of a dozen different sorts of vendors of everything from flowers bootlaces and matches to the collection of rags and bones nine or tenyearold boys shouted where they swept a footpath between the horse droppings so gentlemen might pass from one pavement to another without soiling their boots and ladies might keep the hems of their skirts clean constable stripe was waiting at the station entrance mr pitt sir weve bin looking all over the place for you i told em as youd bin to find that magsman pitt caught his alarm what is it have you turned up something in the bloomsbury case stripes face was pale no sir this is much worse in a manner o speaking im that sorry sir truly i am pitt was assailed by a sudden terrible coldnesscharlotte what he shouted grasping stripe so fiercely the constable winced in spite of himself but he did not look away nor did anger show for even an instant which frightened pitt even moreso much so that his throat dried up and he could make no sound theres bin a murder at cardington crescent sir stripe said carefully making no move to shake off pitts viselike fingers a lord ashworth is dead and lady vesveslady cumminggould especially asked if youd be the one as goes an to tell you as shed already sent er own carriage for miss charlotte sir an im awful sorry mr pitt sir relief flooded through pitt like a hot tide almost making him sick then he felt shame for his selfishness and lastly an overwhelmingly pity for emily he looked at stripes earnest face and found it extraordinarily good he loosened his fingers thank you stripe very thoughtful of you to tell me yourself lord ashworth iswas my brotherinlaw it sounded absurd lord ashworth his brotherinlaw stripe had astounding good manners not to laugh outright my wifes sister married yes sir stripe agreed hastily they did insist as it was you and theres an ansom waiting then wed better go he followed stripe along the footpath a dozen yards beyond the station doorway where a hansom cab was drawn in to the curb horse standing head down the reins loose stripe opened the door and pitt climbed in stripe following immediately behind after directing the driver where to go it was not a long journey and pitt had little time to think his mind was in turmoil all rationality drowned in grief for emily and a surprising sense of loss for himself he had liked george there was an openness about him a generosity of thought a pleasure in life who on earth would want to kill george a chance attack in the street he could have understood even a quarrel in some gentlemans club or at a sporting game which had gotten out of hand but this was in a town house with his own family why was the cab going so slowly it was taking forever and yet when they were there he was not ready mr pitt sir stripe prompted yes he climbed out and stood on the hot pavement in front of the magnificent facade of cardington crescent the georgian windows perfectly proportioned three panes across four down the ashlar stone the simple architraves and the handsome door it looked like everything that was comfortable and centuries secure it made it worse there was nothing left inviolable anymore stripe was standing beside him waiting for him to move yes he repeated he payed the cabbie and walked up to the front door to stripes acute discomfort police went to the tradesmens entrance but that was something pitt had always refused to do though stripe did not know that yet he had only dealt with the criminal world of the tenements and rookeries ratinfested labyrinths of the slums like st giles a stones throw from bloomsbury or the petty bourgeoisie clerks and shopkeepers artisans grasping after respectability but boasting only one street entrance all the same pitt pulled the bell and a moment later the butler stood in the doorway grave and calm of course vespasia would have told him that pitt never went to the back he regarded pitts height his unruly hair the bulging pockets and reached his conclusion immediately inspector pitt please come in and if you will wait in the morning room mr march will see you sir thank you but i will have constable stripe go to the servants hall and begin inquiries there if you dont mind the butler hesitated for a moment but realized the inevitability of it i will accompany him he said carefully making sure they both realized that the servants were his responsibility and he intended to discharge it to the full of course pitt agreed with a nod then if you will come this way he turned and led pitt across the fine rather ornate hallway and into a heavily furnished room masculine hidecovered armchairs by a rosewood desk japanese lacquer tables in startling reds and blacks and an array of indian weapons relics of some ancestors service to queen and empire displayed haphazardly on the walls opposite a chinese silk screen here rather awkwardly the butler hesitated confused as to how he should deal with a policeman in the front of the house and eventually left him without saying anything further he must retrieve stripe from the entrance and conduct him to the servants hall making sure he did not frighten any of the younger girls who were no more than thirteen or fourteen and that the staff acquitted themselves honorably and in no way spoke out of turn pitt remained standing the room was like many he had seen before typical of its station and period except that it contained an unusual clash of styles as if there were at least three distinct personalities whose wills had met in the decisions of taste at a guess a robust opinionated man a woman of some cultural daring and a lover of tradition and family heritage the door opened again and eustace march came in he was a vigorous florid man in his mid fifties at this moment torn by profoundly conflicting emotions and forced into a role he was unused to good afternoon er pitt good afternoon pitt tragedy in the house doctors a fool shouldnt have sent for you entirely domestic matter nephew of mine sort of cousin by marriage to be precise greatnephew of my motherinlaw he caught pitts eye and his face colored but i suppose you know that anyway poor man is dead he drew in his breath and continued rapidly i regret to say it but he had got himself into a hopeless situation in his marriageseems he sank into a fit of depression and took his own life very dreadful familys a bit eccentric but you wouldnt know the rest of them i knew george pitt said coolly i always found him eminently sensible and lady cumminggould is the sanest woman i ever met the blood mounted even higher in eustaces mottled cheeks possibly he snapped but then you and i move in very different circles mr pitt what is sane in yours may not be regarded so favorably in mine pitt could feel an unprofessional anger rising inside him which he had sworn not to allow he was used to rudeness it ought not to matter and yet his feelings were raw because it was george who was dead all the more important that he behave irreproachably that he not give eustace march an excuse to have him removed from the caseor worse permit his own emotions to so cloud his judgment that he fail to discover the truth and disclose it with as much gentleness as possible investigation any investigation uncovered so much more than the principle crime there was a multitude of other smaller sins painful secrets silly and shameful things the knowledge of which maimed what used to be love and crippled trust that might otherwise have endured all sorts of wounds eustace was staring at him waiting for a reaction his face flushed with impatience pitt sighed can you tell me sir what is likely to have caused lord ashworth such distress or despair that on waking up this particular morning he immediately took his own life by the way how did he do it good god didnt that idiot treves tell you i havent seen him yet sir ah no of course not digitalisthats a heart medicine my mother has and he said some rubbish about foxgloves in the garden i dont even know if theyre in flower now and i dont suppose he does either the mans incompetent digitalis comes from the leaves pitt pointed out it is frequently prescribed for congestive heart failure and irregularity of heartbeat ohah eustace sank suddenly into one of the hidecovered chairs for heavens sake man sit down he said irritably dreadful business most distressing i hope for the sake of the ladies you will be as discreet as you can my mother and lady cumminggould are both considerably advanced in years and consequently delicate and of course lady ashworth is distraught we were all extremely fond of george pitt stared at him not knowing how to break through the barricade of pretense he had had to do it many times beforemost people were reluctant to admit the presence of murderbut it was different now when the people were so close to him somewhere upstairs in this house emily was sitting numb with grief what tormented lord ashworth so irreparably he took his own life he repeated watching eustaces face eustace sat motionless for a long time light and shadow passing over his features a monumental struggle waging itself within his mind pitt waited truth or lie it might be more revealing if he allowed it to mature even if it laid bare only some fear in eustace himself im sorry to have to say this eustace began at last but im afraid it was emilys behavior and and the fact that george had fallen very deeplyand i may say hopelesslyin love with another woman he shook his head to signify his deprecation of such folly emilys behavior has been unfortunate to say the least of it but do not let us speak ill of her in her bereavement he added suddenly realizing his charity ought to extend to her also pitt could not imagine george killing himself over any love affair it was simply not in his nature to be so intense about an emotional involvement pitt remembered his courtship of emily it had been full of romance and delight no anguish no quarrels no giving way to obsessive or fancied jealousies what happened last night that precipitated such despair he pursued trying to keep the contempt and the disbelief out of his voice eustace had prepared for this he gave a rather shaky nod and pursed his lips i was afraid you would press me about that i prefer to say nothing let it suffice that she showed her favors most flagrantly where all the household might be aware of her to a young gentleman guest staying here on my youngest daughters account pitts eyebrows rose if emily did it in front of everyone else in the house it can hardly have been very serious eustaces lips tightened and his nostrils flared as he breathed he kept his patience with difficulty it was my mother and poor george himself who were witness to it i grieve to say you will have to accept my word mrer pitt that in society married women do not disappear into the conservatory with gentlemen of doubtful reputation and return some considerable time later with their gowns in disarray and a smirk on their faces for only an instant pitt thought that that was precisely what they did do then anger for emily swept away anything so trivial mr march if gentlemen were to kill themselves every time a wife had a mild flirtation with someone else agreeable london would be up to its waist in corpses and the entire aristocracy would have died out centuries ago in fact they would never have made it past the crusades i am sure in your station in life especially in your trade that you cannot help a certain vulgarity of mind eustace said coldly but please restrain yourself from expressing it in my house particularly in our time of bereavement there is really nothing for you to do here beyond satisfying yourself that no one has attacked poor georgewhich is perfectly obvious to the veriest fool he took a dose of my mothers heart medicine in his morning coffee possibly he only meant to cause unconsciousness and give us all a frightbring emily back to her senses he trailed off aware of pitts monumental disbelief and floundering for a better solution he seemed to have forgotten that he had said jack radley was here for tassie contradicting himself by branding him as of ill reputation or perhaps it was all right to marry a girl to such a man simply not to allow him near your wife the moral contortions of society were still unclear to pitt at another time pitt might almost have been sorry for eustace his mental acrobatics were absurd and yet how often he had seen them before but this time his patience was worn raw he stood up thank you mr march ill see the doctor now and then ill go up and see poor george when ive done that ill want to see the rest of the household if i may not necessary at all eustace said quickly scrambling to his feet only cause quite pointless distress emily is a new widow man my mother is elderly and has had a severe shock my daughter is only nineteen and most naturally delicate in her sensibilities as a girl should be and lady cumminggould is considerably more advanced in years than she realizes pitt hid a bitter smile he was quite sure greataunt vespasia knew better than eustace precisely how old she was and she was certainly braver emily is my sisterinlaw he said quietly i should have called upon her whatever the circumstances of georges death but first ill see the doctor if you please eustace left without speaking again he resented the position he had been placed in his house had been invaded and he had lost control of events it was a unique and frightening occurrencehe was taking orders from a policeman here in his own morning room damn emily she had brought all this upon them with her vulgar jealousy treves came in so soon he must have been waiting close at hand he looked tired pitt had not met him before but liked him instantly there was both humor and pity in the weary lines of his face inspector pitt he said with a raised eyebrow treves he held out his hand pitt took it briefly could it have been suicide rubbish treves replied dourly men like george ashworth dont steal poison and take it in their coffee at seven oclock on a sunny morning in someone elses houseand certainly not over a love affair if hed ever have done it at allwhich i doubtit would have been in a fit of despair over a gambling debt he couldnt pay and hed have blown his brains out with a gun gentlemanly thing to do and he damn surely wouldnt poison a nice little spaniel at the same time spaniel mr march said nothing about a spaniel he wouldnt hes still trying to convince himself its suicide pitt sighed then wed better go up and see the body the police surgeon will look at it later but you can probably tell me all i need to know enormous dose of digitalis treves answered walking towards the door coffee would disguise it i daresay your constable in the kitchen will have found that out poor fellow must have died very quickly i suppose if you have to kill someone short of a bullet through the head this would be about the most merciful and the most efficient way of doing it i daresay youll find the old ladys entire supply is gone she had a lot pitt asked following him across the hall and up the wide shallow stairs to the landing and into the dressing room he noted sadly that george apparently had been sleeping in a separate room from emily he knew perfectly well it was the custom among many people of affluence for husband and wife each to have their own bedroom but he would not have cared for it to wake in the night and know always that charlotte was there beside him was one of the sweetest roots deep at the core of his life an ever waiting retreat from ugliness a warmth from which to go forth into the coldness of any day even the most violent the weariest and the most tragic but there was no time now to contemplate the difference in lives and how much or little it might mean treves was standing beside the bed and the sheetcovered body wordlessly he pulled the cover back and pitt stared down at the waxy pale face they were georges featuresthe straight nose broad browbut the dark eyes were closed and there was a blueness around the sockets everything was the right shape exactly as he remembered him and yet it did not seem to be george death was very real looking at him one could not imagine that the soul was present no injury he said quietly george was not really there this was only a shell but it seemed callous to speak in a normal voice in its presence none at all treves replied there was no struggle nothing but a man drinking coffee that had enough digitalis in it to give him a massive heart attackand an unfortunate little dog getting a treat and dying as well which means it wasnt suicide pitt sighed george would never have killed the dog it wasnt even his stripe will get the details from the servants find out where the coffee was who could have reached it i expect george was the only person to take coffee at that hour most people take tea ill have to see the family nasty treves said sympathetically domestic murder is one of the tragedies of our human condition god knows what we do to each other in what is fondly imagined to be the sanctuary of our homes and is too often a purgatory he opened the door onto the landing again the old lady is a selfish and autocratic old besomdont let her fool you she is in delicate health theres nothing the matter with her except old age then why the digitalis treves shrugged she didnt get it from me shes the sort who affects vapors and palpitations when her family thwarts her its about the only hold she has over young tassie without obedience dominion is empty so she persuaded one of the other doctors in the area to prescribe it for her she seldom misses an opportunity to tell me how he saved her lifeimplying i would have let her die he smiled grimly pitt remembered other dowagers he had met who ruled their families with relentless threats of imminent collapse charlottes grandmother was a fearsome old lady who could cast a gloom on almost any family proceedings with a catalogue of the ingratitude she suffered at their hands perhaps id better see her next he remarked offering his hand to the doctor thank you treves shook it with a firm grip good luck he said shortly and his face conveyed his disbelief in it pitt dispatched a note about digitalis to stripe in the servants hall and set about the next duty he asked the footman to take him to mrs march she was still downstairs in the hotpink boudoir and in spite of the extremely pleasant early afternoon there was a fire burning strongly in the grate making the room stuffyquite unlike the rest of the house where the windows were thrown open she was lying on the chaise longue a tray of tea on a rosewood table beside her also an ornate glass bottle of smelling salts she clutched a handkerchief to her cheek as if she were about to burst into weeping the room was crowded with furniture and drapery and pitt found it almost robbed him of breath closing in on him but the old womans eyes over her fat hand shining with rings were as cold as chips of stone i presume you are the policeman she said with distaste yes maam she did not offer him a seat and he did not invite rebuff by taking one unasked i suppose youll be poking your nose into everybodys affairs and asking a lot of impertinent questions she went on eyeing his wild hair and bulging pockets he disliked her immediately and georges white face was too recent a vision for his usual selfcontrol i hope also to ask some pertinent ones he answered i intend to discover who murdered george he used the word murder deliberately turning its harshness on his tongue her eyes narrowed well youll be a fool if you cant do that but then i daresay you are a fool he stared back at her without a flicker i presume there has been no intruder in the house overnight maam she snorted certainly not her little mouth turned down at the corners in contempt but a burglar would hardly use poison would he no maam the only possible conclusion is that it was someone in the house and its extremely unlikely to be a servant which leaves the family or your guests will you be kind enough to tell me something about those presently in the house you dont need to go through them all she sniffed and pulled a face the room was stifling the cloudless sun hot on the windows but she did not seem to notice there is only my immediate family lord ashworth he was a cousin lady ashworth whom i have heard tell is somehow connected with you she let this incredible piece of intelligence fall into the hot air and remained silent for several seconds then as pitt made no remark she finished tartly and a mr jack radley a person of some disappointmentto my son anyway although i could have told him pitt took the bait told him what maam her eyes gleamed with satisfaction pitt felt the sweat trickle down his skin but it would not be acceptable to take off his jacket in her boudoir immoral the old lady said baldly no money and too handsome by half mr march thought he would be a suitable match for anastasia nonsense she doesnt need to marry good blood shes got plenty of her own not that youd know anything about that she stared up at him cricking her neck to see him but determined not to let him sit down he was an inferior and he must be made to remember it it was not for the likes of policemen to sit themselves on the good furniture in the front of the house by such license had begun the whole erosion of every value that now afflicted the nation if this man had to sit let him do it in the servants hall anyway she went on a man like radley doesnt pick a plainjane like anastasia all that orangecolored hair and skin full of specklesdoesnt come from our side of the family and thin as a washboard hardly a woman at all a man like that is out to marry for money for something fashionable to be seen with in public something handsome to bed ha i shock you pitt remained totally straightfaced not at all maam im sure you are right there are many men like that and many women who are much the same except of course they also like a title where it is to be had the old lady glared at him wishing to snub his insolence but he had made the point she desired and at the moment that need was stronger humha wellmr radley and emily ashworth are an excellent pair came together like two magnets and poor george was the victim thereive done your job for you now go away im tired and i feel ill i have had a severe shock today if you had the slightest idea how to behave you would she trailed off not sure what he would do pitt bowed you are bearing up magnificently maam she glared at him sure there was sarcasm there but unable to pinpoint it exactly enough to retaliate his face was almost offensively innocent wretched creature ha she said grudgingly you may go for the first time he smiled thank you maam gracious of you in the large hall he found a footman waiting for him lady cumminggould is in the breakfast room sir she would like to see you the footman said anxiously this way sir with a slight nod pitt followed him to the door knocked and went in the room was heavily furnished bright sunlight picked out the massive sideboard and large breakfast table the windows were open and a chatter of birds drifted in from the garden vespasia was sitting at the foot of the tableolivias place when she had been alive she looked tired there was a stoop to her shoulders that he had never seen before even in the weariest days when she had been fighting to get the child poverty bill through parliament the relief in her eyes when she saw him was so intense it gave him a lurch of pain that he could do nothing to make it easier for her indeed he feared already that he was going to make it worse she straightened up with an effort good afternoon thomas i am pleased it was possible for you to take thiscaseyourself for once he could think of nothing to say grief was too strong for the few words he could find and yet to speak purely as a policeman would be appalling for heavens sake sit down she ordered i am in no mood to break my neck looking up at you i am sure you have already seen eustace march and his mother yes he sat down obediently opposite her across the heavy polished table what did they say she asked bluntly there was no time for gentle skirting round the truth simply because it was unpleasant mr march tried to convince me it was suicide because george had fallen in love with another woman rubbish vespasia interrupted tartly he was infatuated with sybilla he behaved like a fool but i think by last night he had realized that emily handled it perfectly she had every bit as much sense as i could have hoped pitt glanced down for a moment then up again mrs march said that emily was having an affair with the other guest jack radley spiteful old besom vespasia said in exasperation emilys husband was behaving like an ass with another woman and without the slightest discretion an affliction which lavinia has had to put up with herself and failed to resolve of course emily made it appear she was developing an interest in another man what woman with spirit wouldnt pitt did not comment on lavinia march the pain of the dilemma was known to both of them a man could divorce his wife for adultery a woman had no such privilege she must learn to live with it the best she could with this death the fears engendered by suspicion had begun to grow to warp thought to seize and enlarge every ugly trait who is sybilla he asked because he had to eustaces daughterinlaw vespasia answered wearily william march is eustaces only sonmy grandson she said it as if the idea surprised her olivia had ten daughters seven of whom lived they are all married except tassie eustace wanted to marry her to jack radley thats why he is hereto be inspected so to speak i assume he does not meet with your approval her finely arched eyebrows rose and there was a gleam of humor in her eyes too slight to reach her mouth not for tassie she doesnt love him nor he her but hes pleasing enough as long as one is sensible and doesnt expect too much he has one redeeming feature i cannot imagine he will ever be a bore and that is more than one can say of most socially acceptable young men who else is there in the house he dreaded the answer because if there had been any other outsider he knew mrs march would already have told him no matter how she disapproved of emily she would never choose her for a cause of suicide had there been any other answer available it reflected too badly on the family no one vespasia said very quietly lavinia eustace and tassie live here william and sybilla were visiting for the season george and emily were to be here for a month and jack radley and i are here for three weeks he could think of nothing to say georges murderer had to be one of the eight he could not believe it was vespasia herselfand please god it was not emily i had better go and see them how is emily for the first time vespasia could not look at him she bent her head and hid her face in her hands he knew she was weeping and he longed to comfort her they had shared many emotions in the past anger pity hope defeat now they shared grief but he was still a policeman whose father had been a gamekeeper and she was the daughter of an earl he dared not touch her and the more he cared for her the more deeply it would hurt him if he trespassed and she were to rebuff him he stood helpless and awkward watching an old lady racked with grief and the beginning of terrible fears anyway what could he say that he would somehow alter things hide the truth if it were too ugly she would not believe him or want him to do that she would not expect him to betray himself nor would she have done so in his place then instinct overrode reason and he reached forward his hand and touched her shoulder gently she was extraordinarily thin for all her height when she stood her bones felt fragile there was a faint smell of lavender in the air then he turned and went out of the room in the hall there was a girl of perhaps twenty her hair the brilliant color of marmalade her face pale under its dapple of freckles she had hardly a shred of the beauty with which vespasia had dazzled a generation but she was just as thin and there was perhaps an echo of the high cheekbones the hooded eyelids she was staring at pitt with a mixture of horror and curiosity miss march he inquired yes im tassie marchanastasia you must be emilys policeman it was a statement and phrased like that it was surprisingly painful may i speak with you miss march she gave a little shiver her revulsion was not for himher eyes were too directbut for the situation there had been a murder in her home and a policeman must question her of course she turned and led the way through the dining room to the withdrawing room cool and silvergreen utterly different from the suffocating boudoir if that was the old ladys taste this must have been olivias and for some reason eustace had permitted it to remain tassie offered him a seat and sat down herself on one of the green sofas unconsciously placing her feet together and holding her hands as she had been taught i suppose i should be honest she observed looking at the pale muslin of her dress what do you want to know now that it came to the moment there was very little to ask her but if she was like most wellbred young ladies she was confined to the house a great deal of the time with little to do and she might be extremely observant he debated whether to treat her delicately obliquely or frankly then he looked at the steady slateblue eyes and thought she was probably more like her mothers family than her fathers do you think george was in love with your sisterinlaw he said without preamble her eyebrows shot up but she retained her composure with an aplomb worthy of an older woman no but he thought he was she replied he would have got over it i understand that sort of thing happens from time to time one just has to put up with it which emily did superbly i dont think i should have been so composednot if i loved someone but emily is terribly sensible far more than most women and infinitely more than most men and george was she swallowed and her eyes filled with tears george was very nice really i beg your pardon she sniffed pitt fished in his breast pocket and brought out his only clean handkerchief he passed it to her she took it and blew her nose fiercely thank you i know he was he agreed filling the silence before it became an obstacle between them what about mr radley she looked up with a watery smile i think hes quite tolerable in fact as long as i dont have to marry him i daresay i should like him well enough he makes me laughor he did her face fell but you dont wish to marry him not in the slightest does he wish to marry you i shouldnt think so he doesnt love me if that is what you mean but i will have some money and i dont think he has any how very candid you are she was almost worse than charlotte and he found himself wishing he could protect her from all the anguish that was bound to come one should not lie to the police in matters of importance she said quite sincerely i was really very fond of george and i like emily too someone in this house murdered him yes martin told me sohes the butler it seems impossible ive known them all for yearsexcept mr radley and why on earth should he kill george might he have imagined emily would marry him if george were dead she stared at him not unless he is a lunatic then she turned it over in her mind realizing the only other possibilities but i suppose he could be you can see very little indeed of some people in their faces watching them do all the usual things everyone does eating theirdinner making silly conversation laughing a bit playing games writing letters there is a way of doing all these things and you are taught it as a child like the steps of a dance it doesnt have to mean anything at all you can be any kind of person underneath it its sort of uniform how perceptive you are you are like your grandmother grandmother vespasia she asked guardedly of course thank you she breathed out in relief i am not in the least like the marches have you solved anything not so far oh is that all i should like to go and see how emily is please do i shall find your brother if i can hell be in the conservatory at the far end he has a studio there she stood up and courtesy bade him stand also painting hes an artist hes very good hes had several things in the royal academy there was pride in her voice thank you i shall go and find him as soon as she had gone he turned to the row of french doors and the vines and lilies beyond the conservatory felt humid and full of heavy growth and smelled of lush flowers and hot perfumed air the afternoon sun beat on the windows till it was like an equatorial jungle in the winter a giant furnace maintained the temperature and a pond the dampness william march was precisely where tassie had said he would be standing in front of his easel brush in his hand the sunlight making a fire of his hair his thin face was tense utterly absorbed in the image on his canvas a country scene full of glancing sunlight and fragile almost insubstantial trees as though not only the spring but the garden itself might vanish pitt hardly needed his occasional work recovering stolen art to know that it was good william did not hear him till he was a yard away good afternoon mr march forgive me for interrupting you but i must ask you certain questions about lord ashworths death at first william was startled simply because his concentration had precluded his awareness of anyone else then he put down the brush and faced pitt bleakly of course what do you want to know thoughts were teeming in pitts head but looking at the clever vulnerable face the delicate mouth the quicksilver dreamers eyes he abandoned them as clumsy even brutal what was there left to say i am sure you must realize that lord ashworth was murdered he began tentatively i suppose so william agreed with obvious reluctance i have tried to think of a way in which it could conceivably be an accident i failed you did not consider suicide pitt said curiously remembering eustaces determined attempts george wouldnt kill himself william turned away and looked at the canvas on his easel he wasnt that kind of man his voice trailed off and his face looked even thinner pinched with a sorrow that seemed to run right through him it was precisely what pitt knew to be true there was infinitely less hypocrisy less selfregard in william than in his father pitt found himself liking him yes that is what i thought he agreed for a moment william was silent then recognition lit his face of coursei forgot youre emilys brotherinlaw arent you he said so quietly his words were almost lost im sorry its all very he searched for an expression of what he felt but it eluded him very hard i am afraid it wont get better pitt said honestlyim forced to believe someone in this house killed him i suppose so but i cant tell you whoor why william picked up his brush again and began to work touching a muted raw sienna into the shadows of a tree but pitt was not ready to be dismissed what do you know of mr radley very little father wants to marry him to tassie because he thinks jacks family might get him a peerage we have a lot of money you knowfrom trade father wants to become respectable indeed pitt was startled by his frankness there was no attempt to protect his fathers weakness no family defense and might they i should think so tassies a good catch jacks not likely to do betteraristocratic heiresses can afford a tide and the americans wont settle for anything less or to be accurate their mothers wont he went on working in the shadows looking at the vandyck brown discounting it and squeezing out burnt umber what about emily pitt asked doesnt she have more money than miss march williams hand stopped in midair yes she will have now that george is dead he winced as he said it but jack has too much experience of women if even half his reputation is deserved to believe from a couple of evenings flirtation that emily would consider marrying himespecially with george behaving like such a fool emily was only retaliating you may not be aware of it mr pitt but in society married women have little else to do but gossip dress up in the latest fashions and flirt with other men it is their only source of entertainment not even an idiot takes it seriously my wife is very beautiful and has flirted as long as i have known her pitt stared at him but could see no additional pain no new anger or awareness of fear as he said it i see no you dont william said dryly i dont suppose youve ever been bored in your life no pitt admitted there had never been time poverty and ambition do not allow it you are fortunateat least in that respect pitt looked at the canvas again neither have you he said with conviction for the first time william smiled a sudden flash then it was gone again as quickly replaced by the knowledge of tragedy thank you mr march pitt stepped back i shant disturb you any longer for the moment william did not reply he was working again downstairs stripe was also finding things difficult he was not any more welcome in the servants hall than pitt had been in the withdrawing room the cook looked at him with acute disfavor it was the hour after luncheon when she should have been able to take a little time off before beginning to think of dinner and she wished to sit with her feet up and gossip with the housekeeper and the visiting ladys maids there was always scandal to exchange and today especially she was overburdened with the need to express her emotions she was a large capable woman with pride in her job but spending all day on her feet was more than anyone should be asked to bear hurts me veins something terrible she confided to the housekeeper a rotund woman of her own age wouldnt tell them flipperty parlormaids that though gets above themselves far too easily as it is not the discipline there was in my young days i know how a house ought to be run everythings going downhill the housekeeper agreed and now weve got the police in the ouse i ask you whatever next notice thats what the cook shook her head alf the girls givin notice you mark my words mrs tobias youre right mrs mardle youre right and no mistake the housekeeper agreed sagely they were in the housekeepers sitting room stripe was still in the servants hall where they ate and had such companionship as their duties allowed time for he was uncomfortable because it was a world he was unused to and he was an intruder it was immaculately clean the floor was scrubbed by the thirteenyearold scullery maid every morning before six am the dressers and cupboards were massed with china any one service worth a year of his wages there were jars of pickles and preserves bins of flour sugar oatmeal and other dry stores and in the scullery he could see piles of vegetables there was a vast blackleaded cooking range with its bank of ovens and beside it scuttles of coke and coal of course the boiling coppers sinks washboards and mangles would all be in the laundry room and the airing racks drawn up to the ceiling by pulleys full of clean linen now in this warm delicioussmelling kitchen he was standing in the middle of the floor with an array of maids and footmen in front of him all stiffly to attention immaculate men in livery girls in black stuff dresses and crisp snowdrift caps and aprons the parlormaids trimmed with lace many middleclass ladies would have been glad to own stripe thought by far the handsomest of them was the ladys maid of the household lettie taylor but she seemed to regard him with even more disdain than the others the visiting ladies had naturally brought their own staff and they were also present except digby lady cumminggoulds maid she had been elected to remain with the new widow perhaps because she was the oldest and considered the most sensible somewhat uncomfortable under their hostile gaze stripe licked his pencil asked the questions he was obliged to and noted down their answers in his book it all told him nothing except that the trays were set the night before and left in the upstairs pantry where the kettles were brought and the tea made freshlyor in lord ashworths case the coffeeeach morning on this particular occasion there had been an unusual turmoil and the pantry had been filled with steam and apparently unattended for some minutes anyone could at least in theory have slipped in and poisoned the coffee he asked for a private room and was shown the butlers pantry which actually was a sitting room for the butlers personal use there he interviewed each member of the staff alone he askedwith commendable subtlety he thoughtfor any information they might have about relationships within the family comings and goings and learned precisely nothing that his own guess could not have told him he began to wonder if they identified with their masters or mistresses so closely that it was their own honor they defended their own status in the small community that existed in this house finally on being handed pitts note regarding the digitalis he asked lettie to take him upstairs and show him mrs marchs room and her medicine cabinet and any other medicine cabinet in the house she put her hands up to tuck her hair in more tidily then smoothed her apron over her slim hips to stripe blushing a little at the thought and terrified lest it should show in his face she was the prettiest most pleasing woman he had ever seen he found himself hoping this investigation would take a long timeseveral weeks at the least he followed her obediently up the back stairs watching the tilt of her head and the swish of her skirt and finding he was daydreaming when they came to the pantry she had spoken to him twice before he pulled his attention to the subject at hand and looked round at the tables where the trays were laid where was lord ashworths tray with the coffee he asked clearing his throat painfully arent you listening to me she said shaking her head i just told you it was there she pointed to the end of the table nearest the door was that usual i mean her eyes were the color of the sky above the river on a summer day he coughed hard and began again i mean did you put them in the same places each morning miss that one yes she replied apparently unaware of his gaze because it was coffee and the others were tea tell me again what happens every morning he knew what she had already said but he wanted to listen to her again and he could think of no more relevant questions dutifully she repeated the story and he noted it down again thank you miss he said politely closing his notebook and putting it in his pocket now would you show me mrs marchs medicine cupboard if you please she looked a little pale forgetting her general umbrage at having the police in the house at this sudden reminder of death yes of course i will she led the way through the upstairs baize door onto the main landing and along to old mrs marchs room she knocked on the door and when there was no answer opened it and went in the room was like no other stripe had ever imagined let alone seen it was as pink and white as an apple blossom everywhere he looked there were frills laces doilies ribbons photographs with satin bindings a suffocating sea of pillows pink velvet curtains drawn and swagged to reveal white net ruching beneath stripe was robbed of words the air seemed motionless and hot and it clogged his lungs awkwardly in case he left a large footprint in it he tiptoed across the pink carpet behind lettie to the ornate cupboard painted pink and white where she opened a little drawer and looked into it her face grave stripe stood behind her smelling a slight flower perfume from her hair and peeked down at the little space packed with bottles twists of paper and cardboard pillboxes is the digitalis there he asked breaking the silence no mr stripe she said very quietly her hand trembling above the drawer i know what all these are and the digitalis is gone she was frightened and he wanted to reassure her promise he would look after her himself personally see that no one ever hurt her but that would offend her so much the very idea was painful to him she would be outraged by his temerity doubtless she already had admirersthat thought too was extraordinarily unpleasant he pulled his wits together are you sure he asked in a businesslike manner could it be in another drawer or on the bedside table he looked round the cloying room there could be an entire apothecarys shop hidden in all these billowing frills and folds no lettie said decidedly her voice high i have tidied this room this morning the digitalis is gone mr stripe i she shivered yes he said hopefully nothing thank you miss he began back towards the doorway still careful not to knock anything then i think thatll be all for the moment id better send a message to mr pitt she took a deep breath mr stripe yes miss he stopped and turned to face her aware of the blood burning up his cheeks she was trying to hide her fear but it was there in her eyes dark and shivery mr stripe is it true lord ashworth was murdered we think so miss but dont you worry well take good care o you an well find whoever did it be sure now he had said it he waited for her reaction relief flooded into her face then she remembered herself her position and her loyalties she drew herself up and lifted her chin very high of course she said with dignity thank you mr stripe now if theres nothing else ill be about my business yes miss he said regretfully and allowed her to guide him downstairs again to resume his own duties in the butlers pantry pitt saw sybilla march also and the moment she walked into the room he understood why george had behaved with such abandon she was a beautiful woman vivid and sensuous there was a warmth about her face a grace in her movement utterly different from the cool elegance of fashion and yet for all the curves of her body the fragility in the slenderness of her neck the smallness of her wrists made her also seem vulnerable and robbed him of the anger he had wanted to feel she sat down on the green sofa exactly where tassie had been an hour earlier i dont know anything mr pitt she said before he had time to ask her eyes were shadowed as if she had been weeping and there was a tightness about her which he thought was fear but there had been a murder in the house and whoever had committed it was still here only a fool would not be afraid you may not appreciate the value of what you know mrs march he said as he sat down i imagine anyone had the opportunity to put the digitalis in lord ashworths coffee we shall have to approach it from the point of discovering who might wish to she said nothing the white hands in her lap were clenched so tightly the knuckles were shining he found it unexpectedly difficult to go on he did not want to be brutal and yet skirting round the subjects that were painful would be useless and would only prolong the distress was lord ashworth in love with you he said bluntly her head jerked up eyes wide as if she had been startled by the question and yet she must have known it was inevitable there was a long silence before she repliedso long pitt was about to ask again i dont know she said in a husky voice what does a man mean when he says i love you perhaps there are as many answers as there are men it was a reply he had not foreseen at all he had expected a blushing admission or a defiant one or even a denial but a philosophical answer that was a question itself left him confused did you love him he asked far more brashly than he had planned her mouth moved in the slightest of smiles and he suspected there was an infinity of meaning in it he would never grasp no but i liked him very much did your husband know the true nature of your regard for lord ashworth he was floundering now and he was acutely aware of it yes she admitted but william was not jealous if that is what you imagine we mix in society a great deal george was not the first man to have found me attractive that pitt was obliged to believe but whether william was jealous or not was another matter how far had the affair gone and did william know its extent was he either ignorant of it or truly a complacent husband or was there nothing to mind there was certainly no point in asking sybilla thank you mrs march he said formally now he could no longer put it off he must go and see emily face her grief he stood up and excused himself leaving sybilla alone in the green withdrawing room in the hall he found a footman and requested to be taken to see emily the man was reluctant at first having more respect for grief than the necessities of investigation but common sense overcame him and he led the way up the broad stairs to the landing with its jardinieres of ferns and knocked on vespasias bedroom door it was opened by a middleaged maid with a plain wise face at the moment creased with pity she stared up at pitt grimly quite prepared to stand her ground and defy him she would protect emily at any cost and pitt could see it in the shape of her shoulders and the square planting of her feet im thomas pitt he said loudly enough for emily beyond the door to hear him my wife is lady ashworths sister she will be here soon but i must speak to lady ashworth first the maid hesitated looked him up and down with a measured gaze and made up her mind very well i suppose youd best come in she stood aside emily was sitting up on the bed fully dressed in a gown of dark blueshe had nothing black with her her hair was loose at the back of her neck and she was almost as pale as the pillows behind her her eyes were cavernous with shock he sat down on the bed and took her hand holding it in both of his it felt limp and small as a childs there was no point in saying he was sorry she must know that must see it in his face and feel it in his touch wheres charlotte she asked shakily coming aunt vespasia sent her carriage shell be here soon but i have to ask you some questions i wish i didnt but wishing doesnt change things i know she sniffed and the tears escaped her will and ran down her cheeks dear heaven do you think i dont know pitt could feel the maid behind his shoulder alert and defensive ready to drive him out the moment he threatened emily and he loved her for it emily george was deliberately killed by someone in this house you know i have to find out who she stared at him perhaps part of her mind had understood that already or at least rejected all the other possibilities but she had not actually faced it as bluntly as that that meansthe family or jack radley i know of course it is conceivable we could turn up a reason among the servants but i dont believe it dont be ridiculous thomas why on earth would one of uncle eustaces servants murder george they hardly even knew of him a month ago anyway why would any servant murder anyone in the house its a nice thought but its stupid then it is one of the eight of you he said watching her face she breathed out slowly eight thomas not me you cant she was so white he thought she was going to faint even lying against the pillows as she was he gripped her hand harder no of course i dont nor do i think it was aunt vespasia but i have to find out who did and that involves finding out the truth about a lot of things she said nothing behind him he could hear the maid winding her hands in her apron silently he blessed the woman again and vespasia for providing her emilycould jack radley have imagined that you might one day marry him were you free to no her voice faded away and her eyes left his then came back not from anything i said ii flirted a littlea very little thats all he thought that was less than the truth but it did not matter now is there anything else he persisted no then she realized that he was no longer thinking only of jack radley but of anyone i dont know i cant think why anyone should want to kill george couldnt it possibly have been an accident thomas no she looked down at her hand still in his could it have been meant for someone else and not george who does anyone else have coffee first thing in the morning her voice was hardly even a whisper no there was no need to pursue the conclusion she understood as well as he did what about william march emily could he have been jealous enough to kill george over his attentions to sybilla i dont think so she said honestly he showed no sign of even having noticed much less caring i think all he minds about is his painting but anyway her fingers curled round his responding to his grip thomas i swear i heard george and sybilla quarreling last night and when george came up before he went to bed he came to see me and she struggled for a moment to keep mastery of herself and he let me know that it was over with sybilla notnot directly of course that would have been admitting there was somethingbut we understood one another he quarreled with sybilla yes there was no point in asking her if the quarrel had been violent enough to prompt murder she could not answer nor would it mean anything if she did he stood up letting her hand go gently if you think of anything at all please send for me i cant leave it go i know that ill tell you he smiled at her very slightly to blunt the edge of what he had said and to try to throw the frailest of lines across the gulf between the policeman and the man she swallowed hard and the corners of her mouth lifted in an answering shadowy smile it was an hour later when the bedroom door opened again and charlotte came in she said nothing at all but came and sat on the bed reached out her hand to emily and slipped her arms round her and let her weep as she needed to holding her close and rocking a little back and forth murmuring old meaningless words of comfort from childhood when at last emily lay back against the pillows her face was drawn her eyes puffy with dark shadows below them and her usually pretty hair straggled in untidy wisps the sight of her brought home to charlotte the reality of death and fear far more violently than all the words imaginable or excessive weeping people weep for many things she began with the painful practical help she knew was the only way to move to any real healing she rang the bell by the bed i dont want anything emily said numbly yes you do charlotte was firm you want a cup of tea and so do i i dont if i take anything i shall be sick no you wont but if you go on crying you will its enough for now we have things to do suddenly emily was furious all her shock and fear exploded in resentment because charlotte was still safe wrapped up in her own marriage and this was just one more adventure for her she was sitting on the bed with a businesslike complacency in her face and emily hated her for it george had been carried away white and cold only an hour ago and charlotte was busy she should have been shattered and frozen inside as emily was my husband was murdered this morning she said in a tight hard voice if all you can do is exercise your curiosity and selfimportance then id feel a lot better if youd go back home and get on with your housework or whatever it is you do when you havent got anyone elses life to meddle in for a moment charlotte felt as if she had been slapped the blood burned in her face and her eyes stung the retort stopped on her lips only because she could find no words for it then she took a deep breath and remembered emilys pain emily was younger all the protective feelings of childhood came back in a tumble of images always emily the smallest the last to achieve any milestone to maturity emily had envied her admired her and tried desperately to keep up just as she herself was always a step behind sarah who murdered george she asked aloud i dont know emilys voice rose dangerously then dont you think we had better find outvery quickly before whoever it is makes it look even more as though you did emily gasped and her face looked even grayer than before at that moment the door opened and digby came in as soon as she saw charlotte her expression hardened but charlotte had not forgotten all her early years in her parents home when she was accustomed to having a ladys maid and the habit returned automatically will you be kind enough to bring us a tray of tea she said to digby and perhaps something sweet to eat with it i dont want anything emily repeated well i do charlotte forced the outline of a smile to her lips and nodded a dismissal to digby who retired obediently but obviously she deferred judgment upon charlotte charlotte sat down facing emily do you want me to tell you again how deeply i grieve for you how sorry i am how horrified emily looked at her grudgingly no thank you there would hardly be any point then help me to learn at least enough of the truth to prevent another tragedy because if you think someone who would murder george would then be averse to seeing that you were blamed for it you are dreaming i didnt do it emily whispered charlotte controlled herself with a difficulty so sharp for a moment the breath caught in her chest with a stab and tears prickled in her eyes i know she said with a quiver in her voice and she coughed to try to cover it up have you any idea who did what about this sybilla could they have quarreled or her husbandyou didnt tell me his name or did she have another lover she saw concentration overtake anger in emilys face then grief again and unrestrained tears charlotte waited forcing herself not to lean forward and put her arms round her emily did not need sympathy now she needed practical help yes emily said at last they quarreled last night just before we went to bed she blew her nose fiercely and again a second time and stuffed the handkerchief under the pillow and reached for another charlotte passed her own the door opened and digby came in with a tray bearing a flowered china teapot a dish of warm crumbly scones and butter and strawberry jam she set it down carefully shall i pour maam she asked with guarded eyes charlotte accepted yes please and if you can find some handkerchiefs bring them yes maam digbys face relaxed perhaps charlotte was not as bad as she feared charlotte passed emily a steaming cup and buttered a scone and spread jam on it eat it she advised slowly and chew it well we are both going to need all our strength emily took it obediently his name is william she continued answering the question as soon as digby was out the door and i suppose he could have killed george but he didnt seem to care about sybilla i dont even know whether he really noticed how far it had gone maybe sybilla always behaves like that do you know charlotte hated the question but it would hover on the edge of their minds until it was answered emily hesitated only a moment i can guess but it was over he came into my room before he went to bed and we talked she took a shivery breath but this time she did not lose control it was going to be all right ifif he hadnt been killed so it could have been sybilla charlotte made it a statement rather than a matter open to doubt is she that kind of woman has she enough vanity enough hate emilys eyes widened i dont know dont be silly she was trying to take george away from youyou know everything about her that you possibly can now think emily there were several minutes of silence while emily sipped her tea and ate two scones surprising herself i dont know she said again at last i really dont im not sure whether she loved him or just found him fun and enjoyed the attention it might be that if it wasnt george it would have been someone else charlotte did not find that in the least helpful but she realized that it was all emily could give she left it for a moment who else is there nobody emily said quietly it doesnt make any sense she looked up eyes wide and hollow too hurt to think charlotte reached out and touched her gently all right ill judge for myself she took another scone and ate it absently emily sat up a little her shoulders stiff pulling the thin fabric of her wrap round her it was almost as though she expected some kind of a blow and was tensed to ward it off i really dont know what george felt for sybilla she stared down at the embroidered hem of the sheet between her fingers for that matter im not as sure as i used to be precisely what he felt for me even before we came here perhaps i didnt know him so very well its funny when i look back on cater street and all the things that happened there towards the endi thought id never make all those mistakes myself like sarah and mama taking things for granted assuming you know someone just because you see them every day coming and going in the house even sleep in the same bed with them sometimes touch them she hesitated a moment grasping her selfcontrol hard assume that you know them that you understand but perhaps thats exactly what i did i assumed a lot of things about george and maybe i was wrong she waited without looking up charlotte knew she was half hoping for a contradiction and yet she would not have believed one had it been offered we never do know anyone else completely she said instead and nor should weit would be an intrusion and i daresay at times it would be painful and destructive and perhaps boring how long would you stay in love with someone you could look through like glass and see everything one has to have mystery somewhere ahead left to explore or why go on she crept a hand forward and took emilys gently id hate thomas to know everything i thought or didsome of the weak and selfish things id rather fight them on my own and then forget them i couldnt do that if he knewid wonder at all the wrong times if he remembered hed never find it so easy to forgive me if he knew some of the thoughts in my mind and there are some things about people it is better not to know just because if you did you couldnt ever completely dismiss them emily looked up her face angry you think i flirted with jack radley that i led him to expect something emily i never even heard of him until just now charlotte met her eyes frankly you are accusing yourself either because thomas has said something or you think he will or because there is a thread of truth in it youre damnably pious about it emily suddenly lost her temper again and snatched her hand away you sit there as if youd never flirted in your life what about general ballantyne you lied to him just to do your detectingand he adored you you used that i never treated anyone like that charlotte burned at the memory but there was no time for the selfindulgence of guilt or explanation now not that there was an explanationthe charge was true emilys anger hurt but charlotte understood even though her feelings made her want to lash back that it was unfair and had nothing to do with the problem now but more powerful than that superficial abrasion was the deep hurt for emily the knowledge of a loss more profound than she had ever felt herself sometimes when pitt had followed thieves into the dark alleys of the rookeries charlotte had feared for his life till she was cold and sick but it had never been a reality something that did not finally end in the overwhelming warmth of his arms and the certainty that until next time it was all a mirage a nightmare vanished with the day there would be no sunlit awakening for emily some people are incredibly vain she said aloud could mr radley have imagined you might offer him more than friendship not unless hes a complete fool emily said less harshly she seemed about to say something more then lost the words then we are left with william and sybilla or someone else in the family who has a reason we havent even guessed at emily sighed it doesnt make much sense does it there must be something very importantand very uglythat i dont know something i havent even imagined it makes me wonder how much of my safe and pretty life was all a lie charlotte had met no one on her arrival except greataunt vespasia and her only briefly she knew she was going to be given the dressing room where george had slept partly because it was immediately next to emily but also because no one else intended to give up their own accommodations for her georges body was laid out silent and whitewrapped in one of the old nurserymaids rooms in the servants wing charlotte dreaded lying in the same bed that george had died in only a few hours ago and yet there was no alternative the only way in which she could bear it would be in refusing to allow the thought into her mind her few dark clothes suitable for summer mourning had already been unpacked for her she blushed as she remembered how worn they were how plain the underwear even mended in places and her dresses adapted from last year to look a little less unfashionable she had only two pair of boots and neither of them was really new at another time she would have been angry at the embarrassment of it and stayed away rather than cause emily to be ashamed for her now there was no time for such petty emotions she must change from traveling clothes wash her face and do her hair and present herself for the evening meal which was bound to be appallingly grim perhaps even hostile but someone in this house was guilty of murder on the way downstairs for dinner she had reached the lowest step past the dark paneling and rows of muddy oil paintings of marches of the past when she came almost face to face with an elderly woman in fierce black jet beads glinting in the gaslight on her neck and bosom her graywhite hair was screwed back in a fashion more than twenty years out of date her cold blue marble eyes fixed charlotte with immovable distaste i presume you are emilys sister she looked her up and down briefly vespasia said she sent for youalthough i do think she might have informed us first and invited an opinion before taking matters into her own hands but perhaps it is just as well you are here you may be of some useim sure i dont know what to do for emily weve never had anything like this in the family she regarded charlottes gown and the toes of her boots which showed beneath the hem they were not of the quality she was accustomed to even the maids had one new pair every season whether they needed them or not for the sake of appearances charlottes had obviously seen several seasons already whats your name she demanded i daresay ive been told but i forget charlotte pitt charlotte answered her coldly her eyebrows raised in question as to who the asker might be herself the old lady stared at her irritably i am mrs march i presume you areshe hesitated almost imperceptibly and glanced again at charlottes bootscoming in to dinner charlotte swallowed the retort that rose to her lipsthis was not the time for selfindulgent rudenessand forced herself to assume an expression far meeker than she felt she accepted as though it had been an invitation thank you well you are early the old lady snapped dont you have a timepiece charlotte felt her cheeks burn she understood with a passion how so many girls marry anyone who will have them simply to leave home and put away forever the specter of living out the rest of their lives at the beck and call of an overbearing mother there must have been a million loveless marriages contracted for just such reasons please heaven they did not contract such a motherinlaw instead she swallowed hard i thought i might have the opportunity of meeting the family first she replied quietly they are all strangers to me quite the old lady agreed meaningfully i am going to my boudoir i daresay you will find someone in the withdrawing room and with that she walked off leaving charlotte to find her own way through the dining room set for the meal but as yet unoccupied and through the double doors into the cool green withdrawing room beyond already there standing in the middle of the carpet was a girl of about nineteen very thin under her muslin dress her vivid red hair piled untidily her wide delicate mouth grave she smiled as soon as she saw charlotte you must be emilys sister she said immediately im so glad youve come she looked down then up again ruefully because i dont know what to doeven what to say neither do i charlotte thought painfully everything sounds banal and insincere but that was no excuse even clumsy help was better than ignoring grief running away as if it were a disease and you were afraid of being contaminated im anastasia march the girl went on but please call me tassie im charlotte pitt yes i know grandmama said youd be coming she pulled a little face charlotte had already been given grandmamas opinion of that further conversation was prevented by the doors opening again and william and sybilla march coming in she first dressed in glittering black lace around the smooth white throat he a step behind charlotte could see instantly how george had been fascinated with her she had a vibrancy even in repose that emily did not an air of mystery and intensity that would intrigue many men she did not need to do anythingit was there in her face the dark wide eyes the curve of her mouth the richness of her figure charlotte could well imagine how hard emily had had to work how unceasing her charm how tight her selfcontrol to win georges attention back again no wonder jack radley had been drawn but how careless had emily been with her mind solely on george could she have given away far more than she intended and been too preoccupied to notice how seriously he had taken her advances and william march the so slightly complacent husbandhis face was anything but uncaring his features were sensitive ascetic thin nose chiseled mouth yet there was passion of some sort within him even if it was more complex than simple adoration or a fire in the blood he might despise both of those and yet be just as much their victim her contemplation was cut off by eustace march himself sweeping in immaculately dressed his round eyes flicking from one to another seeing who was absent assuring himself that all was as he wished it his gaze stopped on charlotte he seemed already to have made up his mind how he was going to treat her and his smile was unctuous and confident i am eustace march most fortunate you were able to come my dear mrs pitt very fitting poor emily needs someone who knows her we shall do our best of course but we cannot be the same as her own family most suitable that you should be here his eyes flicked towards sybilla and he gave a slight satisfied smile most suitable he repeated the door opened again and the only unrelated guest came in the one who troubled charlotte the most jack radley as soon as she saw him standing elegantly just inside the arch of the lintel she understood more of the problem than she had before and felt the coldness grow inside her it was not so much that he was handsomealthough his eyes were amazingas that he had a grace and a vitality that demanded a womans attention no doubt he was totally aware of the fact his charm was his primary asset and he had sufficient intelligence to make the best possible use of it meeting his gaze across the short space of the green carpet she could understand only too well how emily had used him as a foil against which to win georges attention again a flirtation with the man might be enormous fun and all too believable only it might prove more addictive than she had foreseenand far harder to end than to begin perhaps after the heady excitement of a forbidden romance the exhilaration of the game superbly played george familiar and predictable would be a prize less worth the winning might emily perhaps without acknowledging it have been willing to continue the affair and had jack radley seen it as his chance at last for a wife prettier and far far richer than tassie march it was an ugly thought but now that it was in her brain it was ineradicable without another solution to force it out to disprove it beyond the smallest doubt she glanced at eustace standing with his feet a little apart solid and satisfied his hands clasped behind his back whatever nervousness he might feel was under control he must have convinced himself he was in charge again he was the patriarch leading his family through a crisis everyone would look to him and he would rise to the occasion women would lean on him confide in him rest on his strength men would admire him envy him after all death is a part of life it must be dealt with with courage and decorumand he had not been overfond of george she looked next at tassie as unlike her father as it was possible to be she was painfully slender where he was thick broadboned vivid and alive where he was innately immovable settled and sure did he really want to marry tassie to jack radley in order to purchase himself the ultimate respectability of a title through the radley family connections as emily had said in her letters looking at him now it seemed eminently likely although again it could be no more than the desire of any good father to see his daughter escape the prison of home to find another man to provide her with an establishment of her own when he no longer could and with the social status of wife and that goal and haven of all women a family was it what tassie wanted charlotte cast her mind back to the time when she had been taken with other young women of her age to parties balls and soirees in desperate hope of catching the right husband if one were wellborn enough to come out it was a disaster to finish the season unbetrothed the mark of social failure no one married unless the arrangement were suitable the proposed partner acceptable to ones family very seldom did one know the person except in the most perfunctory way it was impossible to spend time alone together or to speak of anything but trivialities and once a betrothal was announced it was rarely broken and only with difficulty and subsequent speculation of scandal but perhaps anything was better than life in perpetual bondage first to old mrs march and then to eustace he looked robust enough to live another thirty years the introductions had been effected and she had barely noticed now eustace was chunnering on about his emotions rocking slightly back and forth and holding his strong square and immaculately manicured hands together we offer you our condolences my dear mrs pitt it grieves me that there is nothing we can do to be of comfort to you he was making a statement of fact distancing himself and his family from the affair he did not mean to become any further involved and he was making sure charlotte understood but charlotte was here to investigate and she had no compunction at all she might feel profound pity perhaps even for eustace before all this was over but she could not afford such tenderness now when emily was on the edge of such danger they hanged women as easily as men for committing murder and that thought drove all others from her mind she smiled sweetly up at eustace i am sure you underestimate yourself mr march from emilys letters i believe you are a man of the greatest ability who would rise to assume natural leadership in a crisis just the sort of man any woman would turn to when the situation overwhelms her she saw the blood rise in his face till he was scarlet to the eyes she was describing him precisely as he wished to be seenat any time but this and of course your loyalty to your family is beyond anyone to question she finished eustace drew a shuddering breath and let it out with a splutter tassie stared aghast not seeing the irony and sybilla sneezed repeatedly into a lace handkerchief good evening charlotte aunt vespasia said from the doorway her eyes for an instant catching some of their old fire i had no idea emily had written so well of eustace how charming some flicker of movement made charlotte turn and she caught a glimpse of black hatred on williams face that was so swiftly removed she was half convinced it was a trick of the light a reflection of the gas lamp in his eyes tassie moved a step closer to him as if to touch her fingers to his arm but changed her mind family loyalty is a wonderful thing sybilla remarked with an expression that could have meant anything at all except what it said i expect a tragedy like this will show us where our true friends really are i am sure charlotte agreed looking at no one we shall discover depths in each other we had not dreamed of eustace choked jack radleys eyes opened so wide he seemed transfixed and old mrs march threw the door open so violently it jarred against the wall and bruised the paper dinner was grim conducted mostly in silence since mrs march chose to freeze any conversation at birth by staring fixedly at whoever spoke afterwards she declared that in view of the days events it would be suitable if everyone retired early she glowered at eustace and then at jack radley so they could not possibly escape her meaning then she rose and commanded the ladies to follow her they trooped obediently to sit for an insufferable hour in the pink boudoir before excusing themselves and going upstairs emily had gone back to her own room because naturally vespasia required hers for herself lying hot and tangled in georges bed in the dressing room charlotte was acutely aware of her wondering if she should get up and go to her or if it was one of those times when emily needed to be alone to work through the stages of her grief as she must she woke for the final time a little late to find the air heavy and humid and the room full of white flat light there was a maid standing in the doorway with a tray in her hands a hideous flood of memory swamped charlotte not only of where she was and that george was dead but that he had had poisoned coffee on his morning tray for a moment the thought of sitting here in this same bed and drinking tea was intolerable she opened her mouth to say something angry then saw that it was the short sensible figure of digby and the protest died good morning maam digby set the tray down and drew the curtains ill draw you a bath itll be good for you she did not allow any question into her tone it was clearly an order possibly originating with greataunt vespasia charlotte sat up blinking her eyes were gritty her head ached and she longed for the luxury of hot cleantasting tea have you seen lady ashworth this morning she asked no maam the mistress gave her some laudanum last night and said i was to leave her till ten at the soonest and then take her breakfast in no doubt youll be wanting to take yours downstairs with the family again it was not a question in fact it was the last thing charlotte felt like but it was clearly a matter of duty and she could certainly be of no service to emily lying here in bed breakfast was another almost silent meal taken in a room sharply chilly since eustace had preceded them and thrown all the windows open and no one dared to close them while he was still there plowing his way with unabated appetite through porridge bacon kedgeree muffins and toast and marmalade afterwards charlotte excused herself and went to the morning room where she wrote letters for emily informing various more distant members of the family of georges death that at least would save emily some pain by eleven she had completed all she could think of and emily was still not down so she decided to begin her pursuit in earnest she had intended to speak to william to see if she could form a clearer impression of him and confirm in her own mind what that extraordinary expression she had glimpsed the evening before might have been she learned from the parlormaid that he was likely to be in his painting studio at the far end of the conservatory and that the police were in the house againnot the inspector who had been the day before but the constableand the whole kitchen was set on its ears by his probing and prying into all sorts that was none of his affair cook was beside herself and the scullery maid was in tears the bootboys eyes were bulging out like organ stops the housekeeper had never been so insulted in all her life and the inbetween maid was giving notice however she did not get as far as the studio because just inside the entrance of the conservatory she met with sybilla standing silent and motionless staring at a camellia bush charlotte gathered her wits and availed herself of this opportunity instead one could almost imagine oneself out of england altogether she observed pleasantly sybilla was jerked out of her reverie and struggled to find a civil reply to such a banal remark indeed one could there were lilies blooming a few feet away their succulent flesh reminded charlotte of bloodless faces she did not know how long they would be alone there she must use the time and she fancied sybilla was too intelligent for any oblique approach to succeed surprise just might was george in love with you she asked candidly sybilla stood frozen for so long charlotte could hear the condensation dripping from the top leaves near the roof onto the ones below the fact that she did not instantly deny it was important in itself was she debating the truth with herself or merely the safety of answering surely they must all know by now that it was murder and have expected the question i dont know she said at last i am tempted to say mrs pitt that it is a private matter and none of your concern but i suppose that since emily is your sister you cannot help caring she swung round to face charlotte her eyes wide her smile vulnerable and curiously bitter i cannot answer for him and i am sure you dont expect me to repeat everything he said to me but emily was jealous that is undoubted she also carried it superbly looking at her charlotte was aware of intense emotions inside her of the capability for passion and for pain she could not possibly dislike her as she had intended i apologize for asking she said brittlely i know it sounds gauche yes sybilla agreed dryly but you dont have to explain there was no anger visible in sybillas face only a tightness a consciousness of both irony and tragedy charlotte was furious with herself and entangled in confusion this woman had taken emilys husbandwhether intentionally or not in front of the whole houseand perhaps directly caused his death she wanted to hate her with an unfettered clean violence yet she could so easily imagine herself with similar feelings and she was unable to sustain rage against anyone the moment she comprehended the capacity for pain it ruined her judgment and tied her tongue thank you the words came out clumsily it was not at all what she had meant for this interview but she must try to salvage something out of it do you know mr radley well not very sybilla replied with a faint smile papainlaw wishes him to marry poor tassie and he is here for everyone to come discreetly to some arrangement although there is not much discreet about jacknor i gather has there ever been is tassie in love with him she felt a stab of shame for emily if she were and being engineered into a marriage while jack radley quite openly humiliated her by displaying his attraction to emily then how she must have suffered were there any possibility of mistake charlotte would have supposed the poison intended for emily sybilla was smiling slightly she reached out and touched the camellia petals now i suppose they will go brown she remarked they do if you touch them no she wasnt in fact i dont think she wanted to marry him at all shes something of a romantic in that one phrase she summed up a host of things a world of both regret and contempt for girlish innocence a wry affection for tassie and the knowledge that charlotte must be of a lower social class than herself to ask such a question at all people like the marches married for family reasonsto accumulate more wealth to consolidate trade empires or ally with competitors above all to breed strong sons to continue the namenever for emotional fancies like falling in love it passed too quickly and left too little behind what was falling in love anyway the curve of a cheek the arch of a brow a trick of grace or flattery a moment of sharing but it was hard to commit oneself to such an intimate and permanent tie without something of the magic even if it was very often an illusion and sometimes it was real most of the time charlotte took thomas for granted like a profound friendship but there were many moments when her heart beat in her throat and she still knew him in a crowded street among hundreds by the way he stood or recognized his step with a lift of excitement and mr radley i take it is a realist she said aloud oh i think so sybilla agreed looking back at charlotte and biting her lip very slightly i dont think circumstances have allowed him a choice charlotte opened her mouth to ask if he might not have become obsessed with emily all the same then realized that the question was anything but helpful tassie march might inherit a pleasing sum from both her grandparents but it would pale beside the ashworth fortune that would now be emilys alone why look for a motive of love of any degree when that of money was so apt they were at the doorway of the conservatory and there was nothing more to say charlotte excused herself and escaped inside she had learned nothing that she had not already surmised except that instinctively she felt an empathy for sybilla march which threw all her budding theories into turmoil again luncheon yielded nothing but platitudes afterwards charlotte spent an hour with emily ever on the brink of pressing her for answers and seeing her white face changing her mind instead she went to find william march who was still painting in the conservatory she knew perfectly well that she was interrupting him and he would hate it but there was no time to nurse her own sensibilities she found him in the studio that had been cleared for him beyond the lilies and vines he stood with the angular grace of someone who uses his body and is unaware of being observed there was nothing posed about him his elbows stuck out his head was to one side and his feet were apart yet his balance was perfect the top window was open and there was a whispering of wind in the leaves like water through pebbles on a shore he did not hear charlottes approach and she was almost beside him when she spoke ordinarily she would have felt a crassness that would chill her stomach to speak to him but after talking with sybilla she was even more conscious of the danger in which emily stood to any unbiased observer she must look guilty there was only her word that george had quarreled with sybilla whereas everyone had seen georges affairand had seen emily accept attention from jack radley if there was a reason anyone else in the family was involved she had not yet found it good afternoon mr march she said with forced cheerfulness she felt like a fool and a philistine he was startled and the brush jerked in his hand but she had chosen a moment when it was still far from the canvas he turned to look at her coldly his eyes were surprisingly dark gray and deepset under the red brows good afternoon mrs pitt are you lost it was plain to the point of rudeness he resented being disturbed and still more being placed where he was obliged to conduct a pointless conversation with a woman he did not know she lost any hope of fooling him no i came here on purpose because i wished to talk with you i realize i am preventing your work he was surprised he had expected some silly excuse he still held the brush in the air and his face was tight with concentration indeed she looked past him at the picture it was far cleverer than she had foreseen there was a shivering in the leavesan impression more than an outlineand just beyond the brightness of sunlight there was ice wind that cut the skin a sense of isolation and pain it was as much the tail end of winter with sudden frost that kills as it was a herald of spring and she felt it in the mind as well as the eye its very fine she said sincerely she thought it was far too good for someone who merely wanted a representation of his possessions and would be blind to the artists voice illuminating it like flame you should exhibit it before you hand it over it has the cruelties of nature as well as the loveliness he flinched as though she had hurt him thats what emily said his voice was quiet it was more a reflection to himself than a remark to her poor emily did you know george well she plunged straight in watching his eyes and the curious chiseled mouth but she saw no alteration but sadness no evasion no he said quietly he was a cousin so naturally i have met him from time to time but i cannot say i knew him he smiled very slightly we had few interests in common but that is not to say i disliked him on the contrary i found him very agreeable he was almost always goodnatured and harmless emily thought he was in love with mrs march she was franker than she might have been with someone else but he seemed too intelligent to dupe and too perceptive to misunderstand her he stared at the painting in love he turned the phrase over in his mind i suppose that is as good a term as anyit covers almost whatever you like it was an adventure something daring and different sybilla is never a boreshe has too much unknown in her he began to wipe the paint off his brush not looking at charlotte but he would have forgotten her after he left here emily is a clever woman she knew how to wait george was childish thats all charlotte had known george for seven years and what william march said was precisely true and he had seen it as clearly as she but someone killed him she persisted his hands stopped moving yes i know but i dont believe it was emily and it certainly wasnt sybilla he hesitated still watching the spreadout hairs of the brush i would consider jack radley if i were you emily is now a young and titled widow with a considerable fortune and a most attractive woman she has already shown him some favor and he might be vain enough to fancy it could increase that would be vile he looked up at her his eyes bright yes but vileness exists it seems we can think of nothing so appalling that someone somewhere hasnt thought of it tooand done it his mouth twitched and with difficulty he controlled it im sorry mrs pitt i beg your pardon i did not wish to offend you you havent mr march as i am sure you could not have forgotten my husband is a policeman he swung round letting the brush drop and stared at her as if part of him wanted to laugh at the joke on society you must have great courage were your family horrified she had been too much in love to take a great deal of notice of anyone elses feelings but that seemed a peculiarly insensitive thing to say now to this man whose wife had responded so fully and so publicly to george instead she told him the easiest lie they were so pleased with emily marrying lord ashworth they tolerated me really quite well but mention of george and emily only brought back the sharp contrast with emilys present loss im so sorry he said quietly and turned back to the cruel sensitive painting she was dismissed and this time she accepted it walking slowly back through the jungle of growth to the rest of the house in the afternoon they were visited by the pinkfaced curate he made an embarrassed and rather abrupt apology for the vicar who apparently was unable to come in person due to some emergency the nature of which was unclear indeed vespasia said with unconcealed skepticism how unfortunate the curate was a large young man of obvious west highland origin with the bluntness of youth and perhaps some judgment of his own he made no effort to embellish the excuse charlotte warmed to him immediately and was not surprised to observe that tassie also seemed to find him agreeable and when do we expect this crisis to pass mrs march inquired coldly when our reputation is restored and we are not the seat of scandal anymore tassie said instantly and blushed as soon as the words were out the curate took a deep breath bit his lip and colored as well anastasia mrs marchs voice cracked like a whip you will excuse yourself to your room if you cannot guard your tongue from uncharitableness let alone impertinence no doubt mr beamish has his reasons for not calling upon us to give us his comfort in person i expect mr hare will do rather better anyway vespasia murmured to no one in particular i find the vicar peculiarly tedious that is beside the point mrs march snapped it is not the vicars function to be amusing i always felt you did not understand religion vespasia you never knew how to behave in church you have had a tendency to laugh in the wrong places as long as i have known you that is because i have a sense of the absurd and you have not vespasia replied she turned to mungo hare balanced on the edge of one of the hardbacked withdrawing room chairs and trying to compose his face to display the appropriate mixture of piety and solicitude mr hare she continued please convey to mr beamish that we understand his reasons quite perfectly and that we are very satisfied that you should take his place tassie sneezed or that is what it sounded like mrs march made a clicking noise with her tongue excessively irritated that vespasia should have contrived to insult the vicar more effectively than she herself had how dare the wretched cowardly little man send a curate in his place to call upon the marches and charlotte remembered with renewed vividness why she had liked aunt vespasia from the day they had met mungo hare duly unburdened himself of the condolences and the spiritual encouragement he had been charged with then tassie accompanied him upstairs to repeat it all to emily who had chosen to spend the afternoon alone charlotte meant to go up later and see if she could tap emilys memory for some observation however minor which would betray a weakness a lie anything which could be pursued but as she was crossing the hall eustace emerged from the morning room straightening his jacket and coughing loudly thus making it impossible for her to pretend she had not seen him ah mrs pitt he said with affected surprise his round little eyes very wide i should like to talk with you perhaps the boudoir mrs march has gone to change for dinner and i know it is presently unoccupied he was behind her hands wide almost as if he would physically shepherd her in the direction he wished her to go short of being unexplainably rude she could not refuse charlotte found the room one of the ugliest she had ever seen it exemplified the worst taste of the last fifty years and she felt suffocated by everything it symbolized as much as by the sheer weight of the furniture the hot color and the wealth of ornaments and drapings it seemed to be expressive of a prudery that was vulgar in its very consciousness of the things it sought to coveran opulence that was lacking in any real richness it was difficult to keep the distaste from showing in her face for once eustace did not fling open the windows in his customary manner and it was the only time when she would willingly have done it for him he seemed too preoccupied with the burden of framing his thoughts mrs pitt i hope you find yourself as comfortable as may be in these tragic circumstances quite thank you mr march she was confused surely he had not brought her to this room to ask her in private such a trivial question good good he rubbed his hands together and remained looking at her of course you do not know us very well nor perhaps anyone like us no no you wouldnt we must seem alien to you i should explain so that we do not add confusion as well to your natural grief for your sister if i can help you at all in the least way my dear charlotte opened her mouth to say that she was no more confused than anyone else would be but he hurried on drowning her protest you must excuse lady cumminggould her eccentricities she was a great beauty once you know and so she was allowed to get away with being outrageous and im afraid she has never grown beyond it indeed i think with age she has become more soi know my dear mother finds her quite trying at times he rubbed his hands and smiled experimentally searching charlottes face to see how she responded to this information but we must all exercise forbearance he went on quickly sensing disapproval that is part of being a familyso important cornerstone of the country loyalty continuity one generation to the nextthats what civilization is all about marks us from the savages eh charlotte opened her mouth to argue that in her opinion savages had an excellent dynastic sense and were intensely conservative which was precisely why they remained savages instead of inventing and exploring things new but again eustace carried on regardless before she could begin and of course from your point of view poor sybilla must seem most cruel and illbehaved because you will naturally take emilys part but you know there was far more to it than that oh dear yes i am afraid it was george who pursued you knowquite definitely george and dear sybilla is so used to admiration she failed to discourage him appropriately it was illjudged of her of course i feel obliged to tell her so directly and george should have been far more discreet he shouldnt have done it at all charlotte interrupted hotly ah my dear eustaces face was lit with a smile of patience and condescension he wagged his head a little let us not be unrealistic one expects girls of tassies age to have romantic illusions and heaven forfend i should wound her susceptibilities at so tender a stage in her life when she is just on the brink of betrothal but a married woman of emilys years must come to terms with the nature of men a truly feminine woman has forgiveness in her nature for our foibles and weaknesses as indeed we men have for the frailties of women he smiled at her and for a moment his hand hovered warmly over hers and she was intensely aware of him charlotte was furious there was something about him that brought back in a rush every patronizing word she had ever heard she ached to wipe the complacence off his moon face you mean that if emily had lain with mr radley for example george would have forgiven her she asked sarcastically pulling her hand away she had succeeded eustace was genuinely shocked she had preempted a subject he would not have put words to himself the blood drained from his skin then rushed back in a tide of color really he spluttered i appreciate that you have had a grave shock and perhaps you are afraid for emily understandably but my dear mrs pitt there is no call for vulgarity i shall do you the favor of putting from my mind that i ever heard you so forget yourself as to make such a vile suggestion we shall agree never to refer to it again you strike at the very root of all that is fine and decent in life if women were to behave in that way why good god a man wouldnt know if his son were his own the home would be desecrated the very fabric of society would fall apart the idea does not bear thinking of charlotte found herself blushing although as much from anger as embarrassment perhaps she was being ridiculous and the movement of his hand really had been no more than sympathy i did not suggest it mr march she protested raising her chin and staring at him i merely meant that perhaps emily expected as high a standard from george as she was prepared to adhere to herself i see you are very inexperienced mrs pitt and somewhat romantic eustace shook his head knowingly but his expression eased out into a smile again women are quite different from men my dear quite different we have our corresponding virtues of intellect manliness and courage unconsciously he flexed the muscles of his arm a mans brain is a far more powerful thing than a womans his eyes roamed gently and with pleasure over her neck and bosom think what we have achieved for humanity in every way but if a woman does not have modesty patience and chastity a sweet disposition what is she indeed what is the whole world without the influence of our wives and mothers a sea of barbarism mrs pittthat is what it is he stared at her and she met his gaze unflinchingly was that what you wished to say to me mr march she asked ah no er he seemed thrown off balance and blinked rapidly he had lost the thread of his thought entirely and she gave him no assistance i merely wished to make sure that you were comfortable he said at last we must present a united face to the world you are one of us my dear through poor emily we must do what is best for the family it is not a time for selfishness i am sure you understand that oh absolutely mr march she agreed staring solemnly at him i shall not forget my family loyalties you may be assured he smiled with a gust of relief apparently forgetting that thomas pitt was her most immediate relative excellent of course you will not now i must leave you time to change for dinner and perhaps to visit poor emily i am sure you will be an enormous help to her ha after dinner the ladies withdrew from the dining room to be followed quite soon by the gentlemen conversation was stilted because emily had joined them for the first time since georges death and no one knew what to say to speak of the murder seemed needlessly cruel and yet to converse as if it had not happened deformed all other subjects into such artificiality as to be grotesque consequently charlotte rose at a little after nine and excused herself saying she wished to retire early and was sure they would understand emily went with her much to everyones relief charlotte imagined she could hear the sigh of exhaled breath as she closed the door behind them and people sank a little more easily into their chairs she woke in the night thinking she had heard emily moving about next door and she was anxious in case her sister was too distressed to sleep perhaps she should go to her she sat up and was about to reach for a shawl when she realized the noise was from a different direction more towards the stairs why should emily go downstairs at this time of night she slipped out of bed and without fumbling for slippers went to the door opened it and crept out and along to the main landing she had put her head round the corner before she saw what it was in the gaslight at the head of the stairs she froze as if the breath had been snatched from her and her skin doused in cold water tassie march was coming up the stairs her face calm and weary but with a serenity unlike anything charlotte had seen in her before the restlessness was gone all the tension released her hands were held out in front of her sleeves crumpled smears of blood on the cuffs and a dark stain near the hem of her skirt she reached the top of the stairs just as charlotte realized her own position and shrank back into the shadows tassie passed on tiptoe less than a yard away from her still with that unhurried smile leaving a heavy sickly and quite unmistakable odor behind her no one who had smelled fresh blood could ever forget it charlotte went back to her room shivering uncontrollably and was sick emily woke early the next morning it was the day of georges funeral she felt cold immediately and the white light on the ceiling was bleak without warmth or color in it she was filled with the kind of misery that is edged with anger and intolerable loneliness this would make it all final not of course that it was not final anyway george was dead there was no going back or recapturing anything of the past warmth except in memory but a funeral a burial made it certain in the mind took the immediacy out of it and relegated the man to the past she hunched up under the blankets but there was no comfort in it it was too early to get up and anyway she did not want to see other people they would be full of their own business making a show of it thinking what hat to wear how to behave how they looked and above all they would be watching her suspiciously most of them believed she had killed george deliberately crept into old mrs marchs room stolen her digitalis and slipped it into the coffeepot except one one of them would know she had notbecause that one had and that person was prepared to see her suspected perhaps chargedeven tried and she let her thoughts continue even though it was stupid selfinflicted pain and yet she went on visualizing the courtroom herself in drab prison dress hair screwed back face white and holloweyed the jury that could not look at her the odd women among the spectators whose eyes reflected pityperhaps who had suffered the same rejection or felt they had then the verdict and the judge with a face like stone reaching for the black cap there she stopped after that it was too frightening in her imagination she could smell rope and damp inky darkness it was not just a morbid thought it could be real with no warm bed no relieved awakening she sat up and threw off the bedclothes then reached for the bell it was a long flat five minutes before digby knocked and came in her hair a little hastily pinned up and her apron tied unevenly she looked nervous but determined good morning mlady would you like a cup of tea straightaway or shall i draw your bath draw the bath emily replied there was no need to discuss what she would wear it could only be the formal black barathea with black hat and black veil which she had sent for not a fashionable flattering veil that lent mystery but a widows weeds hiding the face disguising the ravages of grief digby disappeared and came back a few minutes later sleeves rolled up a tentative smile hovering uncertainly on her lips its a fine day mlady at least you wont get rained on emily really did not care but perhaps it was a minor blessing standing at a graveside with water trickling down her neck wetting her feet and making the edges of her skirts heavy and sodden would add a physical dimension to the bleakness that consumed her mind it might even have been welcome it was easier to think of frozen feet and wet ankles than of george lying white and rigid inside the closed coffin being lowered into the ground and covered up gone for the rest of her life he had been so warm so important always at the foundation of her thoughts for so many years even when he was not with her the sure knowledge that he would be there in a little while was a safety she had never considered losing suddenly the tears came catching her by surprise all the sniffing and swallowing did not control them she sat down again and covered her face with her hands quite unexpectedly she found digbys arms round her and her head resting against digbys stiff sloping shoulder digby said nothing she just gently rocked emily back and forth stroking her hair as if she were a very young child it was so natural emily felt no embarrassment and when the pain inside her eased and the relief of tiredness came over her she let go and went to her bath without the need to explain or reassert in any way that she was the mistress and digby the maid there were no questions or answers digby knew precisely what was needed and the silence was one of understanding she took breakfast alone with charlotte she did not wish to see anyone else except perhaps aunt vespasia but she did not appear she did not say so charlotte said quietly as they took a thin slice of toast each and spread them with butter then poured themselves cups of hot weak tea from the flowered pot but i think she is busy massing a sort of defense emily did not ask what she meant they both knew the ranks were closing against the police against intrusion and scandaland that meant against emily also if she were guilty it could all be over in a few days no more investigation they could grieve in decency for the appropriate time and resume their lives again charlotte smiled bleakly i dont think even mrs march will give her tongue full rein with aunt vespasia there i feel there is not much love lost between them i wish i could think it was mrs march who killed george emily said thoughtfully ive been trying to scrape up any kind of reason why she should did you succeed no nor i but there must be an enormous amount that we dont know charlottes face was dark and tense as if she was afraid emily i woke up in the night and i thought i heard you walking around im sorry no it wasnt you it was coming from the stairs so i got up to follow but when i got the landing i saw it was tassie she was coming up and she walked past me to her bedroom i saw her quite clearly emily her sleeves were smeared with blood and there were splashes down the front of her skirt and at the hem she was smiling there was a sort of peace about her her eyes were shining and wide open but she didnt even see me i kept back in the small passage to the dressing room and she walked so close i could have touched her she felt a little sick again as the smell came back nauseating and sweet emily was dazedthis was unbelievable she offered the only explanation she could conceive of you had a nightmare no i didnt charlotte insisted it was real her face was tight and miserable but she did not waver i thought i might have been dreaming with everything thats happened so i went down to the laundry room this morning and found the dress soaking in one of the coppers and was it covered in blood charlotte shook her head no more than an inch no it was washed out but then it would be shed hardly leave it like that for the maids to find would she but it doesnt make sense emily still protested whose blood why nobodys been murdered that wayshe swallowedthat we know of another hideous memory stirred in charlottes mind of parcels in a graveyard but she refused to allow it to take shape do you think she could be mad she said wretchedly it seemed the only explanation leftand one must be found for emilys sake i suppose so emily said reluctantly but im sure george didnt knowunless hed just found out which could be a reason for old mrs march to have killed him do you think so charlotte pursed her lips would george ever have told anyone yes if she were dangerouswhich she must be if it was human blood charlotte said nothing but she looked increasingly unhappy emily knew why she liked tassie also there was something in her that was immediately appealing frankness humor and generosity but she had seen her coming up the stairs with blood bright on her sleeves and staining her dress she shivered please god it mustnt be tassie it doesnt have to be her charlotte said quietly i suppose there could be some other explanation an animal an accident in the street we dont know anything i just find it too hard to believe tassie is anyway if the family knew theyd lock her up in an asylum for her own sake perhaps they didnt know how bad she was emily said quietly maybe she has suddenly got worse but there is still jack radley charlotte argued you cant forget him or sybilla and william has to be an obvious choice it could even be eustace i dont know why but maybe george found out something about him after all this is his house perhaps hes doing something very wrong or has a secret in his past that he couldnt afford to have known emily looked up such as what i dont know maybe an illegitimate childor a love affair with someone wildly inappropriate emilys fair eyebrows shot up eustace a love affair that taxes the imagination can you visualize eustace in love no charlotte admitted but i wasnt thinking of love so much as lust the most unlikely people can feel that even pompous and unctuous middleaged men like eustace and anyway it doesnt have to be recent it could have been something that happened years ago even when tassies mother was alive and there are other even worse possibilities people have the strangest obsessions you know maybe she found that out you mean something truly disgusting emily said slowly like a child or another man do you suppose olivia could have found out and he killed her oh charlotte let out her breath with a sigh actually i hadnt thought of anything quite like that rather a servant or a farm girl i heard of a highly respectable man who only liked big dirty scrubwomen thats rubbish emily scoffed taking another slice of thin toast and biting into it without any enjoyment no it isnt and one wouldnt want it known no one would believe it would they not to the point where it was worth murdering to keep them quiet maybe and certainly if he killed olivia it would be but unless he did kill oliviaand i dont believe thatgeorge wouldnt have told anyone he wouldnt want it known any more than eustace would after all eustace is family she swallowed the toast like a lump in her throat and george was rather conventional about things like that thats true charlotte said more gently but perhaps he didnt trust george not to tell his friends as a joke george did not always think before he spoke or he might even have brought pressure on him to stop he wouldnt maybe not but perhaps eustace could not be sure enough of it she shook her head but all im saying is that we dont know there could be all kinds of things emily sat still well wed better find at least one piece of evidence about some of them for constable stripeand soon i know charlotte bit her lip im trying the service was to be held in the local church which had also been the last resting place of the ashworths since the family had acquired its first town house in the parish nearly two hundred years ago naturally emily had informed her own household that had been the most difficult of all the letters to write and the only one with which charlotte could not help her how does one say to a fiveyearold son that his father has been murdered she knew he could not read her letter now it would be his nanny large comfortable mrs stevenson who would try to explain to him help him to understand death and allow his mind to grasp it slowly through the confusion of great and terrible emotions round him emily knew too that the gentle woman would try to comfort him so he did not feel betrayed because his father had left him so soon nor guilty that in some indefinable way it was his fault emilys letter would be for later on when he was older something he would keep and reread in quieter moments he would find by the time he was a young man that he knew it by heart so she had written it only once letting her own loss and wholehearted grief come through inelegance of style would matter little insincerity would clang like a false note with louder and harsher echoes through the years today of course edward would be there small cold and frightened but performing the rites expected of him he was now lord ashworth he must sit in the church upright and wellbehaved and follow his fathers coffin to its grave and mourn as was seemly edward would come from home with mrs stevenson and afterwards return with her charlotte and emily would return to cardington crescent the peculiar circumstances of murder made that necessary they rode with aunt vespasia and eustace in the family carriage for this occasion draped in black and pulled by black horses the hearse of course was provided by the undertaker and was draped and plumed as always mrs march and tassie came next in the secondbest barouche both charlotte and emily stared at tassie but she wore a veil and beneath it her expression was invisible it could have been one of sorrow and awe as everyone presumed or it could equally easily have been remnants of the strange happiness charlotte had seen in her on the stairsor complete forgetfulness of it and whatever ghastly episode had preceded it one could not even guess there was some argument as to where jack radley should ride in the end with great unease mrs march took him with her and william and sybilla went in their own vehicle they alighted at the lychgate one by one and walked up the narrow earth and gravel path towards the old smokedarkened stonetowered church the gravestones on either side were worn and greenrimed with age inscriptions long since softened into blurred edges till one had to peer to distinguish them far towards the yew hedges and the long grass there were white ones like new teeth here and there a bunch of flowers laid by someone who still cared charlotte took emilys arm and walked close to her she could feel her shaking and she seemed thinner smaller than she had thought she could not forget for a moment that she was the elder sister this was oddly like sarahs funeralonly the two of them leftbut emily was far less vulnerable then then there had been boundless optimism under the sorrow a sureness of herself that lay like a wide certainty underneath the surface grief and fear and was strong enough to outlast it this was different emily had not only lost george the first man she had loved and committed herself to but she had lost the confidence in her own judgment even her courage was a barer thing not instinctive but fought fora brokennailed desperate clinging charlottes fingers tightened and emily reached for her hand mr beamish the vicar was waiting at the door a thin fixed smile on his face his cheeks were red and his white hair fluffed as if he had run his hands through it nervously now as he recognized emily he stepped forward extended his arm and then hesitated and dropped it again he murmured something indistinguishable that fell away in a downward cadence to charlotte it sounded like a bad psalm behind him his maiden sister shook her head fractionally and gave a little sniff she touched her handkerchief delicately to her cheek they were embarrassed rumor supposition had reached them they did not know whether to treat emily as a bereaved aristocrat to whom it was their social and religious duty to extend every pity or a murderess a scarlet woman a creature they should shun as a good christian example and before they themselves were contaminated by her double sin charlotte returned their stare without smiling part of her knew a moments empathy for their predicament but a much larger part despised them she was aware it showed in her expression her feelings always did inside the church mrs stevenson somber and gentle was holding edward by the hand his face was pale and looked so like emilys it was painful he let go of mrs stevensons hand and came to her awkwardly at first conscious of a new gravity then as she put her arms round him he relaxed and sniffed fiercely before straightening up again and walking beside her mungo hare was standing in the aisle beside the march family pew at the front he was a large man with a fair open face and blunt features he held his head up and his eyes looked at emily squarely are you all right lady ashworth he said quietly ive put a glass of water on the ledge there if you need it itll not be a long service thank you mr hare emily said absently that is most thoughtful of you she slid into the pew with edward leaving charlotte to follow her then aunt vespasia and eustace she could hear mrs march clattering irritably in the pew behind and banging the hymnbook she resented not being at the front and she intended to make her displeasure known tassie sat beside her head down hands folded in her lap it was incredible to think of her as she had been last night calm bloodsmeared tiptoeing along the landing the curate passed beside her and spoke to the old lady good morning mistress march if i can be of any service to you or offer you any comfort i doubt it young man she said tersely except to keep my granddaughter sufficiently occupied in good works that she doesnt run off and marry unsuitably and end up getting murdered for her money that would be rather pointless tassie murmured you wouldnt leave me any if i did that if anyone murdered you it would be for your tongue the old lady snapped at her kindly remember you are in church and dont be flippant good morning miss march the curate bowed his head good morning mr hare tassie said demurely thank you for your concern i expect grandmama would be grateful if you called upon her id rather have mr beamish the old lady interrupted hes a good deal nearer to death than you are he understands bereavement loss seeing ones own blood caught up in unholy passions to fall victim to its rages and pay its price the curate gasped and turned it into a sneeze indeed vespasia said from the row in front without turning her head if that is so then you know a great deal about beamish that i do not tassie was making a curious little gurgling noise into her handkerchief and the curate moved on to speak to william and sybilla charlotte dared not twist around to observe the service was somber and intoned in the curious singsong voice of formalized grief at moments though there was something vaguely comforting about it perhaps no more than an expression of darker emotions that had been suppressed till now this was an acknowledgment of what was unspeakable in the house here was death and its physical corruption given name instead of closed into the mind and forbidden the tongue but always waiting just beyond behind the spoken word even the organ notes shivered through the ear and held an eternal quality so that one could hear them long into the next note they seemed to come from the whole fabric of the church and the away into it again the stonework and the jewel windows and the pipes were all one with the sound emily stood straight and silent and under her veil it was impossible to see her face charlotte could only guess her feelings between them edward was stiff and upright but he pressed very close to emily and his free hand was clenched hard the last organ notes faded into the high arches of stone and they turned slowly to face the worst six men in black all expression wiped from their faces lifted the coffin and walked in step carrying it sedately out into the hard sunlight two by two the congregation followed led by emily and edward the grave was a neatedged hole in the damp earth the ashworths had never cared for a family crypt or mausoleum preferring to spend their money on the living but of course there would be a marble headstone perhaps carved and gilded in time now all that seemed irrelevant even vulgar beamish still pinkfaced his thick white hair ruffled by the wind till it looked like a pie frill round his head was beginning to recite the familiar words he was happy with these because they gave him no option no room to have to invent his own but still he avoided emily he glanced once at aunt vespasia and tried to smile but she looked so drained and frail it died on his lips he continued waveringly his mind fogged with dawning suspicion charlotte looked round at the faces one of them here had killed george had it been a moment of passion perhaps now turned to terror or remorse or did whoever it was feel justified perhaps released from some danger or was the murderer grasping at a reward the most obvious suspect was jack radley could he have imagined emily would what marry him surely that was the only answer if he were capable of thinking she would accept him at all then merely to be her lover would hardly merit killing george if emily were a widow she would almost certainly be a rich one and at thirty with a young child a very vulnerable one charlotte had also worn a light veil partly for decorum but more to give her the opportunity to watch people without their being aware of it now she looked across the grass and the turned earth with its open hole at jack radley on the far side he was standing with his hands folded very sober his face suitably grave but his suit was fashionably cut his tie elegant and she imagined she could see the shadow of his eyelashes on his cheek as he lowered his gaze had he the monumental vanity to think he could kill george and then take his place had envy given way to temptation and then a slowforming plan and had at last opportunity turned it into act she saw nothing on his face he could have been a choirboy standing there but then if he were guilty of such a plan he was without conscience and she should not expect to find any reflection of guilt in his face eustaces features were composed in pious rectitude and showed nothing but his sense of the occasion and his own part in it whatever else was in him there was no guilt and absolutely no fear if he had committed murder it was without remorse what could possibly even to his mind justify that that left the last and the other most obvious suspects william and sybilla they stood side by side and yet in only the barest and most literal sense were they together william looked straight ahead of him over the grave past eustace and the figure of beamish to the yew trees perpetual guardians of death skirting the burial yard from the living city sheltering darkness in their needle leaves and dense heavy wood nothing grew under them and their fruit was poison such knowledge could have been passing behind williams silvergray eyes as he stood listening there was pain in his mouth and the flesh of his cheeks was pinched charlotte felt pain watching him as though his fair skin were a layer thinner than other peoples and the wounds of nature reached the nerves beneath more readily perhaps that was necessary to paint the shadows and the sweeping light in the sky as he did all the skill in the world cannot interpret what has not first been felt had that delicate creative hand also stolen the digitalis and emptied it into the coffeepot for george to drinkand die why the answer was glaring because george had wooed sybilla and won her automatically charlottes gaze moved to sybilla herself she was a beautiful woman and dressed in reliefless black she looked better than anyone else here the white skin of her neck was perfect almost luminous as pearl her jaw slender her upper face was masked by her veil and charlotte had been watching her for several minutes trying to read something into it when she noticed the tears bright on her skin and the faint lines of strain the tight muscles in her throat she glanced downwards the blackgloved hands were clenched and the lace was ripped off the handkerchief even as she looked the fingers unknotted picking at the cambric tearing fragments of the cotton off and letting them fall little snowflakes of broken lace grief or guilt for having seduced another womans husband or for having murdered him when he tired of her suddenly charlotte felt a cold grip clutch at her deep in the pit of her stomach was sybillas guilt the belief that she had driven emily to murder how much had george loved her there was only emilys word about the reconciliation what had really happened that evening in her bedroom when george had come in was emily now remembering the truth or only what her pride and her pain told her to remember no that was nonsense treacherous weak get rid of the thought refuse to have it but how do you refuse to have a thought the more you try to reject it the stronger its hold on you the more it consumes your mind aunt vespasia but vespasia was unaware of her her mind and heart were absorbed in a bright width of memory nursery days and youth old confidences and small pleasures shared foolish hopes unfettered dreamsall crumpled now into one hard cold box so close she might have stretched out her thin hand and touched it then the coffin was lowered into the ground and beamish scattered something on the lid where it lay a little crooked deep in the hole it looked illfitting what did it matter george would not care all of him that was real had gone gone somewhere bright and warm leaving the fears of earth behind emily bent and picked up a handful of pebbles and threw them in with a clatter she started to say something but her voice failed charlotte took her arm and they turned away keeping edward between them they rode home in silence emily had said goodbye to edward and left him with mrs stevenson to go back to his own home his nursery safe and familiar in her mind she was already alone she had not killed george someone else had crept into the pantry and slipped the digitalis into the coffeepot but why it was the last act at the end of a long succession of events and emotions perhaps many people had contributed each a word a small addition but was it emily herself who had given the major part it would be nice to think that george knew some secret that was worth killing to keep it would drive out the dark thoughts that intruded more and more there were three real suspects william sybilla and jack radley and all of them had the same reasongeorges infatuation with sybilla emily had to be part of it if she had been warm enough interesting enough generous tactful gay witty then george would never have felt more than a passing attraction to sybilla nothing that mattered nothing that hurt emily or william and nothing that sybilla would be desperate over losing was she had she been so much in love with george aunt vespasia had said sybilla had had many admirers and william had never before shown jealousy she was discreet and however far it had gone it was her secret and even with george there had been nothing that anyone could be sure was more than they saw in the open she had accepted his admiration even encouraged it but had she actually taken him into her bed the thought hurt deeply it was a betrayal of all her own most intimate and precious moments but to try and skirt round it was idiotic emily did not know the answer and there was no reason to imagine that william did no it was far more likely to be a game for sybilla a compliment to her vanity and perhaps a ripple of danger made it more fun if william were suddenly jealous then the one thing he would guard would be his vanity he had remained complacent all these years he would not now make a spectacle a laughingstock of himself by attacking george there might be sympathy for the cuckolded husband but there was also laughter a pity profoundly scarred with cruelty relief that it was someone else there were ribald jokes slurs against manhoodand that was the ultimate insult the unbearable thing that robbed the stuff of life but denied the peace of death the victim was still sentient and raw to all the awareness of his loss he would never have brought that upon himself nevernot in hot temper nor in cold revenge no she did not believe william had killed george it would only bring upon him the very thing every man found intolerable sybilla george was charming fun generous but only if she were totally hysterical would she fall so in love with a man she could not marry that a quarrel would turn her into a murderess she had had other affairs they must all have ended one way or another surely she knew how to conclude it gracefully how to sense the coming of the break see the signs and be the first to cool she was not eighteen and far from inexperienced could this affair really have been so radically different why should it emily could think of no reason that left jack radley and the answer to that was the ugly thought she had been trying to avoid all the time she had encouraged him and she had enjoyed it in spite of the misery inside her the pain over george she had liked jack enjoyed flirting with him and had felt justified justified perhapsas far as george was concerned sauce for the goose was sauce for the gander but what about jack himself to begin with she had hardly bothered to look at him as a person but simply as an opportunity he was extraordinarily charming with outward warmth and virility she had heard that he had very little money but she had been uninterested it made no difference to her but did it if she had bothered to look more closely would she have seen a man in his midthirties of good birth but with no money and no prospects other than those he could make for himself with his wits might she have seen a weak man grown accustomed to a very gracious style of living envious of his financial betters and suddenly tempted by a pretty woman a woman publicly ignored by her husband vulnerable because she understood the conventions with her mind but not her heart just how far had she encouraged him could she possibly have led him to imagine she would marry him if she were free to surely he realized her attention was merely a ruse to win george back even less than thata byproduct of her being charming rather than create a scene which could only drive george further away perhaps not perhaps jack radley was even farther from families like the ashworths or the marches than she wasperhaps financial restriction and mounting ambition had eroded all other feelings she had judged him the sort of man too vain too fond of his own pleasures and far too aware of his own interests to fall in love physical attraction was a different matter but not to be taken seriously never to be allowed to jeopardize the things of lasting importance like means and status even the middle classes understood the necessities one did not throw away everything on a whim certainly a man who had survived to thirtyfive on his charm and wit knew a great deal better than to give in to romanticism or appetite or did he people did fall in love some of the least likely were vulnerable had she really been so utterly delightful that he had thrown all sense to the windsand in a fit of passion murdered george no it would be a calculated greed and he had chosen his moment so impetuously because somehow he also had heard the row between george and sybilla and known that his opportunity was slipping away another day and it could be gone the carriage was passing in the dappled sunlight through an avenue of birch trees and the wind in the leaves sounded like the rustle of skirts black bombazine on the graveyard walk the clink of jet beads round fat necks she shivered it was cold inside the white silk handkerchief in her hand reminded her of lilies and death was she at heart responsible she had not wished it but neither had she cared the moral guilt would remain whatever the police discovered and the social stigma too the fact that she had done no more than be attentive would be forgotten society would remember her as the woman whose lover had murdered her husband and the money she had already received a quick note from the lawyer a condolence merely but she knew there was a great deal of money some of it was in trust for edward but she herself would still have a very considerable amountenough to keep jack radley in very fine style indeed and of course she would have the houses the thought was frightening a cold clammy sickness gripped like a hand at her stomach if he had murdered george then she must share the responsibility if he was discovered she would be a social outcast at bestat worst she would be hanged with him if he were not discovered the suspicion would remain over her forever she would spend the rest of her life with other people wondering and whispering about her and she might be the only other person who would know without the worm of doubt that she was innocentand he was guilty could he afford to let her live with the danger she might one day somehow prove it was he she would have to try for her own honor surely she would one day also have an accident or maybe even commit suicide the draft through the carriage window brought out goose pimples on her skin luncheon was a chill formal affair as a funeral meal should be emily bore it with as much dignity as she could but afterwards she excused herself and went not to her bedroom where charlotte or vespasia could find her but beyond she wanted time to think without interruption and she did not want anyone pressing her with questions anywhere in the main house there was the risk of running into one of the others forcing her either to make some obvious excuse to leave or else to find conversation knowing what they were thinking of her and going through the charade of forced politeness she went up the stairs and then up the second narrower flight to what had been the childrens floor a generation ago where their games and their crying would not disturb the rest of the house she passed their bedroomsclosed off nowthe nurserymaids room the night nurseryempty except for two sheetcovered cribs and a chest of drawers painted pink and whiteand at the very end of the corridor came at last into the big main day nursery it was like a world apart trapped in amber a decade ago when tassie the last child had left it the curtains were wide and sunlight caught the walls with gold showing the faded patches and the rime of dust on the tops of the pictures little girls in crisp pinafores and a boy in a sailor suit it must have been william face softer in childhood bones not yet formed mouth hesitant in a half smile in the sepia tint without the red of his hair he looked oddly different in his young face there was something sharply reminiscent of the picture she had seen of olivia the little girls were different but all but one had eustaces round face round eyebrows and confident stare the exception was tassie thinner more candid more like william except for her mouth and the bow in her hair there was a dappled rocking horse by the window its bridle broken saddle worn a frilled ottoman in patched pink was covered with a row of dolls all sitting to attention obviously tidied by the unloving hand of a maid a box of tin soldiers was closed neatly and piled next to colored bricks a dollhouse with a front that opened up two music boxes and a kaleidoscope she sat down on the big nursery chair and caught sight of her own black skirt spread across the pink she hated black in the sunlight it looked dusty and old as if she were wearing something that had died she would be expected to keep to it for at least a year ridiculous george would not have wanted it he liked gay colors soft colors especially pale greens he had always loved her in pale greens like shaded rivers or young leaves in spring stop it it was an unnecessary hurt to keep on thinking of george turning it over and over it was too soon perhaps in a year she would be able to remember only the good things she would be used to being alone by then and the rough edges would have worn off the wound the healing would begin the room was warm and full of light and the chair was very comfortable she closed her eyes and leaned back her face to the sun it was totally silent up here the rest of the house need not have existed she could be anywhere their quarreling and spite the whispers the fear and the malice a hundred miles away in another city there were the smells of dust and old toys the cotton of dolls dresses the wood of the horse the sharp bitter smell of lead and tin boxes and toy soldiers it was all vaguely pleasing perhaps because it was different half a memory from a simpler infinitely safer time of her own life she was half asleep when the voice broke in quite quietly but so startling that she felt as if she had been struck couldnt you bear us anymore i dont blame you no one knows what to say but they go on saying it anyway and the old woman is like something out of a greek play i came up here to find you because i was afraid you werent well her eyes flew open and she stared up squinting in the sun jack radley was standing gracefully leaning a little against the doorway he had changed out of his funereal black and was in a pleasant brown she could think of nothing at all to answer him the words froze in her brain he moved forward and sat on a nursery stool at her feet the sun made a halo out of the edge of his hair and cast the shadow of his eyelashes on his cheek it all reminded her of the conservatory and her conscience wrenched at her again george had been alive then she found an answer at last im not in the mood for conversation i dont feel like forcing myself to be polite anymore with everyone tryingvery clumsilynot to mention murder while at the same time making it perfectly clear they think it was me then i shall avoid the subject he replied without a qualm looking at her with exactly the same warm candor she had seen in him that night he had kissed her so intimately it brought back very precisely the taste of his mouth the smell of his skin and the thick soft texture of his hair under her fingers her guilt was overwhelming dont be ridiculous she snapped with unreasonable fury normally she could have exchanged harmless banter indefinitely but the knack had abandoned her she did not want to talk to jack radley at all about anything she could not get out of her mind the thoughts she feared he might have with regard to her the idea that she could have been so attracted to him that when george was dead she would be prepared to think of marrying anyone elselet alone a man who might have murdered him im sorry he said quietly i know its impossible not to think i suppose you cant even put it out of thought for half an hour she looked at him reluctantly he was smiling and looked so agreeable and innocent here amid these childish things she felt bizarre thinking of murder and yet the knowledge would not be banished it was true someone had murdered george she had not done it she found it hard to think it was sybillashe had nothing to gain and so much to loseand impossible to think it was william she would love to think it was old mrs march but she could rake up no possible reason and of course there was the abominable picture of tassie creeping up the stairs in the night tired and smelling of blood could she have killed george in a fit of madness but even madness has some reason or even at a very wild extreme eustace to hide tassies affliction perhaps she had done something else dreadful before could it be to conceal that but that did not make sense if eustace knew tassie was mad he would hardly seek to marry her to anyone he would have her locked away for all their sakes surely it had to be jack radley sitting here two feet away from her the sun shining on his hair his shirt dazzling white she could smell the clean cotton just as she could smell the dust and the suns heat on the chair and the tin soldiers she avoided his eyes afraid he would see the fear in her own if he did see her thoughts and understand them how would he feel hurt because he cared what she thought of him because it was unjust and he had hoped for better angry because she misjudged him or because his plans were failing how angry angry enough to strike out at her or worse far worse fearful that she would betray him become a danger to his safety now she dared not look up what if he saw all that in her eyes if he had killed george then he would now have to kill her too but he would be caught not if he made it look like suicide the marches would be only too glad to accept it and dismiss the whole matter and send the police away and thomas would have to go to accept the obvious the family would not question it or make an issuefar from it they would be grateful charlotte would never believe it of course but who would take any notice of her there would be nothing she could do and even if she could it would hardly help emily she was sitting in the nursery in the silence and the sun it was so bright it dazzled her she felt a little dizzy and the chair was suddenly very hard under her it seemed to be tilting this was ridiculous she must not faint she was alone here with him out of hearing of everyone if he killed her here it could be days before anyone found herweeks not till a maid came again to do a little perfunctory dusting they would think she had run awayadmitting her guilt emily are you all right his voice sounded anxious she felt his hand warm on her arm very strong tight she wanted to pull away violently a sweat of terror broke out on her skin wetting the black cloth of her dress and trickling cold down her back if she tore away from him he would know she was afraid and he would know why she would not be able to get up and run away before he could catch her it was possible she would reach the door behind him and race along the passage to the steep stairs it would be so easy to push her a headlong fall she could already see her own crumpled body at the foot hear his voice with the explanation so simple so sorry another tragic accidentshe was beside herself with grief and guilt there was only one way pretend innocence convince him she had no suspicions no ideas no fear of him she swallowed hard and gritted her teeth she forced herself to look up at him meet his eyes without flinching speak without biting her tongue or fumbling yesyes thank you i just felt dizzy for a moment its warmer in here than i expected ill open the window he stood up as he said it reaching for the catch and lifted the heavy sash that was it a fall out of the window they were three stories up she would hit the hard walk outside once and that would be the end who would hear her if she screamed no one up here that was precisely why it was the nursery so the cries of the children should not disturb anyone but if she stayed seated he would find her hard to pick up a deadweight it was a little a very little but there was nothing she could do but take it a step at a time searching for the next one yes yes perhaps that would help she agreed he turned round facing her silhouetted against the sun and the blue dazzle of the leaves and the sky through the window he walked over and leaned forward a little taking her hand he was warm and she felt with a shudder how strong she could not possibly get out of the chair now he was standing almost above her imprisoning her emily he looked at her facein fact he was staring emily are you afraid of them she was so frightened her body ached and the sweat ran down her back and between her breasts afraid she feigned innocence trying to look as though she were not sure what he meant dont pretend with me he was still holding her hand eustace and that fearful old woman are hellbent on having you blamed for murder but thats only so they can get the matter hushed up and the police out of the house surely pitt knows that isnt he your brotherinlaw and i have the opinion that your sister will not let any accusations against you go by without doing her best to tear them to bits let the pieces fall where they may did he have any idea what she was thinking could he smell her fear surely he would know it was immediate and physical nothing so remote as the marches suspicions it was an obvious compelling step from that to the knowledge that she thought he had killed george and why i find it very uncomfortable she said with a dry little swallow her face hot of course it isnt pleasant to have people even someone like mrs march imagine such a thing of you but i know its because shes afraid for her own her own he sounded surprised but she did not look at him i think it would be better if i did not discuss it she said quietly but there are certain things in the family who tassie there was disbelief in his voice now really mr radley i would very much rather not talk about it i dont suppose it was anything to do with her but mrs march may be very anxious she made her move at last praying he would step back and allow her to stand she was weak with relief when he did but you think it was tassie he pressed on but she refused to look at him carefully breath tight in her throat she moved past him towards the door noprobably because i dont want to i dont want to think it of anyone but i cannot avoid it she was in the night nursery now and he was close behind her there was as good a reason for william to have done it as for me it was a miserable thing to say but all she could think of was escaping reaching the stairs and getting down them to the main landing where there would be people of course he was still beside her very close ready to catch her if she felt faint again if he cared i never saw any sign that he did and george was certainly not the first man to be besotted with sybilla you know i can imagine but that doesnt mean he didnt mind she was walking rapidly now too rapidly the thought of safety only yards away was too sweet relief welled up inside her tightening her throat she must just get down the stairs ahead of him where he could not push or trip her she wanted to run to make sure of it now then with almost unbearable horror she felt his hand close over her elbow she wanted to wrench away call out scream but there might be no one else even beyond that flight of steps then she would have betrayed her fear and be left alone with him she froze emily he said urgently be careful was it a threat at last she looked at him almost involuntarily but she had to know be careful of william he said earnestly if it was william and he realizes you know he might hurt youeven if only by trying to incriminate you somehow i will in fact i shall try not to discuss it if i can he laughed without pleasure i mean it emily thank you she gulped and all but choked they were at the top of the stairs she could not stay here he would know she expected him to push herand that knowledge would be enough to bring it about he could not dare let her live and he would never have a better chance than this a simple slip of the foot and she would pitch down breaking her back or her neck her feet were already on the second step she forced herself shaking knees weakthe third the fourth he was behind her it was too narrow to come beside the seventh step the eighthshe tried not to hurry with every second she was nearer at last she was at the bottomsafe for now she took an enormous breath scuffed her shoes with the clumsiness of relief and hurried across the landing towards the main stairs pitt attended the funeral but at such a discreet distance that he was sure none of the family saw him afterwards he followed them back to cardington crescent and this time entered through the kitchen taking stripe with him they had gone over and over the meager evidence pursued the few threads of conversations overheard impressions formed hoping to surprise an unguarded revelation but nothing had stayed in his mind sharper than the rest nothing led him more clearly through the maze he left stripe to question the servants one more time on the chance that in repetition a fragment would be remembered that some flash of new recollection would rise to the surface of the mind he wanted to see charlotte no absorption in this case the bloomsbury one or any other could drown out the loneliness in the evenings when he returned home often close to midnight and found only the nightlight burning in the hall the kitchen empty and tidy everything put away but for the supper gracie had carefully prepared and left on the table for him every night he ate silently by the remains of the fire in the stove then he took his boots off and tiptoed up the stairs looking in first at the small motionless forms of jemima and daniel in the nursery before going on to his own bed he was tired enough to sleep within a few minutes but he woke in the morning aware of an incompleteness and sometimes he was actually physically cold in the mornings gracie reported to him the events of the previous day that she considered important but it was a shy bare accountnothing like charlottes full of opinion detail and drama he used to think her incessant talking through breakfast an intrusion one of the penalties men invariably pay for marriage but without it he found himself unable to concentrate on the newspaper and taking little pleasure in it now he inquired of the footman where she was and was shown into the overcrowded boudoir close as a hothouse and requested to wait it was less than five minutes before charlotte came in and pushing the door closed sharply behind her threw her arms round him and clung to him fiercely she made no sound but he could feel that she was weeping a tired slow letting go of tears presently he kissed herher hair her brow her cheekthen he passed her his only decent handkerchief waiting while she blew her nose savagely twice how are the children she asked swallowing and looking up at him has daniel cut that tooth yet i thought he was getting a bit feverish hes perfectly all right he assured her youve only been gone a couple of days but she was not satisfied what about the tooth are you sure he isnt feverish yes im quite sure gracie says hes fine and eating all his meals he wont eat cabbage she knows that may i have my handkerchief back its the only one ive got ill get you one ofof georges why havent you got any handkerchiefs isnt gracie doing the laundry of course she is i just forgot she should put it in your pocket for you are you all right thomas yes thank you im glad but her voice was doubtful she sniffed and then changed her mind and blew her nose again i suppose you dont know anything about george yet i dont the more i watch the less i seem to see he put his hand on her shoulder gently feeling her warm beneath his touch we will he said with more conviction than he had any grounds for its too soon yet how is emily feeling ill and frightened ii think she found letting edward go back with mrs stevenson the hardest thing hes so awfully younghe doesnt understand but he will soon hell lets solve todays problems first he interrupted well help with edward after yes of course she swallowed again and unconsciously rubbed her hands over her skirt we must know more about the marches it was one of them or or jack radley why do you hesitate before you mention him she looked down avoiding his eyes i suppose she stopped are you afraid emily encouraged him he asked hating to say it but if he did not it would still hang between them they knew each other too well to lie even by silence no but she knew he did not believe her it was the answer of loyalty not conviction i dont know she added trying to find something closer to the truth i dont think she meant to she took a deep breath how are you getting on with the bloomsbury case you must be busy with that as well im not he felt a heaviness as he said it he had no hope of solving that and no solution would show anything more than a common tragedy he was incapable of preventing again it was only the grotesqueness of the corpse that marked it in the public mind she was looking at him puzzlement gave way to understanding isnt there anything cant you even find out who she was not yet but were still trying she could have come from anywhere in a dozen directions if she was a parlormaid dismissed for immoral conduct or even because the master of the house made advances to her and the mistress found out then she could have taken to the streets to earn a living and been killed by a customer a pimp a thiefanyone poor woman charlotte said softly then its hopeless probably but well keep on a little longer she stared at him fiercely but this isnt hopeless here whoever killed george is one of us in this house right now its jack radley or one of the marches she frowned fighting with herself for a moment and then coming to some decision thomas i have something veryvery ugly to tell you and without stopping to watch his face or allow interruption she recounted exactly what she had seen at the head of the stairs in the middle of the night he was confused had she been dreaming she had certainly had enough cause for nightmare in the last few days even if she had been awake and really gone to the landing might not the abrupt arousal from sleep the flickering of the dim gas nightlight have misled her vision caused her to imagine blood where there were only shadows now she was staring at him waiting looking in his face for an answering horror he tried to mask doubt with amazement nobodys been stabbed he said aloud i know that now she was angry because she was frightened and she knew he disbelieved her but why does anyone creep up the stairs in the small hours reeking of blood if it was innocent why has nothing been said she was perfectly normal this morning and she wasnt distressed thomas i swear she was happy say nothing he warned we wont learn anything by attacking openly if you are right then there is something very evil indeed in this housein this family for gods sake charlotte be careful he took her by the shoulders perhaps emilyd better go home and you go with her no she resisted him pulling away her head coming up if we dont find out who it is and prove it emily could be hanged or at best have the doubt stain her all her life have people remember and whisper to each other that she might have killed her husband and even if that were bearable for emily its not for edward ill find out without you he began grimly but her face was tight and her eyes hot maybe but i can watch and listen in a way you never can not in this house emily is my sister and im going to stay it would be wrong to run away and you wouldnt argue with me about that and you wouldnt run he weighed it for a moment what would happen if he tried to order her home she would not go her loyalty to emily at this moment was greater rightly so all his emotion strained backwards wanting demanding that she run from the danger his reason knew it was cowardice fear for his own pain should anything happen to her but if he failed to solve this crime if emily were hanged then he would have lost all in his relationship with charlotte that gave it fire and value all right he said at last but for the love of heaven be careful someone in this house is murderousmaybe more than one i know she said very quietly i know thomas later in the afternoon eustace sent for pitt to come to him in the morning room he was standing hands in his pockets in front of the unlit fireplace still in the clothes he had worn at the funeral well mr pitt he began as soon as the door was closed how are you proceeding have you learned anything of value pitt was unprepared to commit himself least of all to say anything about charlottes story of tassie on the stairs a great deal he replied levelly but i am not yet sure as to its value no arrest eustace persisted his face brightening and his broad shoulders relaxing making the wellcut jacket sit more evenly without the tensions in the weave you dont surprise me domestic tragedy told you so in the first place i daresay a nursing home can be found there will be no shortage of means and she can be made very comfortable best for all of us nothing proved not possible no blame attached to you my dear fellow invidious position for you so he was already preparing to have the case closed and all investigation effectively prevented it would be so easy for the marches to protect themselves by blaming emily they had barely waited till the body was in the ground before beginning with a small lie here or there a very discreet conspiracy for the sake of them all they might even convince themselvesall but onethat it really had been emily who murdered george in a fit of jealousy and that one would be the keenest of all whether they betrayed it or not to have emily disposed of quietly and the guilt forever apportioned the case closed worse than that was the wisp of suspicion nagging at the back of his mind that it was not impossible that it had been emily he would not say so to charlotte and he felt a sting of guilt for the thought but no one else had mentioned the supposed reconciliation and without that she had one of the oldest and best motives in the human condition that of the woman ridiculed and then betrayed she had been witness to so much of the aftermath of murder through charlotte and himself perhaps the idea was closer in the shadows of her thought than they knew most unfortunate eustace repeated with increasing satisfaction no doubt you did all you could the unctuousness of it the assumption of his blindness his willingness to comply was insulting i have barely begun pitt said harshly i shall discover a great deal more in fact i shall not rest until i have proof as to who murdered george for heavens sake why eustace protested eyes wide at such nonsensical behavior you can only cause needless pain to your own wife not least have a little compassion man a little sensitivity i dont know that it was emily pitt glared at him feeling angry and helpless and wishing he could beat that appalling certainty out of eustace he was standing there squarely in front of the dead fireplace with all his comfortable possessions round him disposing of emilys life as if she were a household pet that had become troublesome theres no proof he said loudly then you cant expect to find it can you eustace was eminently reasonable his eyes wide dont blame yourself i daresay you are perfectly efficient but you cannot work miracles let us deal with it without scandalfor emilys sake and for the childs his name is edward pitt was furious and he could feel himself losing the control which was the core of any intelligent pursuit of truth but he scrambled after it in vain his voice rising why do you believe it was emily have you some evidence youve not given me my dear chap eustace rocked back and forth gently hands still in his pockets george was having an affair with sybilla emily knew it and could not control her jealousy surely you realize that that is an excellent motive pitt lowered his voice with an effort for emily and for mr william march i can see no difference unless you believe emilys story that she and george were reconciled in which case the motive is stronger for mr march eustace smiled broadly his composure quite undisturbed not at all my dear fellow first of all i for one do not believe the story of a reconciliation wishful thinking or very natural fear but even so the position for emily is quite different from that for william emily wanted georgeindeed needed him he nodded once or twice if a husband has affairs a woman has no choice but to accept it as best she may a wise woman will pretend not to knowthat way she does not have to do anything at all her home and her family are not jeopardized by a little foolishness without her husband she has nothing where would she go what would she do he shrugged she would be outcast from society and without a penny to bless herself let alone to feed and clothe herself and her children on the other hand for a man it is quite different i may as well tell you sybilla has behaved indiscreetly on other occasions and poor william resolved not to put up with it any longer added to which she had given him no family which although i daresay it is an affliction the poor woman cannot help it is an affliction nonetheless he wished to divorce her and take a more suitable wife who would fulfill a wifes role for him and be the fount of family joy he was very pleased sybilla had at last provided the justification he needed so as not to seem in anyones eyes to be unjust or to cast her aside because she is barren pitt was staggered it was something he had not even imagined william was going to divorce sybilla he repeated stupidly no one said so ah no eustaces smile grew even more confidential and he leaned forward a little taking his hands out of his pockets and placing one on the back of the chair to maintain his balance i daresay that was the quarrel emily thought she overheard now that sybilla is going to have a child at last that naturally changes things for the childs sake william has forgiven her and will take her back and of course she is very grateful and repentant i imagine her behavior in future will be all that can be desired his face shone with eminent satisfaction pitt was speechless he had no idea whether it was true but he knew from his slight knowledge of the divorce laws that what eustace said was correct a man might divorce his wife and put her out on the street for adultery but a woman could do nothing whatsoever by law adultery was beside the point as long as it was he who committed it and not she i see you understand eustace was saying the words passing over pitts head like the rattle of water very wise least said the better treated you to a confidence know you wont repeat it trust your discretion matters like that are between a man and his wife he spread his hands wide palms up in a confidential gesture from one man of reason to another just told you so you would understand poor william has had a lot to put up with but he should be at the beginning of happiness now tragedy poor emily couldnt have kept her headanother few days and all would have been well tragedy he sniffed but you can rest assured we shall look after her shell have the best of care im not leaving pitt said feeling foolish he must look ridiculous in this sedate room with its collection of family relics and eustace himself as solid as the hide chairs pitt had a tumble of hair his tie was crooked and his coat hung askew and he had two of georges handkerchiefs in his pocket eustaces boots were polished by the bootboy every day pitts were patched on the soles and cleaned by gracie when she remembered and had the time im not finished he said again as you wish eustace was disappointed but not concerned carry out whatever you think is necessary make it look fitting by all means dont want to lose you your job im sure the kitchen will give you dinner if you like and your fellow stripe of course stripe was delighted to have dinner in the kitchen not because he had any hope at all that he would learn something of value to the case but because lettie taylor was also there neat and pretty as a cottage garden and in stripes opinion every bit as pleasing he kept his eyes deliberately on his plate longing to look at her but furiously selfconscious he was not accustomed to eating in such formal even hierarchical company the butler sat at the head of the table like the father of a large family and the housekeeper at the foot as a mother would the butler presided as if it were a function of great importance and strict ritual was observed the junior footmen and youngest maids did not speak at all unless they were spoken to the ladys maids resident and visiting seemed to be a class apart both by the house servants reckoning and by their own the senior footmen kitchen maid and parlormaid sat in the middle and volunteered a good deal of the conversation table manners were quite as refined as those in the front dining room and the discussion surely as stilted but there was rather more of a domestic atmosphere the food was complimented dish by dish as it was served eaten and cleared the younger members manners were corrected gently but with a parental familiarity there were giggles blushes sulks just as stripe could remember at his own home when he was growing up only the standards were strange and strict elbows at sides all green vegetables to be eaten or there was no pudding no peas on the knife speaking with the mouth full was reproved instantly uninvited opinions quashed for him to have mentioned death would have been gross bad taste and murder unthinkable involuntarily stripe stole a look at lettie prim in white lace over her black and found she was also looking at him even in the gaslight her eyes were just as blue he looked away again quickly and was too selfconscious to eat afraid he would push peas off his plate onto the sparkling cloth is your meal not to your taste mrer stripe the housekeeper asked coolly oh excellent maam thank you he answered then as they were still looking at him he felt something more was required and went on ii suppose my thoughts was a little taken up well i hope you int going to discuss them ere the cook blew down her nose in distaste really weve already ad rosie in ysterics and marigold given notice and gone eavens knows where i dont know what things are coming to i swear i dont weve never had police in a house where ive been before sybillas maid said stiffly never its only my loyalty that keeps me in this house a moment longer neither have we lettie answered her so quickly the words tripped off her tongue before she had time to consider them but what do you want that we should be left to be murdered in our beds with no one to protect us im very glad theyre here ha i daresay you are the housekeeper said tartly lettie blushed a deep pink im sure i dont know what you mean she looked down at her plate and beside her one of the upstairs maids giggled stifling it in her napkin when the butler glared at her stripe felt an undeniable compulsion to defend her how dare anyone slight her and cause her embarrassment very dignified of you miss he said looking straight at her understandin adversity and takin it calm like good sense is about the best cure for times like these lot of arm avoided if there was more who showed it thank you mr stripe lettie said demurely but the pinkness crept further up her cheeks and he dared to hope it was pleasure the rest of the meal passed in conversation about trivialities but when stripe could no longer think of anything else to ask pitt having exhausted his duties in the front of the house it was time to leave he went with regret replaced by a ridiculous elation as lettie came down into the kitchen on some slight pretext caught his eye and bade him good night and then swishing her skirt with an elegant little step vanished up the stairs and into the hallway stripe opened his mouth to reply but it was too late he turned and saw pitt smiling and knew his admirationhe would still call it thatwas too plain in his face very nice pitt said approvingly and sensible er yes sir pitts smile widened but suspicious stripe very suspicious i think you had better question her a lot moresee what she knows oh no sir shes asoh he caught pitts eye yes sir ill do that sir tomorrow morning first thing sir good and good luck stripe but stripe was too full of emotion to speak upstairs in the dining room dinner was worse than even charlotte could have imagined everyone was there including emily looking ashen with misery all the women wore either black or gray except aunt vespasia who always refused to she wore lavender the first course was served in near silence by the time they had let their soup grow cold and pushed whitefish in a sauce like glue from one side of the plate to the other the oppression was becoming unbearable impertinent little man mrs march burst out suddenly everyone froze horrified wondering wildly whom she was addressing i beg your pardon jack radley looked up eyebrows raised the policemanspot or whatever his name is mrs march went on asking the servants all sorts of questions about matters that are none of his business stripe charlotte said very quietly it hardly mattered but she was glad of an excuse to retaliate mrs march glared at her i beg your pardon stripe charlotte repeated the policemans name is stripe not spot stripe spot its all the same id have thought youd have more important things to remember than a policemans name mrs march stared at her her face cold eyes like bluishgreen marbles what are you going to do with your sister you cant expect us to bear the burden of responsibility god knows what she will do next that was uncalled for jack radley said furiously there was instant and icy silence but he was unabashed emily has enough grief without our indulging in vicious and uninformed speculation mrs march sniffed and cleared her throat your speculation may be uninformed mr radleyalthough i doubt it mine is most certainly not you may know emily a great deal more intimately than i do but you have not known her as long for heavens sake lavinia vespasia said hoarsely have you forgotten every vestige of good manners emily has buried her husband today and we have guests at the table two spots of scarlet stained mrs marchs white cheeks i will not be criticized in my own house she said furiously her voice rising to a shriek since you hardly ever leave it anymore it would seem to be the only place available aunt vespasia snapped back at her i might have expected that from you mrs march swung round to glare at vespasia and knocked over a glass of water it rolled across the cloth and dripped water noisily down into jack radleys lap soaking him to the skin but he was too paralyzed with horror at the scene to move you are perfectly accustomed to having the most vulgar people tramping through your house mrs march went on probing and prying and talking of obscenities and god knows what among the criminal classes sybilla gasped and tore her handkerchief jack radley looked at vespasia in fascination thats nonsense tassie flew to her favorite grandmothers defense nobodys vulgar in front of grandmamashe wouldnt let them be and constable stripe is only doing his duty and if somebody hadnt murdered george he wouldnt have any duty to do in cardington crescent eustace pointed out exasperatedly and dont be impertinent to your grandmother anastasia or i shall require you to finish your dinner upstairs in your room temper flashed in tassies face but she said nothing more her father had dismissed her in the past and she knew he would do it quite easily now georges death is not aunt vespasias fault charlotte said for her unless you are suggesting she killed him hardly mrs march sniffed again a sound full of irritation and contempt vespasia may be eccentric even a little senile but she is still one of us she would never do such a fearful thing and she is not your aunt youve tipped your water all over our guests vespasia said curtly poor mr radley is soaked do look what you are doing lavinia it was so trivial and idiotic it effectively silenced mrs march and there were several moments of peace while the next course was served eustace drew in his breath his chest swelled we have a most distasteful time ahead of us he said looking round at each of them in turn whatever our individual weaknesses we none of us desire a scandal he let the word hang in the air vespasia closed her eyes and sighed gently sybilla still sat totally mute disregarding everyone selfabsorbed william looked at emily and there was a flash of profound almost wounding pity in his face i dont see how we can avoid it papa tassie said into the silence if it really was murder personally i think it was probably some sort of accident in spite of what mr pitt says why on earth would anyone want to kill george you are very young child mrs march said with a curl of her lips and very ignorant there are a multitude of things you do not know and probably never will unless you fill out a little and manage to hide all those freckles to the rest of us it is perfectly obvious if excessively distasteful again she let her fishblue eyes rest on emily tassie opened her mouth to retaliate but closed it again charlotte felt a sudden surge of anger for her above all things being patronized galled her soul neither do i she said bluntly know of any reason why someone should have killed george you would say that wouldnt you mrs march stared at her malevolently i always said george married badly fire rushed up charlottes cheeks and the blood pounded in her temples the hard accusing look in the old womans eyes was too plain to misunderstand she thought emily had murdered george and intended to see her punished for it she gulped air and then hiccuped loudly everyone was looking at her their faces a pale sea mirrored with eyes horrified embarrassed compassionate accusing she hiccuped again next to her william leaned forward poured her a glass of water and passed it to her she took it from him in silence hiccuping once more then drank a little and tried holding her breath her napkin held to her lips at least georges wife was his own choice vespasia filled the void with chipped ice he was encumbered with his family regardless of his wishes and i think there were times when he found it distinctly a burden you have no notion of loyalty mamainlaw eustace said with a slight flaring of his nostrils and a warning note in his voice none at all she agreed i always felt it a spurious value to defend what is wrong merely because you are related to its perpetrators quite eustace avoided charlottes eyes and looked at emily if we find that theoffenderis one of this family we will still do our duty painful as it may be and see that they are locked away but discreetly we do not wish the innocent to be hurt as well and there are many to consider the family must be preserved he flashed a smile at sybilla some people he continued ignorant people can be most unkind they are apt to tar all of us with the same brush and now that sybilla is at last to bear us a childhis tone was suddenly jubilant and he gave william a conspiratorial glancewe trust the first of many we must look to the future emily had a suffocating feeling of being crowded in she looked at mrs march who looked away dabbing stupidly at the water she had spilled across the cloth but it had long since soaked in jack radley gave a half smile but it died on his lips as he thought better of it william had eaten little and now he stopped altogether his face was as white as the sauce on the fish emily already knew him well enough to be aware that he was an acutely private man and such open discussion of so personal a subject was agonizing to him she looked away along the table to sybilla but sybilla was gazing at william then at eustace her face filled with a loathing so intense it was incredible he should be unaware of it tassie picked up her wineglass and it slipped through her fingers to crash on the table spilling wine everywhere emily had no doubt whatsoever she had done it on purpose her eyes were wide like pits in the bleached skin of her face sybilla was the first to recover she forced a smile that was painful worse than the hate before because of the effort behind it never mind she said huskily its a white winei daresay it will wash quite easily would you like some more tassie opened her mouth soundlessly and closed it again emily stared at william and he looked back at her ashen and with a complexity of emotions she could not unravel it could have been anything most probably pity for her perhaps he also believed she had murdered her husband in a frenzy of hopeless jealousy and that was what he pitied her for perhaps he even felt he understood was it eustace with his complacency his boundless energy his virility which had ultimately exhausted olivia who had shadowed williams marriage for so long was he terrified sybilla would die of excessive childbearing as his mother had done or had he never loved sybilla deeply anyway maybe he even loved someone else society was full of empty marriages at all levels since marriage was the only acceptable state for a woman one could not afford to be pernickety she looked at eustace but he was busy again with his food he had problems to consider keeping his family from hysteria preventing scandal in society and preserving the reputation of the marchesespecially of william and sybilla now that the longedfor heir was to come emily was an embarrassment threatening rapidly if the old lady were to be believed to become something far worse he sliced a piece of meat viciously squeaking his knife on the plate and his face remained in deep concentration emily looked across the table at jack radley his eyes were candid and startlingly soft he had been watching her already before she looked at him she realized how often she had seen that expression in him recently he was attracted to her very strongly so and it was deeper than the triviality of a flirtation oh god had he killed george for her did he really imagine that she would marry him now the room swayed around her and there was a roaring sound in her ears as if she were underwater the walls disappeared and suddenly she could not breathe she was far too hot suffocating emily emily the voice was booming and fuzzy and yet very close to her she was sitting on one of the side chairs half reclining it was uncomfortable and precarious she felt as if she might slide off if she were to move it had been charlottes voice you are perfectly all right she said quietly you fainted we expected too much of you mr radley will carry you upstairs and ill help you to bed i will have digby bring you up a tisane aunt vespasia added from somewhere above her in an unfocused distance i dont need carrying upstairs emily protested it would be ridiculous and why cant millicent bring me a tisaneexcept that i dont want one millicent is upset vespasia replied she weeps at the drop of a hat and is quite the last thing you need ive put her to the stillroom till she can take hold of herself and you will do as you are told and not cause yourself any more distress by fainting again but aunt vespasia before her argument was formed charlottes borrowed silk was replaced by black barathea and jack radley put his arms round her and lifted her up this is quite unnecessary she said irritably i am perfectly able to walk he ignored her and with charlotte going ahead opening doors emily was carried out of the dining room through the hallway and up the stairs to her bedroom he laid her on the bed said nothing but touched her arm gently and left i suppose its a little late to think of it now charlotte said unbuttoning emilys dress but your excess of charm to win george back was bound to attract others as well you shouldnt really be surprised emily stared at the pattern on the coverlet she allowed charlotte to continue with the buttons she did not want her to go im frightened she said quietly mrs march thinks i killed george because he was making love with sybilla she as good as said so charlotte did not reply for so long that finally emily swung round and stared at her her face was grave and her eyes were blurred and sad thats why we have to discover exactly what did happen painful as it will beand difficult i must talk to thomas privately tomorrow and see what he has learned emily said nothing she could feel the fear growing enormous inside her roaring into the chasm of loneliness for george the fierce gripping pain was like ice the danger was closing round her if she did not learn the truth soon she would not escape it perhaps not ever charlotte woke in the night her skin crawling with horror her body rigid under the sheets and her fists clenched something appalling had torn her from the dark cocoon of sleep then it came againa high sharp scream ripping through the silence of the house she sat up clutching the bedclothes as though the room were freezing although it was midsummer she could hear nothing nothing at all she climbed out of bed slowly her feet touching the carpet with a chill she bumped against a chair she was longer than usual accustoming her sight to the denseness of the curtained room what would she find out there on the landing tassie horrific ideas of blood and the gaslight at the head of the stairs shining on knives swarmed into her imagination and she stopped in the middle of the floor holding her breath at last there was another sound footsteps somewhere far away and a door opening and closing then more steps and the confused sounds of fumbling of people awkward with sleep she pulled her wrap off the chair and put it round her shoulders then opened the door quickly at the end of the small passage the landing itself was aglow with light someone had turned up the lamps by the time she reached the head of the stairs greataunt vespasia was standing beside the jardiniere with the fern in it she looked old and very thin charlotte could not remember ever having seen her with her hair down before it was like old silver scrollwork polished too many times till it had been worn away now the lamplight shone through it and it looked vaporous what is it charlottes voice cracked her throat too dry to allow the words through who screamed there was another sound of feet and tassie appeared from the stairs to the floor above she stared at them her face white and frightened i dont know vespasia answered them quietly i heard two screams charlotte have you been to emily no it was only a whisper she had not even thought of emily she realized now that she had believed the sound came from the opposite direction and farther away i dont think but before she could continue sybillas bedroom door swung open and jack radley came out wearing nothing but a silk nightshirt charlotte was sickened by a wave of disgust and disappointment and in an instant the thought flew to her how could she prevent emily from knowing about this she would feel betrayed a second timehowever little she cared for him he had still affected to care for her theres no need to be concerned he was saying with a slight smile pushing his hands through his hair sybilla had a nightmare indeed vespasias silver eyebrows rose in disbelief charlotte collected herself what about she said sarcastically concealing nothing of her contempt william opened his own bedroom door and came out onto the landing looking confused and embarrassed his face was blurred with sleep and he blinked as though dragged from an oblivion he infinitely preferred is she all right he asked turning to jack radley and ignoring the others i think so jack replied she rang for her maid vespasia walked slowly past without looking at either of them and went into sybillas room pushing the door open wider charlotte followed partly from some vague idea that she might help but also from a compulsion to know if sybilla were ever to tell the truth of what had happened it would be now when she was still too startled to have thought of a lie she followed vespasia inside and was taken aback all her ideas were thrown into turmoil when she saw eustace decorously wrapped in a blue paisley dressing gown sitting on the end of the bed talking now now my dear he said firmly have your maid bring you a hot drink and perhaps a little laudanum and youll sleep perfectly well you must dismiss these things from your mind or you will make yourself ill they are only fancies quite unreal you need a good rest no more nightmares sybilla was propped up against the pillows but the bed was in considerable disorder sheets tangled and blankets crooked as if she had been thrashing around in them in her sleep her mass of hair was loose like a river of black satin and her face was bloodlessly pale her eyes wide with shock she stared back at eustace speechlessly as though she barely comprehended his words perfectly all right he repeated yet again he turned and looked at charlotte and vespasia half apologetically women seem to have such vivid dreams but a tisane and a dose of laudanum and in the morning you will have forgotten all about it sleep in my dear he said again to sybilla have your breakfast sent up he stood smiling benignly but there was a tightness at the corners of his lips and an unusual color marking his cheeks he looked shaken and charlotte could hardly blame him it had been a terrible shriek in the depth of the night and jack radleys apparent behavior was inexcusable perhaps it was wise for eustace to try to convince her it was fantasy although her tight face and burning eyes betrayed her utter disbelief put it from your mind eustace said carefully right out involuntarily charlotte looked at the doorway william was standing just inside his face crumpled in anxiety staring past his father and vespasia to sybilla she smiled at him and there was a softness in her face charlotte had not seen before charlotte knew without question that it was not something sudden nor was william surprised to see it are you all right he said quietly the words were simple almost banal but there was a directness in them quite unlike eustaces assurance eustace was speaking for himself william was asking for her her hands relaxed and she smiled back at him yes thank you i dont think it will happen again we trust it will not vespasia said coldly looking back towards the landing where charlotte could still see jack radley it wont he said a little more loudly than necessary looking past vespasia into the bedroom he met sybillas eyes but if you have any more frights dreamshe said the word heavilyjust scream again well come i promise you and he turned and walked away gracefully the tails of his nightshirt round his bare legs and disappeared into his own room without looking back good god vespasia said under her breath well eustace began awkwardly rubbing his hands well all had a bit of a shock ah he cleared his throat least said soonest mended well not refer to it again all go back to bed and try to get a little sleep thank you for coming mrs pitt most thoughtful of you but nothing you can do now if you need a tisane or a glass of milk just ring for one of the maids thank heaven mama wasnt disturbed poor woman has more than enough to bearer he faltered to a stop looking at no one well good night charlotte went to vespasia and without giving a thought to the familiarity of it put her arm round her feeling with a start how thin and stiff she was under her wrap how unprotected her bones come she said gently sybilla will be fine now but you should have a hot drink ill get you one vespasia did not shrug off the arm she seemed almost to welcome it her own daughter was dead now george was dead tassie was too young and too frightened but she was used to servants ill ring for digby she said automatically shell get me some milk no need charlotte walked with her across the landing i can heat milk you know i do it all the time in my own houseand id like to vespasias mouth lifted in the wraith of a smile thank you my dear i should appreciate it it has been a distressing night and i feel no comfort in eustaces rather sanguine hopes he is quite out of his depth i am beginning to fear that we all are in the morning charlotte got up late and with a splitting headache hot tea brought to her by lettie did not help lettie drew the curtains and asked if she might lay out any particular clothes and if she should draw a bath no thank you charlotte declined primarily because she did not want to take the time she must see how vespasia was and emily and if she could make the opportunity sybilla there was a great deal more to last nights events than a bad dream there had been a look of hatred in sybillas eyes a deliberation in her voice more than the shreds of a nightmare however vile but lettie remained in the middle of the sunlit carpet her hands kneading her skirt under her apron i expect the inspector understands a lot of things we dont maam she said quietly charlottes first thought was that lettie was frightened in the circumstances it was hardly surprising im sure he does she tried to sound reassuring although it was the last thing she felt but lettie did not move it must be very interesting she hesitated being married to a policeman yes charlotte reached for the pitcher of water and lettie automatically poured it for her she began to wash is it very dangerous lettie went on does he gethurt sometimes sometimes its dangerous but he hasnt been badly hurt usually its just hard work charlotte reached for the towel and lettie handed it to her do you often wish he did something else maam it was an impertinent question and for the first time charlotte realized lettie was asking because it was of some personal urgency to her she put down the towel and met letties blue eyes with curiosity im sorry maam lettie blushed and looked away no i dont charlotte said honestly it was hard to get used to at first but now i wouldnt have him do anything else it is his work and he is good at it if you love someone you dont want to change them from doing what they believe in it makes no one happy why do you ask letties blush deepend oh no reason maam just just silly thoughts she turned away and began fussing with the dress charlotte was to wear tweaking unnecessarily at petticoats and removing imaginary specks of dust charlotte learned from digby that emily was still asleep she had taken laudanum and not woken in the night even sybillas screams and the comings and goings on the landing had not disturbed her she expected aunt vespasia to have had breakfast sent up but actually met her at the top of the stairs looking ashen and holloweyed holding on to the bannister head erect back stiff good morning my dear she said very quietly good morning aunt vespasia charlotte had been intending to go to sybillas room if necessary to waken her and ask her about last night some pretext of concern for her would have been easy enough to find but vespasia looked so fragile she offered her arm instinctively something she would not have dreamed of doing a week ago vespasia took it with a tiny smile there is no point in speaking to sybilla vespasia said dryly as they went down if she had meant to say anything she would have done so last night there is a great deal about sybilla that i do not understand charlotte let her uppermost thought find words i wish we could prevent emily from finding out i could strangle jack radley myself cheerfully he is so abysmallycheap i admit i am disappointed vespasia agreed with an unhappy little shake of her head i had grown rather to like him this as you say is quite remarkably shabby breakfast was extraordinary for eustaces absence not only were all the windows still closed and the silver dishes on the sideboard untouched but he had sent for a tray in his room neither was jack radley present probably too ashamed to face them charlotte presumed nevertheless she was annoyed she had wished to make him aware of her contempt it was after eleven when she went into the morning room to fetch some more notepaper and found eustace sitting at the desk silver inkwell open and a pen in his hand but the sheet in front of him virgin white he turned round at the sound of her step and she saw with incredulity that his right eye was swollen and darkened with an immense bruise and there was a graze on the side of his face she was too amazed to think what to say ah oh he looked awkward good morning mrs pitt ier i had a slight accident fell oh dear she said foolishly i hope you are not seriously hurt have you sent for the doctor not necessary perfectly all right he closed the inkwell and stood up wincing as his weight came onto his left leg he let out his breath sharply are you sure she said with more concern than she felt her overriding emotion was curiosity when had this extraordinary accident occurred to sustain such injuries he must have fallen downstairs at the very least im so sorry she added hastily very kind of you he answered his eyes resting on her with appreciation for a moment then as though recollecting some more pressing thought he limped over to the door and out into the hall and at luncheon a totally new dimension appeared startling charlotte and obliging her to think far better of eustace than she wished jack radley came to the table nursing a painful right hand and with a split and swollen lip however he offered no explanation at all and no one asked him for any charlotte was forced to conclude that eustace had seen him early in the morning and thrashed him over the disgraceful affair in sybillas room and for once she admired him for it remarkably sybilla herself spoke to jack radley perfectly civilly even agreeably although she looked very tense her shoulders were tight stiff under the thin fabric of her dress and the very few remarks she made were distracted her mind obviously elsewhere perhaps she had a share of guilt had she implied however obliquely that he might be welcome charlotte tried to behave as normally as possible mainly because she did not want emily to know what had happenedat least not yet time enough for that kind of disillusion when she was home and would not see jack radley again for now let her believe in accidents emily knew nothing about the extraordinary episode in the night and the first she observed was early in the afternoon when she came downstairs and sat in the withdrawing room staring at the sunlight on the leaves in the conservatory she saw william briefly as he came through to his studio he looked at her with a hollow pain she took for pity but did not speak tassie had gone off on good works again with the curate visiting the sick or some such thing her grandmother said it was unnecessary in the circumstances she might be excused but tassie had insisted there were certain tasks she would not forgo apparently she had given an undertaking and she ignored argument eustace had not been present to lend his weight and for once the old lady lost the contest retiring to her boudoir to sulk charlotte was with aunt vespasia leaving emily alone to while away the afternoon she could not be bothered to occupy herself with any of the usually acceptable feminine taskspainting embroidery music she had written all the letters that were required of her and visiting so soon after a family death was out of the question therefore she was doing nothing at all when eustace came in limping noticeably but it was not until he turned to speak to her that she saw the richly purpling bruise round his eye now almost closed and looking acutely painful oh she drew in her breath sharply whatever happened to you are you all right emily stood up without thinking as if in some way he might actually need her physical assistance he smiled awkwardly ah i tripped he said without meeting her eyes in the dark nothing for you to worry about i suppose williams in therehe waved towards the conservatoryfiddling about with his damn paints again he cant seem to leave them alone for five minutes god knows youd think with all this distress in the family hed be some use wouldnt you but william always did run away from everything he swiveled round winced with pain as his injured leg took his weight and then moved towards the conservatory doors leaving emily with her answer unspoken on her lips she sat down again feeling even more conscious of her loneliness it was several minutes before she became aware of voices fragmented by the distance the vines and leaves and the heavy swags of curtain between the doors but there was no mistaking the anger in them the sharp cutting edge of old hatred if youd damn where you should then youd have known it was eustaces voice williams reply was indistinguishable thought youd have been used to it eustace shouted back your thoughts we all know this time williams answer was quite clear ringing with unutterable disgust imagination never needed to your mother eustaces retaliation was disjointed blurred by the tangle of plants mother for gods sake william shouted in an explosion of violence emily stood up unable to bear the intrusion she was unwittingly making into what was obviously a highly intimate matter she hesitated between leaving by way of the dining room and fleeing to some other part of the house or having the courage and the effrontery to interrupt the quarrel and end it at least temporarily she turned to the conservatory then back to the dining room and was startled to see sybilla in the doorway for the first time since she had come to cardington crescent the look of anguish in sybillas face overrode all emilys old hatred of her and prompted a sympathy she could not have imagined even a day before dare you i wont williams voice rose again thick with emotion sybilla almost ran across the floor catching her skirts on the back of a chair and tearing at them impatiently and disappeared into the conservatory knocking against flowers and stepping off the path into the damp loam in her haste a moment later the voices from beyond the leaves froze and there was utter silence emily took a deep breath her stomach tight unclenching her hands deliberately and walked towards the dining room door she did not wish to be here when any of them returned she would pretend complete ignorance it was the only possible thing in the main hallway she met jack radley his lip was swollen and there was a line of dried blood on it and he carried his right hand awkwardly he smiled at her and drew in his breath in pain as the lip cracked i suppose you tripped in the dark as well she said icily before she could stop herself then wished she had simply ignored him he licked the lip and put his hand to it tenderly but there was still that same gentleness in his eyes is that what he said he mumbled not at all i had a row with eustace and hit himand he hit me obviously emily replied without quite the contempt she had intended i am surprised you are still here she moved past him to go up the stairs but he sidestepped and remained in front of her if you expect me to explain myself youll wait in vain it is none of your business he said with an edge to his voice i dont break confidences even for you but i admit i expected you of all people not to jump to conclusions she felt a stab of shame im sorry she said very quietly ive surely wished i could hit eustace a few times myself it looks as if you got rather the better of it he grinned regardless of the blood now staining his teeth for what its worth he agreed emily yes then as he said nothing she added your face is bleeding you had better go and wash it and find some ointment or it will dry and crack again i know he put his hand on her arm gently and she could feel the warmth of him through the muslin of her sleeve emily keep your courage we will find out who killed georgei promise you suddenly her throat ached abominably and she realized how deeply frightened she was how close to weeping not even thomas seemed able to help of course she said huskily pulling away this was ridiculous she did not wish him to see her weaknessabove all she did not wish him to know how very agreeable she found him in spite of her distrust thank you im sure you mean well she went hastily up the stairs leaving him standing in the hall looking after her and she turned onto the landing without glancing back emily slept badly it was a night full of enormous and ugly dreams bloodspattered clothes the rattle of stones on georges coffin lid the vicars pink face with his mouth opening and closing like a fish and every time she woke the picture of jack radley came back to her sitting on the nursery stool staring at her the sun in his hair and in his eyes the understanding that she knew he was guilty and there could be no escape she woke at once sweating and chill staring into the black void of the ceiling when she fell asleep again the dreams were worse billowing one into another swelling and bursting then shrinking away into nothingness always there were faces uncle eustace smug and smiling staring at her with those round eyes that saw everything and understood nothing not caring if she had murdered george or if it was someone else only determined she should be blamed for it to keep the march name clear and tassie too mad to know anything old mrs marchs eyes like glass marbles blind with malice shrieking all the time william with a paintbrush in his hand and jack radley with the sun round his head like a halo smiling because emily had murdered her husband for love of him over one kiss in the conservatory she lurched into wakefulness and lay watching the slow light creep across the ceiling how long had she before thomas had no choice but to arrest her every second ticking away was eating her life the remnant was slipping into eternity and she was lying here alone and useless what was it that had so horrified sybilla that had ripped the usual mask off her face to show such hatredtwice once at dinner two days ago and then again in the withdrawing room when she overheard the quarrel in the conservatory she could bear it no longer and climbed out of bed it was already light and she could see quite easily where she was going she put on a wrap over her nightgown and tiptoed across the room to the door she would ask her she would go to sybillas room now when she was alone and could not make some polite evasion or claim a pressing duty nor would anyone interrupt them she opened the door slowly holding the latch so it would not fall back with a noise there was no sound outside she looked up and down the passage the dawn light came in cool and gray through the windows and fell on the bamboopatterned wallpaper opposite a bowl of flowers glowed yellow there was no one she stepped out and walked quickly towards the room she knew was sybillas she had no doubt what she was going to say she would tell sybilla that she had seen that look in her face and wherever her pity lay whatever loyalties she thought she had if she did not tell emily what act in the past had given birth to such a depth of loathing she would go to thomas pitt and let him discover it in her with pryings and questions which would be far harder from the anger in which she left the room the night before she was willing to threaten anything it was too late to care about sensitivity or embarrassment now she found her hand was shaking as she lifted it to grasp sybillas doorknob and turn it slowly perhaps it would be locked and she would be forced to wait till day she could put off the inevitable answers for a few hours more but it turned easily in her hand of course why would anyone lock doors in a house like this it would mean having to get out of bed to let the maid in who wanted to do that half the point of having a maid was to avoid getting up and pulling the curtains or drawing the water yourself if you were going to get out of a warm bed on demand fresh from sleep the whole luxury was lost she was inside now it was quite light the curtains were yellow and the window faced the sun sybilla was already awake sitting upright against the nearest high carved bedpost facing the window her black hair in thick tresses wound at both front and back the thought passed through emilys mind that it was an odd way to wear it sybilla she said quietly im sorry to intrude but i couldnt sleep i need to talk to you i believe you know who murdered george and she was at the end of the bed now and she could see sybilla more clearly she was sitting very awkwardly her back rigid against the bedpost and her head a little to one side as if she had fallen asleep emily came round the far edge of the bed and leaned forward then she saw sybillas face and felt the horror rising inside her robbing her of breath freezing her heart sybilla was staring with blind bulging eyes out of swollen flesh her mouth open tongue out the black hair was knotted tight round her throat and swept back round the bedpost and tied again emily opened her mouth to scream but no sound came at all only a violent dry ache in her throat she found she had her hands to her lips and there was blood on her knuckles where she had bitten them she must not faint she must get help quickly and she must get out of hereshe must not be alone at first she was shaking so much her legs would not obey her she knocked into the corner of the bed and bruised herself felt for the chair to regain her balance and nearly upset it there was no time to be sicksomeone else might come and find her here they blamed her already for georges deaththey would be sure to blame her for this too the doorknob was stiff now twice she turned it and her sweaty fingers let it slip back before she pulled the door open and almost fell out into the corridor thank god there was no one else there no housemaid hurrying down to clean grates or prepare the dining room almost running she made her way to the dressing room where charlotte was and without knocking fumbled for the handle and threw it open charlotte charlotte wake up wake up and listen to mesybilla is dead she could dimly make out the form of charlotte her hair a dark cloud on the white pillow charlotte she could hear her voice rising hysterically and could not help it charlotte charlotte sat up and her whisper came out of the cool grayness what is it emily are you ill no no she gulped painfully sybilla is dead i think shes been murdered i just found her in her bedroom strangled with her own hair charlotte glanced at the clock on the bedside table emily its twenty past five are you sure you didnt have a nightmare yes oh god theyre going to blame me for this too and in spite of all the strength of will she thought she had she began to weep crumpling slowly into a little heap on the end of the bed charlotte climbed out and came to her putting her arms round her and holding her rocking her like a child what happened she said quietly trying to keep her voice calm what were you doing in sybillas room at this time in the morning emily understood charlottes urgency she dared not indulge in misery and fear only thought rational and disciplined could help she tried to iron out the violence in her mind and grasp the elements that mattered i saw her face at dinner the night before last for a moment there was such a look of hatred on it as she turned to eustace i wanted to know why what did she know about him or did she fear he was going to do something charlotte they are convinced i murdered george and they are going to make sure thomas has no choice but to arrest me i have to find out who didto save myself for a moment charlotte was silent then she stood up slowly id better go and see and if youre right ill waken aunt vespasia well have to call the police again she pulled on a shawl and hugged it round herself poor william she said almost under her breath when she had gone emily sat curled up on the end of the bed and waited she wanted to think to see the pattern falling clearly but it was too soon she was shiveringnot with cold because the air was warm the chill was inside just as the darkness was whoever had murdered george had now murdered sybilla almost certainly because sybilla knew who heor shewas was it something to do with eustace and tassie or eustace alone or was it jack radley after all the door opened and charlotte came back her face tight and pale in the softening dawn light coming through the windows her hands were shaking shes dead she said with a gulp stay here and lock the door behind me im going to tell aunt vespasia wait emily stood up and lost her balance her legs were weak as if her knees would not lock im coming id rather come with youanyway you shouldnt go alone she tried again and this time her body obeyed her and wordlessly she and charlotte crept shoulder to shoulder along the landing feet soundless on the carpet the jardiniere with its splayed ferns seemed like half a tree casting octopus shadows on the wallpaper they knocked at vespasias door and waited there was no answer charlotte knocked again then turned the handle experimentally it was not locked she opened it and they both slipped in closing it behind them with a tiny click aunt vespasia charlotte said distinctly the room was darker than emilys having heavier curtains and in the gloom they could see the big bed and vespasias head on the pillow her pale silver hair in a coil over her shoulder she looked very frail very old aunt vespasia charlotte said again vespasia opened her eyes charlotte moved forward into the shrouded light from the window charlotte vespasia sat up a little what is it is that emily with you a note of alarm sharpened her voice what has happened emily remembered something she saw an expression on sybillas face the other night at dinner charlotte began she thought if she understood it it might explain things she went to ask sybilla at dawn now vespasia was sitting upright and did itexplain things have you learned something what did sybilla say charlotte shut her eyes and clenched her hands hard nothing shes dead she was strangled with her own hair round the bedpost i dont know whether she could have done it herself or not well have to call thomas vespasia was silent for so long charlotte began to be afraid then at last she reached up and pulled the bellpull three times pass me my shawl will you she asked when charlotte did so she climbed stiffly out of bed leaning on charlottes outstretched arm for support we had better lock the door we dont want anyone else going in and i suppose we must tell eustace she took a long deep breath and william i imagine at this time in the morning thomas will be at home good then you had better write him a note and send a footman to bring him and his constable there was a sharp rap on the door startling them and before anyone answered it it opened and digby came in looking disheveled and frightened as soon as she saw vespasia herself was all right the fear vanished and was replaced by concern she pushed the straggling hair out of her eyes and prepared to be cross yes mlady she said cautiously tea please digby vespasia replied struggling to maintain dignity i would like a dish of tea bring enough here for all of usyou had better have some yourself and as soon as you have put the kettle on waken one of the footmen and tell him to get up digby stared at her roundeyed grimfaced vespasia gave her the explanation she was waiting for young mrs march is dead perhaps youd better get two footmenone for the doctor we can telephone the doctor mlady digby answered oh yes i forgot i am not yet used to who has these contraptions and who has not i presume treves has one yes mlady then get one footman to send for mr pitt im sure he hasnt got a telephone and bring the tea the next few hours moved like a feverish dream a mixture of the grotesque and the almost offensively commonplace how could the breakfast room look precisely the same the sideboard laden with food the windows thrown open pitt was upstairs with treves bending over sybillas corpse locked in her own hair trying to decide whether she killed herself or someone else had crept in and tied those lethal knots charlotte could not keep it from her mind to wonder if that was why jack radley had gone in the night before not by any amorous designonly she had wakened too soon and raised the alarm she knew it must have occurred to vespasia too it was late when they sat down well after ten and everyone was at the table even william ashen hands shaking eyes haggard apparently preferred the noise and occupation of company to the loneliness of his room next door to sybilla emily sat rigid her stomach knotted so hard she could not bear to eat it would make her ill she sipped a little hot tea and felt it burn her tongue and slide painfully down her closed throat the sounds of crockery and talk alternately outraged and frightened her swirling round her like so much empty rattle it could have been the sound of carriage wheels over gravel or geese in a yard charlotte was eating because she knew she would need the strength it would give her but the carefully coddled eggs and thin sliced toast might as well have been cold porridge in her mouth the sunlight glittered on silver and glass and the clink of cutlery grew louder as eustace fought his way through fish and potato but even he found little joy in it the linen was so white it reminded her of snowfields glaring and cold with the dead earth underneath this was ridiculous fear was paralyzing her solidifying like ice she must force herself to listen to them all to think to make her brain respond and understand it was all here if only she could tear the fog from her mind and recognize it it ought to be familiar to her nowshe had seen enough murder before the pain and the fear that led to violence how could she be so close and still not know it she looked round the table at them one by one old mrs march was tightlipped and her fist was clenched beside her plate perhaps anger against the injustice of fate was the only way she could keep from being overwhelmed by the tragedy which was engulfing the family in which she had invested her whole life vespasia was silent she had shrunk she seemed smaller than charlotte had thought her her wrists bonier her skin more papery tassie and jack radley were talking about something totally immaterial and she knew even without listening that they were doing it to help so that the silence would not creep in and drown them all it did not matter what was said anything the weather would do everyone each imprisoned in a private little island of horror was trying to grasp back something of last week only a tiny span of days ago when the world had been so ordinary so safe they would gladly have brought back the anxieties that seemed pressing then and so infinitely trivial now charlotte had seen pitt briefly he had called her into sybillas bedroom at first she had drawn back but he had told her the body was laid out quietly the hair undone a sheet over the terrible face please he had said fiercely i need you to come in reluctantly shivering she had obeyed and he had almost pushed her through the door arms round her sit on the bed he had ordered nowhere sybilla was she had stood rooted to the spot pulling against him why it was unreasonable grotesque why i need you to he had said again charlotte please i have to know if she could have done it herself of course she did she had not moved pulling hard against his strength and they remained frozen like that locked in a tugofwar in the middle of the carpet in the sun pitt was getting cross because he was helpless of course she could charlotte had been shaking she had it round her throat then round the bedpost its just like tying a scarf behind your neck or doing up the back of a dress she used the bedpost to make it tight enoughthe carving on it tightened it again when she slipped down a bit she must have meant to or she wouldnt have stayed there shed have moved while she still had the strength i dont suppose you black out straightaway let go of me thomas im not going to sit there dont be silly he had begun to lose control because he understood what he was asking of her and he knew of no other way do you want me to have to get one of the maids im not asking emily she had stared at him in horror then seeing the desperation in his eyes hearing the edge of it mounting in his voice she had taken a step towards the bed still refusing to look at the exact spot where she had seen sybilla take the other one he had yielded pointing to the bedpost at the opposite side sit there and reach behind your neck round the post slowly stiffly she had done as he ordered stretching her arms up behind her head reaching the post feeling her fingers round it pretending to tie something lower down he had commanded she bent them a little lower now pull he had said make it tighter he had taken her hands and pulled them down and away i cant her arms had hurt her muscles strained its too low downi cant pull that low thomas youre hurting me he had let go thats what i thought he had said huskily no woman could have pulled at it that low down behind her own neck he had knelt on the bed beside her put his arms round her and buried his face in her hair kissing her slowly holding her tighter and tighter there had been no need for either of them to say it they stayed there close in the silent certainty sybilla had been murdered charlottes mind returned to the present to the breakfast table and its painful charade of normality she wanted to be gentle comforting but there was no time she swallowed the last of her tea and looked round at each of them we have our senses and some intelligence she said distinctly one of us murdered george and now sybilla i think we had better find out who before it gets any worse mrs march shut her eyes and grasped for tassies arm her thin fingers like claws surprisingly brown spotted with old age i think i am going to faint put your head between your knees vespasia said wearily the old womans eyes snapped open dont be ridiculous she snarled you may choose to sit at the breakfast table with your legs around your earsit would be like you but i do not not very practical emily looked up for the first time i dont suppose she could vespasia did not bother to lift her eyes from her plate i have some sal volatile if you want it eustace ignored her staring at charlotte do you think that is wise mrs pitt he said without blinking the truth may be of a highly distressing nature especially for you charlotte knew precisely what he meant both as to the nature of the truth he believed and how he intended it should be presented to the police oh yes her voice was shaking and she was furious with herself but she found she could not prevent it i am less afraid of what might be discovered than i am of allowing it to remain hidden where it may strike againand kill someone else william froze vespasia put her hand up to her eyes and leaned forward over the table bad blood mrs march said with harsh intensity gripping her spoon so hard it scattered sugar over the cloth it always tells in the end no matter how fine the face how pretty the manners blood counts george was a fool an irresponsible disloyal fool careless marriages are the cause of half the misery in the world fear charlotte contradicted deliberately i would have said it was fear that caused the most misery fear of pain fear of looking ridiculous of being inadequate and most of all fear of lonelinessthe dread that no one will love you you speak for yourself girl mrs march spat at her turning whitefaced her eyes blazing the marches have nothing to be afraid of dont be idiotic lavinia vespasia sat up pushing her fallen hair off her brow the only people who dont know fear are the saints of god whose vision of heaven is stronger than the flesh and those simpletons who have not enough imagination to conceive of pain we at this table are all terrified perhaps mrs march is one of the saints of god jack radley said sarcastically hold your tongue mrs march shouted the sooner that incompetent policeman takes you away the better if you didnt murder poor george then you certainly inspired emily to do it either way you are guilty and should be hanged the blood fled his face but he did not look away there was a vacuum of silence somewhere across the hall a footmans steps sounded loudly till they died away beyond the baize door even eustace was motionless vespasia rose to her feet stiffly as if her back hurt her eyes glazed william rose also and pulled out her chair steadying her arm i assume mr beamish will send mr hare to console us again she said quietly and with only the slightest tremor which is as well he will be infinitely more use if he calls i shall be in my room i would like to see him would you like us to send for the doctor grandmama william found his voice with difficulty he looked as if he were walking in a nightmare through which he had struggled all night only to wake and find it still with him stretching into endless unalterable reality no thank you my dear vespasia patted his hand and then walked slowly from the room keeping her balance with care excuse me charlotte set her napkin by her plate and followed vespasia out catching up with her in the hallway and taking her elbow all the way up the long wide stairs for once vespasia did not resist her would you like me to stay with you she asked at the door of the bedroom vespasia looked at her steadily her face weary and frightened do you know anything charlotte no charlotte said honestly but if emily is right sybilla hated eustace whether for herself or for william or for tassie i dont know vespasias lips tightened and her eyes looked even more wretched for william i should imagine she said in barely more than a whisper eustace has never known when to hold his tongue he is not a sensitive man charlotte hesitated on the brink of asking if there was anything else but drew back from probing any more she gave the shadow of a smile and left her the idea was hardening in her and as soon as she was sure the landing was clear charlotte went to sybillas door and tried it the servants had naturally been told what happened and no maid would venture in here pitt had moved sybilla to the long seat by the window before for his experiment on the bed but perhaps he had lifted her back now to rest in some attitude of peace providing one did not see the face the door was not locked maybe there was no need who would return except in grief and in humanity that must be allowed both pitt and treves must already have seen everything they could and presumably gone down to the butlers pantry to consult she glanced round the landing once more then turned the handle and went in the room faced south and was full of light there was a shape on the bed under a sheet she kept her eyes from it although she knew perfectly well precisely what she would see if she were to take it off she must control her imagination and a surprisingly sharp sense of pity which tugged at her like a bruise of the mind sybilla had caused emily dreadful pain and yet perversely she could not loathe her as she wished even when she was alive she was aware of some hard knot of hurt in sybilla also something growing and becoming worse more acute she could only hate the comfortable the unmarked because she felt alien from them the moment she saw the wound and believed the pain her anger slipped away like sand through a sieve so it had been with sybilla and now she intended to search for some sign of what had been the cause she stared round where to begin where did she keep her own private things things that would reveal to another woman her frailties not the wardrobethat would hold only clothes and one did not leave private things in a pocket the bedside table had a small drawer but maids might tidy that there was no lock on it still she pulled it open in case and found only handkerchiefs a lavender bag smelling sweet and dry a twist of paper that had contained a headache powder and a bottle of smelling salts nothing next she tried the dressing table and found all the things she would have expected brushes and combs silk scarves for polishing hair pins perfumes and cosmetics she would like one day to learn how to use them as skillfully as sybilla had the thought of the murdered womans beauty was peculiarly painful seeing these small artifices spread out so uselessly now it was ridiculous to identify with her so much and yet the knowledge did not dispel the feeling there was underwear as she would have expected infinitely prettier and newer than her ownprobably much the same as emilys but there was nothing about it in which she could see any deeper meaning no paper or article hidden underneath she tried the jewel case and lingered in a moments envy for a rope of pearls and an emerald clasp but again the bare objects told her nothing gave her no clue as to whether they were more than the ornaments any wealthy and loved woman might have she stood in the center of the floor staring round at the pictures the curtains the enormous fourposter surely there must be something under the bed she knelt down quickly and threw up the long counterpane to see there was a trunk for clothes and beside it in the shadow a small vanity case instantly she hauled it out and still kneeling tried the lid it was locked damn she swore fiercely damn damn damn she thought for a moment peering at it it was a very ordinary lock small and light there was a little tongue of metal holding the catch if she could just move that where was the key sybilla must have had one where did she keep her own keys in the jewel case of course in the space underneath the tray for earrings that was where she kept her own suitcase keys not that she traveled very often these days she scrambled to her feet tripping over her skirt and landed half on top of the dressingtable stool it was there a little brass key about an inch long in with the gold chains it opened the vanity case on the floor and with fingers fumbling with excitement charlotte pushed back the lid and saw the pile of letters and two little white kidbound books one had addresses written on the front she looked at the letters first they were love letters from william and after the first one she checked only the names they were passionate tender written with a delicacy of wording that brought back to her mind the painting on the easel in the conservatory full of so much more than merely wind in spring trees there was in it all the subtlety of the turning year of blossom and ice and the knowledge of change she hated herself for doing it they were all from william there was nothing else nothing from georgebut then george was not a man who wrote love letters and any other mans would surely be clumsy and inarticulate beside these she picked up the unmarked book it was a diary begun some years ago in an ordinary notebook no dates printed no headings except those sybilla had written herself charlotte opened it at random and saw the notation christmas eve a few months ago she read with horror william has been painting all day i can see it is brilliant but i wish he would not spend so much time on it leaving me alone with the family the old woman is still asking me when i propose to become a real woman and bear a family an heir for the marches there are times when i hate her so much i would gladly kill her if i knew how perhaps i would regret it afterwards but it could hardly be worse than the way i feel now and eustace sits there talking about what a waste william ispainting life instead of living it and he looks at me unctuously all the time i feel as if his eyes see through my clothes he has such manhood how can i ever have been insane enough to let him make love with me i would give anything on earth to have refused himbut that is a pointless thought we are both locked in it and i dare not tell anyone tassie would be appalled not for her fathersometimes i think she has no love for him anywaybut for william whom she loves so much and with such gentleness more than most sisters i think dear god im so miserable i dont know what to do but cowardice wont help i have always been able to charm men i will find a way out charlotte was shaking and in spite of the heat in the closed room there were trickles of sweat chilling on her body was that what it was all about with george not a grand passion at all not even the vanity of a beautiful woman but a protection from eustace the thought made her feel sick she flicked through more pages of the little book till she came to the end she read the last entry i can hardly believe it nothing seems to shatter his appetite or frighten him i am almost driven into thinking it was a nightmare as he tried to make us all believe i have to look at jack to make myself sure poor jack grandmother vespasia looks at him with such disappointment i think she really liked him he is just the sort of man i fancy she would have led a rare dance when she was young and charlotte she is disgusted and it shows so plainly in her face i imagine that is on emilys account i wish i had a sister who cared for me so much i never before felt as if i needed one someone to trust who would defend me but i do now perhaps my screaming will be enough please god eustace did look truly horrified just for a moment before he thought what to say when everyone came running i dont think he really believed i would until i opened my mouth and so help me godif he comes again i shall scream again i dont care what anyone thinksand i told him i would now he has a black eye and jack a split lip jack must have gone to his room and thrashed him dear jack but what on earth can i do when he leaves please god help me and there it ended there had not been another morning for sybilla to write but why had she not told william because william already had no love for his father and she was afraid of what he would do in rage and the depth of his hurt and revulsion or perhaps because in any battle between william and eustace she was afraid eustace would always win no wonder she hated him there was a noise outside the doornot the light trip of a housemaid but a heavy tread a mans step there was no time to escape the footsteps stopped and someone touched the doorknob in a panic she threw the vanity case back under the bed and rolled in after it banging against something hard snatching her skirts after her and pulling down the counterpane just as the door opened and after a moment closed again he was in the room whoever he was she was huddled up against the trunk the vanity case digging into her back but she dared not move she thought of sybilla lying stiff and cold a few feet above her on the bed there was only the thickness of the springs and the mattress between them who was it he was opening and closing drawers searching through them she heard the wardrobe door squeak just as it had for her and then the rustle of taffeta a swish of silk then it closed again dear heaven was he looking for the little book she still had in her hand his feet were moving back this way she would have given a lot to know who it was but she dared not lift the counterpane even an inch to look whoever it was might be facing this way and he would surely see and then what haul her out and at best accuse her of robbing the dead the vanity case was digging into her its edges bruising her back the feet had not moved there was a faint soundof shifting weight and rustling clothwhat was it the answer was instant the counterpane was whipped away and she was staring paralyzed into eustaces red face and round eyes for a long terrible second he was as transfixed as she was then he spoke his voice a parody of its usual self mrs pitt is there anything whatsoever you can say to explain yourself had he any idea what was written in sybillas book she clung to it so hard her fingers were white she tried to speak but her throat was dry and she was so frightened she could not move she could not even crawl backwards because of the trunk if he decided to attack her to get back the damning bookand that was surely what he had been looking forthen the only escape she had was to stay here where he could not reach her it was too low for his thick body to get in that was preposterous she could hardly remain under the bed until someone else came to coax her out mrs pitt eustaces face was hard now his eyes dangerous yes he had seen the little white leather book in her hand and guessed what it was if he did not already know she stared back at him like a rabbit mrs pitt how long do you propose to remain under the bed i invited you to my house in order to be of comfort to your sister in her bereavement but you force me to think you are as mentally infirm as she is he held out his hand strong and square even now she noticed how clean it was how perfectly manicured the nails and give me the book he added with only the slightest stammer i will pretend i do not know you took it it will be for the best but i believe you should return to your own house at once you are obviously unsuited to remain in a household such as ours she did not move if she gave him the book he would destroy it and there would be nothing left except her word which no one would have believed against his even before this come he said angrily you are being foolish get out of there she reached up slowly to her neck and undid the top three buttons of her dress he stared at her in horrified fascination and in spite of himself his eyes went to her bosom always one of her handsomest assets mrs pitt he said hoarsely very carefully she pushed the little white book down the front of her dress and fastened it up again it felt uncomfortable and no doubt looked ridiculous but he would have to tear her bodice to take it from her and that would be very hard indeed for him to explain still looking at him his eyes now hot and furiousperhaps he was as frightened as she wasshe scrambled very awkwardly out from under the bed and stood up rumpled and stiff her legs shaking that book does not belong to you mrs pitt he said grimly give it to me it doesnt belong to you either she answered with as much courage as she could he was very strong thickchested broadhipped and he stood between her and the door i shall give it to the police no you wont he reached out and took her arm his fingers closed right around her immovably her breath almost choked her are you going to tear my dress off to get it mr march she tried to make her voice light and failed that will be extremely awkward for you to explain and i shall screamand you wont pass this off as a nightmare and how will you account for being here in sybillas room he asked but he was afraid and she smelled it in the air felt it in the bruising pressure of his fingers how will you his mouth flickered in the sickest of smiles i shall say i heard a sound in here and came in and i found you going through sybillas jewel casethe reason for that will be painfully obvious then i shall say the same she countered only it was not the jewel case it was the vanity case under the bed and i shall say you found the diary and then everyone will read what is in it his hand weakened she saw the fear deepen in his face and sweat break out through the skin of his upper lip and above his eyebrows let me go mr march or i shall call out there must be maids around and aunt vespasia is in her room across the landing slowly an inch at a time he took his hand away and she waited till it was fully gone just in case he changed his mind before she turned and walked legs wobbling to the door and out onto the landing she felt lightheaded and a little sick with relief she must find thomas immediately charlotte found pitt in the butlers pantry and threw the door open interrupting constable stripe in midsentence and barely hesitating to apologize thomas ive discovered the answer or at least one of the answersexcuse me constablein sybillas diary something i never even thought of she stopped abruptly now that they were both staring at her she felt vulnerable for the secret she had discovered not for eustaceshe would happily have seen him humiliated but for sybilla she felt unexplainably naked what have you found pitt asked anxiously his eyes wide seeing the fear and the flush in her face more than hearing her words there was no triumph in her she glanced at stripeonly for a moment but he saw it and instantly she was sorry she swung round to turn her back to him unbuttoned her dress just enough to pull out the diary and handed it to pitt christmas eve she said very quietly read the entry for christmas eve last year and then the very last one he took the book and opened it riffling through the pages till he came to december then turned them one by one finally he stopped altogether and she watched his face as he read it the mixture of anger and disgust slowly blurring and becoming inextricably confounded with pity he read the end and he killed george over her he looked up at charlotte and passed the book without explanation to stripe i suppose poor sybilla knew or guessed i wonder why he didnt look for the book when he killed her she said with quiet unhappiness maybe he heard something pitt replied someone else awakeeven emily coming and he dared not wait charlotte shuddered are you going to arrest him he hesitated weighing the question looking at stripe whose face was red and unhappy no he answered flatly not yet this isnt proof he could deny it all say it was sybillas imagination without any other evidence its only her word against his to make it known now would hurt william perhaps even cause more violence and more tragedy his mouth moved in the faintest of smiles let eustace wait and worry for a while lets see what he does he looked at charlotte you said there was another book with addresses yes then we had better get that as well it may mean nothing but well check through them all see who they are charlotte went obediently back to the door pitt hesitated looking at stripe with a half smile sorry stripe but i shall need you for this and it may take some time for a moment stripe did not understand the reason for the apology then his face fell and the pink crept up his cheeks yes sir er his head came up would there be time sir of course there would pitt agreed but dont waste words be back here in fifteen minutes yes sir stripe waited only until charlotte and pitt were round the corner in the corridor before he shot out stopped the first maid he saw which chanced to be the parlormaid and asked her where miss taylor was at that moment he looked so urgent and impressive in his uniform that she responded immediately without her usual prevarication towards strangers in the houseespecially of the lower orders such as police chimney sweeps and the like in the stillroom sir thank you he turned on his heel and made his way past the other small rooms for numerous household duties to the stillroom which had originally been used for the making of cordials and perfumes but was now largely for tea coffee and the storing of sweetmeats lettie was putting a large fruitcake into a tin and she turned at the rather heavy sound of his feet she was even prettier than last time he saw her he had not noticed before how her hair swept off her brow or how delicate her ears were good morning mr stripe she said with a little sniff if youve come to look at this coffee youre welcome im sure but theres no point its all new in stripe brought his mind to attention no i didnt he said more firmly than he would have believed weve got some new evidence she was interested in spite of herself and frightened she liked to tell herself she was independent but in truth she had a strong loyalty to the household especially tassie and she would have gone to great lengths to prevent any of them being hurt especially by outsiders she stood still staring up at stripe her mind racing over what he might say and how she should answer she gulped have you he wished he could comfort her reassure her but he dared notnot yet im going to ave to go away to look into it oh she looked startled then disappointed then as she saw the pleasure in his face and realized she had betrayed herself she straightened so stiffly her back was like a ramrod and her chin so high her neck hurt indeed an i suppose thats your duty mr stripe she did not trust herself to go on it was ridiculous to be upset over a policeman of all things i may be quite a time he went on might even find the solutionand not come back again i hope you do we dont want terrible things like this happening and no one caught she moved as if to turn back to the cake tin and the rows of tea caddies but changed her mind she was confused not certain whether she was angry with him or not pitts admonition was ringing in his ears time was sliding by all must be won or lost now he screwed up his courage and plunged in staring at the chinese flower design on the jar behind her so i came to say as id like it very much if i could call on you personal like she drew in her breath quickly but since he was not looking at her he could not judge the reason perhaps youd come with me for a walk in the park when the bands playing it can be he hesitated again and met her eyes at last most pleasant he finished cheeks hot thank you mr stripe she said quickly half of her told herself she was crazy walking out with a policeman what on earth would her father have said the other half was tingling with delightit was what she had wanted most in the world for about three days she swallowed hard that sounds very agreeable he beamed with relief then collecting his composure remembered a little dignity and stood to attention thank you miss taylor if my duties take me away ill write you a letter andin a wave of triumphill call for you at three oclock on sunday afternoon and he left before she could demur she waited only until his footsteps had died away then she jammed the rest of the tea she was sorting all into one jar and ran upstairs to tell tassie a remarkable amount of whose own secrets she herself shared charlotte sat on the edge of her bed struggling with her growing desire to escape going down to dinner altogether pitt had gone with the address book to pursue the names in it and she felt a chill without him facing eustace across the table would be appalling he must surely know beyond question that she had shown the diary to pitt and that pitt must be weighing whether to make it public and what of william his own father who so clearly despised him with the wife to whom he had written such love letters it would be unbearable it was that which hardened in her mind the already halfmade decision not to tell emily let no one know who did not have to it was not certain beyond any other possibility that eustace had murdered george in a passion of jealousy after all he could hardly imagine any claim on sybilla if he was driven by jealousy it could only be if she had refused him in georges favor then a coldness drenched her much stronger more sure in its grasp of course sybilla dared not look to william for protection both because she would not wish him ever to know of her first weaknesslunacy as she had called itand because she was afraid for him if he and eustace quarreled eustace might in malice make sure everyone else knew he had cuckolded his own son she could imagine the old ladys face if she heardand tassie who loved william with such sensitivity no far better far wiser for sybilla to seek her defense in george who could be so startlingly considerate at times when he understood the wound he was loyal without judgment he would have helped her and kept silent only he had done the unforeseen and become enchanted with her himself and there had begun the unraveling of all the plan and then jackjack had understood and helped her as well but understood how much she would tell emily nothing not yet but dear heaven she did not want to go through the charade of dinner how could she excuse herself to the company it would be easy she had a headache she was unwell there would be no need to explain that women were always getting headaches and she had certainly had enough to justify one aunt vespasia would be concerned for her and send digby with medicines and advice emily would miss her at table and what excuse would satisfy her or thomas he would not accept a headache he would expect her to go down and watch and listen that was the reason she had given him for remaining here at all ladies with servants might take to their beds with the vapors working women were expected to keep on even with fevers or consumption he would see it for an attack of cowardiceexactly as it was on the whole facing eustace was the lesser evil at least she thought so until she sat down at the table determined not to look at him and in her very consciousness of him ended by meeting his eyes precisely when he was staring at her she averted her gaze instantly but it was too late the chicken in her mouth turned to wet sawdust her hands were clammy and she all but dropped her fork surely everyone else must be looking at her too and wondering what on earth was the matter with her it could only be politeness that kept them from asking she was staring at the white ice sheet of the tablecloth away from the dazzling facets of the chandeliers and the light on the cut glass of the cruet sets but all her mind saw was eustaces face i think the weather is going to break old mrs march said joylessly i hate wet summers at least in winter one can sit by a decent fire without feeling ridiculous you have a fire all through the year anyway vespasia replied that boudoir of yours would suffocate a cat i dont keep cats mrs march replied instantly i dont like them insolent creatures dont care for anyone but themselves and there is more than enough selfishness in the world already without adding cats to it but i did have a dogshe shot a look of intense hatred at emilyuntil somebody killed it if it hadnt preferred george to you it wouldnt have happened vespasia pushed her plate away in disgust poor little creature and if george hadnt preferred sybilla to emily none of it would mrs march was not to be beaten especially not at her own table in front of strangers whom she despised and not by vespasia whom she had resented for forty years you said before that it was because emily preferred mr radley charlotte interrupted looking at the old lady with raised eyebrows have you discovered something that changed your mind i think the less you have to say the better young woman mrs march flicked a scornful eye over her and continued eating i thought perhaps you had learned something new charlotte murmured then impelled by an inner compulsion she looked sideways at eustace it was an extraordinary expression she surprised on his facenot exactly fearsomething that had superceded it half curiosity he was the supreme hypocrite selfimportant and insensitive plowing on in his obsession with dynasty regardless of the trampling of subtle and private emotions but she realized with uncomfortable surprise that he did not lack courage he was beginning to regard her in a way quite different from the uninterested condescension which had possessed him before she read in that one glance that she had become not only an adversary but a woman the passage in the diary came back to her as sharply as if it were on the tablecloth in front of herwhat manhood he has and she felt her face flame the thought was so profoundly repellent her hands shook her fork clattering on the plate perhaps sybilla had made other references obliquelyeven in detail her face was burning she felt as if her dress had come undone in front of everyone especially eustace he might even know what she had read and more he might in his own mind be repeating the words and sharing them with her imagining her response she shuddered then because civility demanded it she looked upand found jack radley seated beside emily regarding her with concern have you discovered something tassie added with distressing perspicacity no charlotte denied too quickly i dont know who it wasi dont know at all then youre a fool mrs march said viciously or a liar or both then we are all fools or liars william laid his napkin beside his untouched plate where others had pushed the food around and eaten a mouthful or two he had not even pretended we are not all fools eustace did not look at charlotte but she knew as well as if he had that he was speaking to her doubtless one of us knows who killed george and sybilla but the rest of us have sufficient wisdom not to speculate aloud on every thought that comes into our minds it can only cause unnecessary grief we must remember christian charity as well as righteous indignation what in heavens name are you talking about vespasia demanded with startling anger christian charity towards whom and why you never had an ounce of charity in you all your life why the sudden aboutface are you on the other end for once eustace looked as if he had been struck he fumbled for a reply but found nothing that shielded him from her brilliant suspicion not because she cared a lot about eustace but because she must defend william from the humiliationabove all from eustace himselfcharlotte interrupted with the first thing that came into her head we all have things to hide she said overly loud foolishness if not guilt i have seen enough investigations to know that perhaps mr march is just beginning to learn im sure he would wish to protect his family whether he is concerned for the rest of us or not he may believe emily will not retaliate no matter what is said of her but i dont think he misjudges me in the same way vespasia was silent if she thought anything more she preferred not to say it now william looked at her with the shadow of a smile so thin it was painful and jack radley put his hand on emilys arm indeed mrs march regarded charlotte with a curl of her lip and what on earth could you say that my son would care about in the slightest charlotte forced a smile to her face you are inviting me to do precisely what we have just agreed would be most unfortunatecause unnecessary distress by speculation is that not so mr march she lifted her eyes and met eustaces he was surprised and a series of thoughts flashed through his mind so vividly she could trace them as if they had been pictures alarm temporary safety a budding ironya perception new to himand finally a reluctant admiration she had a hideous feeling that at that precise moment had she wished she might have filled the place so lately left by sybilla but this time she stared him out and it was he who lowered his eyes still she slept badly she had not offered aunt vespasia any explanation of her extraordinary confrontation with eustace and she felt guilty for it emily was still too absorbed in her own grief and the weight of fear that haunted her to have noticed it was long after midnight when she heard the noise outside very slight as of a pebble falling then it came again and she was surer of it she got out of bed and went to the window careful to disturb the curtain as little as possible and looked out she could see nothing but the familiar garden in the hazy light of a half moon then the noise came again a tiny thin plink a pebble fell from above touched the sill and bounced out and into the void she did not hear it land still she could see no one they must be standing so close to one of the ornamental bushes that one shadow consumed them both an assignation for one of the housemaids surely not a girl caught in such an act would lose not only her present position and the roof over her head but her character also which would preclude any future position as well she would be reduced to the grim choices of a sweatshop or the streets where she must live by thievery or prostitution even the hot flush of romance seldom inspired such dangerous abandon there were better ways whose window was above hers everyone had bedrooms on this floorexcept tassie tassie had kept her old childhood bedroom in the nursery wing upstairs to leave sufficient guest rooms free charlotte made up her mind instantly any time for thought and her nerve would fail she did not bother with underwear but grasped her warmest plainest dark dress climbed into it and pulled on her boots and buttoned them fumbling in the dark she dared not light one of the lamps even with the curtains drawn the watcher outside might see it she had no time to do more with her hair than tie it back then having found her coat she waited behind the door straining her ears till she heard the very faintest footfall on the landing she waited a moment longer then opened the door and went out silently closing it after her at the head of the stairs she was just in time to see a shadow at the bottom turn and disappear not towards the front but in the direction of the baize door and the kitchens of coursethe front door had bolts on it which could not be fastened from the outside in the scullery one of the servants would be blamed she ran down as quickly as she could holding her skirts she must be careful not to make a sound or get so close that tassie might glance backwards and see her was she sleepwalking or taken by some intermittent madness or quite sane but about some dreadful business that splashed her with blood for a moment charlotte hesitated it was a delusion to say it could not be anything grotesque horrors did happen she knew it only too well before georges death pitt had been called to a case of murder so horrific even he had come home whitelipped and sicka woman dismembered and left in parcels round bloomsbury and st giles she was standing rigid alone in the hallway ahead of her the baize door had almost stopped swinging tassie must be in the scullery by now there was no more time to decide either she followed her and learned the truth or she went back to bed the door was perfectly still if she did not hurry she would lose tassie without allowing herself to think any longer she crossed the last few steps of the hall and pushed through the door and into the servants wing the kitchens were deserted smelling clean and warm odors of scrubbed wood flour and as she passed the stoves coal dust she could see the gleam of light on the scuttles from the streetlamp through the window the scullery was piled with vegetables and buckets and mops her skirt caught against the handle of a pail and she stopped only just before it overbalanced and crashed down onto the stone floor the outer door ahead of her was closed tassie had already gone charlotte tried the handle and found it turned easily outside the night was only a little cooler than the house there was no breeze here in the highwalled yard the sky was shredded with a few faint mares tails of cloud but the half moon shed a milky light in which she could see the back windows the housing of the chute down into the coal cellars several bins for rubbish and at the far side the gate out into the areaway and the street and the yellow globe of a lamp above the wall tassie was somewhere out on the road carefully lifting the latch with both hands and holding it so it would not fall charlotte pulled the gate open and looked outside to the left there was nothing but the pavement to the right the slender figure of tassie walking rapidly down the crescent charlotte followed closing the gate behind her and hurrying a dozen yards before tassie disappeared round the corner into the main avenue now she was free to run without fear of drawing attention to herself there was no one else in sight and if she delayed tassie might be gone when she emerged into the avenue herself then she would never know what violent intrigue took a nineteenyearold heiress out in the small hours of the night and brought her home reeking with blood but when she got to the corner and raced round it stopping suddenly in case her feet on the cobbles were too loud and made tassie turn she saw no one at all along the broad sweep of the treelined way charlotte stood with the frustration boiling up inside herand saw tassie come out of the shadow of a sycamore fifty yards ahead moving very quickly charlotte had been too slow she had not imagined such haste and now if she were to keep tassie in sight she must run as lightfooted as possible and within the shadows as much as she could if tassie were to realize she was being followed at best any chance of discovering her secret would be lost and the worst hardly bore thinking ofa fight with a madwoman alone in the midnight streets that blood had come from someone if pitt knew about this he would be furioushe would quite probably never forgive her the very thought of the words he would use made her cringe but it was not his sister who faced trial and the gallows if they failed even a reasonable and fairminded person would have to agree that emily had as good a motive for murdering her husband as most women could imagine tassie was still walking swiftly along the avenue and charlotte was only ten yards behind her now but when she turned off without warning into a side street narrower and poorer charlotte was caught by surprise she had been lost in her thoughts and was startled back to awareness with an unpleasant realization of how close she had been to losing tassie and continuing alone to god knew where this new street was also residential but the houses were meaner closer together graciousness had yielded to necessity they had come to the end of the street and tassie was still walking rapidly as if she knew precisely where she was going they were now in a road which was little more than an alley closewalled and grimy with sagging houses propped against one another dark threatening recesses into yards and shadows like unknown stagnant pools there was no one else in sight but a scrawny urchin with a huge cap a few yards ahead of tassie walking in the same direction charlotte shivered although she was warm from hurrying and the night was mild she dared not think how afraid she was or she would lose her nerve and turn tail as fast as flying feet could carry her back to the broad clean familiar avenue but tassie seemed to be without fear her step was quick and light and her head was high she knew where she was going and looked forward to getting there there was no one in sight but the urchin tassie and charlotte herself but god knew what lurked in the doorways where on earth could tassie be going in this sour maze of tenements and grimy pinchpenny shops she could not possibly know anyonecould she charlottes heart missed a beat and coldness rippled through her had george also wakened one night or perhaps returning from sybillas room seen tassie and followed her was charlotte doing exactly what he had done had george discovered her abominable secretand died for it incredibly her feet did not stop some other part of her brain seemed to be governing them and they kept on quite automatically hurrying almost soundlessly along the dank street she was aware now of figures slumped in doorways of movement in the black alleyways amid the heaps of refuse rats or people both it was in alleys like this that pitts men had discovered the dismemhered parts of the girl less than a month ago charlotte felt sick but the thought would not be turned away it was the figure tiptoeing up the stairs the blood and the terrible serenity how far were they from cardington crescent how many times had they turned tassie was still ahead of her only ten or twelve yards she dared not allow the distance to become greater in case tassie turned suddenly and charlotte lost her she was a slight figure almost as thin as the urchin in front of her and the other ragged shadows that swam on the edge of her vision it was too late to go back wherever tassie went she would have to wait for her alone she would not know how to find her way out of this slum one large figure took shape detaching itself from the bulging irregular walls a man with broad shoulders but far from being afraid tassie went towards him with a little murmur of pleasure and lifted her arms accepting his embrace as naturally as a sweet and familiar blessing the kiss was intimate as easy as people who love each other with unquestioning trust but it was swift and the next moment tassie disappeared into the nearest doorway and the man after her leaving charlotte alone in the dark chipped and slimy pavement the urchin had seemingly vanished now she was really frightened she could feel the darkness coming closer figures moving uneasily with shuffling feet a slithering in the alleys a settling of beams and dripping of water leaking from hidden drains if she were robbed and killed here not even pitt would ever find her what was this place it looked like an ordinary mean house what inside it drew tassie here alone and at midnight she would have to wait here till she came out then follow her again until there was a hand on her shoulder and her heart jumped so violently the shriek was forced out of her in a shrill yelp that choked off in inarticulate terror wot yer be doin ere missy a voice growled in her ear hot ranksmelling breath she tried to speak but her throat was so tight the words died the hands over her mouth were coarse and the skin had the acrid smell of dirt well missy meddler the voice was so close the breath moved her hair wot yer want ere then come spyin ave yer come ter tell tales ave yer goin a runnin back for papa ter tell im all abaht it are yer ill give yer summin worf tellin then and he yanked her savagely bending her back and taking her off balance she was still shivering with fear but anger was mounting as well and she jabbed her elbow back sharply and at the same time trod back with her heel putting all her weight into it it caught the man on the instep and he howled with pained outrage it was just about to descend into something far uglier when a womans voice cut across them angrily stop it mr hodgekiss leave her alone this minute a lantern shone high and bright making charlotte wince and close her eyes the man spluttered and let her go growling wordlessly in the back of his throat mrs pitt it was tassies voice high with amazement whatever are you doing here are you all right have you been hurt you look terribly pale there was no conceivable explanation but the truth tassies face when she lowered the light looked as innocent as a bowl of milk eyes wide dark with concern i followed you charlotte said hesitantly it sounded foolish now and dangerous but there was no anger in tassies face then youd better come in she did not wait for a reply but turned back into the house leaving the door open charlotte stood on the pavement in an agony of indecision part of her wanted to escape to run as fast as her feet would carry her away from these cramped illsmelling streets the yawning house in front of her and whatever blood and madness was inside it another part of her knew she could notshe had no idea where she was and might as easily be running further into the slums she could wait no longer it was not a decision to go in so much as a lack of the courage to bolt she went after tassie through the door along a corridor so mean she could touch either side simply by extending her elbows and up a steep stairway that creaked under her weight her uncertain way was lit not by gas but a wavering pool of candlelight carried only just ahead of her she dared not imagine where she was going but the bedroom was desperately ordinary thin curtains at the windows sacking on the floor for carpet a bare wooden table with a pitcher and bowl and a large marital bed made tidy for the event in it lay a girl of barely fourteen or fifteen her face pale and tense with fear her hair brushed off her forehead and lying in a damp tangle over her shoulders she was obviously well into labor and in considerable pain on the far side of the bed stood a girl a year or two older and bearing so marked a resemblance they must have been sisters beside her sleeves rolled up ready to assist when the time should come but for now holding her hand was mr beamishs curate mungo hare a blinding realization came to charlotte it was all so obvious there was no question left to ask somehow or other tassie had become involved in helping to deliver the babies of the poor or abandoned presumably it was mungo hare who had introduced her to this area of need the idea of the pink and pious mr beamish organizing such a thing was absurd and that quick wholehearted kiss explained itself and also explained tassies compliant obedience with her grandmothers command that she should be occupied in good works happiness bubbled up inside charlotte she was so relieved she wanted to laugh aloud but tassie had no time for such emotions the girl on the bed was going into another spasm of contractions and was racked almost as much by fear as by the pain tassie was busy giving orders to a whitefaced youth in a cloth cap presumably the urchin who had fetched her with the stone against the window sending him for water and as much linen as he could find that was clean perhaps to get him out of the room had it not been for the girls fear and the close possibility of death mungo hare would also have been banished childbirth was womens business charlotte could remember her own two confinements especially the first the awe and the pride of carrying had given way to a primitive mouthdrying fear when the pain came and her body began its relentless cycle which would end only when there was birthor death and she had been a grown woman who loved her husband and wanted her child and had a mother and sister to attend her after the doctor had done his professional work this girl was barely more than a child herselfcharlotte had been in the schoolroom at her ageand there was no one to help her but tassie and a young highland curate she stepped forward and sat on the bed taking the girls other hand hold on to me she said with a smile it will only hurt worse if you fight against it and cry out if you want toyou are entitled to and no one will mind in the least it will all be worth it i promise you it was a rash thing to say and as soon as the words were out her mind half regretted them too many children were born dead and even if it were perfect how was this girl going to care for it youre very kind miss the girl said between gasps i dont know why you should take the trouble i dont ive had two myself charlotte replied holding the thin little hand more tightly and feeling it clench with another spasm of pain i know just how you feel but wait till you hold your baby youll forget all about this then again she cursed her runaway tongue what if the girl could not keep it what if it went into adoption or some anonymous orphanage a charge on the parish to grow up in a workhouse hungry and unloved me an me sister the girl answered her unspoken question were goin ter raise imor er annie as a real good job cleanin an like mr are got it for er she gave mungo hare a look of trust so total it was frightening in its intensity then more regular contractions cut out all conversation and it was time for tassie to begin her work with words of command and encouragement and all the towels and eventually water without ever making the decision to charlotte helped and at half past three in the narrow shabby room the old miracle was fulfilled and a perfect child was born the girl in a clean nightgown exhausted hair wet but flushed with joy held him in her arms and asked charlotte timidly if she would mind if the baby were named charlie after her she said quite honestly that she would count it a very great honor at quarter past four as the summer dawn splashed the sky pearl above the sloping maze of roofs gray with grime and soot charlotte and tassie left the house and with the urchin dancing a little jig were led back to the avenue from which they could find cardington crescent and home mungo hare did not come with them he had said goodbye to tassie at the corner of the alley he had other tasks before he reported to mr beamish for the ritual of the morning service charlotte felt like dancing too except that her legs would not obey such a hectic call after the extraordinary demands that had already been made upon them but she found herself singing some snatch of a music hall number because of its sheer joy and after a moment tassie joined in side by side they marched along the avenue in the white dawn bloodspattered hair wild as the birds in the sycamores welcomed the day in cardington crescent they found the scullery door still unlocked and crept in past the piles of vegetables and the rows of pans on the wall up the stone step into the kitchen another half hour and the first maids would be down to clean out the stove renew the blacking and get the fires going and the ovens ready for breakfast when the cook appeared not long after that the housemaids would be up too to prepare the dining room and begin the daily round havent you ever run into anyone charlotte whispered no i have had to hide in the stillroom once or twice tassie looked at her anxiously you wont tell anyone about mungo will you please of course not charlotte was horrified that the possibility could have crossed tassies mind what do you think of me that you need to ask are you going to marry him tassies chin came up yes papa will be furious but if he wont give me permission i shall just have to do without i love mungo more than anyone else in the worldexcept grandmama vespasia and william but thats different good charlotte clasped her arm in a fierce little gesture of companionship if i can help i will thank you tassie meant it profoundly but there was no time for conversation now they could not afford to linger they were later than was safe as it was on tiptoe charlotte followed her along the corridor past the housekeepers sitting room and the butlers pantry to the baize door and the main hallway they were as far as the foot of the great stairway when they heard the click of the morning room door and eustaces voice behind them mrs pitt your conduct is beyond explanation you will pack your belongings and leave my house this morning for an instant charlotte and tassie both froze tingling with horror then slowly and in unison they turned to face him he stood three or four yards away just outside the morning room door a candle in his hand dripping hot wax into its holder he was wearing his nightshirt with a robe over it tied round the waist and a nightcap on his head it was broad sunrise outside but in here the velvet curtains had not been drawn and the flame of the candle held high was necessary to see their faces and the dark stains of the afterbirth splashed down their skirts in spite of the dreadfulness of the moment charlotte could not quench in herself the infinitely more important joy the exultant achievement in new unblemished life eustaces face blanched in the yellow candlelight and his eyes opened even wider oh my god he breathed appalled what have you done delivered a baby tassie said with the same smile charlotte had seen that first night on the staircase youyyou what eustace was aghast delivered a baby tassie repeated dont be ridiculous what baby whose baby he spluttered youve taken leave of your senses girl her name doesnt matter tassie answered it matters very much eustaces voice was rising and growing louder she had no business sending for you at this time of night in fact she had no business sending for you at allwhere is her sense of propriety an unmarried woman has no no call to know about these things it is quite improper how can i marry you decently nownow you have beenwho is it anastasia i demand to know i shall criticize her most severely and have a few very unpleasant words to say to her husband it is completely irresponsible he broke off as a new thought struck him i didnt hear a carriage there wasnt one tassie replied we walked and there isnt a husband and her name is poppy brown if that helps ive never heard of herwhat do you mean you walked there are no browns in cardington crescent are there not tassie was completely indifferent there was nothing left to be saved by tact and she was too euphoric too weary and too tired of being humiliated to plead no there are not he said with mounting anger i know everyone at least by repute it is my business to know what is this womans name anastasia and this time you had better tell me the truth or i shall be obliged to discipline you as far as i know her name is poppy brown tassie repeated and i never said she lived in the crescent she lives at least three miles from here maybe more in one of the slum areas her brother came for me and i couldnt find the way back there alone if i wanted to he was stunned into silence they stood in the guttering candlelight at the foot of the stairs like figures in a masque somewhere far upstairs there was movement a junior maid had allowed a door to swing shut unattended everything else was so still the sound reverberated through the vast house the sooner you are married to jack radley the better eustace said at last if hell have you which i imagine he willhe needs your money let him deal with you give you your own children to occupy you tassies face tightened and her hand on the bannister gripped hard you cant do that papa he may have murdered george you wouldnt want a murderer in the family think of the scandal the blood darkened eustaces cheeks and the candle shook in his fingers nonsense he said too quickly it was emily who killed george any fool can see there is a streak of madness in her family he shot a look of loathing at charlotte then turned to his daughter again you will marry jack radley as soon as it can be arranged now go to your room if you do that people will say i had to marry him because i was with child she argued it is indecent to marry in hasteespecially a man of jacks reputation you deserve to lose your standing he said angrily youd lose it a lot further if people knew where youd been tonight she would not give in but im your daughter my reputation will rub off on yours and anyway if emily killed george jack is certainly implicatedat least people will say so what people he had a point and he knew it no one knows of his flirtation except the family and we are certainly not going to tell anyone now do as i tell you and go to your room but she stood perfectly still except for a tremor in her hand where it gripped the bannister he may not want to marry me emily has far more money and she has it now ill only get mine when my grandmothers die i shall see that you are properly provided for he countered and your husband emily doesnt count she will be put away quietly somewhere in a private asylum for the insane where she cant kill anyone else her chin came up and her face was tight and frightened im going to marry mungo hare whatever you say for an icy moment he was speechless then the torrent broke you are not my girl you are going to marry whomever i tell you and i say you will marry jack radley and if he proves unsuitable or unwilling then i will find someone else but you are most certainly not going to marry that penniless young man with no family what in heavens name are you thinking of child no daughter of mine marries a curate an archdeacon perhaps but not a curate and that one hasnt even any prospects i forbid you to meet or speak to him again i shall talk to beamish and see that hare does not call at this house in future nor will you have occasion to speak with him in church and if you do not give me your word on it then i shall tell beamish that hare has made advances towards you and he will be defrocked do you understand me anastasia tassie was so stunned she seemed to sway now go to your room and remain there till i tell you you may come out eustace added he swung round to charlotte and you mrs pitt may take your leave as soon as you have packed whatever belongings you have but first i would like to speak with you mr march charlotte had one card to play and the decision was made without hesitation she met his eyes levelly we have something to discuss i he teetered on the edge of defying her his mouth a thin line his cheeks purple but his nerve failed go to your room anastasia he barked furiously charlotte turned to her with a brief smile ill come and see you in a few minutes she said quietly dont worry tassie waited a moment her eyes wide then seeing something in charlottes face she let go of the bannister turned slowly and climbed up the stairs and disappeared onto the landing well eustace demanded but his voice had a tremor and the belligerence in his face was artificial charlotte debated for an instant whether to try subtlety or to be so direct he could not possibly mistake her she knew her limitations and chose the latter i think you should allow tassie to continue with her work to help the poor she said as calmly as she could and marry mr hare as soon as it can be arranged without seeming hasty and causing unkind remarks out of the question he shook his head quite out of the question he has no money no family and no prospects she did not bother to argue mungo hares virtues they would weigh little with eustace she struck at him where he was vulnerable if you do not she said slowly and clearly meeting his eyes i shall see that your affair with your sons wife becomes public property so far it is only with the police and although it is disgusting it is not a crime but if society were aware of it your position would be untenable nearly everyone will turn a blind eye to a little discreet philandering but seducing your sons wife in your own houseover christmas and then continuing to force yourself on her stop it the cry was dragged out of him stop it the queen would not approve she went on mercilessly she is rather a prudish old lady with an obsession about virtue especially marital virtue and family life there would be no peerage for you if she knew this in fact you would be wiped off every guest list in london all right the surrender was strangled in his throat his eyes beseeching all right she can marry the bloody curate for gods sake dont tell anyone about sybilla i didnt kill heror george i swear it possibly she would give him nothing the police have the diary and as long as you are guilty of no crime against the law there is no reason why they should ever make it known i shall ask my husband to destroy itafter the murder is solved for williams sake not yours he swallowed hard and spoke with difficulty hating every word do you give me your word i just did now if youll excuse me i would like to go to bed it has been a very long and arduous night and i would like to tell tassie the good news she will be very happy i think she loves mr hare very much an excellent choice i shall not see you at breakfasti think i will have it in bed if you will be so kind as to order it for me but ill see you at luncheon and dinner he made a stifled sound that she took for assent good night mr march ahaaah he groaned while charlotte was enjoying breakfast in bed and telling emily about the nights events pitt was reexamining the address book found in sybillas vanity case by late morning he and stripe had accounted for all entries but one they were addresses he would expect to find any society woman making note of relatives mostly elderly a number of cousins friendssome of whom had married and moved to other parts of the country particularly in the winter out of the season others who were merely social acquaintances with whom it was advantageous to keep up some relationship and the usual tradesmentwo dressmakers an herbalist a milliner a corsetiere a florist a perfumer and others in similar occupations the one he could not place was a clarabelle mapes at tortoise lane the only tortoise lane he knew of was a grubby little street in st giles hardly an area where sybilla march would have occasion to call possibly it was a charity of some sort to which she gave her support an orphanage or workhouse it was a matter of diligence overly fussy and probably a waste of timehis superior was certainly of that opinion and said so witheringlybut pitt decided to call at tortoise lane it was just possible mrs clarabelle mapes might know something which would add to the close but still indistinguishable picture he had of the marches much of st giles was too narrow to ride through and he left his cab some half mile from tortoise lane and walked the buildings were mean and gray jettied stories overhung the streets and there was a fetor of hot air and old sewage spindly clerks with stovepipe hats and shiny trousers hurried by clutching papers a screever wirerimmed spectacles on his nose shuffled aside to allow pitt to pass the sun was beating down from a flat windless sky and there was smoke strong in the air a onelegged man on a crutch hawked matches a youth held a tray of bootlaces a girl offered tiny homemade childrens clothes pitt bought something from her it was too small for his own children but he could not bear the pain of passing her by even though he knew dozens wouldif not today then tomorrowand there was nothing anyone could do about it a coster pushed a barrow of vegetables down the middle of the street the wheels jiggling noisily over the cobbles the girl went to him immediately and spent all the few coins pitt had given her disappearing with the vegetables in her apron had eustace march really murdered george to keep secret his affair with his daughterinlaw and then murdered her when she realized his guilt he would like to have believed it almost everything about eustace offended him his complacence his willing blindness to other peoples need or pain his unctuous overbearing manner his virility and dynastic pride but perhaps he was not wildly untypical of many socially ambitious patriarchs possessed of vigor and money he was selfabsorbed insensitive rather than deliberately malicious most of the time he was convinced he was totally in the right about everything that mattered and a lot that did not pitt had no awareness of a violence or fear in him that would drive him to commit a double murder least of all in his own house then there was charlottes lurid story of tassie creeping up the stairs splattered with blood and in spite of her protestations he was still not absolutely sure she had not walked in a nightmarethe whole idea was so absurd perhaps in the faint gaslight of the night lamps ordinary water splashed on a dress or even wine might have looked to a frightened imagination like blood above all there was no one who had been stabbed except of course the horrific murder in bloomsburybut there was no reason to believe that had any connection with cardington crescent the other possibility occurring to him even as he walked along the miserable streets towards tortoise lane was that this clarabelle mapes was an abortionist and sybilla had procured her address for tassiethat it was after a hasty illdone operation that charlotte had seen tassies return in the night and what she had mistaken for a look of joy had in fact been a grimace of pain mixed with intense relief at being safe back in her own house and relieved of an intolerable disgrace it was an unpleasant thought and he hoped with surprising depth that this was not true but he knew the frailties of nature well enough to accept that it was not impossible the other answer stemmed from georges affair with sybillawilliam as the wounded husband in spite of eustaces claim that he had wanted to divorce sybilla until he knew of the child but pitt did not believe william march would have killed his unborn child no matter how furious he was at his wifes infidelity and pitt did not yet know how far that had gone it could have been no more than vanity and a stupid exhibition of power or was the child eustaces and not williams at all no if that were so and william knew it surely he would have killed eustace not george and perhaps felt himself justified and there would certainly be many who whatever their public pronouncements would privately agree with him and the pregnancy predated georges arrival at cardington crescent so he could not be blamed by anyone that left emily and jack radley they might have acted either together or separately for love or greedor both emily he refused to think of until there was no other possibility and it was forced upon him and if that happened please god charlotte would know it for herself and he would not have to be the one to tell her he turned the last corner and was in tortoise lane it was as shabby and squalid as the others indistinguishable except to those who understood the labyrinth and could smell and taste in the thick air their own familiar row of crooked jetties and angled roofs there were two grubby children of about four or five years playing with stones outside number pitt stopped and watched them for a moment they had scratched a pattern of squares on the pavement including about ten of the slabs and were skidding the marker stone to a chosen one then doing an elaborate little dance in and out of the squares bending gracelessly on one leg to pick up the stone when they were finished do you know the lady in there pitt pointed to the door of number they looked at him with confusion which lady the bigger one asked are there a lot of ladies yeah do you know mrs mapes mrs mapes the child said soberly course we do do you live in there pitt was surprised he had already half decided it was an abortionist and children did not fit his preconception yeah the older child answered the smaller child was pulling at his sleeve frightened and pitt did not want to get them into trouble for the crumb of information they might be able to give him thank you he smiled touched the childs matted hair and went up to the door he knocked gently afraid that a peremptory rap would sound like authority and perhaps elicit no answer or at best put them on their guard it was opened after a very few moments by a small thin girl who might have been anywhere between twelve and twenty she was wearing a brown stuff dress taken in from several sizes larger a mobcap that held back no more than half her hair and an outsize apron her hands were wet and she carried a kitchen knife obviously pitt had disturbed her at her chores yeah she said with a lift of surprise her eyes washedout china blue already tired is mrs mapes at home pitt inquired yeah the girl swallowed put the knife in her pocket and wiped her hands on her apron yerd better come in turning she led the way through a dark rushmatted corridor past narrow stairs on which sat a child of about seven nursing a baby and holding by the hand an infant just old enough to stand but large families were common what was less so was that so many within a few years of each other should have survived infant mortality was enormous the girl knocked on the last door at the very end of the passage before it turned towards the huge kitchens he could see a dozen yards away come a throaty voice called from inside thank you pitt dismissed the girl and pulled on the handle it opened easily and soundlessly into a sitting room that was almost a parody of old mrs marchs boudoir it was doubly startling for its contrast with the threadbare outside and the other rooms pitt had glimpsed as he passed and for its joke of familiarity the windows looked onto the blind walls of an alley rather than the marchs gracious garden but it was curtained in a similar hectic pink faded even by this mean and dirtfiltered light probably the curtains had hung unmoved for years the mantel was draped as well although in smarter houses fashion had freed the beauty of fine wood or stone from such ornate and destructive prudery a piano was similarly covered and every table was bristling with photographs lamp shades were fringed and knotted and plastered with mottoes home sweet home god sees all and i love you mother seated on the largest pink armchair was a woman of ample fiercely corseted bosom and prodigious hips swathed with a dress that on a woman half the size would really have been quite handsome she had stubby fat hands with strong fingers and on seeing pitt they flew to her face in a gesture of surprise her black hair was thick her black eyes large and shining her nose and mouth predatory mrs mapes pitt asked civilly she waved him to the pink sofa opposite her the seat worn where countless others had sat thats me she agreed an oo are you sir thomas pitt maam he did not yet intend to tell her his office policemen were not welcome in places like st giles and if she had some illegal occupation then she would do everything to hide it probably successfully he was in hostile territory and he knew it she regarded him with an experienced eye seeing immediately that he had little money his shirt was ordinary and far from new his boots were mended but his jacket in spite of its worn elbows and cuffs had originally been of fine cut and his speech was excellent he had taken his lessons with the son of the estate on which his father worked and never lost the timbre or the diction she summed him up as a gentleman on hard times but still considerably better off than herself and perhaps with prospects well mr pitt wot can i do for yer this aint where you live so wot you ere for i was given your address by a mrs sybilla march her black eyes narrowed was yer now well mr pitt me business is confidential like im sure yer understands that i take it for granted mrs mapes he was hoping that if he continued he would learn something from her however tenuous that he might pursue even a clue as to mrs mapess occupation might yield something about sybilla he had not known at least she had not denied the acquaintance course yer do she agreed heartily or yer wouldnt be ere yerself eh she laughed a rich gurgle in her throat and looked at him archly pitt could not remember ever having been quite so revolted he forced an answering smile that must have been sickly ave a cup otea wiv a drop o suffin she invited ere she reached for a grubby bellpull i could do wiv one meself an its only perlite ter keep yer company pitt had not had time to decline when the door opened and yet another girl peered round eyes wide face gaunt this one might have been fifteen yes mrs mapes maam get me a cup o tea dora mrs mapes ordered an you make sure florrie is doin the pertaters fer supper yes mrs mapes maam an bring the good pot mrs mapes called after her then turned back to smile at pitt now wots yer business mr pitt yer can trust me im the soul o discretion she held her finger up to her nose clarabelle mapes ears evrythin an tells nuffin he knew already that if he had hoped to trick her or intimidate her he was foredoomed to failure she was one of lifes survivorsa venturer not a victim behind all the thrusting flesh and the curls and smiles she was as careful as a miser and suspicious as a dog in strange territory he decided to appeal to her greed and at the same time see what effect surprise might have on her guilt he did not imagine but there was a measure of fear deeper than mere caution that would have meaning to her im afraid mrs march is dead he said watching her closely but her face did not alter by a shadow or hairsbreadth of movement wot a shame she said expressionlessly her black eyes meeting his squarely i ope as it wasnt in pain poor thing she didnt go easily he parried but there was not a tremor in her not many of us do she shook her head and the black curls bounced very civil of you ter tell me mr pitt he pressed on therell be a postmortem will there an wots that the doctors will examine her body to decide exactly why she died cut her open if necessary he locked his eyes on hers trying to see inside her to get beyond the gross shining exteriorand failed ow disgustin she said without flinching her sharp curved nose wrinkled a little but the distaste was assumed she had seen infinitely worseanyone who lived in st giles had wouldnt yer think doctorsd ave suffin better ter do than cut up someone as is already dead cant elp er now poor thing be better ter doctor them as is livinnot that thats a lot o use often as not pitt felt he was losing ground rapidly they have to he plunged on something of a mystery about her death that was literally true even if the implication was not often is she nodded again and there was a rap on the door followed by yet another girl of about ten bringing the awaited tea on a painted lacquer tray chipped in several places but in pride of place was a silver teapot which from his experience on robbery detail pitt judged to be genuine georgian the child staggered awkwardly under its weight her spindly arms shaking even as she left again her eyes were fixed hopelessly on the currant cakes on the china plate ave a drop o suffin ter refresh yer mrs mapes offered when the door was closed and fished in a cupboard beside her twisting her huge bulk in the chair till it creaked she brought up an unmarked green glass bottle from which she poured what from the smell could only be gin pitt refused quickly no thank you too early ill just have the tea often is a mystery death she said finishing her previous train of thought please yerself mr pitt and she poured a generous dollop into her own cup before adding tea milk and sugar she passed a goodquality china cup across to pitt and invited him to help himself as he wished but only the rich as gets doctors ter cut them up afterwards stupid i calls it as if slicin up corpuses is goin ter tell anyone the secrets o life an death he gave up on the postmortem obviously it did not frighten her and he was beginning to believe she had no hand in any abortion that could be traced to the march household and yet sybilla had kept her address and there was no conceivable possibility of it being a social acquaintance what did this fearsome woman do to provide for herself he glanced round the room by st giles standards it was comfortable bordering on luxurious and mrs mapes herself all too clearly ate well but the children he had seen looked half starved and were dressed in shabby handmedown clothes illfitting and iller kept you set a good table mrs mapes he began cautiously mr mapes is a fortunate man there aint no mr mapes these ten years she looked at him with brightening eyes then she caught sight of the neat mending on his jacket sleeves and breathed in sharply pinching her nostrils that was a wifes work if ever she saw it died o the flux e did but e thought well o me when e was ere my mistake pitt said immediately i thought with all the children her eyes were hard and her hand tightened very slightly in her fat lap im a soft earted woman mr pitt she said with a guarded smile takes in all sorts to care fer em when they aint got nobody looks after em fer neighbors an cousins an the like always carin fer somebody i am all tortoise lanell tell yer that if theyre honest how commendable pitt could not keep all the sarcasm out of his voice although he tried he was far from finished with mrs mapes there was the beginning of an ugly idea in his mind mr mapes must have left you very well provided for that you have the means and the time to be so charitable her chin came up and her smile widened showing hard yellowwhite teeth thats right mr pitt she agreed thought the world o me did mr mapes pitt put down his cup and remained silent for a moment unable to think of another line of attack she was no longer afraid and he could see it in every curve of her strong bulging body he could smell it in the hot air good o yer ter come all this way ter tell me o mrs marchs death mr pitt she was preparing to dismiss him time was short he had no cause to search the premises and what was he to look for even if he returned with men and a warrant then a lie occurred to him that might work forget her fear try the paramount urge in her charactergreed no more than my duty mrs mapes he replied with only the barest faltering please heaven the metropolitan police would honor the debt he was about to contract mrs march remembered you in her will forservices rendered you would be that clarabelle mapes wouldnt you the caution fighting avarice in her face was grotesquely comical and he waited without interruption while she sought a compromise with herself she let out her breath in a huge gusty sigh her eyes gleamed very good of er im sure you are the right person he persisted you performed some service for her but she was not outmaneuvered so easilyshe had already seen that trap private she said staring at him boldly between ladies as im sure yerll unnerstand and not pry as would be indelicate he allowed a look of doubt to cross his face i have a responsibility yer got my haddress or yer wouldnt be ere she pointed out there aint no clarabelle mapes ere but me i gotta be the right one aint i an i can prove oo i am never you fear wot i done forrer aint none o your business mighta bin no moren a kind word when she needed it in tortoise lane pitt smiled back dourly i aint always bin in tortoise lane she said instantly regretting it she knew she had made a mistake and it was marked in the sudden slackness in her face an alteration in the way she sat i goes out sometimes she said trying to make good the damage not to cardington crescent you dont his confidence was growing although he still had no idea towards what end and youve been here for some time he looked about him certainly since she wrote to you as you pointed out she had this house in her address book this time she really did pale the color blanched from her predatory face leaving the rouge standing on her cheeks the spot on the left cheek an inch higher than the spot on the right she said nothing pitt stood up ill see the rest of the house he announced and went to the door before she could stop him he opened it and went out into the dogleg of the passage walking swiftly towards the kitchens away from the front door one of the girls he had seen before was on her hands and knees on the floor with a bucket of water and a brush she moved out of the way for him the kitchen itself was enormous for a house of this size two rooms knocked into one either deliberately or by a rotten wall collapsing and being removed the floor was wooden scrubbed till the planks were worn uneven nails in little islands humped above grit driven into the cracks two large stoves were covered with a variety of cauldrons and one kettle spouted steam presumably to refresh mrs mapess teapot beside the stoves were scuttles of coal dust and coke refuse close enough for the spindlyarmed girls to lift them and restoke by the far wall sank sacks of grain and potatoes and a bundle of grubby cabbages opposite was a huge dresser decked with dishes and pans and mugs drawers illfitting papers poking out a ball of string partly unwound lay on the floor there was a half wrapped parcel on the kitchen table and a pair of scissors above them winched to the ceiling was an airing rail hung with all manner of ragged clothes and linen collecting the kitchen smells there were three more girls working at various chores one at the sink peeling potatoes one stirring a cauldron of gruel on the stove the third on her hands and knees with a dustpan none of them could have been more than fourteenthe youngest looked more like ten or eleven obviously the establishment was intended to cater to a considerable number of people on a regular basis how many more are there of you he asked before mrs mapes could catch up with him he could hear her skirt swishing and rattling behind him i dunno a whitefaced girl whispered theres all them little ones the babes they comes and goes so i dunno shush the oldest warned fiercely her eyes black with fear pitt did all he could to keep his expression from betraying him now he knew what this place was but he was helpless to change it and if he showed his fury pity or disgust he would only make it worse nature fueled the need and poverty necessitated the answer what do yer want in ere mr pitt mrs mapes demanded from behind him her voice shrill aint nothin ere as as ter do wiv you no nothing at all he agreed grimly without moving there was no point at which he could even begin let alone accomplish anything he would do more harm by starting and yet he was loath to leave ow much she asked what he had no idea what she was talking about his eyes roamed over the cauldrons gruel easy and cheap for the children potatoes to fill out a stew with no meat ow much did mrs march remember me wiv she said impatiently you said as she remembered me he looked at the floor and the large wooden table they were unusually cleanthat at least was something in her favor i dont know i expect it will be sent to you it would depend on what he could persuade out of his superiors he might even forget it altogether aint you got it he did not answer if he did he would have no excuse to remain and there was something at the back of his mind that held him here a sense that there was meaning if only he could find it what could sybilla march possibly have wanted with this woman a child taken for a maidservant in trouble it seemed the only reasonable thing was it worth pursuing following to sybillas house and seeing if any maid there had been unaccountably absent perhaps due to a confinement did it matter life was full of such domestic tragedies girls who had to earn their livings and could not afford to keep a child born out of wedlock and servants hardly ever married precisely for that reason they lived in their masters houses where there was no room for families mrs mapess voice grated behind him then yerd best be abaht yer business an leave me ter mine he turned slowly looking over the room for a last time then he realized what it was that held him the parcelthe brown paper parcel on the kitchen table half tied next to the scissors he had seen that paper that curious yellow string before tied lengthways and widthways twice knotted at each join and tied with a loop and two raw ends suddenly he was ice cold as if a breath from a charnel house had crawled over his skin he remembered the blood and the flies the fat woman with her bustle crooked and her bulgingeyed dog it was too much to be a coincidence the paper was common but the string was unusual the knots eccentric characteristic the combination surely unique they were at least a mile and a half from bloomsbury what of this small parcel wrapped in the off cuts where was the first parcel the larger one he could see it nowhere in the kitchen im going he said aloud surprised by the sound of his own voice yes mrs mapes ill bring the money myself now that i know its you when she smiled again oblivious of the parcel on the table and its knots i wanter make sure as im in like she added in explanation as if it could mask her eagerness tomorrow he replied sooner if i get back to my offices in time he must get one of these children alone and ask them about the parcelswhere they went to how often and who carried them but it must be away from here where she could not overhear or the childs life would be imperiled have you got someone reliable wholl deliver a message for me someone you trust yourself he asked she weighed the advantages against the disadvantages and decided in his favor i got nellie shell do it fer yer she said grudgingly wot is it confidential he answered ill tell her outside then ill be back as soon as i can you may rest assured of that mrs mapes nellie she shrieked at the full power of her lungs the blast of it shivered the china on the dresser there was a moments silence then the wail of a wakened baby somewhere upstairs a clatter of feet and nellie appeared at the doorway hair straggling apron awry eyes frightened yes mrs mapes maam go wiv vis gennelman and do is errand fer im mrs mapes ordered then come back ere an get on wiv yer work theres no food in this life fer them as does no work no mrs mapes maam nellie bobbed a half curtsy and turned to pitt she must have been about fifteen although she was so thin and underdeveloped it was hard to be sure thank you mrs mapes pitt said hating her as he had hated few people in his life aware that perhaps it was only a vent for his rage against poverty itself she was a creature of her time and place should he hate her for surviving those who died did so only because they had not her strength and yet he still hated her he went past her to the corridor along its dank rushmatted thinness past the children still sitting on the stairs and out of the front room into tortoise lane nellie a step behind him he walked till he was round the corner and out of sight of number wots yer errand mister nellie asked when they stopped do you often run errands for mrs mapes yes mister yer can trust me knows me way round ere good do you take parcels for her yes an i aint never lost one yer can trust me mister i do trust you nellie he said gently wishing to god he could do something about her and knowing he could not if he did it would be misunderstood and probably frighten and confuse her did you take the big parcel from the kitchen table her eyes widened mrs mapes told me ter honest im sure she did he said quickly did you take several parcels for her about three weeks ago i aint done nuffin wrong mister i jus took em where she said now she was beginning to be frightened his questions made no sense to her i know that nellie he said quietly where was that around here and in bloomsbury her eyes widened no mister i took em to mr wiggelike always he let out his breath slowly then take me to mr wigge nellie take me there now nellie led pitt through a maze of cramped alleys and steps till they came to a small squalid yard stacked with old furnituremuch of it mildewed and wormeatenbits and pieces of old crockery and scraps of fabric that not even the ragpickers would have bothered with at the far side beyond the illbalanced piles and heaps was the entrance down to a large cellar this is were i brung em nellie said looking up at pitt anxiously i swear it mister who did you give them to he asked staring round and seeing no one mr wigge she pointed to the steps down to the dark gaping cellar come and show me he requested please reluctantly she picked her way through the rubbish to the edge of the stair descending slowly at the bottom she turned and knocked on the wooden door which stood open on rusted hinges her hands made hardly any sound mr wigge sir a scrawny old man appeared almost immediately clad in a filthy jacket pockets torn by the weight of the junk he had piled in them over the years trousers splashed with all manner of ordure he wore fingerless mittens on his hands in spite of the warmth of the day and on his thin uncut hair was a shiny black stovepipe hat completely unmarked it might have left the hatters shop an hour since his lanternjawed face split in an anticipatory leer and he squinted up at pitt mr wigge pitt inquired the old man bowed jerkily it was an affectation of gentility he liked septimus wigge at your service sir ow may i elp yer i got a lovely brass bedstead i got a dancin lady in real porcelain ill come in and take a look pitt had a premonition of disappointment if clarabelle mapes had simply been selling off household goods her own or others to raise a little money it was not worth pursuing and yet the knots had been peculiar identical to those on that terrible parcel in the churchyard and all the others what should he do about nellie if he sent her back to tortoise lane would she tell mrs mapes what he had asked her and where she had taken him he did not hold much hope that she would hold out against mrs mapess inquisition if she were suspicious nellie lived in a cocoon of hunger and fear and yet if he kept her with him what could he do with her tortoise lane was her homeprobably all she knew he had already committed her she knew about the parcels and if clarabelle mapes had tied those bloody and dreadful ones as well as the innocent one nellies life was imperiled if she returned and told how she had led pitt to septimus wigge he had to keep her nellie come in with me and help me look i darent mister she shook her head i got chores ill be in trouble if i dont get ome in time mrs mapesll be that cross wi me not if you go back with the money from mrs march he argued shes in a hurry for that nellie looked doubtful she was more afraid of the immediate than the problematical her imagination did not stretch that far pitt did not have time to argue she was used to obedience its an order nellie he said briskly you stay with me mrs mapes will be angry if her money is delayed he turned to the waiting mannow mr wigge ill take a look at these brass beds of yours very reasonable sir very reasonable wigge turned and led the way inside the cellar it was larger than pitt had expected higherceilinged and stretching back into the recesses of the building against one wall there was a large furnace with a metal door hanging open sending heat out into the stone spaces and in spite of the mildness of the day its warmth was agreeable under the ground level where there was no sunlight the old man showed him several fine brass bedsteads a few pieces of quite good china and several other odds and ends in which pitt affected to be interested all the time peering and searching finding nothing beyond what might or might not be stolen goods but while haggling with him over a small green glass vase he eventually bought for charlotte he did make a very close observation of mr septimus wigge himself by the time he left still followed by nellie he could have described mr wigge so closely an artist could have drawn him from the soles of his appalling boots up to the crown of his immaculate hat and every feature of his smirking face he took his leave holding the vase taking nellie with him he had no choice he must forget about sybilla whose connection with clarabelle mapes he could not understand and very probably was coincidental and had nothing to do with her murder he must go back to the bloomsbury churchyard now that he knew who he was looking for and try all the residents and habitues to see if even one of them could place septimus wigge there three weeks ago it could be a long task first he must find a safe place to leave nellie where mrs mapes would not discover her it was after two and they had not eaten are you hungry nellie he asked only out of politeness from the childs hollow eyes and the sunken slack quality of her flesh he knew she was always hungry yes mister she did not sound surprised that he should ask she obviously believed him sufficiently eccentric to do anything so am i lets have luncheon i aint got nuffin this time she looked at him anxiously youve been a great help to me nellie i think youve earned luncheon she was fifteen quite old enough to understand patronage and she did not deserve it she had little enough dignity and he was determined not to seduce that from her nor would he question her yet about the house in tortoise lane he knew what it was he did not need to lead her into betraying it i know a very good public house where theyll give us fresh bread and cold meat and pickle and pudding she did not yet believe it thank you mister she said her expression unchanged the pub he had in mind was only half a mile away and they walked to it in silence quite companionable for his part as soon as he went in the landlord recognized him he was a moderately lawabiding citizen most of the time and that area of his business which was questionable pitt left alone it was to do with game bought from poachers the occasional avoidance of excise taxes on tobacco and similar goods and a great deal of judicious blindness pitt was concerned with murder afternoon mr tibbs he said cheerfully afternoon mr pitt sir tibbs came hurrying towards him wiping his hands on the sides of his trousers eager to keep on the right side of the law luncheon for yer mr pitt sir got a luvly piece o muttonor a good cheshire or a double gloucester an me best pickle mrs tibbss own put it up last summer an its proper tasty whatll it be mutton mr tibbs pitt replied for me and the lady and a jar of ale each and then pudding and tibbs there are some very unpleasant people who might come looking for the lady to do her harm id like you to keep her safe for a while shes a good little worker when shes fed find her a place out of sight in your kitchens she can sleep by the stove it wont be for long unless you decide to keep her shell earn her way tibbs looked doubtfully at nellies skinny little body and pinched face wots she done he asked giving pitt a narrow look seen something she shouldnt pitt replied immediately all right tibbs said reluctantly but youll answer fer anythin she takes mr pitt you feed her properly and dont beat her pitt agreed and ill answer for her honesty and if i dont find her here when i come back for her youll answer with a lot more than money are we understood its a favor im doin yer mr pitt tibbs wanted to make sure he was laying up future repayment it is pitt conceded i dont forget much mr tibbsgood or bad ill get yer mutton tibbs disappeared satisfied pitt and nellie sat down at one of the small tables he with relief she gingerly still confused why yer talkin abaht me wiv im fer she asked screwing up her face and staring at him a trace of fear in her eyes because im going to leave you here to work in his kitchen he answered youre not safe in tortoise lane till ive finished learning what i have to mrs mapesll turn me aht she was really frightened now ill ave nowhere ter go you can stay here he leaned forward nellie youve learned something you shouldnt im a policeman a rozzer do you know what happens to people who know secrets they shouldnt she nodded silently she knew they vanished she had lived fifteen years in st giles she understood the laws of survival very well you a rozzer honest you aint got no cape ner elmet ner one o them little lights i used to have now i only deal with big important crimes and i have some of the rozzers with helmets to work for me tibbs brought their food himself crusty bread thick slices of cold saddle of mutton and rich dark pickle two mugs of ale and two portions of spotted dicksteamed pudding thick with currants nellie was speechless when a full half of it was placed in front of her pitt only hoped she would not be sick with the unaccustomed wealth of it he might have been wiser to give her shrunken stomach a little at first but there was no time and he was hungry himself eat as much as you want he said graciously but dont feel you have to finish it therell be more tonight and tomorrow nellie simply stared at him he collected a constable from the local beat and coopted him into going from one door to another yet again all afternoon they worked the areas within five hundred yards of where the hideous parcels had been foundfirst in the approaches to the bloomsbury churchyard then closer to the outskirts of st giles where the later discoveries were made he had given the constable a precise description of septimus wigge both his person and the clothes he had seen him wearing in his cellar storehouse by six oclock in the evening they met again at the churchyard gate well pitt asked although the answer mattered little he already had what he needed he had been too impatient too angry to be subtle but in spite of his unusual clumsiness he had found a footman who had been up early returning from an assignation and had seen a scraggy lanternjawed old man in a stovepipe hat a hundred yards from the church hurrying along pushing a small handcart with one fairly large parcel in it he had not mentioned it at the time of the torsos discovery because he did not wish to admit being out it would almost certainly mean his dismissal from his position and he had thought the old man merely a peddlar probably with something stolen to be about at such an hour it was too early even for costers in from the outlying districts with vegetables or up from the docks or the river with winkles eels or other such delicacies but pitt had bullied him into believing that to hide such knowledge now would make him accomplice to the murder and that was infinitely worse than losing a position over a bit of flirtation with a housemaid a mile away and he had also chanced on a prostitute further toward st giles where one of the gruesome parcels a leg had been found now that he could describe septimus wigge so precisely he knew what to ask and after several girls he came upon one who had seen him with his handcart she remembered the fine stovepipe hat its sheen gleaming in the moonlight as he turned the corner she had noticed it then but not considered the three paperandstringwrapped parcels in his cart and there had been othersmen he would not like to call to a witness stand but nonetheless all helping to seal the certainty a squinteyed little fence who had been keeping an eye open for dealers a pimp in a knife fight over one of his whores and a burglar busy starglazing a window to break into a house two the constable answered he was good at his job and knew the crime but he had not pitts anger and had been more circumspect in his threats he looked disappointed feeling he had let down his superior not much use in court a ratfaced little magsman coming home after a night cheating at cards and a twelveyearold snakesman thin as a wire on his way to climb in through someones back windows and let his master in i know where to find them both again what did they see pitt was not disconcerted no citizen would be about respectable business at that time of night in st giles except perhaps a priest or a midwife and the first was little wished for the second little afforded god knew how many children died at the moment of birth through dirt and ignorance and their mothers with them a spindly old man with scruffy hair under a shiny stovepipe hat wheeling a handcart and hurrying the constable answered the snakesman certainly saw him coming out of the alley where the head was found good then well go and arrest septimus wigge pitt replied decisively but we cant call them to a court the constable protested running a step or two to keep up with him no judge in london will take their word wont need to pitt replied i dont think wigge killed the woman he simply disposed of the parcels if we arrest him and frighten the living daylights out of him hell tell us who didalthough im pretty sure i know but i want him to swear it the constable understood little of what pitt was referring to but he was satisfied if pitt was they strode rapidly along the narrow refusestrewn streets past sweatshops tenements and huddles of collapsing houses beggars stood idle or sat in doorways children labored in endless dreary jobs picking rags running errands stealing from pockets or barrows women begged toiled and drank pitt made only one wrong turn before finding septimus wigges cellar again with its piles of junk and its furnace he told the constable to wait out of sight while he made sure the old man was in and that there was no back way out for him to escape through a warren of passages heaven knew where he walked smartly across the yard and down the steps keeping as quiet as he could he came upon the old man going through a box of spoons his head bent to pore over them a huge smile on his face glad to find you in mr wigge pitt said softly waiting till he was within a yard before he spoke wigge jerked up startled and amazed until he saw it was a customer his face ironed out and he smiled with brown irregular teeth more missing than present well sir an wot can i do for yer this time i got some luvly siller spoons ere i daresay but i dont want them at the moment he moved to stand between wigge and the back of the shop the constable should be at the top of the steps and would prevent escape that way wotcher want then i got all kinds o fings have you got any brown paper parcels with bits of a womans body in them wigges face went slack bloodless with terror so the gray dirt stood out on it in smears he tried to speak and his voice failed his throat contracted his larynx bobbed up and down he gulped choked and gulped again the smell of sweat was strong in the close hot air that aint ffunny he said hoarsely trying desperately to control the panic racing through him it aint ffunny at all i know pitt agreed i found one of them the upper half of the torso to be precise soaked with blood did you have a mother mr wigge wigge wanted to take offense but the power did not reach his lips course i did he said wretchedly no call ffer i he subsided staring at pitt in mesmerized horror she had a child pitt answered gripping his skinny shoulder that woman whose body you hacked to pieces and dropped around i didnt wigge wriggled under pitts hand and his voice rose so high and shrill it was painful to hear swelpme gawd i didnt you gotta blieve me i didnt kill er i dont believe you pitt lied badly if you didnt kill her you wouldnt have cut her up and distributed her round half of london i didnt kill er she were already dead i swear wigge was so terrified pitt was afraid he might have a seizure and pass out altogether even die he modified his expression to one of dawning interest come on wigge if she was dead and you didnt kill her why would you slash her to bits and wrap her up and put the parcels round in the middle of the night and dont try to deny thatweve got at least seven people who saw you and will swear to it took us a little while but weve got them now i can arrest you this minute and take you to newgate or coldbath fields no the little man shrieked and squirmed glaring up at pitt with a mixture of fury and impotence im an old man them placesd kill me there aint no decent food an the jail feverd kill me it would maybe pitt said dispassionately but theyll probably top you before that you dont always get jail fever immediately its only a few weeks before a hanging gawd elp me i didnt kill er so why did you cut up the body and get rid of it pitt persisted i didnt he squealed i didnt cut er up she come that way i swear ter gawd why did you put her all round bloomsbury and st giles pitt glanced at the furnace why didnt you burn her you must have known wed find her in a churchyard really wigge not very clever course i knew yerd find er yer fool a shadow of his old contempt came back quickly erased by the terror crawling in his belly but adult bones dont burn awaynot even in an ole ouse afire let alone a furnace like mine pitt felt sick but infant bones do of course he said very quietly he gripped wigges shoulder so hard he could feel the scrawny flesh crumple under his hands and the hard flat old bones grind together underneath but wigge was too terrified to scream wigge nodded i never took a live one i swear ter gawd i just got rid o them as ad died poor little things suffocated or starved pitt looked at him as one might the germs of some disease i dunno i just done it fer a favor im innocent the words a blasphemy from you pitt shook him till his feet lifted off the ground and his boots jittered on the floor you knew this wasnt a child did you open the parcels to see no stop urtin me yer breakin me bones two o them parcels was all over blood when i went to put em in the fire fair gave me a turn it did near killed me wiv me eart twas then i knew as i ad ter get rid o them cant bear things like that and i dont want nuffin ter do wiv em not keepin em ere in my furnace for the pigs ter find if they do me over fer loot i gets some very good fings in ere i do it was a grotesque moment for such perverse pride real gold and siller sometimes so you didnt want to keep the bones in your furnace pitt said viciously very wise we pigs take nastily to things like thatit needs a lot of explaining in fact as much as dumping bits of corpse round bloomsbury his grip tightened so hard wigge practically lifted himself off the ground again by his contortions to free himself without actually fighting back where did they come from i i er im going to hang somebody for it pitt said between his teeth if it isnt whoever sent you those parcels then youll do i didnt kill er it was clarabelle mapes swear ter gawd number three tortoise lane shes a baby farmer advertises fer infants to raise illegitimate and the like says as shell raise em as er own if shes paid right fer their keep only sometimes they dies proper weakly infants is i jus get rid o the corpuses for er cant afford no burials were poor ere in st giles you know that youll swear to that before the judge clarabelle mapes sent you those parcels yeah yeah ill swear its gawds truth swelpme it is good i believe you however i wouldnt want you disappearing when i need you and its a crime to dispose of a human body even if it is dead so ill take you in charge anyway constable the constable appeared down the steps his face pale rubbing the sweat off his hands on his trouser legs yes mr pitt sir take mr septimus wigge to the station and charge him with disposing of a corpse illegally and see that you hold on to him tight hes a witness against a murderessprobably the murderess of a great many children although well never prove that be careful constable hes a wriggly little bastard youd best cuff him i will sir i certainly will the constable pulled his manacles out from under his coat and fastened them on wigges bony wrists now you come along o me an any trouble an ill ave ter be rough wiv yer an we wouldnt want that now would we mr wigge wigge gave a screech of alarm and the constable hoisted him up the stairs with marked lack of gentleness leaving pitt alone in the cellar the air suddenly seemed heavy acrid with the smell of uncounted tiny bodies burning in the hot gray furnace he felt overpowered by it sick he collected two more constables from the nearest station just in case mrs mapes were not alone and should put up some sort of struggle she was a big woman and pitt judged something of a fighter it would be foolish to go to tortoise lane alone to search that large house where there might well be male employees or dependents as well as at least half a dozen girls that he knew of plus an unspecified number of infants it was after seven by the time he stood on the sloping pavement again and knocked on the heavy door one constable was half hidden in an alley a dozen feet away another in the street roughly parallel where pitt judged the back entrance would open he lifted his hand and knocked once then again it was several minutes before it opened at first only a crack but as the child saw who it was and recognized him from the morning it swung all the way back it was the girl he had seen on the stairs with the infants may i see mrs mapes he stepped in then stopped remembering he must not show his anger or he would betray himself and perhaps lose her please yes sir come this way sir she turned and walked along the corridor her feet bare and dirty we bin expectin yer she did not look back or notice that the other constable had followed pitt in and closed the door at the end of the passage she came to the overfurnished sitting room where pitt had been in the morning and knocked tentatively come mrs mapess voice called loudly wot is it mrs mapes maam theres the gennelman wivva money ere ter see yer maam send im in her voice softened noticeably send im in girl thank you pitt moved past the girl into the sitting room closing the door so mrs mapes would not see the constable pass on his way to the kitchen and the back door to let in his companion they had orders to search the house mrs mapes was in a puce dress stretched tight over her jutting bosom and her voluminous skirts filled the entire chair with taffeta that rustled every time she breathed that she corseted her flesh into such a relentlessly feminine shape was a monument to her vanity and her endurance of acute and persistent discomfort her fat fingers were bright with rings and her ears dangled with gold under the black ringlets her face gleamed with delight when she saw pitt he noticed there was a tray in a space cleared for it on the sideboard a decanter of wine madeira from the depth of the color and two glasses the price of which if they were as good as they looked would have fed the entire household for a fortnight on better than the gruel they were getting at the moment well mr pitt sir you were asty an no mistake she said with a broad smile makes me think yer was awantin ter come back yer got my money ave yer she was so normal so guilelessly greedy he had to force to his mind the memory of the bloody parcels the fact that she regularly wrapped in paper the corpses of infants taken in trust into her care and sent them to septimus wigge to dispose of in his furnace how many of them had died of natural causes how many of starvation and disease brought about by neglect how many had she actively murdered he would never know still less prove but she was an abomination ive just been to see a friend of yours he answered sidestepping the question or perhaps i should say an associate in business i dont ave no associates she said carefully some of the glisten dying from her face though there are some asd like ter be this is one who does favors for you now and thenand no doubt you reward him for it i pays me way she agreed cautiously no time fer them as doesnt life aint like that a mr septimus wigge for a moment she was still as stone then she caught her breath and continued as though nothing had affected her well if i got suffin off im as was stolen i bought it honest i didnt know the little weasel was bent i wasnt thinking of goods mrs mapes so much as services pitt said distinctly e dont do nobody no service her mouth sloped downwards in disgust he does you a considerable service he corrected her still standing and keeping himself carefully between her and the door he only failed you once her fat hands beside her monstrous skirt were clenched but her eyes were still defiant she stared up at him her face heavy he did not burn the body of the woman you sent him wrapped up in the usual parcels which he expected to be babies who had died in your care by the time he came to put the parcels in his furnace the blood had soaked through so he undid one and discovered what it really was adult bones dont burn that easily mrs mapesnot like those of a small child it takes a very great heat to destroy a human thighbone or a skull wigge knew that and he didnt want to be left with those in his furnace so he dropped the parcels as far away from himself as he could carry them alone in one night he thought he would be safe and he very nearly was she was pale beneath her rouge but she had not yet realized just how much he knew her body was tight hard under the straining taffeta and her hands shook a little so little he could barely see it if es killed some woman its nuffin ter do wiv mean if e says it is es a liar you go an arrest im dont come around ere bullyin me you dont look like no naffin rozzerusually i can smell em e aint murdered nobody from ere so get on wiv yer business an leave me alonecept fer mrs marchs money i dont suppose yer got that eh there is no money you lyin bastard her voice rose shrilly and she lurched forward out of the chair to stand opposite him eyes blazing yer lyin son of a bitch yer bleedin swine her hands came up as if she would strike him but she recollected herself in time she was a big woman vastly heavy but short pitt was a good deal taller than she and strong it was not worth the risk you lied she repeated incredulously thats right he agreed at first i simply wanted to find out what you knew about mrs march then i saw the parcel on the kitchen table and recognized the paper and the knots you wrapped the parcels that the pieces of the body were found in not septimus wigge he says he got them from you and we believe him clarabelle mapes i am arresting you for the murder of the woman whose body was found in the churchyard of st marys in bloomsbury and dont be foolish enough to fight mei have two other constables in the house she stared at him a succession of emotions in her face fear horror disbelief and finally hardening resolution she was not yet beaten yer right she conceded grudgingly she died ere but it werent no murder it were in defense o meself an yer cant ardly blame me fer that a womans entitled ter save erself her voice grew more confident ill ignore yer charges against meself an me work carin fer infants wot their muvvers cant keep cos they aint married or already got moren they can feed its a wicked charge iggerant of all i do fer em she saw the look on pitts face and hurried on but i ad no choice or itd be me lyin dead on the floor so help me gawd come at me like a mad thing she did she looked up at pitt first through her lashes then more boldly pitt waited wanted one o the babes some women is like that lorst one of er own an come ere ter get another like they was new dresses or suffin well o course i couldnt give er one why not pitt asked icily i would have thought youd be only too pleased to find a good home for an orphan save you working yourself to the bone and stinting yourself to care for it anymore she ignored his sarcasm she could not afford to retaliate but the anger was there in her eyes hot and black them children is in my care mr pitt an she didnt want jus any one oh no she wanted a particlar oneone ass mother was aht o means temporary like an jus avin me care for er little girl till she was better placed an when this woman goes off er ead an insists on avin this one babe an no other i ad ter refuse er well she flew at me like a mad thing i ad ter defend meself or sheda cut me throat oh yes what with wiv a knife o course we was in the kitchen an she snatched up a carvin knife orff the table an went at me well i ad ter fight fer me life an i did it was a sort o haccident she got killedi merely meant ter save meself like any person would so you cut her up and wrapped her in parcels which you took to septimus wigge to burn pitt said bitingly why was that seems like a lot of unnecessary trouble you got a cruel tongue mr pitt she was gaining confidence an a nasty mind cause i couldnt take the risk o you bleedin rozzers not believin mejust like you dont now sort o proves i was right dont it absolutely mrs mapes i dont believe a word of itexcept that you probably did stick the kitchen knife into her and killed her and then carried on with the knife and maybe a cleaver as well yer may not believe me mr pitt she put her hands on her hips but theres nuffin as you can prove its my word gainst yours and no court in lunnons goin ter ang a woman on the misbelief o one o your kind an thats a fact she was right and it was a bitter taste to swallow i shall still charge you with disposing of the body he said flatly and youll go down for a nice stretch for that she let out a coarse expletive of denial alf the poor doesnt tell the pigs o every death in places like st giles peoples dyin all the time then why didnt you simply have her buried like all these others youre talking about because she was knifed o course fool wot priest is goin ter bury a woman as as bin knifed an she didnt come from st giles she was a stranger ere thered a bin questions but the laws the sameif yer charge me wiv that yerve gotta charge all the others i reckon when the judge ears ow she came at me an ow terrible sorry i was when she haccidentallike fell on the knife erself in the struggle ell unnerstand why i lorst me ead an got rid of er well well find out mrs mapes i promise you he said bitterly because youll have your chance to tell him he raised his voice constable immediately the door opened and the burlier of the two constables came in yes sir stay here with mrs mapes and see she doesnt leavefor anything shes a rare one with a knifehas accidents in which people who threaten her end up carved in little bits and dropped in parcels round half of london so watch yourself yes sir the mans face hardened he knew st giles and not much surprised him ill take good care of er sir shell be ere safe as ouses when yer gets back good pitt went out into the corridor and along to the kitchen there were five girls sitting round the other constable in their midst he stood up as pitt came in and the girls did too out of habit towards adultsnot from respect but from fear pitt wandered in and sat casually on the edge of the big central wooden table and one by one the girls resumed their seats huddled together mrs mapes has told me a young woman came here about three weeks ago wanting a baby girl and became very upset when she couldnt have a particular one does anybody remember that their faces were blank eyes wide she was nicelooking he went on trying to keep the anger out of his voice the rasping edge of desperation he had never wanted to convict anyone more than clarabelle mapes and she would escape him if he did not prove murder the story of selfdefense he was almost sure was a complete fiction but it was not impossible a jury might believe it his superiors would know that as much as clarabelle herself she might never even be charged the thought burned like acid inside him seldom had he given in to personal hatred in his work but this time he could not suppress it if he was honest with himself he was no longer trying please think he urged she was young and quite tall with fair hair and a pretty skin she didnt come from round here one of the girls nudged the girl next to her avoiding pitts eyes fanny she whispered tentatively fanny looked at the floor pitt knew what troubled her had he been a child in mrs mapess care he would not have dared risk her anger mrs mapes told me she came here he said gently i believe her but it would help if someone else could remember he waited fanny twisted her fingers together and breathed deeply someone coughed i remember er mister fanny said at last she came ter the door an i let er in she shook her head she werent from ereshe were all andsome and clean but terrible upset she was when she couldnt ave the little girl said as she were er own but mrs mapes said she were mad poor thing what little girl pitt asked do you know which one yes mister i remember cos she was real pretty all fair air and such a smile called er faith they did pitt took a deep breath what happened to her he said so quietly he had to repeat it she were adopted mister a lady wiv no children come and took er i see and was this young woman who asked after faith still upset when she left here dunno mister none of us saw er go pitt tried to make his voice sound casual gentle so as not to frighten her but he knew the edge was still there did she tell you her name fanny fannys face remained glazed her eyes faraway pitt looked at the floor willing her to remember clenching his hands inside his pockets where she could not see prudence fanny said clearly she said as er name were prudence wilson i let er in an told mrs mapes as she was ere mrs mapes sent me back ter aks er business and what was her business pitt was buoyed up by a surge of hope and yet at the same time giving a name to the hideously used corpse learning of her loves and hopes made her death so much deeper an offense fanny shook her head i dunno mister she wouldnt say cept to mrs mapes and mrs mapes didnt tell you no pitt stood up thats fine thank you fanny stay here and look after the little ones the constable will stay too oo are yer mister an wots appenin the eldest girl asked with her face screwed up they were frightened of change it usually meant the loss of something the beginning of new struggle pitt would like to have thought this time would be different but he could not delude himself they were too young to earn their way in any legal occupationnot that there were many for women except domestic service for which they had no references sweatshops barely afforded survival and without clarabelle mapes to connive and cheat monthly money out of desperate women on the pretense of minding children they were unable to keep themselves there was no means to support this present group of infants in tortoise lane it would probably mean the workhouse for most of them he did not know whether to lie to them and keep fear at bay a little longer or if that only added to the patronage the robbery of dignity in the end cowardice won he had simply worn out all the emotion he had im a policeman and until ive made a few more calls i dont know for certain whats happening ive got to discover more about prudence wilson fanny did she say where she came from fanny shook her head no never mind ill find out he went to the door giving the constable instructions to remain there until he returned or sent relief outside in tortoise lane he walked smartly towards bloomsbury it was the obvious place to begin it was a reasonable assumption that prudence wilson had walked to the nearest such place as mrs mapess that she lived in at her own employment as housemaid or parlormaid as the police surgeon had suggested therefore pitt went to the bloomsbury police station and by ten past eight he was facing a tired and shorttempered sergeant who had been on his feet all day and was so thirsty for a pint of ale he could taste dust in his mouth yes sir he said without raising his eyes from the enormous ledger in front of him where he was writing in a careful copperplate hand the details of a charge of vandalizing a fence brought against a small boy inspector pitt metropolitan police pitt said formally to give the man time to correct his attitude accordingly not ere sir dont belong to this station ive eard of im does murders an the like try bow street sir if they dont ave im they maybe know oo as pitt smiled wearily this pedestrian misunderstanding had a kind of sanity about it that was vaguely comforting i am inspector pitt sergeant he replied and i am here about a murder i would be obliged for your attention if you please the sergeant blushed a hot pink and stood up smartly not even wincing as he banged the toe of his boot against the chair leg aggravating his corns he faced pitt with wide eyes inarticulate with apology i am looking for record of a miss prudence wilson probably a maid in domestic service maybe in this area i am hoping she has been reported missing about three or four weeks ago does the name sound familiar to you people dont usually report ousemaids missin mr pitt sir the sergeant shook his head terrible suspicious in their thoughts people isand usually right too thinks theys run off wiv some man an like as not they ave an he let the sentiment remain unexpressed it was indiscreet personally he wished them luck his own marriage was a happy one and he would not willingly have seen anyone bound to a life of service in someone elses house rather than having their own but could a bin he showed his agreeability by going for the ledger where such things were noted and pulling it out dutifully he turned it back four weeks and began to read forward after six pages he stopped with his finger on an entry he looked up at pitt his eyes surprised and sad yes sir ere it is young man by the name o arry croft came an says as she was is betrothed an shed gone ter fetch er little girl from someone as was keepin er lookin after er like an never came back terrible upset e was sure as somethin ad appened to er since they was ter be married and she was real appy about it but o course we couldnt do nuffin young women dont ave ter be found by a man they aint married ter aint daughters of and aint employed by not as if they dont want ter an we didnt know different as shed gone off on er own with the little girl no pitt agreed it was fair and even if they had known by then it was already too late no of course you couldnt the sergeant swallowed is she dead sir yes the sergeant did not take his eyes from pitts face was shewas she the body wot was found inin the parcels sir yes sergeant the sergeant gulped again ave you got the man wot done it mr pitt it was a woman and yes weve got her im going to charge her now and take her in im off duty any minute now sirid thank yer dearly if i could come along with yer sir please certainly i may need an extra man shes a big woman and there are a lot of children to be taken somewherei suppose the workhouse yes sir by the time they were back in tortoise lane it was fifteen minutes to nine it was still a clear evening and at this highsummer time of the year there was another hour of daylight and twenty minutes beyond that of fading dusk while the color slowly ebbed away and the shadows joined themselves together into a solidity broken only by the gas lamps on the main streets and the occasional lantern or candle in st giles they stopped outside number and pitt went in without knocking there was no sense of triumph he felt only a vindictiveness uncharacteristic of him he strode along the corridor to mrs mapess sitting room and threw the door open the constable was still standing as uncomfortable as when he had left and mrs mapes was sitting in her own chair her taffeta skirt spread round her her black ringlets shining and a satisfied smile on her mouth well mr pitt she said boldly wot now eh yer goin ter stand ere all night no none of us are going to be here all night he replied in fact i doubt if we shall ever be here again clarabelle mapes i arrest you for the murder of prudence wilson when she came to collect her child whom you had sold for an instant she was still prepared to brazen it out why why should i kill er on purpose dont make no sense because she threatened to make your trade public he said bitterly youve killed too many babies entrusted to you rather than feed them youd go out of business if that was known this time she was shaken sweat stood out on her upper lip and across her brow her skin was suddenly gray as the blood drained from it right constable pitt commanded bring her along he turned and went out of the door again and along the passage to the kitchens constable wyman ill send someone to relieve you get these children cared for tonight tomorrow well have to inform the parish authorities you takin er away sir yesfor murder shell not be back suddenly there was a cry from the front of the house the thud of a body landing heavily and then yells of outrage pitt spun on his heel and charged out in the passageway the constable was scrambling to his feet dusty and with rushes sticking to him his helmet in his hand and through the open door were disappearing the coattails of the sergeant shes away the constable shouted furiously she it me he ran out with pitt on his heels and fast overtaking him already twenty yards down tortoise lane clarabelle mapes was running with surprising fleetness for one so immensely stout pitt ignored the sergeant and sprinted as hard as he could after her scattering into the gutter an old woman with a bundle of rags and a coster returning for his supper if he lost her now he might never get her back the warrens and mazes of the london slums could hide a fugitive for years if they were cunning enough and had enough to lose by capture there was no point in shouting it would only waste his breath no one stopped a thief in st giles she was still moving with the speed of terror and even as he watched she turned sharply and disappeared into an open doorway had he been ten yards further off he could not have told which one he charged in after her knocking into an old man and seeing him collapse with a shower of abuse but he had no feeling left for anyone but the gross figure of clarabelle mapes black curls flying taffeta skirts like brilliant overblown sails he followed her through a room he dimly saw was filled with people bent over a table ran along a dark passage where his feet echoed and out into the beersour space of a sawduststrewn taproom she swung round and glared at him her black eyes venomous and knocked aside a serving girl sending her sprawling onto the floor covered in the ale she had been carrying pitt was forced to hesitate to avoid falling over her his feet entangled in her thrusting legs as it was he tripped over a stool and all but measured his length catching hold of the doorframe just in time to steady himself there was a roar of laughter behind him and another clatter as the sergeant appeared buttons undone helmet askew out of the front door past a knot of idlers pitt saw her still running swiftly towards a side alley opposite no more than a slit in the gray walls between houses she was going deeper into the labyrinth of sweatshops gin mills and tenements and if he did not catch her soon she would find a hundred natural allies and he would be lucky if he returned at all let alone having captured her at the end of the alley was a flight of steps down into a wide illlit room where women sat sewing by oil lamps clarabelle had no care whom she spilled onto the floor whose shirts she tore or sent flying into the dust and pitt could not afford to look either outraged cries rang in his ears at the far side the door caught him in the chest and checked him for a moment knocking the breath out of his lungs but he was too hot in pursuit to care about pain his mind was filled and possessed with the hunger to capture her to feel her physically under his hand and to force her to walk ahead of him hands manacled behind her drenched in the knowledge she was on the last length of the unalterable journey towards the gallows in the areaway three old women shared a bottle of gin and a child played with two stones help clarabelle mapes shouted piercingly stop im es after me but the old women were too rubberlegged and blearyeyed to respond as she wanted and pitt jumped over them without their offering any serious resistance he was gaining on clarabelle another few yards at this pace and he would catch her his legs were far longer and he had no skirts to trammel him but she was among her own kind now and she knew the way the next door was slammed in his face and would not open when he pushed it he was obliged to hurl his weight against it bruising his shoulder it was not till the sergeant caught up with him that they were able to force it together the room beyond was dimly lit and packed with humanity of all ages and both sexes the smell of sweat stale food and animal grime caught in his throat they ran through leaping and kicking at sprawled bodies and out of the far door into a crumbling street so narrow the jettied upper stories almost met the open drain down the middle was crusted with dry sewage a score of squat doorwaysshe might have gone into any one of them all the doors were closed there were huddles of people already half asleep or sodden with drink propped up here and there none of them took the slightest notice of him or the sergeant except one old man who watching the situation yelled encouragement to pitt imagining him the fugitive he threw an empty bottle at the sergeant which missed him and shattered on the wall behind sending splinters in an arc ten feet wide which way did she go pitt shouted furiously theres sixpence for anyone who helps me get her two or three stirred but no one spoke he was so angry so scalded with frustration he would have attacked them even in their stupor if he had thought it would achieve anything at all then another far brighter thought came to him he had been only a couple of yards behind clarabelle when she had gone into the large dormitory even with the few moments it had taken to break in the door he should have seen the far door swing and caught a glimpse of her fuchsia skirt in this frowsy street he spun round and charged back into the great room seizing the first person he could reach hauling him up by the lapels and glaring at him where did she go he said gratingly between his teeth if shes still here ill charge you all with being accessory to murder do you hear me she aint ere the man squeaked let go o me yer bleedin pig shes gawn gawd elp er fooled yer yer swine pitt dropped him and stumbled back to the broken door the sergeant still on his heels out in the alley again there was no sign of her and the possibility that she had escaped brought him out in a sweat of fury and impotence he could understand how children wept at their own powerlessness he must force himself to think more clearly anger would solve nothing she had a flourishing business and considerable possessions in tortoise lane what would he seek to do in her place attack get rid of the only man who knew her crime would clarabelle think that far or would escape be all that mattered now was panic greater than cunning he remembered the brilliant black eyes and thought not if he looked vulnerable offered himself as bait she would come back to finish him her instinct was all to attack to kill wait he said curtly to the sergeant but shes not ere the sergeant hissed back she cant ave got far sir id ate something rotten to lose this one a right wicked woman so would i sergeant so would i pitt looked up searching the grimy windows in the flat walls above it was growing dimmer closer to true twilight he had not long then he saw itthe pale glimmer of a face behind a windowand then it was gone again wait here he said tersely in case im wrong he turned and went in the nearest door past the inhabitants up a rickety stairway and along a dim passage he heard movement at the end and a rustle of taffeta a fat body squeezing through a narrow way he knew it was her as if he could smell her only a few yards ahead of him she was waiting what would she have she had killed prudence wilson with a knife and carved up her body as if it had been a side of meat he moved after her quietly now walking on the sides of his feet even so the boards were rotten and betrayed him he heard her aheador was it her was she crouched behind some half concealed door waiting all the weight of her thick body balanced to thrust the knife into his flesh deep to the heart without realizing it he had stopped fear was tingling sharp his throat tight tongue dry he could not stay here he could hear someone further and further ahead of him going on upwards unwilling pulse racing he crept forward one hand outstretched to touch the wall and feel its solid surface he came to another flight of stairs even narrower than the last and knew she was close above him he could feel her presence like a prickle on his skin he even thought he could hear her breath wheezing somewhere in the gloom then suddenly there was a thud a cry of anger and her footsteps at the top of the stepladder above him he started up and saw for a moment her bulk bent over the square of yellow light at the top where the attic opened out she was half in shadow but he could still see the shining eyes the curls loose like bedsprings the sweat gleaming on her skin he almost had her he was forewarned expecting a knife she moved back as if she were afraid of him startled to find him so close he could make the last four steps easily in two strides and be beside her before she had time to strike if he moved to one side as soon as he was through that square then with horror paralyzing him quite literally leaving him frozen on the step he remembered the secret of these old warrensand deliberately let go the rail and fell backwards down to the floor bruising and battering himself just as the trapdoor came down with its spearsharp embedded blades slicing the air where he had been the instant before followed by her shrill scream of laughter he scrambled to his feet blood surging through him pain forgotten and swarmed up the stairs striking his hand between the blades and shooting the trap open he fell up and out of the hole onto the attic floor only a yard away from where she crouched before she had time even to register shock he hit her as hard as he could with his clenched fistand all the stored up anger the pain and loss of her victimsand she rolled over and lay senseless he did not give a damn about the difficulty of getting her down or even whether his superiors would charge him with breaking her jaw he had clarabelle mapes and he was satisfied it was late the following morning when pitt returned to cardington crescent the euphoria of capturing clarabelle mapes had vanished and in the dull warm daylight he remembered that he had gone to tortoise lane to find out what sybilla march had wanted there and he had learned nothing no amount of questioning was going to get anything more from clarabelle and none of the children had ever seen a lady like sybilla the butler let him in and he asked that charlotte be sent for he was permitted to wait in the morning room it was oppressive curtains half drawn pictures draped with black black crepe fluttering in unlikely places like cobwebs stained with soot charlotte came in dressed in exquisitely fashionable lavender it flickered through his mind that it was a gown of aunt vespasias altered a little at the bosom to fit charlotte vespasia never wore black even for death charlotte was pale there were smudges of tiredness under her eyes but her face lit up with pleasure as she saw him and he found it extraordinarily good in a sense deeper than walls or possessions wherever she was he would be at home oh thomas im so glad youve come she said immediately everything is getting worse we are looking at each other with terrible thoughts in our eyes and strings of words we want to mean and cant she turned and closed the door behind her and stood leaning against it staring at him biting her lips her hands clenched tightly it isnt tassie ive discovered what she does at night where she goes and gets splashed with blood a monstrous anger welled up inside him sharp as a dagger because it was principally fear not only for her but for himself fear of losing all that was most precious to him all the deep warm safety that supported every other courage and dream he held you what he shouted involuntarily she closed her eyes her face tight dont shout thomas he strode forward and took her by the arm pulling her away from the door and around to face him in the center of the room he was hurting her and he knew it you what he repeated fiercely the very fact that she had remained by the door instead of coming to him and kissing him that she had not replied with any righteous anger of her own meant that she was conscious of her guilt you followed her he accused with certainty her eyes opened wide and there was no apology in them i had to find out where she went she explained and it was perfectly all rightshe goes to help deliver babies a lot of poor women or unmarried womengirlscant afford a midwife thats why so many die thomas its a wonderful thing shes doing and the people love her he was too angry at the idiotic risk she had taken to be relieved that tassies conduct was so innocent where he had feared such horror without realizing it he was shaking charlotte you followed her to some womans home alone at night he was still shouting you you fool you imbecile she could have taken you anywhere what if she had been responsible for the woman whose body was found in bloody pieces in bloomsbury you might have been the next one he was so furious he could have slapped her as one does a beloved child who has just escaped falling under the carriage wheels in the rush of relief one dares to imagine all the possible dangers so narrowly missed memory of clarabelle mapes and the appalling labyrinth he had so lately left were stronger in him than this comfortable civilized house you stupid irresponsible woman do i have to lock you up before i can leave the house safely and be sure youll behave yourself like an adult what had begun as guilt in her was now overridden by a sense of injury he was being unjust and she was correspondingly angry in her own right you are hurting me she said coldly you deserve to be thrashed he retaliated without altering his grip in the slightest she answered by kicking him sharply in the shins with the toe of her boot he was so surprised he let go of her with a gasp and she stepped back smartly dont you dare treat me like a child thomas pitt she said furiously i am not one of your dainty ladies who do nothing all day and can be ordered to their rooms whenever you dont like what they say emily is my sister and shes not going to be hanged for killing george if there is anything at all that i can do to help it tassie is in love with mungo hare beamishs curatehe helps her with the deliveriesand she is going to marry him he clung to the only other example of male reason and dominion he could think of her father wont let her hell never allow it oh yes he will she retorted ive promised him you wont tell anyone about his affair with sybilla if he agrees and if he doesnt i shall make thoroughly sure all society knows of it in detail hell give tassie his blessing i assure you do you he was incensed you take a great deal for granted and what if i dont choose to honor this promise you gave so freely on my behalf she hesitated swallowing hard then met his eyes then tassie will not be able to marry the man she loves because he is not socially suitable and has no money she said bluntly shell remain single and live here in bondage to that selfish old woman keeping her company till she dies and then doing the same for her father either that or shell have to marry someone she doesnt love she did not need to add that that was what might well have happened to her had her father not been of a more amenable disposition than eustace and had her mother not pleaded her cause with force pitt was aware of it and the knowledge robbed him of the justification he wanted she had done exactly what he would have wished it was the fact that he had been preempted that enraged him not the act but to say so aloud would be ridiculousin fact the complaint was ridiculous he chose to change the subject entirely and play his best card i have solved the murder of the corpse in the bloomsbury churchyard he said instead and captured the murderess after a chase with enough evidence to hang her charlotte was impressed and she let her amazement and admiration show in her face i didnt think that would be possible she said honestly how did you do it he sat down sideways on the arm of one of the hide chairs he was stiff after the bruising he had taken chasing clarabelle mapes and he was surprisingly sore it was a woman who kept a baby farm she frowned a what a baby farm he hated having to tell her of such things but she had chosen to know a woman takes out discreet advertisements saying that she loves children and will be happy to care for any infant whose mother due to circumstances of ill health or other commitment is unable to care for it herself often they add that sickly children are particularly welcomed and will be nursed as if their own a small financial provision is required of course for necessities charlotte was puzzled there must be many women only too glad to avail themselves of such a service it sounds like a charitable thing to do why do you say it with such disgust too many women have to work and cant care for their children especially if they are in domestic service and the child is illegitimate she stopped why because most of them like clarabelle mapes take the fee from their mothers and then let the sickly ones starveor actually murder themrather than spend money on caring for them the strong or pretty ones they sell he saw her face im sorry you did ask why the bloomsbury murder she asked after a moments silence was she the mother of one of the children who was murdered and discovered the truth one who was sold oh she sat down without moving for several minutes and he did not touch her then at last he put out one hand gently why did you go there she asked at last the address was in sybillas book she was startled the baby farm but thats ridiculous why i dont know i never found out i presume sybilla found it for a servant one of her own maids or a friends i cant imagine any of her own circle wanting such a service even if they had an illegitimate child they would find some other provision a relative in the country a family retainer in retirement with a daughter i suppose it was a maid charlotte agreed or else she knew the woman for some other reason poor sybilla it doesnt help me any further towards finding out who killed her or why you asked the woman of course he gave a sharp guttural little laugh you didnt see clarabelle mapes or you wouldnt ask have you no idea who killed george she faced him eyes dark with anxiety fear heavy at the back of them he realized again how tired she was how very troubled he touched her cheek gently slowly no my love not much there are only william eustace jack radley and emily left unless it was the old woman which i would dearly like to think but i know of no reason she would i cant even imagine oneand believe me ive tried you include emily he closed his eyes opening them slowly unhappily i have to there was no point in arguing she knew it to be true a knock on the door saved her from the necessity of replying come in pitt said reluctantly it was stripe looking apologetic and holding a note in his hand sorry mr pitt sir the police surgeon sent this for you it dont make no sense give it to me pitt reached out and grabbed it opening the single sheet and reading what is it charlotte demanded what does it say she was strangled he replied quietly his voice dropping by her hair quick and hard very effective he saw charlotte shiver and out of the corner of his eye saw stripe bite his lip but she wasnt carrying a child he finished charlotte was stunned are you sure of course im sure he said irritably dont be idiotic this is from the surgeon who did the postmortem you can hardly mistake such a thing charlotte screwed up her face as if she had been physically hurt and bent her head into her hands poor sybilla she must have miscarried and she dared not tell anyone how she must have hated eustace going on and on about how marvelous it was she was going to give william an heir after all this time no wonder she looked at him with such loathing and that dreadful old woman haranguing about family oh god what wounds we inflict on people pitt looked at stripe who was obviously embarrassed at such an intimate subject and hurt by the pity he felt but only half understood he realized this was a whole sea of pain he did not comprehend thank you pitt nodded i dont think it helps us and i see no reason to tell the family it will only cause unnecessary distress let her keep her secret yes sir stripe withdrew something like relief in his face charlotte looked up and smiled she did not need to praise him he knew it was there in all the unsaid words between them luncheon was as miserable as breakfast had been and emily sat at the dining room table more in defiance than because of any delusion that it would be more endurable than eating alone in her room an additional incentive was the growing conviction that the ring was tightening round her and unless she could find her own escape she was going to be charged with murder charlotte had told her about following tassie and discovering the secret of her midnight excursions and the blood on her dress a difficult delivery could be a very messy affair the afterbirth could look in the glare of lamplight like the gore of a butchery and no wonder tassie had worn such a look of calm delight she had witnessed the beginning of a new life the last act in the creation of a human being could anything at all be further from the madness of which they had suspected her thomas had been here this morning had spoken to charlotte and left again without explanation or apparently any further investigation although to be fair to him emily could think of nothing else for him to ask she looked round the table at them from under her lashes so no one would notice while she pushed a lump of boiled chicken round her plate tassie was sober but there was a glow of happiness inside her that no awareness of others distress could extinguish emily found most of her could honestly be pleased for her only a tiny core one she would willingly have quenched was sharp with envy then she felt an unclouded sense of relief that there was no reason on earth to suspect tassie of any kind of guilt either in georges death or sybillas emily had never wanted to think there was it was a necessity forced on her by charlottes extraordinary account of the episode on the stairs now that was explained in a way better than she could have dreamed at the foot of the table with its snowfield of a cloth and fine georgian silver but flowerless in spite of the blaze in the garden the old woman sat dourfaced in black her fishblue eyes staring straight ahead of her presumably she had not been told either about tassies intention of marrying the curate or of eustaces capitulation in allowing her still less of his reason and most assuredly she had not learned of tassies midnight excursions if she had there would be far more in her present mood than a cold dislike and perhaps at the back of that chill expression and the petty angers a suffocated fear after all it was someone in this house who had murdered twice even lavinia march could not pretend to herself it was a foreign force invading her home it was something withina part of them but she seemed to remain alone in whatever mourning she suffered it had not driven her to any softening of heart any understanding of the fear in anyone else emily was aware somewhere in the back of her mind that that was perhaps the greatest tragedy of all far beyond the need to receive pitythe inability to feel it and yet she could not evoke in herself compassion for those who gave none themselves she would dearly have liked to believe the old woman responsible for murder but she could think of no reason why she should be nor any evidence whatsoever which suggested that she was mrs march was the only one in the house whose guilt would cause emily no unhappiness at all she racked her brain to find anything to support it and failed as if conscious of her thoughts the old woman looked up from her plate and gazed at her icily i imagine after the funeral tomorrow you will be returning to your own house emily she said with lifted eyebrows presumably the police will equally easily be able to find you therealthough most else seems to be beyond them yes certainly i shall emily answered tartly it is only for the convenience of the police that i have stayed here so longand to show some family solidarity there is no need for the rest of society to know how little we find each others company agreeable or seem able to offer each other any comfort she took a sip of her wine although i dont know why you think the police are unable to solve the murders she used the ugly word deliberately and was pleased to see the old woman wince with distaste they undoubtedly know a great deal that they have not chosen to tell you they will hardly confide in us after all it is one of us whom they will arrest really eustace said angrily remember yourself emily that kind of remark is quite unnecessary of course it is one of us you fool the old woman snapped at him her hand shaking so hard her wine slopped over the rim of her glass and ran down onto the cloth it is emily herself and if you do not know that you are the only one here who doesnt you are talking nonsense grandmama william spoke for the first time since they had come into the dining room in fact as far as either emily or charlotte could recall he had not spoken at breakfast either he looked ghostlike as if sybillas death had taken all his own vitality as well charlotte had said earlier that she was afraid he might collapse at the funeral so gaunt did he seem the old woman swung round on him opening her mouth but then she registered the expression on his face and closed it again i for one dont know that it was emily he went on the motive of jealousy you credit to her might equally well do for me although in fact it doesnt the affair was trivial at best and over with anyway which both emily and i knew you may not have but then it was none of your business he stopped and took a sip from his glass of water his voice was rough as though his throat ached and the other motive you imagine for her that of an infatuation with jack while quite believableshe would certainly not be his first conquest william eustace shouted banging his hand flat on the table to make as much noise as possible and sending the silver and crockery jumping this conversation is in the worst possible taste we are all prepared to allow your grief some latitude but this is beyond bearing william stared back at him with burning contempt his eyes brilliant his mouth pinched with violent emotion long held in and hidden taste is a personal thing father i find many of your conversations as distasteful as anything i have ever said in my life i frequently find your hypocrisy quite as obscene as all the vulgar picture postcards of naked women they at least are honest eustace gasped but was not quick enough to stem the tide of anger he was aware of charlotte next to him because she had pushed out her foot under the table to kick him fairly sharply on the ankle the ridiculous scene under sybillas bed was not allowed to fade for a moment from his memory he clenched his teeth and remained silent but as a motive it is hardly worth murder william went on she could perfectly well have had jack as well if she had wanted himand there is no evidence that she did whereas on the contrary if he had wanted heror to be more accurate georges money which she inheritsthen he had an excellent reason for murdering george emily sat rigid acutely aware of jack radley beside her conscious that he had stiffened in his seat but was it guilt or embarrassment or simply fear innocent people were hanged sometimes emily herself was afraid why should not he be but william was not finished personally he went on i favor father he had excellent reasons which just in case he is innocent i shall not discuss there was total silence round the table vespasia set down her knife and fork touching her napkin delicately to her mouth once and lying it aside she looked at william and then down at the tablecloth but she said nothing eustace was pale and charlotte could see his fists were clenched in his lap the veins stood out on his neck till she feared his collar would strangle him but he also did not speak tassie hid her face mrs march was scarlet but for some reason afraid to break the silence perhaps nothing she dared say was adequate to her outrage jack radley looked wretched and acutely embarrassed the only time charlotte had seen his composure completely shattered although she was perfectly aware how likely it was that he was guiltynot only of double murder but of the most callous abuse of a womans emotions and that he had fully intended to abuse them furtherstill she liked him better for seeing him at a loss it gave him a reality beneath the charming smile and the marvelous eyes emily stared straight ahead of her in the end it was the footman with the next course who broke the silence and the meal proceeded with a saddle of mutton no one tasted and a trivial conversation no one could have recalled a moment after it was spoken after the dessert emily excused herself and retired to the rustic seat in the garden not because it was a pleasant dayindeed it was overcast and seemed very likely to rainbut because she felt it her best chance of being alone and there was no one whose company she desired tomorrow was sybillas funeral she stayed because she wished to attend it now that sybilla was dead all emilys hatred of her had vanished the ridiculous affair with george had receded to a far different proportion of importance he had regretted it he had been robbed of the chance to undo it so she would wipe it out for him cherishing all the other memories that were good they had shared a great deal if she allowed sybilla to rob her of all those things then she was a fool and she deserved to lose them she had not seen charlotte alone since pitt called that morning except for an instant as they came through the hall towards the dining room but that had been enough to learn that he still had little idea who had murdered george or why presumably it was the same person who had then killed sybilla she must have known something which the killer could not afford her ever to tell that did not exclude anyone sybilla was a clever and observant woman she may have understood some word or act that had eluded the rest of them or even been told something by george what could george have known emily sat hunched up in the damp rising wind pulling her shawl round her and raking through every possibility her mind could imagine from the absurd to the horrific at the end she was still left with jack radley and her own clumsy complicity or else williams rather wild attempt to blame eustaceand she was obliged to admit she believed that born more of hatred than sense she did not hear jack radley approach and only when he was almost above her did she realize he was there he was the last person she wanted to speak to at all still less be alone with she pulled her shawl even tighter round her and shivered i was just thinking of going inside she said hastily it is not very pleasant i wouldnt be surprised if it rains it wont rain yet he sat down beside her refusing to accept dismissal but it is cold he slipped off his jacket and put it gently round her shoulders it was still warm from his own body she thought his hand lingered a moment longer than necessity required she opened her mouth to protest but did not unsure that she would not be making herself ridiculous after all they were in clear view of the house and she had no reason to wish herself back there luncheon had been ghastly and no one would believe she wanted to pursue its conversations and he had removed from her the excuse of being cold he interrupted her train of thought emily have the police any idea who killed george yet or were you just defying the old woman why was he asking she wanted to be free to like him she felt a happiness in his company like sunlight through a garden door at the end of a long passage yet she was terribly afraid it was deceptive i dont know she said truthfully i didnt see thomas this morning and i only spoke to charlotte for a moment as we came in to luncheon i have no idea she forced herself to face him it was just a fraction better than imagining his eyes his expression was full of concern was it for her or for himself what did eustace mean he said urgently emily for heavens sake think i know it wasnt me and i refuse to believe it was you it has to be one of them let me help you please try to think tell me what william meant emily sat paralyzed he looked so earnest but he had lived by his charm for years he was a superb actor when it was in his own interest and this could be a matter of survival if he had killed george they would hang him the fact that she liked him did not cloud reason some extremely virtuous people could also be extremely boring and admire them as one might one shrank from their company and the cruelest people could be very funnyuntil the essential ugliness snowed through he was still talking his eyes on her face could she look at him and keep the balance to disbelieve she had always had sense far more sense than charlotte and she was a better actress more skilled in masking her own feelings she met his gaze squarely i dont know i think he just hates eustace and would like it to be him that leaves only old mrs march he said very quietly unless you think it was tassie or greataunt vespasia which you dont she knew what he was thinking nowit took only one step in reasoning an inevitable step it was jack or emily herself she knew she had not murdered george and sybilla but she was growing increasingly afraid he had worse than that she feared he still intended to court her he took her hands he was not rough but he was far stronger than she and he did not mean to let go emily for heavens sake think there is something in the march family that we dont know something dangerous or shameful enough to cause murder and if we dont find out what it is you or i may very well be hanged for it instead half of her wanted to scream at him to be quiet but she knew it was true giving way to hysterics now would be stupid and destructiveperhaps even fatal charlotte had got nowhere except to discover tassies secret which as it turned out was irrelevant emily would have to save herself if jack radley were innocent together they might discover something if he were guilty and she played along with him perhaps she would trick him into betraying something however small it could be survival you are quite right she said seriously we must think i shall tell you everything i know then you will tell me between us we may finally deduce the truth he smiled very slightly not quite believing her she made an effort to deny the fear she feltnot only the great and overshadowing knowledge of danger from the law and the enduring judgment of society but the inner loneliness and the belying warmth he offered which it would be so easy to accept if only the poisonous suspicion in her mind could be crushed she had to force herself to remember that he was still the most likely murderer the thought hurt even more than she expected tassie goes out at night alone to help deliver babies in the slums she said rather abruptly if she hoped to startle him she succeeded magnificently he stared at her while emotions teemed across his face incredulity fear admiration and lastly pure delight thats superb but how in gods name do you know charlotte followed her he cringed letting his breath out between his teeth in a little hiss and shutting his eyes i know she said quietly i expect thomas was furious furious his voice rose isnt that something of an understatement immediately she was defensive well if she hadnt wed still be thinking it was tassie charlotte saw her coming upstairs in the middle of the night with bloodstains on her hands and dress what else should she do let it remain a mystery she knows i didnt murder anyone emily he caught her hands and if we dont find who it is i could be arrested and imprisoned emily stop it and tried and hanged she finished harshly she was shaking in spite of the closeness of him and the strength of his hands holding hers people have been hanged wrongly before memories stories teemed in her mind charlotte knows that and so do i it was a relief to put it into words to drag the real terror out of the darkness at the back of her mind and share it with him i know he said quietly but it is not going to happen to you charlotte wont let itneither will i it has to be someone in this house vespasia has the courage if she thought such a thing were necessary but she would never have killed george and i dont think she would have had the physical strength to kill sybillanot the way it was done sybilla was a young healthy woman he hesitated remembering i know she said without pulling her hands away from him and aunt vespasia is not young and not strong anymore he smiled bleakly i wish i could think of a reason why old mrs march would have done it he said with feeling shes twice vespasias weight shed have the power emily looked at their locked hands but why would she she said hopelessly anger and frustration welling up inside her thered have to be a reason i dont know he admitted unless george knew something about her like what he shook his head something about the marches shes choked up with family pride im damned if i know why theyve plenty of money but no breeding at all it comes from trade then he laughed at himself not that i wouldnt be glad of a little of it my mother was a de bohun traces her family back to the conquest but you cant even buy a good meal with that let alone run a house a wild series of thoughts clashed and jostled in her mind had he killed george hoping to marry her for the ashworth money but then what about tassie any man with sense would have chosen that marriage it was infinitely safer and his for the askingor he must have thought so he didnt know about mungo hare or did he was he really so astounded by the news of tassies midnight expeditions as he pretended to be if charlotte had followed her so could heat least as far as seeing the young curate and realizing tassie would never marry anyone else or perhaps tassie had even told him herself she was honest enough she might have chosen not to delude him with false hopenot of love but of money emily shivered she wanted to look at himsurely she had some ability of judgment left and yet she also dreaded what she would see and what she would reveal of herself but as long as it remained undone it would crowd out all other thought from her mind it was like vertigo standing at the edge of a high balcony with the compulsive desire to look down feeling the void pulling at you she looked up quickly and found his eyes worried serious she could see no deceit in them at all it solved nothing to find ugliness there might have freed her let her believe the worst of him and kill the hope thatthat what she refused to put it into words it was too soon but the thought stayed at the edge of her mind something to move towards beckoning her like a warm room at the end of a winter journey emily she recalled her attention they had been talking about the old woman she might have done something scandalous in her youth she offered or maybe her husband did perhaps we should learn more of how the marches got all their moneyit could be something that would put an end to any idea of a peerage perhaps george knew of it after all it was her she swallowed her medicine that was the poison memory of death came back sharp and cold physically painful and the tears stung in her eyes she found she was clinging to his hand so hard she must be hurting him but he did not pull away instead he put his arm round her and held her touching her hair with his lips whispering words that had no meaning but whose gentleness she felt with an ease that made weeping not an ache but a release from pain an undoing of the hard frightened knots inside her she realized that she wanted the solution to the crime almost as much for him as for herself she longed with an intense need to know that he was untouched unmarked by it charlotte also was happy to be alone and spent some time in the dressing room which was her bedroom repeating in her mind all that she had learned since the first news of georges death right up to pitts departure this morning it was half past three when she went downstairs with the small spark of an idea she wanted to disbelieve it was ugly and sad and yet it answered all the contradictions she was in the withdrawing room almost at the curtains which half covered the french doors to the conservatory when she heard the voices how dare you say such a thing in front of everyone it was eustace loud and angry his broad back was to the doors and beyond him she could just see the sunlight on williams flaming hair i can forgive you a lot in your bereavement eustace went on but that insinuation was appalling you as good as said i was guilty of murder you were perfectly happy to see emily blamedor jack william pointed out thats entirely different they are not part of us for gods sake what has that got to do with it william demanded furiously it has everything to do with it eustace was growing angrier and there was an ugly note in his voice as if the dark and unrefined mass of inner thoughts were too close to the frail surface of manners that overlaid them you betrayed the family in front of strangers you suggested there was something secret and shameful which you knew and others didnt have you no conception what a meddling and inquisitive busybody that pitt woman is the dirtyminded little chit will never rest until she either uncovers or invents something to fit your wild ramblings god knows what scandal shell start william moved back a step his face was twisted with pain and contempt shell have to be very dirtyminded indeed to get to the depths of your soul if that is not too grand a word for it perhaps belly would be more apposite theres nothing wrong with a man having stomach eustace said with answering scorn i sometimes think if you had more stomach and fewer airyfairy ideas youd be more of a man you mince around dabbling in paints and dreaming of sunsets like a lovesick girl wheres your courage wheres your heart your manliness william did not answer beyond eustace standing with his back to her charlotte could see the white almost deathlike look on williams face and she could feel pain in the air like the hot settling of condensation on the lily leaves and the vines great god eustace shouted with unutterable disgust no wonder sybilla took to flirting with george ashworth at least he had something in his trousers besides his legs william winced with revulsion so acute charlotte thought for a moment he had actually been struck she was so offended for him herself that she felt sick her hands were clammy and hurt with the strength of her clenched fists yet she still stood transfixed listening with a terrible foresight williams answer when it came was quiet heavy with irony and you expect me to be discreet for you in front of mrs pitt father you have no sense of the ridiculousindeed the grotesque is it grotesque to expect a little responsibility from you eustace shouted family loyalty you owe us that william i owe you nothing but my existence william said gratingly between his teeth and that was only because you wanted a son for your own vanitys sake it was nothing to do with me you want to continue your name a perpetuation of little eustace marches all down through eternity thats your idea of being immortal with you it would be the flesh not an idea not a creation but an endless reproduction of bodies ha eustace said explosively with overpowering derision well i missed my chance with you didnt i in twelve years of marriage you couldnt beget a child till now and its too late if youd played about less with paints and more in the bedroom perhaps youd have been more of a man and none of this damn tragedy would have happened george and sybilla would be alive and we wouldnt have the police in the house the conservatory was motionless it seemed even the water did not drip charlotte realized the tragic truth the explanation was clear like the hard white daylight of early morning showing every weakness every flaw and pain without taking time to think or weigh any consequence she seized a china vase off the nearest small table and smashed it on the parquet floor sending the pieces shivering noisily across the wide surface then she turned and ran back across the withdrawing room through the dining room and out into the hallway to where the telephone instrument was installed she picked it up and clicked the lever urgently she was not used to it and was unsure exactly how it worked her ears were straining to catch the sound of eustace coming after her there was a womans voice coming through the speaker at her ear yes she said quickly i want the police stationi want to speak to inspector pitt please do you want the local police station maam the voice asked calmly yes yes please hold the line please it seemed an age of clicking and buzzing during which she was acutely aware of the dining room door behind her and every tiny creak of boards or whisper which could be a door opening wider or the softness of a shoe on carpet at last she heard a mans voice at the other end of the line yes maam im sorry inspector pitt aint here can i give im a message when e comes in or can somebody else elp you it had not occurred to her that he might not be there she felt helpless cut off you there miss the voice sounded anxious where is he she was beginning to panic it was stupid and yet she did not seem to be able to help herself i cant rightly tell you that miss but e left about ten minutes ago in a cab can i elp you no she had been so sure she could reach him the thought of having to manage alone was worse now no thank you and with stiff fingers shivering she replaced the instrument in its hook she had no proof anyhow only the certainty within her own mind but now that she knew there would be ways the police surgeon that was what sybilla had gone to clarabelle mapes for not to get rid of a baby but to buy the one william could never give her to silence the nagging cruel tongues of the family the condescension and the demand to satisfy the thoughtless insatiable dynastic vanity charlotte was sick with grief for her her aloneness her need the hopeless sense of rejection no wonder she had had affairs had turned to george was that what george had died for not because he had made love to her or stolen her affections but because in a moments foolishness from a need to justify herself she had betrayed to generous indiscreet george the secret too agonizing to be spoken even in the mindlet alone aloud for others to know to pity to make obscene and humiliating jokes over there would always be the nudges and the jeers the brazen manhood exhibited with a snigger to men like eustace virility was more than a physical actit was proof of his existence of potency and value in all of life and william had loved sybillathat charlotte knew from far more than the words in the letters from the vanity casewith a love worth infinitely more than eustaces narrow physical mind could climb to but in that one instance of weakness she had threatened his belief in himself the respect every man must have to survivenot inwardly where he had learned to bear it but in society and worst of all among his family eustace was so close to the truth already cruel and thrusting intruding like a rape of the spirit what would he do if he knew forever pry at it till there was no dignity left nothing unviolated by the constant remarks the prurient mocking eyes the knowledge of superiority and so sybilla had died too strangled by her own beautiful hair before she could betray him again perhaps to jack the bought child william might have accepted even understood perhaps more easily than one conceived to another man but he could never have accepted the shame charlotte was still standing in the hallway wondering what to do both eustace and william must have seen her she had smashed the vase precisely so they should know she was there and stop that terrible hurting did they know how much she had overheard or were they so caught up in wounding each other that her momentary interruption was incidental to be forgotten as soon as she left without knowing what she intended other than perhaps to stop eustace she began back towards the dining room past its gleaming sunlit table through the double doors to the withdrawing room all smooth greenness and pale satins reflecting the light and back to the entrance to the conservatory there was silence now and no sign of eustace or william the french doors were open wider and the smell of damp earth came into the withdrawing room she stepped through them slowly onto the walk between the vines she need not have come there was nothing for her to do except wait until she could find pitt and tell him if it were not for emily and the fear that would hang over her forever she would be tempted not to say anything she did not feel any desire to be an instrument of justice no sense of satisfaction or resolved anger the camellia bush was covered with flawless blooms perfect rosettes she did not like them the canna lilies were better irregular assymetrical the condensation dripped heavily into the pool someone should have opened the windows even though it was a dull day she came to the space cleared at the end where william had his studio and stopped abruptly she wanted to weep but she was too tired and too cold inside there were two easels set up on one was the finished painting of the april garden full of subtle loveliness dreams and sudden cruelty the other was a portrait of sybilla realistic without flattery and yet with such a tenderness it laid open a beauty in her few had perceived so clearly in life in front of them crumpled rather awkwardly on the stone floor william lay the palette knife having slipped from his hand the blade of it scarlet only inches away from the wound in his throat with an artists knowledge of anatomy he had sliced the vein in one clean movement he had understood the smashed vase perfectly and saved her the last ghastly confrontation she stood staring at him she wanted to bend and lay him straighteras if it could make any difference nowbut she knew that she must not touch anything she remained there silent hearing the water trickling on the leaves and the sound of a flower head dropping petals rotted at last she turned and walked slowly under the vines back through the french windows and saw eustace coming in from the dining room with a violence that startled her the long path up to the tragedy stood out clearly in her mind the years of demanding expecting the subtle cruelties her fury exploded william is dead she said harshly im sorry i really am sorry i liked himprobably far more than you ever did she looked at his shocked face the open mouth and pallid skin without any gentleness he killed himself she went on there was nothing else left for him except arrest and hanging she found her voice was choking as she said it she let all her scalding emotions pour out at eustace ii dont know what you mean he said helplessly dead why what happened he moved towards her floundering a little dont just stand there do something help him he cant be dead she blocked his way he is she repeated dont you understand yet you stupid blind man she could feel the thickness tightening her throat she wanted him to know the maiming he had caused absorb it into itself and become one with it he stared at her as if she had struck him killed himself he repeated foolishly you are hystericalhe cant have he has dont you know why she was shivering me how could i know his face was ashen the first pain of belief beginning to show in his eyes because it was you who drove him to it she spoke more quietly now as if he were an obstinate child trying to make him into something he wasntcouldnt beand ignoring all that he was you with your obsession with family your pride your vulgarity your she stopped not wanting to expose william to his contempt even now he was bewildered i dont understand she closed her eyes feeling helpless no no i suppose you dont but maybe you will one day he sat down on the nearest chair huddled as if his legs had failed him still looking up at her william he repeated very quietly william killed george and sybillahe killed sybilla now the tears burned in her eyes she saw vespasia in the dining room doorway white as the wall behind her and beyond gentle and untidy the figure of pitt she made her decision he thought there was an affair she said slowly to everyone the words difficult the lie catching on her tongue he was wrongbut it was too late then eustace was staring at them with the beginnings of comprehension a glimmer of what she was doing and even why it was a world he had not imagined and he was frightened by his own crassness in the doorway pitt put his arm round vespasia supporting her but he looked over her shoulder at charlotte he smiled his face blurred with pity thats right he said deliberately theres nothing more for us to do now thank you charlotte whispered thank you thomas
