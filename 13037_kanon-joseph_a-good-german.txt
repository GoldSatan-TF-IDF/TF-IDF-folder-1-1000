joseph kanon a good german i ruins chapter one the war had made him famous not as famous as murrow the voice of london and not as famous as quent reynolds now the voice of the documentaries but famous enough to get a promise from colliers four pieces if you can get there and then the press pass to berlin in the end it was hal reidy whod made the difference juggling the press slots like seating arrangements up next to scrippshoward down the table from hearst whod assigned too many people anyway i cant get you out till monday though they wont give us another plane not with the conference on unless youve got some pull only you hal grinned youre in worse shape than i thought say hello to nanny wendt for me the prick their censor from the old days before the war when theyd both been with columbia a nervous little man prim as a governess who liked to run a pen through their copy just before they went on the air the ministry of propaganda and public enlightenment hal said the way he always did i wonder what happened to him goebbels poisoned his own kids i hear no magda jake said the gnddigefrau in chocolates yeah sweets to the sweet nice people he handed jake the traveling orders have a good time you should come too its a historic occasion sos this hal said pointing to another set of orders two more weeks and im home berlin christ i couldnt wait to get out and you want to go back jake shrugged its the last big story of the war sitting around a table divvying up the pot no what happens when its over what happens is you go home not yet hal glanced up you think shes still there he said flatly jake put the orders in his pocket not answering its been a while you know things happen jake nodded shell be there thanks for this i owe you one more than one hal said letting it go just write pretty and dont miss the plane but the plane was hours late getting into frankfurt then hours on the ground unloading and turning around so it was midafternoon before they took off the c was a drafty military transport fitted out with benches along the sides and the passengers a spillover of journalists who like jake hadnt made the earlier flights had to shout over the engines after a while jake gave up and sat back with his eyes closed feeling queasy as the plane bumped its way east there had been drinks while they waited and brian stanley the daily express man who had somehow attached himself to the american group was already eloquently drunk with most of the others not far behind belser from gannett and cowley whod kept tabs on the shaef press office from a bar stool at the scribe and gimbel who had traveled with jake following patton into germany they had all been at war forever in their khakis with the round correspondent patch even liz yeager the photographer wearing a heavy pistol on her hip cowgirl style hed known all of them one way or another their faces like pins in his own war map london where hed finally left columbia in because he wanted to see the fighting war north africa where he saw it and caught a piece of shrapnel cairo where he recovered and drank the nights away with brian stanley sicily missing palermo but managing improbably to get on with patton so that later after france he joined him again for the race east across hesse and thuringia everything accelerated the stopandgo days of fitful waiting over finally a war of clear running adrenaline weimar then finally up to nordhausen and camp dora where everything stopped two days of staring not even able to talk he wrote down numberstwo hundred a dayand then stopped that too a newsreel camera filmed the stacks of bodies jutting bones and floppy genitals the living with their striped rags and shaved heads had no sex on the second day at one of the slave labor camps a skeleton took his hand and kissed it then held on to it an obscene gratitude gibbering something in slavicpolish russian and jake froze trying not to smell feeling his hand buckle under the weight of the fierce grip im not a soldier he said wanting to run but unable to take his hand away ashamed caught now too the story theyd all missed the hand you couldnt shake off old home week for you boyo isnt it brian said cupping his hands to be heard youve been before liz said curious lived here one of eds boys darling didnt you know brian said till the jerries chucked him out of course they chucked everybody out had to really considering so you speak german liz said thank god somebody does berliner deutsch brian answered for him a tease i dont care what kind of deutsch it is she said as long as its deutsch she patted jakes knees you stick with me jackson she said like phil harris on the radio then what was it like well what was it like a vise slowly closing in the beginning the parties and the hot days on the lakes and the fascination of events he had come to cover the olympics in and his mother knew somebody who knew the dodds so there were embassy cocktails and a special seat in their box at the stadium goebbels big party on the pfaueninsel the trees decked out in thousands of lights shaped like butterflies officers swaggering along the footpaths drunk on champagne and importance throwing up in the bushes the dodds were appalled he stayed the nazis supplied the headlines and even a stringer could live on the rumors watching the war come day by day by the time he signed on with columbia the vise had shut rumors now just little gasps for air the city contracted around him so that at the end it was a closed circle the foreign press club in potsdamerplatz up the gloomy wilhelmstrasse to the ministry for the twicedaily briefings on up to the adlon where columbia kept a room for shirer and they gathered at the raised bar comparing notes and watching the ss lounging around the fountain below their shiny boots on the rim while the bronze frog statues spouted jets of water toward the skylight then out the eastwest axis to the broadcasting station on adolf hitler platz and the endless wrangling with nanny wendt then a taxi home to the tapped telephone and the watchful eye of herr lechter the blockleiter who lived in the apartment down the hall snapped up from some hapless jews no air but that had been at the end it was like chicago he said blunt and gritty and full of itself a new city trying to be old clumsy wilhelmine palaces that always looked like banks but also jokes with an edge and the smell of spilled beer sharp midwestern air chicago it wont look like chicago now this surprisingly from the bulky civilian in a business suit introduced at the airport as a congressman from upstate new york no indeed brian said mischievous all banged about now still what isnt whole bloody countrys one big bomb site do you mind my asking ive never known what does one call a congressman i mean are you the honorable technically thats what it says on the envelopes anyway but we just use congressmanor mister mister very democratic yes it is the congressman said humorless you with the conference or have you just come for a lookin brian said playing with him im not attending the conference no just come to see the raj then meaning oh no offense its very like though wouldnt you say military government pukkah sahibs really i dont know what youre talking about well neither do i half the time brian said pleasantly just a little conceit of mine never mind here have a drink he said taking another his forehead sweaty the congressman ignored him turning instead to the young soldier wedged next to him a lastminute arrival no duffel maybe a courier he was wearing a pair of high riding boots his hands gripping the bench like reins face white under a sprinkling of freckles first time in berlin the congressman said the soldier nodded holding his seat even tighter as the plane bounced got a name son making conversation lieutenant tully he said then gulped covering his mouth you all right liz said to him the soldier took off his hat his red hair was damp here just in case she said handing him a paper bag how much longer he said almost a moan holding the bag to his chest with one hand the congressman looked at him and involuntarily moved his leg in the tight space out of harms way turning his body slightly so that he was forced to face brian again youre from new york you said utica new york utica brian said making a show of trying to place it breweries yes jake smiled in fact brian knew the states well fair number of germans there if im not mistaken the congressman looked at him in distaste my district is one hundred percent american but brian was bored now i daresay he said looking away how did you get on this plane anyway i understood it was for american press well theres allied feeling for you brian said to jake the plane dropped slightly not much more than a dip in a road but evidently enough for the soldier who groaned im going to be sick he said barely opening the bag in time careful the congressman said trapped just get it out liz said to the soldier a bigsister voice thats it youll be all right sorry he said half choking clearly embarrassed looking suddenly no older than a teenager liz turned away from the boy did you ever meet hitler she asked jake the question bringing the others with her as if she were drawing a privacy curtain in place for the soldier meet no saw yes jake said lots of times up close i mean once he said a sultry early evening coming up from the press club the street almost in shadow but the new chancellery still catching the last of the light prussian moderne the broad steps leading down to the waiting car just an aide and two guards curiously unprotected on his way to the sportpalast probably for another harangue against the devious poles he stopped for a second near the bottom stairs looking down the empty street at jake i could reach into my pocket now jake had thought one shot put an end to all of it that easy why hadnt anyone done it then as if the thought had carried like a scent hitler raised his head and sniffed anxious as prey and looked back at jake one shot he held the look for a second assessing then smiled just a twitch of the mustache lifted his hand in a languid heil of dismissal and headed toward the car gloating there was no gun and he had things to do they say the eyes were hypnotic liz said i dont know i never got that close jake said shutting his own making the rest of the plane go away not long now hed go to pariserstrasse first he saw the door the heavy sandstone caryatids holding up the balcony over the entrance what would she say four years but maybe shed moved no shed be there a few more hours a drink at the cafe down the street in olivaerplatz catching up years of stories unless they stayed in pleasant dreams liz said and he realized he was smiling already there berlin not long now were coming in brian said his face at the little window god come have a look jake opened his eyes and jumped up a kid they crowded around the window the congressman at their side my god brian said again almost in a hush silenced by the view bloody carthage jake looked down at the ground his stomach suddenly dropping all his excitement draining away like blood why hadnt anyone told him he had seen bombed cities beforeon the ground in london rippedup terrace houses and streets of glass then cologne and frankfurt from the air with their deep craters and damaged churchesbut nothing on this scale carthage a destruction out of the ancient world below them there seemed to be no movement shells of houses empty as ransacked tombs miles and miles of them whole pulverized stretches where there were not even walls they had come in from the west over the lakes so he knew it must be lichterfelde then steglitz the approach to tempelhof but landmarks had disappeared under shifting dunes of rubble as they dropped lower scattered buildings took shape smashed but there a few chimneys sticking up even a steeple some kind of life must still be going on a beige cloud hung over everything not smoke a thick haze of soot and plaster dust as if the houses could not quite bring themselves to leave but berlin was gone the big three were coming to divide up ruins well they got what they deserved the congressman said suddenly a jarring american voice jake looked at him a politician at a wake didnt they he said a little defiantly brian turned slowly from the window his eyes filled with scorn boyo we all get what we deserve in the end tempelhof was a mess around the edges but the field had been cleared and the terminal itself was still there after the tomb city theyd seen from the air the airport seemed dizzy with life swarming with uniformed ground crews and greeters a young lieutenant full of hair and chewing gum was waiting at the foot of the stairs picking out faces as they disembarked the sick soldier had staggered down first running off jake guessed for the mens room geismar the lieutenant stuck out his hand ron erlich press office ive got you and miss yeager she on board jake nodded with these he said indicating the cases hed been lugging off the plane want to give me a hand whats she got in there her trousseau equipment liz said behind him you going to make cracks or give the man a hand ron took in the uniform with its unexpected curves and smiled yes sir he said giving a mock salute then picked up the cases in one easy movement impressing a date this way he led them toward the building colonel howley sends his regards he said to liz says he remembers you from his days in the ad business liz grinned dont worry ill take his picture ron grinned back you remember him too i guess vividly hey careful with that lenses they went up the gate stairs behind the congressman who seemed to have acquired an entourage and into the waiting hall the same tawny marble walls and soaring space as before when flying had been a romance people had come to the restaurant here just to watch the planes jake hurried to keep up ron moved the way he talked breezing a path through the gangs of waiting servicemen you missed the president he said went into town after lunch had the whole second armored lined up on the avus quite a picture sorry your plane was so late thats probably it for town shots wasnt he at the conference liz said hasnt started yet uncle joes late they say he has a cold a cold jake said hard to imagine isnt it trumans pissed i hear he glanced at jake thats off the record by the way whats on not much ive got some handouts for you but youll probably throw them away everybody else does theres nothing to say till they sit down anyway we have a briefing schedule set up at the press camp which is where down the road from mg headquarters argentinischeallee he said rolling it out a joke name out in dahlem jake said placing it everythings out in dahlem why not somewhere nearer the center ron looked at him there is no center they were climbing the big flight of stairs to the main entrance doors as i say the camps right by mg headquarters so thats easy your billet too we found a nice place for you he said to liz almost courtly photo schedules different but at least youll get out there potsdam i mean but not press jake said ron shook his head they want a closed session no press im telling you this now so i dont have to hear you squawk later like the rest of them i dont make the rules so if you want to complain go right over my head i dont care well do the best we can at the camp everything you need you can send from there but your stuff goes through me you might as well know take looked at him forced to smile a new nanny wendt this time with gum and getupandgo whatever happened to freedom of the press dont worry youll get plenty of copy well have a briefing after every session besides everybody talks and what do we do between briefings drink mostly at least thats what theyve been doing he turned to jake its not as if stalin gives interviews you know here we go he said swinging through the doors ill get you out to your billet you probably want to clean up hot water liz said sure all the comforts of home in the driveway the congressman was being bundled into a requisitioned horch with an american flag painted on the side the others into open jeeps beyond them at the end of the drive were the first houses not one of them intact jake stared everything emptying out again not an aerial glimpse anymore worse a few standing walls pitted by artillery shells mounds of debris broken concrete and plumbing fixtures one building had been sliced through a strip of wallpaper hanging off an exposed room scorch marks around the window holes how would he ever find her in this the same dust hed seen from the plane suspended in the air making the afternoon light dull and now the smell sour wet masonry and open earth like a raw building site and something else which he assumed was bodies still lying somewhere under the rubble welcome to berlin ron said is it all like this liz said quietly most of it if the roofs gone it was bombs otherwise the russians they say the shelling was worse just blew it all to hell he threw the bags into the jeep hop in you two go on ahead jake said still looking at the street something i want to do first hop in ron said an order what do you think youre going to do get a taxi liz looked at jakes face then turned to ron and smiled whats the rush take him where he wants to go you can give me a tour on the way she patted the camera slung around her neck then put it up to her eye crouching down smile she snapped his picture busy tempelhof behind ron glanced at his watch pretending not to pose we dont have a lot of time a little tour liz said wheedling snapping a few more isnt that part of the service he sighed i suppose you want to see the bunker everyone wants to see the bunker and theres nothing to see the russians dont let you in anyway say its flooded maybe adolfs floating around down there who knows but its their sector and they can do what they want he smiled back at liz you can get the reichstag though everybody wants a picture of that and the russians dont care youre on she said lowering the camera if i can get us there i know the way from dahlem but liz jerked her thumb toward jake he used to live here you navigate then ron said shrugging and motioned liz into the jeep you can ride up front another grin lucky me just keep your hands on the wheel the whole us armys got this problem with their hands jake paid no attention the flirting a harmless buzz beside him some people had emerged from one of the piles of rubble two women and he watched them pick their way carefully over the bricks listless as if they were still shellshocked in the july heat they were wearing overcoats afraid to leave them home in the basement of the ruined house where everything maybe even themselves must be open for the taking what had it been like these last few months carthage maybe she was like these two burrowed in somewhere but where he realized for the first time looking at the women that he might not find her at all that the bombs must have scattered people too like bricks but maybe not he turned to the jeep suddenly anxious to get there a pointless urgency as if everything that could have happened to her had not already happened he lifted himself into the back next to lizs cases where first the bunker ron said to liz who nodded he turned to jake which way not where he wanted to go but stuck with it now a favor to liz turn right at the end ron let out the clutch dont bother taking notes everybody says the same thing anyway lunar landscape thats the big one and teeth rows of decayed teeth ap had rotting molars but maybe youll come up with something original be nice something new how would you describe it cant ron said no longer flip maybe nobody can itswell see for yourself jake headed them north on the mehringdamm but they were forced to detour east and in minutes were lost streets blocked off or impassable the whole map redrawn by debris five minutes back and already lost they threaded their way through the ruins ron glancing back at him as if he were a broken compass until luckily another detour put them on the mehringdamm again a cleared stretch this time which would get them to the landwehrkanal an easier route to follow than the unpredictable roads only the major streets had passable lanes the others reduced to winding footpaths when they were visible at all berlin a flat city finally had contours new hills of brick there was no life once he spotted children skittering over the rubble like crickets and a working detail of women reclaiming bricks their heads wrapped in kerchiefs against the dust but otherwise the streets were quiet the silence unnerved him berlin had always been a noisy city the elevated sbahn trains roaring across their trestle bridges radios crackling in the apartment block courtyards cars screeching at red lights drunks arguing now he could hear the motor of the jeep and the eerie creaking of a single bicycle ahead of them nothing else a cemetery quiet at night it would be pitch dark the other side of the moon ron had been rightthe unavoidable cliche at the landwehrkanal there was more activity but the smell was worse raw sewage and corpses still floating on the water the russians had been here two months had there been so many to fish out but there they were bodies stuck on the piles of the wrecked bridges or just suspended face down in the middle of the canal held in place by nothing but the stagnant water liz had dropped her camera to hold a handkerchief over her mouth against the smell no one said a word across the water hallesches tor was gone they followed the canal toward the potsdamer bridge which took traffic at one of the footbridges he saw his first men shuffling across in gray wehrmacht uniforms still in retreat he thought inevitably of the night hed seen the transports set out for poland a big public display down the linden squarejawed faces out of a newsreel these were blank and unshaven and almost invisible women simply walked around them not looking up there were landmarks nowthe reichstag in the far distance and here in potsdamerplatz the jagged remains of the department stores wertheims gone a burnedout truck had been pushed to the side but there was no traffic to block just a few bicycles and some russian soldiers leading a horsedrawn wagon the old crowded intersection now had the feel of a silent movie without the jerky rhythm instead everything passed by in slow motion even the bicycles wary of punctures and the wagon plodding down a street as empty as the steppes how many nights of bombing had it taken near the truck a family sat on suitcases staring into the street maybe just arrived at anhalter station waiting for a phantom bus or too tired and disoriented to go on you have to feel sorry for the poor bastards ron said you really do who the germans liz said yeah i know still they turned up the wilhelmstrasse goerings new air ministry or its shell had survived but the rest of the street the long line of pompous government buildings lay in sooty heaps their bricks spilling into the street like running sores where it had all started there was a crowd near the chancellery an unexpected popping of flashbulbs scattered applause look its churchill liz said grabbing her camera pull over guess they all want the tour ron said pretending to be bored but staring nevertheless at the stairs starstruck jake got out just where hitler had stood smiling now it was churchill in a light summer uniform cigar clenched in his teeth surrounded by reporters brian next to him how did he get here so fast but brians corklike ability to bob up everywhere was legendary churchill was stopping on the stairs disconcerted by the applause he raised his fingers in a v sign a reflex then dropped them confused aware suddenly of where he was jake glanced at the crowd it was british soldiers who were applauding the germans stood silently then moved away embarrassed perhaps by their own curiosity like people at an accident churchill frowned and hurried to the car lets take a look jake said you out of your mind and leave a jeep full of cameras churchills car was pulling away the crowd following ron lit a cigarette and sat back go ahead ill hold the fort bring me a souvenir if theres anything left there were russian guards at the entrance squat mongols armed with rifles but they seemed to be no more than a show of force since people went in and out at will and there was in any case nothing to guard jake led liz past the entrance hall with its gaping roof then down the long reception gallery soldiers roamed through the building sifting through the wreckage for medals something to carry away the huge chandeliers lay in the middle of the floor one of them still suspended a few feet above the litter nothing had been cleared away it was somehow more shocking than the bomb damage outside the visible fury of the final assault a destructive madness furniture smashed to pieces its upholstery ripped open by bayonets paintings slashed drawers looted and then flung aside in hitlers office the giant marble desktop was overturned its edges chipped away for keepsake fragments papers everywhere stamped with muddy boot marks all the disturbing evidence of a rampage the mongolian horde he imagined the guards outside shouting as they raced through the halls ripping and grabbing what do you think these are liz said holding up a fistful of cards blank pieces of stationery edged in gold the nazi eagle and swastika engraved at the top invitations he fingered one the fiihrer requests your presence tea boxes of them enough to last a thousand years just like mrs astor liz said stuffing a few in her pocket thats something isnt it lets go he said unsettled by the mess just let me get a few shots she said taking a picture of the room two gis hearing english came over to her and handed her a camera hey how about it do you mind liz smiled sure over there by the desk can you get the swastika in a massive ornamental swastika lying face down on the floor they each planted a leg on it one slinging his arm over the others shoulders and grinned at the camera kids one more liz said the lights bad she clicked then looked at their camera whered you get this anyway havent seen one of these since the war you kidding theyre practically giving them away try over by the reichstag couple of bottles of canadian club should do it you just got in huh just how about i buy you a drink i could show you around now what would your mother say hey easy she said then nodded toward jake besides he gets mean the gi glanced at jake then winked at her maybe next time then babe thanks for the picture theres one for the books she said to jake as the gis moved away i never thought id get picked up in hitlers office jake looked at her surprised he had never thought of her being picked up at all now he saw that scrubbed of combat dirt and bluff she was attractive babe he said amused wheres the bunker there i guess he pointed through the window to the back courtyard where a group of russian soldiers stood guard a small concrete blockhouse a scarred empty patch of ground the two gis were being turned away but offered cigarettes around until the guards stepped aside to let them take a picture jake thought of egypt the valley of bunkers where the pharaohs had gone to ground in love with death but even they hadnt taken their city with them they say he married her at the end liz said while the russians ran wild overhead the very last hour lets hope it meant something to her it always does she said lightly then glanced at him ill come back i can see youre not in the mood everybody wants to see the bunker ron had said the last act right down to the ghoulish wedding and finally too late the one shot now a story for the magazines did eva have flowers a champagne toast before they put the dog down and magda murdered her children its not a shrine jake said still looking out the window they should bulldoze it over after i get my picture liz said they moved back into the gloom of the long gallery there were the brokenup chairs again stuffing bursting out of the bayonet slashes why had the russians left it like this some kind of barbarous lesson but who was here to learn it gis were taking pictures by the fallen chandeliers oblivious tourists near the wall was a heap of medals thrown out of drawers iron crosses when jake bent over to pick one up a souvenir for ron he felt like a gravedigger scavenging through remains the uneasy mood followed him up the street the mountains of rubble no longer an impersonal landscape but the berlin hed known a part of his life knocked out too at the corner unter den linden was gray with ash even the adlon had been bombed no ron corrected him the russians burned it after the battle no one knows why drunk probably he looked away but what was a building compared to the rest of it the hands you couldnt shake off across the square the brandenburg gate was standing but the quadriga had skidded off its mount like a chariot overturned in a race red flags and posters of lenin were draped on the columns hiding some of the shell holes as they passed into the tiergarten he could see a large crowd milling in front of the reichstag gis exchanging their bottles of canadian club russian soldiers examining wristwatches some of the germans like the two women near tempelhof wore overcoats in the hot afternoon presumably to hide whatever theyd brought to sell cigarettes tins of food antique porcelain clocks the new wertheims a few young girls in summer dresses were hanging on to soldiers arms in front of the reichstag its charred walls covered with cyrillic graffiti soldiers were posing for pictures another stop on the new tourist circuit at the park he hit bottom buildings like soldiers were expected casualties of war but the trees were gone too all of them the dense forest of the tiergarten all the winding paths and silly tuckedaway statues had burned down to a vast open field littered with dark charcoal stumps and the twisted metal of streetlamps the jeep was heading west along the axis and in the far distance over charlottenburg the last of the sun had turned the sky red so that for a moment jake could imagine the fires still burning glowing all night to guide the bombers a fragment of one had fallen and a single propeller stuck up out of the ground a surreal piece of junk like those old refrigerators and rusting tractor parts you sometimes saw on the front yards of poor farms jesus h christ liz said look at them a landscape full of people moving slowly all around them suitcases clothes tied up in bundles a few handcarts and baby carriages the movement of exhaustion one step at a time old people and families with no bags at all displaced persons the new euphemism no one begged or called out just trudged past going where relatives in a cellar a new camp delousing and a bowl of soup and no further address stunned to find in the heart of the city a wasteland worse than the one they had left yet they were moving somewhere a survivors trek just like the ones in the old engravings wandering through the burned landscape of the thirty years war it wasnt supposed to end this way jake thought but how else parades berlin as vibrant as ever with the nazis taken away how else the odd thing was hed never imagined it ending thered been no life outside the war just one story that led to the next and then another and now the last one what happens when its over you go home hal had said where he hadnt been in ten years so hed come back to berlin another dp in the tiergarten except he was in a jeep flying past the stragglers with a sassy girl taking pictures and a driver lighting another cigarette worth a meal the people on foot merely glanced at them without expression then kept going he realized with an unexpected lurch that what they saw was a conqueror one of the priapic teenagers and souvenir hunters not a homecoming berliner that delusion was gone now too with everything else but something must be left years of his life people survived even this he ordered ron to turn at the victory column and aimed them down toward the flak towers at the zoo his eyes still cataloguing the missing the kaiser wilhelm church its steeple blown away kranzlers in bits more people now the kurfiirstendamm smashed but recognizable no glass in the storefronts or the display boxes along the sidewalks but occasional buildings roulette winners in the bombing left down the fasanenstrasse this is out of our way ron said i know i want to see something jake said his voice edgy expectant a right past the ludwigkirch a route he could follow blindfolded after all the nights in the blackout the chestnut trees were gone so that the street seemed in a kind of unnatural glare clear all the way to olivaerplatz stop here he said suddenly they had overshot it because there was nothing there for a moment he simply stared then got out of the jeep and walked slowly over to the pile of rubble nothing five stories collapsed the light brown facade lying now in slabs even the heavy wroughtironandglass door had been blasted away crazily he looked around for the caryatids gone a washbasin perched on one of the mounds of broken plaster is this where you lived liz said her voice loud in the deserted street he heard a camera click no jake said someone else theyd only come here a few times when emil was away afternoons the leafy branches outside making patterns on the drawn shades sheets damp with sweat teasing her because she covered up afterward pulling the sheet over her breasts even as her hair lay tangled and moist on the pillow as illicit as the warm afternoon the room where they shouldnt be their time together you didnt mind before that was before i cant help it im modest she met his eyes then started to laugh a bed laugh intimate as touch she turned on her side how can you joke he fell down next to her its supposed to be fun she put her hand along the side of his face fun for you she said but smiling because the sex was playful part of their other excitement getting away with something the early days before the guilt he walked toward a small pathway in the debris maybe someone was still living in the cellar but the path led nowhere there was nothing but rubble and the cloying smell whose body a stick with a piece of paper was wedged in the broken bits of plaster like a grave marker he bent down to read it frau dzuris the fat woman on the ground floor evidently still alive had moved a street he didnt recognize in wilmersdorf frau dzuris is now residing the quaint formal language of a receiving card he took out his notebook and jotted down the address a nice woman fond of poppyseed cakes whose son worked at siemens and came to lunch every sunday the things you remember he turned back to the jeep nobody home ron said jake stopped then let it go and shook his head not here anyway but somewhere how do they find anybody with all this ron shrugged bush telegraph ask the neighbors jake looked at the empty street or message boards you see them at the corners request information on the whereabouts ofyou know like a miss lonelyhearts club he caught jakes expression i dont know he said still airy they do though somehow if theyre alive an awkward silence liz whod been watching jake turned to ron your mother raise you or did you just get this way by yourself sorry he said to jake i didnt mean skip it jake said wearily is this what you wanted to see its getting late yes this was it jake said climbing back into the jeep okay dahlem ron said jake took a last look at the rubble why had he expected anything to be here a cemetery is there really hot water i could use a bath thats what everybody says ron said cheerful again after its all the dust their billet was a large villa in gelferstrasse a suburban street behind the luftwaffe headquarters on kronprinzenallee that now housed the military government the luftwaffe buildings were in the same style as goerings ministry gray streamlined masonry here with decorative eagles jutting out of the cornices poised for flight but the compound bristled with american flags flapping on the roofs and the aerials of cars lining the driveway there was damage here too burnedout patches where houses had been but nothing like what they had just seen and gelferstrasse itself was in fairly good shape almost peaceful some of it still shaded by trees jake had never spent much time in dahlem whose quiet streets away from the center reminded him of hampstead but the relief of seeing houses standing with their traditional tile roofs and brass knockers made it seem more familiar than it was most of the windowpanes were still missing but the street had been swept free of glass tidied up and the smell that had followed them through the city was finally gone the bodies swept away too in the general housecleaning the villa was a threestory pile of pale yellow stucco not as lavish as the millionaire mansions up in grunewald but substantial the home probably of a professor from the kaiser wilhelm institute a few streets away i had to give the congressman the master bedroom ron said an innkeeper leading them up the stairs but at least you wont have to double up i can switch you later he said to liz hes only here a few days hit and run huh liz said nobody stays for long except the mg personnel theyre all on the second floor one more flight dinners at seven by the way where do the enlisted men stay all over mostly barracks down in the old telefunken factory some over by onkel toms hutte he said pronouncing it in english uncle toms hut liz said amused since when since always their name they like the book i guess jakes room must have belonged to the daughter of the house there was a single bed with a pink chenille spread floral wallpaper and a vanity with a round mirror and pink ruffled skirt even the blackout drapes had been backed with pink fabric sweet yeah well ron said like i said we can switch around in a few days never mind ill just think virginal thoughts ron grinned thats one thing you wont have to worry about in berlin he turned to the door just leave any laundry on the chair theyll pick it up later and then with a click he was gone taking his breeze with him jake stared at the frilly room they who a house staff to fetch and carry one of the spoils of victory what had happened to the girl requisitioned out of her pink cocoon he walked over to the glasstopped vanity a trace of powder but otherwise cleared off all the jars and tubes swept into some case on the way out idly he opened the drawers empty except for a few publicity stills of viktor staal with pinholes in the corners presumably no longer her dreamboat but at least shed had a room to leave what about lena did she pack her perfume bottles and compacts and get out in time lucky or linger until the roof caved in he lit a cigarette and walked over to the window unbuttoning his shirt the yard below had been dug up to make a vegetable garden but the rows had become a muddy tangle tramped over he supposed by the russians foraging for food still you could breathe here the wounded city just a few miles away had already begun to fade hidden by the trees and suburban houses the way an anesthetic blotted up pain he should have taken notes but what was there to say the story had already happened from the looks of it building by building old men and teenagers sniping from doorways why had they held out waiting for the americans hed heard anyone but the russians the peace will be worse goebbels last warning the only one that came true so the final madness whole streets on fire thered been roving packs of ss hanging boys from lampposts as deserters to make an example in the camps theyd killed people right up to the last hour here theyd even turned on their own not war anymore a bloodlust jake hadnt filed a real story in two months not since the camps he had been waiting for berlin now he felt that berlin would defeat him too that all the copy would end in rons lunar landscapes and decayed teeth inadequate attempts at scale he had run out of words personalize it not the thousands just one shed be here it wasnt too much to hope for one survivor he looked again at the garden near a shed in the back a grayhaired woman was hanging wet clothes over an improvised line of rope a hausfrau but what are you going to do hed said come with me ill arrange it ill get you out out she said dismissing it the word itself improbable then she shook her head no its better shed been sitting at her dressing table still in her slip perfectly madeup again her nails red ill be a hausfrau shed said almost casually putting on lipstick a good german hausfrau she lowered her eyes not this all the lies theyre not lies hed said putting his hands on her shoulders she looked up at his face in the mirror the lies to him down below the grayhaired woman had spotted him in the window she hesitated then nodded in a servants bow and picked up the wicker basket he watched her cross the muddy yard personalize it what had her war been like maybe shed been one of the faithful shouting her lungs out at the sportpalast now doing laundry for the enemy or maybe just a hausfrau lucky to be alive he crossed over to the bed dropping his shirt what did it matter either way losers stories back home theyd want the glamour of the conference truman horsetrading with stalin the great world theyd won not the rubble and the people in the tiergarten with the future knocked out of them he took off the rest of his clothes and wrapped a towel around his waist the bathroom was at the end of the hall and he opened the door to a rush of steam and a surprised yelp oh liz was in the tub her breasts barely clearing the soapy water wet hair swept back from her face dont you knock sorry i he said but he didnt move watching her slide down into the tub covering herself her flesh as pink as the vanity ruffle have a good look sorry he said again embarrassed a soft womans body without the uniform and gun holster now hanging on a peg never mind she said smiling a veteran of shared tents and field latrines just keep your towel on ill be out in a sec she plunged her head into the water to rinse then smoothed her hair back and reached for a towel you going to turn around or do you want the floor show too he turned his back to her as she stepped out a splash of water and a rustling of cloth the sounds themselves intimate i suppose i should take it as a compliment she said wrapping herself in a robe you never noticed before sure i did he said his back to her uhhuh he could hear the water running down the drain in gulps okay decent she was in a silk wrapper toweling her hair he looked at her then cocked his head like the young gi at the chancellery how about i buy you a drink later with my clothes on cant im busy that was fast not young ron she grinned i wouldnt have the strength she fixed the towel around her head in a turban just business have to see a man about a duck ill take a rain check though she nodded at the tub better run your water it takes a while she gathered her things slowly from the stool then sat down are you staying jake tell me something that business this afternoonwho was she why a she because it was whats the story you know ill get it out of you eventually no story he said turning on the taps she went back to her husband oh she said that kind of story she left you i left berlin dr goebbels request there was an attitude problem ill bet when was this fortyone did me a favor i suppose a few months later and id have been stuck he waved his hand to take in the city in all this so only she got stuck he looked at her for a moment then went back to adjusting the taps she stayed with her husband he said flatly i wouldnt have she said trying to be casual a light apology who was he one of the master race he smiled to himself not too masterful he was a teacher actually a professor of what liz what is all this just making conversation i dont often get you at a disadvantage the only time a man will talk is when he has his pants off is that a fact he paused mathematics since you ask math she said laughing slightly genuinely surprised an egghead not very sexy it must have been she married him and slept with you mathematics i mean a ski instructor or something i could understand he did ski as a matter of fact thats how they met see she said playing i knew it where was this he glanced at her annoyed another womans magazine piece the encounter on the slopes as wistful as eva brauns last glass of champagne i dont know liz does it matter i dont know anything about their marriage how would i she stayed thats all maybe she thought theyd win the war the last thing she thought why say it he turned off the taps annoyed now with himself my baths ready were you in love with her thats not a reporters question she looked at him and nodded then stood up thats some answer this towel is coming off in two seconds youre welcome to stay okay okay im going she smiled i like to leave a little something to the imagination she gathered up her things slinging the holster belt on her shoulder and went to the door dont forget the rain check he said she turned to him by the way a piece of advice next time you ask a girl for a drink dont tell her about the other one even if she asks she opened the door see you around the campus contents previous chapter next chapter chapter two dinner was surprisingly formal served by the grayhaired woman and a man jake took to be her husband in a large corner room on the ground floor a starched white tablecloth was set with china and wine goblets and even the foodstandard b rations of pea soup stewed meat and canned pearsseemed dressed up for the occasion ladled out of a porcelain tureen with ceremony and garnished with a sprig of parsley the first green jake had seen in weeks he imagined the woman snipping off pieces in the muddy garden determined even now to keep a good table the company all men was a mix of visiting journalists and mg officers who sat at one end with their own whiskey bottles like regulars in a western boardinghouse jake arrived just as the soup was being served well heres a sorry sight tommy ottinger from mutual extended his hand when did you blow in hey tommy even balder than before as if all his hair had migrated down to the trademark bushy mustache i didnt know you were here you back with murrow jake sat down nodding hello across the table to the congressman sitting between ron clearly on caretaking duty and a middleaged mg officer who looked exactly like lewis stone as judge hardy no broadcasting tommy just a hack yeah whose nickel colliers oh tommy said drawling it pretending to be impressed in depth good luck you see the agenda reparations you could nod off just thinking about it so what do you know not much i just got in took a ride through the city thats all you see truman he went in this afternoon no i saw churchill though i cant use churchill they want trumanhows he doing i mean how the fuck do i know he hasnt done anything yet jake grinned at him make something up it wouldnt be the first time the serving man placed the soup in front of him looking surprised when jake thanked him in german you know what he said today in berlin this is what happens when a man overreaches himself jake thought of the miles of debris reduced to the lesson for the day whos your source jimmy byrnes sounds just like truman dont you think it will if you use it got to fill the air somehow you remember the old graveyard shift the am broadcasts timed for the evening news back home worse they kept berlin on russian time so its even later he took a drink shaking his head the russians he turned to jake suddenly earnest as if he were confiding a secret they just went all to hell here raped everything that moved old women children you wouldnt believe the stories no jake said thinking of the bayoneted chairs now they want reparations tommy said rolling his deep radio voice i dont know what they thinks left theyve already grabbed everything that wasnt nailed down took it all apart and shipped it home everythingfactories pipes toilets for christs sake of course once they got it there they didnt know how to put it back together so i hear its all sitting on the trains going to rust useless theres your story they dont want that either lets not make fun of the russians we have to get along with them you know theyre touchy bastards so what do they want truman the poker game whos a better player him or uncle joe potsdam poker he said trying it thats not bad and were holding the cards tommy shrugged we want to go home and they want to stay thats a pretty good card the serving man hovering in a frayed suit replaced the soup with a gray stew salty probably lamb tommy picked at it then pushed it away and took another drink so what are you going to do i dont know yet i thought id look up some people i used to know see what happened to them heartsandflowers stuff jake spread his hands not wanting to be drawn in the poker game then i guess in other words sit around with the rest of us and do what ron here says he said raising his voice right if you say so tommy ron said shooting him a wary look across the table handouts we cant even get near the place stalins afraid somebodys going to take a potshot at him that it ron id say hes more afraid of being quoted out of context now whod do a thing like that would you do that jake never i cant say i blame him the congressman said smiling ive had a little experience in that department myself his manner was looser now a campaign geniality and jake wondered for a second if the stiffness on the plane had been nothing more than fear of flying better hidden than the young soldiers his wide tie a dizzying paisley was like a flash of neon at the uniformed table youre alan breimer arent you tommy said thats right he said nodding pleased to be recognized war production board tommy said a memory display we met when i covered the trust hearings in thirtyeight oh yes said breimer who clearly didnt remember what brings you to berlin tommy said so smoothly that jake saw he was working the line to ron only a way of reeling breimer in just a little factfinding for my committee in berlin the congressmans been looking at conditions all over the zone ron said stepping in technically that includes us too why not berlin breimer said to tommy curious well industrial capacitys your field not much of that left here not much of that anywhere in our zone breimer said trying for a backroom heartiness you know what they saythe russians got the food the british got the factories and we got the scenery i suppose we have yalta to thank for that too he looked at tommy expecting a response then switched gears anyway im not here to see factories just our mg officials weve got general clay tomorrow right lieutenant bright and early ron said youll want to see blaustein over in economics tommy said as if he were helping to fill the schedule remember him he was the lawyer from justice at the trust hearing i remember mr blaustein on the other hand you werent exactly best friends he had his ideas i had mine breimer said easily what is he doing here same idea decartelization one of the four ds four ds jake said military government policy for germany ron said in his briefing voice demilitarization denazification decartelization and democracy and the least of these shall be decartelization isnt that right congressman tommy said im not sure i know what you mean american dye and chemicals in your district i seem to remember they held the north american farben patents i thought maybe youd come over to see he waited for breimer to take the bait but the congressman just sighed youre barking up the wrong tree same one mr blaustein kept barking up he shook his head the more successful a business became the more he wanted to tear it down i never did understand that he looked straight at tommy american dyes just one business in the district just one but the only one with a german partner that was before the war mr who did you say you were with tom ottinger mutual dont worry were off the record we can be on the record for all i care im not here for american dye or anyone else just the american people tommy grinned now that makes me homesick you forget people talk like that in washington im glad you find us so funny he turned to ron well i can see im not winning any votes here he said an unexpectedly graceful exit then unable to resist he turned back to tommy you know its easy to attack business ive heard it all my life usually from people who dont know the first thing about it maybe we ought to keep in mind that those companies the ones you want to break up won the war for us they almost won it here too now theyre war criminals i wonder where the boys at american dye would be if things had gone the other way thats a hell of a thing for an american to say tommy raised his glass but youd defend to your death my right to say it he took in breimers blank expression oliver wendell holmes another troublemaker in the justice department no voltaire the judge hardy lookalike said mildly the first time hed spoken if he said it he was probably misquoted too a sly smile at tommy well somebody said it tommy said anyway its the right idea dont you think he said to breimer his glass still raised breimer stared at him for a moment a politician assessing a heckler then lifted his glass with a forced smile i certainly do to the justice department and to the gentlemen of the press bless their little hearts ron said they drank then breimer turned back to ron placing his fleshy hand on a paper on the table but clays a direct report to ike he said as if they had never been interrupted thats right ron said quickly before tommy could jump in again the armys here as support but military government reports in to ike technically to the allied control council thats ike ismay and zhukov were usgcc us group control council he was drawing boxes on the paper an organization chart control councils the final authority for the country at least for the signoff but the real works here in the coordinating committee thats clay as ikes deputy and the other allied deputies under clay youve got your executive staff line like colonel muller here he said turning to judge hardy who nodded nice to put a face on a box breimer said eagerly but ron was already moving down the sheet then the functional officespolitical affairs intelligence information control and so on jake watched the lines and boxes spread across the bottom of the page a kind of bureaucratic family tree the functional divisions down here are the ones that work with the germanstransport manpower legal and so on breimer was studying the chart with care familiar with the world as a pyramid of boxes where does frankfurt come in well thats usfet g civil affairs usfet the armys got more damned alphabet soup than the new deal breimer said evidently his idea of a joke because he looked up ron smiled obligingly in other words overlap breimer said ron smiled again that i couldnt say no you dont have to he shook his head if we ran a business this way wed never make any money were not here to make money muller said quietly no to spend it breimer said but pleasantly from the looks of things weve got a whole country on relief and the american taxpayer footing the bill some peace we cant let them starve nobodys starving that i can see muller turned to face him his expression grave and kindly judge hardy lecturing andy the official ration is fifteen hundred calories a day in practice its closer to twelve hundred sometimes lower thats only a little better than the camps theyre starving his voice as precise and rational as one of rons boxes stopped breimer short unless they work for us he went on calmly then they get a hot meal every day and all the cigarette butts they can scrounge he paused theyre the ones you see jake glanced over at the serving man quietly removing plates and noticed for the first time his thin neck bobbing in its oversized collar nobody wants anybody to starve breimer said im not a hard peace man thats that nut morgenthau in treasury he glanced over at tommy one of your trustbusters by the way wants to make em all farmers take the whole damn thing apart dumbest thing i ever heard of course those people have their own agenda what people tommy said but breimer ignored him sweeping along im a realist what we need to do is get this country back on its feet again not put em on relief now im not saying you people arent doing a fine job here this to muller who nodded dutifully ive been in germany two weeks and i can tell you ive never been prouder to be an american the things ive seen but hell look at this he pointed to the chart you cant do much when youre spread this thin on the ground one group here another in frankfurt i believe its general clays intention to combine the organizations ron said good breimer said annoyed at being interrupted thats a start and heres a whole other group just for berlin well you know the citys jointly administered so theres no way around that ron said still on his chart the coordinating committee set up the kommandatura to deal with berlin thats howleywe see him tomorrow after clay kommandatura breimer said that the russian name more international than russian i think ron said evading everyone agreed to it breimer snorted the russians ill tell you one thing we dont get these people back on their feet the russiansll come in thats for sure well thats one way to stop the drain on the american taxpayer tommy said let ivan pick up the tab breimer glowered at him thats not all hell pick up well have your fun have your fun he said sitting back i suppose im making speeches again and ruining the party my wifes always telling me i dont know when to stop he gave a calculated smile meant to disarm its just you know i hate to see waste thats one thing you learn in business he glanced again at tommy to be a realist he shook his head four ds we ought to be putting these people to work not giving them handouts and breaking up their companies and wasting our time looking for nazis under every bed a plate crashed like a punctuation mark and everyone turned to the door the old man distraught was looking at the floor held at the elbow by the short wiry american who had just bumped into him for a second no one moved suspended in a stopped piece of film then the reel caught again and they tumbled forward into a kind of slapstick the grayhaired woman rushing out hands to her cheeks the old man moaning the american apologizing in german when he bent down to help with the pieces the files under his arm slid onto the floor in a heap of papers and broken crockery more excited german a fuss too elaborate jake thought to be about a platethe fear perhaps of losing a job with its one hot meal a day finally the woman shooed both men away from the china and with a bow pulled back a chair for the late arrival sorry gentlemen he said to the quiet room busy stacking files on the table he had a terriers sharp nose and nervous energy his face covered with a dark fiveoclock shadow he hadnt had time to shave even the air around him seemed to be running late his tie loosened from its open collar by the same hurried gust congressman your three oclock tomorrow ron said wryly captain teitel public safety division bernie congressman breimer pleased to meet you teitel said quickly extending his hand and almost colliding again with a plate of stew the serving man had brought jake watched amused as the old man hesitated behind him waiting for a safe opening public safety breimer said thats police among other things im denazificationthe guy wasting our time looking under the beds teitel said ah breimer said unsure how to proceed then he stood no dont get up breimer smiled pointing to the tall soldier standing at the door my ride but bernie wasnt ready to let go frankfurt tells me you have a problem with the program he said lowering his head as if preparing to ram breimer looked down at him ready for another heckler but tommy had wearied him no problem he said mollifying just a few questions im sure youre all doing a fine job wed be doing a better one if we had more staff breimer smiled that seems to be the general complaint here everybody i meet wants another secretary i dont mean secretaries trained investigators the old man now slid the plate between them onto the table and backed away as if sensing that they were squaring off well well talk about that tomorrow breimer said preparing to go im here to learn afraid i cant do anything about personnel thoughthats up to mg i thought you were writing some kind of report breimer held up a waitasecond finger to his driver no just making sure were keeping our priorities straight this is apriority breimer smiled again back on familiar ground well thats what every department says but you know we cant do everything he indicated the organization chart sometimes i think we let our good intentions run away with us he put his hand on bernies shoulder an uncle giving advice we cant put a whole country on trial no just the guilty ones bernie said looking at him steadily breimer dropped his hand the easy getaway lost thats right just the guilty ones he looked back at bernie we dont want to start some kind of inquisition over here the american people dont want that really what do we want bernie said using the pronoun as a jab breimer stepped back i think we all want the same thing he said evenly to get this country going again thats the important thing now you cant do that by locking everybody up the worst cases yes get the big boys and put them on trialim all for it but then weve got to move on not chase all the small fry he paused avuncular again we dont want people to think a minority is using this program to get revenge he shook his head we dont want that the voice of the kiwanis club lunch bland and sure of itself in the awkward silence jake could feel tommy shift in his chair leaning forward to see bernies response were an even smaller minority here bernie said calmly most of us are dead i didnt mean you personally of course just all the other jews in the program but we speak the language some of usone of lifes little ironiesso youre stuck with us i was born here if my parents hadnt left in thirtythree id be dead too personally so i think this is a priority he touched the pile of papers on the table im sorry if it interferes with economic recovery as far as im concerned you can file that under t for too bad im a da back home thats why they tapped me for this das dont get revenge half the time were lucky to get a little justice breimer who had turned red during this sputtered i didnt mean save it i know what you mean i dont want to join your country club anyway just send me more staff and well call it quits he pulled the chair beneath him and sat down cocking his head toward the door i think your drivers waiting breimer stood still for a moment furious then visibly collected himself and nodded to the quiet table gentlemen he looked down at bernie well talk tomorrow captain i hope ill be better understood the entire table watched him go jake looked around waiting for someone to speak feeling the room grow warmer as if the quiet were letting in the sticky night air finally muller staring at his glass said dryly hes here to learn tommy smiled at him and lit a cigarette i wonder what hes really doing here guy doesnt take a leak unless american dye tells him to go to the bathroom hey tommy ron said do me a favor lay off im the one who gets the complaints whatll you do for me but the earlier mood was gone replaced by something uncomfortable and even ron no longer wanted to play well that was nice he said to bernie we have to live with this guy you know bernie looked up from his stew sorry he said still on edge ron took a drink looking at tommy he seems to bring out the best in everybody small fry bernie said imitating breimers voice whoever that is anybody but goering tommy said small fry bernie said again heres one he reached into the pile and pulled out a few buffcolored sheets otto klopfer wants to drive for us experienced says he drove a truck during the war he just didnt say what kind one of the mobile units it turns out the exhaust pipe ran back into the van theyd load about fifty sixty people in there and old otto would just keep the motor running until they died we found out because he wrote a letter to his co he held up a sheet the exhaust was taking too long recommended they seal the pipes so it would work faster the people were panicking trying to get out he was afraid theyd damage the truck another silence this time so still that even the air around bernie seemed to stop he looked down at the food and pushed it away fuck he said embarrassed then stood up gathering his files and left the room jake stared at the white tablecloth he heard the old man quietly clearing the plates then the muffled scrape of chairs as muller and the mg end of the table got up to leave tommy ground his cigarette into the ashtray well ive got a poker hand waiting he said subdued now you coming jake everybodyll be there the floating game of the war still going on press tents filled with smoke and battered typewriters and the steady slap of cards not tonight jake said looking at the table lets go ron bring your money he stood up then turned to take take a gun if you go out the russians are still all over the place once they get liquored up its like dodge city out there but theyd be rowdy roving the streets in packs their good time its own warning it was the others the shadows gliding through the rubble whod pounce in the dark where was breimer going he said to ron no idea im the day shift lets hope he gets laid talk about punishing the germans tommy said and then they were gone too and jake was alone in the quiet room he poured some more wine the old man returned and after a quizzical look at jake began emptying the ashtrays carefully straightening the butts and putting them on a separate plate occupation currency would you like anything else he said in german brushing the tablecloth no ill just finish this bitte he said as polite as a waiter at the adlon and left jake lit a cigarette had otto klopfer smoked in the cab while he ran the motor listening to the thumps behind him there must have been screaming a furious pounding on the van and hed sat there foot on the pedal how could they do it all the questions came back to that hed seen it on the faces of the gis whod hated france and then confused felt at home in germany the plumbing the wide roads the blond children grateful for candy their mothers tirelessly sweeping up the mess clean hardworking just like us then theyd seen the camps or at least the newsreels how could they do it the answer the only one that made sense to them was that they hadntsomebody else had but there wasnt anybody else so they stopped asking unless like teitel the hook had gone in too deep jake looked around the empty room still feeling the disturbance once in chicago hed worked the crime desk and the rooms had felt like this the uneasy quiet that follows murderthe body covered but everything else disordered he remembered the indifferent photographers the policemen picking through the room dusting for prints the numbed faces of the others who didnt look back at you but sat staring at the tagged gun in a daze as if it had gone off by itself and he realized suddenly that he had seen it all again today that what the city had really become was not a bomb site but a vast scene of the crime shaken waiting for someone to bring the stretcher and erase the chalk marks and put the furniture back except this crime wouldnt go away even then there would always be a body in the middle of the floor how could they do it sealing pipes locking doors ignoring the screams it was the only question but who could answer it not a reporter with four pieces in colliers the story was beyond that a twisted parody of goebbels big lieif you made the crime big enough nobody did it all the pieces he might do full of local color and war stories and trumans horsetrading were not even notes for the police blotter he got up from the table his head thick with drink and the humid air in the hall the old man was standing in front of an open door listening to the piano soft music barely louder than the clock when he saw jake he moved away a concertgoer giving up his seat jake stood for a moment trying to place the musicdelicate slightly melancholy something nineteenthcentury like the house a graceful world away from the abrasive dinner when he looked through the door he saw bernie bent over the keys in a pool of dim light his tight wavy hair just visible across the well of the piano at this distance his body was foreshortened and for a second jake saw the boy he must have been a diligent practicer his mother eavesdropping down the hall its something youll have all your life she would have said a nice boy not gifted who kept his eyes on the keys not yet a terrier ready to take offense but perhaps it was only the room the first real berlin room jake had seen with its tall stove in the corner the piano near the window to catch the light in the old days there would have been cake with coffee bernie kept his head down after he was finished so that jake was at the piano when he looked up what was it jake asked mendelssohn one of the songs without words beautiful bernie nodded also illegal until a few months ago so i like playing it rusty though your audience enjoyed it jake said nodding to the hall where the old man had been bernie smiled hes just keeping an eye on the piano its their house they live in the basement jake took this in so thats why the plate its all they have left they hid it i guess the russians took everything else he waved his hand at the room which jake saw now had been stripped of knickknacks the afternoons of coffee cakes just his imagination he looked down at the piano covered in cigarette burns and water rings from wet glasses of vodka we havent met im jake geismar he held out his hand the writer unless theres another one jake said pleased in spite of himself you wrote the piece about nordhausen camp dora bernie said jacob as in jewish jake smiled no as in the bible my brother got ezra bernie shrugged bernie teitel he said finally shaking jakes hand so i heard bernie looked at him puzzled until jake cocked his head toward the dining room oh that he looked away bastard you really dont want to join his country club you know bernie nodded no i just want to pee in his pool he stood up and closed the piano lid so what are you doing in berlin the conference looking for a story like everybody else i dont suppose i could interest you in the program we could use some press life was here they just wanted to know how our boys were doing how are they doing oh fine fine nobody fraternizes so nobody gets the syph nobody loots nobodys making a dime on the black market just handing out hershey bars and keeping their noses clean any mother would be proud according to life he picked up his files to go jake lit a cigarette and looked at him carefully through the smoke a da not a boy playing mendelssohn whats going to happen to otto klopfer bernie stopped otto summary court hes not big enough for the nuremberg team three to five probably then hell be back driving a truck but not for us but i thought you said we cant prove the actual killing no witnesses in the van if he hadnt sent the letter we couldnt prove anything were sticklers for the law here we dont want to start an inquisition he said back in his dining room voice wed rather cut the nazis a little slack summary courtthats you bernie shook his head we try to keep the foreignborn minorities out of court in case theyre notimpartial im just the hound right now im on the fragebogen he touched the files questionnaires he translated were you a member of the party bdm like that they have to fill one out if they want a job a ration card dont they lie sure but we have the party records so we check wonderful people for keeping records jake stared at the bulky files like a hundred message sticks in the rubble could you locate somebody with those bernie looked at him maybe if theyre in the american zone he said a question i dont know the british files would take a while the russians he let it dangle then said gently a relative somebody i used to know bernie took out a pen and scribbled on a piece of paper ill see what i have he said handing him an office number come by tomorrow i have a feeling my three oclock will be canceled he left the piano then turned back to jake theyd have to be alive you know yes thanks he pocketed the address can i buy you a drink bernie shook his head have to get back to work he shifted the files under his arm running late again you cant get them all jake said smiling a little bernies face went hard no just one at a time the way they did it one at a time it took over an hour the next morning to find frau dzuris in one of the crumbled streets not far from the british headquarters in fehrbelliner platz plaster had fallen off the front of the building leaving patches of exposed brick and the staircase smelled of mildew and slop buckets the signs of a broken water line he was shown to the second floor by a neighbor who lingered in the hall in case there was trouble inside the sounds of children immediately silent after the knock on the door when frau dzuris opened it looking frightened there was the faint odor of boiling potatoes she recognized him her hands fluttering to smooth her hair and drawing him in but the welcome was nervous and jake saw on the childrens faces that it was the uniform not sure what to do she insisted on introducing everybodya daughterinlaw three childrenand sat him at the table in the other room two mattresses had been pushed together i saw your notice in pariserstrasse he began in german for my son he doesnt know were here they took him to work in the east a few weeks they said and now look you were bombed out oh it was terrible the british at night the amis in the day a quick glance to see if she had offended him why did they want to bomb everything did they think we were hitler the building was hit twice the second time the daughterinlaw offered him water and sat down in the other room the children watched through the door was lena there no at the hospital the hospital not hurt she worked there the elisabeth you know the one in liitzowstrasse i said it was god protecting her for her good works you know the others in the basement didnt make it herr bloch his greta everybody they killed them all another glance herr bloch wouldnt go to the public shelter not him but i never trusted the cellar its not deep enough i said and you see it wasnt she had begun to wring her hands and jake saw the flesh of her upper arms hanging in folds like strips of dough so many dead terrible you cant imagine all night but lena she was all right she nodded she came back but of course we had to move where did she go she had a friend from the hospital after that i dont know it was hit too i heard a hospital they bombed even the sick she shook her head but she didnt leave an address with me i was already gone you know there wasnt time for addresses you found whatever you could perhaps she had relatives i dont know she never said you cant imagine what it was like the noise but do you know the strange thing the telephones worked right to the end thats the thing i remember about pariserstrasse the bombs and everybody running and there was a telephone ringing even then and her husband away somewhere in the war she waved her hand they left the women for the russians oh that was terrible thank god i she glanced toward her daughterinlaw i was lucky but she must be somewhere jake said i dont know i told your friend what friend the soldier yesterday i didnt know what to think now i see you didnt want to come yourself that explains it you were always careful i remember in case emil she leaned forward and put her hand on his arm an unexpected confidante but you know none of that matters anymore so many years i didnt send anybody here she withdrew her hand no well then i dont know who was he she shrugged he didnt say they dont you know just how many are living here do you have milk cards for the children where did you work in the war its worse than the nazis maybe he was counting the dead they do that so you cant use the name for the ration cards what did he say did i know where she was living had i seen emil thats all like you she looked at him is something wrong were good people here i have children to no no nothing im not here for the police i just want to find lena we were friends she smiled faintly yes i always thought so not a word from her she said as if she still hoped for a chat over coffee so proper always well what does it matter now im sorry i cant help perhaps the hospital would know he took out his notepad and wrote down the gelferstrasse address if you do hear from her of course its not likely you know many people left berlin before the end many people it was hard to find a place even like this you see how we live now jake looked around the shabby room then stood i didnt know about the children i would have brought some chocolate perhaps you can use these he offered her a pack of cigarettes she widened her eyes then grabbed his hand and shook it with both of hers thank you you see she said to her daughterinlaw i always said it wasnt the amis you can see how kind they are its the british who wanted the bombing that churchill she turned back to jake i remember you were always polite i wish we were back in the american zone not here with the british jake headed for the door then turned the soldier yesterdayhe was british no american he stood for a second puzzled not an official then if he comes back you will let me know she nodded clutching the cigarettes nervous again youre sure theres nothing wrong jake shook his head maybe just another old friend he might know something no she said answering something else there was only you a hospital would have records jake thought but when he got there he saw that a fire had swept through that stretch of liitzowstrasse taking the elisabeth and all its paper with it only a few walls were left black and open to the sky one of rons decayed molars a work brigade of women was clearing the site handing pails of bricks along a line that snaked over the heaps of fallen beams and charred bedframes the breeze that had come up during the night was now a steady hot wind blowing ashes so that the women had had to cover their mouths with kerchiefs like bandits jake stood for a while watching trying not to notice the heavy stench that hung in the street how long before one didnt smell it anymore he wondered what shed done here emil hadnt wanted her to work a traditional husband so shed left columbia for idle afternoons at home theyd had to take on hannelore instead a thick girl with inadequate english and jake assumed a direct line to nanny wendt but lena still came to parties until it became awkward to see foreigners and emil asked her to stop and then she only saw jake had he ever suspected frau dzuris didnt seem to think so but how could she know thered only been a few times in pariserstrasse when they couldnt go to his place because hal was there always careful alert even to the flick of a curtain at a neighbors window but frau dzuris had known somehow maybe just from the look on their faces emil surprisingly had been at the anhalter when theyd all come to see jake off a defiantly raucous party hal and the rest of the gang guzzling champagne while emil looked uneasily at the platform guards lena had given him flowers the respectable sendoff for an old boss never meeting his eye until one of the party became sick and in the confusion of hustling him to the mens room theyd finally had a moment together why did you bring him jake said he was there when they called from the office i couldnt come alone how would it look she paused looking down he wanted to come he likes you lena he said reaching for her no no scenes i want him to see me drink champagne and wave like the others then well take a taxi home and thats the end ill come back he said hurrying hearing the loud bursts of english near the mens room no you wont not now she said simply nodding toward all the uniforms on the platform ill come back for you he said looking at her until she raised her eyes again her face softening no longer public she shook her head slowly glancing to see if the others were still away then put her hand up to his cheek and held it there for a moment her eyes on him as if she were trying to memorize his face no but think of me sometimes she said he stood there just looking lena he said moving his face against her hand but then she dropped it a quick graze as she looked over his shoulder my god its renate she said pulling away they called her too shes crazyits not safe for her he heard the platform noises again the private second gone when he turned he saw renates knowing sharp eyes which had taken in lenas hand the way they noticed everything his best tipster off the books because you couldnt hire jews but she just smiled pretending not to have seen hello joe what do you know she said american slang an endless joke hey its renate the boys back on the platform surrounding them berlin closing in again he tried to catch lenas eye but she avoided him hanging back with emil helping hal pour champagne into cups more drinks and jokes renate brazenly cadging a cigarette from a passing policeman with a flirtatious thankyou just to prove she could do it while hal looked on appalled with the train whistle there was a final round of hugs crushing the flowers emil shook jakes hand looking relieved that the party was coming to an end any news on the visa jake said to renate embracing her she shook her head soon she said not meaning it bright eyes a head full of dark curls the train attendant was closing doors jacob lenas voice then her face next to his a formal kiss on each side light leaving only the smell of her skin he looked at her but there was nothing to say not even her name and the hands at his back were pushing him onto the train he stood on the stairs as the train began to move waving hearing drunken auf wiedersehens and when she took a step forward he thought for a second wildly that she would do it run after the train and come with him but it was only a step a push from the crowd so that the last thing he saw in berlin was her standing still on the platform with emils arm around her shoulder the rubble women had stopped moving their pails scrambling over the bricks to the middle of the building one of them shouted down to the street where another group picked up a stretcher from a cart and followed jake watched them lift a body out of the debris turning their faces away from the smell and swing it onto the stretcher as indifferently as if it were another load of bricks the stretcher team plodded back stumbling under the weight then overturned it into a cart a woman her hair singed away where did they take the bodies some big potters field in the brandenburg marshes more likely a furnace to finish the burning renate would have died like that her sharp eyes finally dulled unless she had somehow survived become one of the living skeletons hed seen in the camp their eyes dull too half alive the crime so big that no one did it but theyd kept records in the camps the long roll calls it was only here under the bricks that a numberless body could vanish without a trace he ran over to the cart and looked down a stocky faceless body not lena not anybody he turned away this was as pointless as frau dzuris the living didnt vanish emil had been at the kwitheyd know something army records if hed been in the war pow lists all it took was time shed be somewhere not on a cart maybe even waiting for him in one of bernies questionnaires bernie however was out called to an unexpected meeting according to the message tacked on his office door so jake walked over to the press camp instead everyone was there drinking beer and looking bored the typing tables littered with rons bland releases stalin had arrived churchill had called on truman the first plenary session would start at five a reception had been arranged by the russians not much is it boyo brian stanley said a full whiskey glass in his hand what are you doing here coming over to the other side better booze he said sipping i had hoped for a little information but as you can see he let one of the releases fall to the bar i saw you with churchill he say anything course not but at least he said it to me special to the express very nice but not so nice for the others brian smiled mad as hornets they are so i thought id poke around here for a bit stay out of harms way he took another sip theres no story you know cant even get eden we ought to just pack it in and instead theres tomorrow to worry about want to see what our lots handing out he reached into his pocket and passed over another release three thousand linen sheets five hundred ashtrayswhats this preparation for the conference last blowout of the war by the size of it try getting a story out of that three thousand rolls of toilet paper jake said all from london now whereve they been hiding it you wonder havent seen decent loo paper in years he took back the sheet shaking his head heres the one a hundred and fifty bottles of button polish broke but still gleaming youre not going to print this he shrugged what about you anything not today i went into town theyre still digging up bodies brian made a face i havent the stomach i really havent youre getting soft it never bothered you in africa well that was the war i dont know what this is he took a sip from his glass brooding lovely to be back in cairo wouldnt it sit on the terrace and watch the boats just the thing after this drifting feluccas white triangles waiting for a hint of a breeze a million miles away youd be in london in a week i dont think so you know brian said seriously its the boats for me now thats the whiskey talking when a mans tired of london jake quoted brian looked at the glass thats when we were on the way up i dont want to see us go down bit by bit its finished there too just the russians now theres your story and youre welcome to it i havent got the stomach anymore awful people and theres us brian sighed the lucky americans you dont need to count the loo paper do you just streams out what will you do i wonder go home no youll stay youll want to put things right thats your particular bit of foolishness youll want to put things right somebody has to do they well then i anoint you why not he put his hand on jakes head good luck and god bless im for the boats dont you guys ever work a voice coming up from behind liz my darling brian said instantly hearty the lady with the lens come have a drink i hear miss bourkewhites on her way up yours too brian laughed ooo he got up from his stool here darling have a seat id better push off go polish my buttons probably the last time we get to sit at the high table so we like to look our best whats he talking about she said watching him walk away hes just being brian here jake took out a match to light her cigarette what have you been doing she said inhaling holding up the bar no i went into town god why look at the message boards charred bodies oh she glanced up at him any luck he shook his head and handed her a release the russians are giving a banquet tonight i know theyre also posing she looked at her watch in about an hour in potsdam take me with you cant theyd have my head no press remember ill carry your camera youd never get through special pass she said showing hers yes i would just bat your baby blues the russians cant read anyway come on liz she wont be in potsdam jake she said looking at him i cant sit around here it just makes it worse anyway i still need to file something were taking pictures thats all but id be there see it at least anythings better than this he said picking up the release come on ill buy you that drink later ive had better offers how do you know she laughed and got up from the stool meet me outside in five if theres any trouble i dont know you understood i dont know how you got in the jeep serve you right if they hauled you away youre a pal yeah she handed him a camera theyre brown by the way not blue in case you havent noticed another photographer was at the wheel so jake crammed in the back with the equipment watching lizs hair flying in the wind next to the aerial flag they drove south toward babelsberg the old route to the film studios and met the first russian sentry on the lange brucke he looked at the drivers pass pretending to understand english and waved them through with a machine gun the entire town had been cordoned off lines of russian soldiers posted at regular intervals up to wilhelmplatz which seemed to have got the worst of the bomb damage they swung behind the square and then out the designated route along the neuer garten the large villas facing the park wall looking empty but intact lucky survivors after berlin it was a haven somewhere out of the war jake almost expected to see the usual old ladies in hats walking their dogs on the formal paths instead there were more russians with machine guns stretched along the lakeshore as if they were expecting an amphibious assault the cecilienhof was at the end of the park a big heap of stockbroker tudor with brick chimneys and leaded windows an unexpected piece of surrey on the edge of the jungfernsee there were guards posted at the park gates more menacingly correct but no more thorough than the first set on the bridge then a long gravel drive to the palace forecourt where mps and british soldiers mingled with their russian hosts they parked near a row of official black cars through the opening to the inner courtyard they could see hundreds of red geraniums planted in the shape of a huge soviet star an ostentatious display of property rights but before liz could photograph it a liaison officer directed them around the building to the lawn that fronted the lake here on the terrace next to a small topiary garden three wicker chairs had been set out for the picture session a small army of photographers and newsreel cameramen were already in place smoking and setting up tripods and shooting uneasy glances toward the patrolling guards as long as youre here you might as well be useful liz said handing jake two cameras while she loaded a third one of the guards came by to inspect the cases so where are they probably having a lastminute comb liz said he imagined stalin in front of a mirror smoothing back the sides of his hair for history then there was nothing to do but wait he studied the building for detailsthe doubleheight bay windows with their view of the lake presumably the conference room the chimneys of patterned brick too numerous to count but there was no story in any of it just architecture the lawn had been mowed the hedges trimmed everything as tidy as a set shipped down the road from the soundstages in babelsberg a few miles away the rubble women were dumping bodies in a cart here a breeze was blowing in from the lake the waves flashing in the sun like tiny reflectors the view was lovely he wondered if crown prince wilhelm used to walk across the lawn towel in hand for a morning dip but the past seemed as unlikely as stalins comb no sailboats now just the russian sentries standing back from the water hands resting on their guns churchill was first he came onto the terrace in his khaki uniform holding a cigar and talking to a group of aides then truman jaunty in a gray doublebreasted suit trading jokes with byrnes and admiral leahy finally stalin in a dazzling white tunic his short frame dwarfed by a circle of guards there were a few informal shots as they shook hands then a flurry of taking seats aides crowding around to settle them in churchill handed a soldier his cigar truman tugged at his jacket so it wouldnt ride up as he sat had the places been decided beforehand truman was in the middle his wirerimmed glasses catching the light each time he turned his head from one to the other everyone smiling casual as if they were posing for a group shot at a class reunion truman crossed his legs revealing a pair of ribbed silk socks the cameras clicked jake turned when he heard the shout sharp in russian now what a soldier at the lakes edge was calling out pointing at something in the water surprisingly he waded in wetting his boots shouting again for help on the terrace some of the aides glanced toward the water then turned back to the photographers frowning at the interruption jake watched fascinated as the russian soldiers began pulling a body to the shore another floater like one of the bodies in the landwehrkanal but this one in uniform indefinable at this distance still more interesting than chimneys he started down the lawn no one stopped him the other guards had left their posts and were running toward the body confused looking toward the palace for instructions the first soldier wet now to the knees was pulling the body up on the mud he dropped the lifeless arm then grabbed the belt for better leverage and yanked a final heave to the grass suddenly the belt gave way and jake saw that it was a kind of pouch ripped now and spilling open the wind from the lake catching bits of paper and blowing them over the grass jake stopped not paper money bills whirling up then floating in the air like hundreds of little kites the sky a surreal moment filled with money the russians stood still for a second amazed then lunged for the bills grabbing them out of the air another gust sent them higher so the guards now had to leap up no longer soldiers but astonished children snatching candy everyone on the terrace stood to watch a few of the russian officers ran down to restore order brushing past bills scattering across the lawn they shouted to the guards but no one listened yelling instead to each other as they chased the flying paper stamping the ground to hold down the bills and stuffing them into their pockets so much money blowing like confetti jake picked one up occupation marks hundreds maybe thousands of them so much money now the photographers began to break ranks and head for the lake too until the russian officers turned on them holding them back with pointed guns but jake was already there he went over to the body an american uniform the torn money belt lying in the mud some of the notes drifting back into the water but what was he doing here floating in the russian zone to the most heavily guarded lawn in berlin jake knelt down to the body a face sickly white and puffy from the water the tag chain at his neck hanging to the side he reached for the tags then stopped thrown no need not just any soldier the shock of a corpse you knew the boy on the flight from frankfurt whiteknuckled clasping the bench in fear his fingers outstretched now shriveled it was then stupefied that jake noticed the bullet hole the dark matted fabric where the blood had been behind him men were still shouting in russian but suddenly he was back in one of those chicago rooms everything disrupted the eyes were open only one riding boot the other pulled away by the water how long had he been dead he felt the jaw clenched tight but there was no coroner to turn to nobody dusting for prints he felt the blunt tip of a gun in his back snell the russian commanded evidently his one word of german jake looked up another soldier pointing a gun was waving him away as he stood the other grabbed the camera saying something in russian the first soldier poked the gun again until jake raised his hands and turned around on the terrace the big three were being hustled into the house only stalin still rooted to the spot assessing an anxious look like the one from the chancellery steps a sharp crack of rifle fire startled the air a few birds bolted up out of the reeds the men on the terrace froze then hurried quickly into the building jake looked toward the sound of the shot a russian officer firing into the air to stop the riot in the silence that followed the guards stood still watching the rest of the money blow toward the neuer garten sheepish now afraid of what would follow their perfectly arranged afternoon turned squalid an embarrassment the officers ordered them into line and took back the notes jakes russian pointed again to the house lieutenant tully who was afraid of flying four russians were picking him up flinging the money belt onto his chest as if it were evidence but of what so much money can i have my camera back jake said but the russian yelled at him and pushed him forward with the gun back to the photographers the lawn was swarming with aides now directing everyone back to the cars like tour leaders apologies for the disruption as if tully were a drunk whod spoiled the party the russian guards watched sullen their one piece of luck blown away sorry jake said to liz they took the camera youre lucky you didnt get shot what were you doing down there it was the guy from the plane what guy tully the kid with the boots but how lets go lets go a brusque mr funs over they were herded behind the others to the car park before they reached the gravel jake turned looking back toward the lake what the hell was he doing in potsdam he said to himself maybe hes with the delegation jake shook his head does it matter maybe he fell in the lake he turned to her he was shot liz looked at him then nervously back to the cars come on jake lets get out of here but why potsdam in the park a few of the bills still bounced along the grass like leaves waiting to be raked with all that money did you get any he uncrumpled the salvaged note in his hand a hundred marks liz said lucky you ten whole dollars but thered been more thousands more and a man with a bullet in his chest come on the others have gone liz said back to the press camp to drink beer jake smiled to himself his mind racing no longer walking dazed through ruins a crime the way in his berlin story i i occupation chapter three word had already gotten around the press camp by the time jake got back just the man im looking for tommy ottinger said looming over the typewriter jake was using to peck out some notes first thing thats happened all week and there you are right on the spot how by the way jake smiled just taking some pictures and and nothing dead soldier washed up in the lake come on ive got to go on tonight you can take your own sweet time with colliers who was he how would i know well you might have checked his tags tommy said waiting i wish id thought of that tommy stared at him really jake said some reporter what does ron say a john doe no tags jake looked at him for a second thinking so why did you ask me cause i dont trust ron i trust you look tommy heres what i know a stiff washes up dead about a day id say he had some money on him which got the russians all excited the big three left in a hurry ill give you my notes use whatever you want stalins faceits a nice touch he stopped meeting tommys stare he had tags i just didnt look so why would ron tommy smiled and took a chair because thats what ron does covers ass his own the armys we dont want to embarrass the army especially in front of the russians why would they be embarrassed they dont know what they have yet except a soldier in potsdam and thats embarrassing it might be tommy said lighting a cigarette potsdams the biggest black market center in berlin i thought the reichstag the reichstag zoo station but potsdams the biggest why because its in the russian zone tommy said simply surprised at the question no mps the russians dont care they are the black market theyll buy anything the othersthe mpsll make a sweep every once in a while arrest a few germans just to keep up appearances not that it matters the russians dont even bother every days saturday on main street in potsdam jake smiled so he wasnt attending the conference not a chance and ron doesnt want his mother to read about her boy in the papers not that way tommy looked behind jake do you ron i want to talk to you ron said to jake visibly annoyed whered you get the pass i didnt nobody asked jake said you know weve got a waiting list for press credentials here i could free up a slot any time i want relax i didnt see a thing see he waved at the paper in the typewriter geranium star lots of chimneys local color thats all unless youve got an id for me ron sighed dont push me on this okay the russians find out there was press there theyll make a formal protest and ill have your ass out of here on the first truck jake spread his hands ill never go to potsdam again okay now have a beer and tell us where the body is the russians have it were trying to get it released why the delay theres no delay theyre fucking russians he paused its probably the money theyre trying to figure out how much they can keep he glanced at jake how much did he have no idea a lot thousands double whatever they give you im on tonight tommy said you going to have an official statement i dont have an official anything ron said as far as i know somebody got drunk and fell in the lake if you think thats a story be my guest jake looked at him no tags no bullet but ron was rushing on we will have a release on the first session though in a couple of hours if anybody cares warm greetings were exchanged by the allies tommy said generalissimo stalin made a statement expressing a wish for a lasting peace an agenda for the conference was approved ron grinned and to think you werent even there no wonder youre the best and a soldier happened to fall in the lake thats what they tell me he turned to jake stay in town i mean it jake watched him walk off when did the russians close off potsdam he said to tommy over the weekend before the conference he looked at jake what hed only been in the water a day how do you know tommy said alert jake waved his hand i dont for sure but he wasnt that bloated so so how did he get into potsdam if it was closed off what the hell you did tommy said watching him of course you have an honest face the piano music was coming through the open windows not mendelssohn this time but broadway party songs inside the house was filled with uniforms and smoke and the clink of glasses gelferstrasse was entertaining jake stood for a minute in the hall watching there was the usual hum of conversation laced with russian from a group standing near the spread of cold cuts and the usual music but it was a cocktail party without women oddly dispirited looking for someone to flirt with men stood in groups talking shop or sometimes not saying anything at all lifting glasses from the trays passed by the old couple and tossing them back quickly as if they knew already that nothing better was going to come along the host seemed to be colonel muller whose silver hair moved through the crowd as he introduced people occasionally getting clamped on the shoulder by a friendly russian as awkward and unlikely in the role as judge hardy himself would have been jake headed for the stairs geismar come in muller said handing him a glass sorry we had to requisition the dining room but theres plenty of grub youre welcome to whatevers left in fact the dining table pushed against the wall was still heaped with ham and salami and smoked fish a banquet whats the occasion were having the russians over muller said making them sound like a couple they like parties they invite us to karlshorst then we invite them here back and forth it greases the wheels with vodka muller smiled they dont mind bourbon either let me take a rain check i cant speak a word of russian a few of them speak german anyway in a while it wont matter its always a little awkward at first he said looking toward the party but after theyve had a few they just say things in russian and you nod and they laugh and were all good fellows allies and brothers actually yes its important to them this stuff they dont like being left out so we dont he took a drink this isnt what it looks like its work jake held up his glass and somebodys got to do it muller nodded thats right somebody does nobody told me id end up feeding drinks to russians but thats what we do now so i do it and i could use a new face to liven things up he smiled besides you owe me a favor lieutenant erlich says im supposed to chew you out but im going to let it pass youre supposed to you mean who am i i guess we didnt meet with the congressman giving speeches im colonel muller fred he said extending his hand i work for general clay doing what i look after some of the functional departments keep them in line when i have to lieutenant erlichs one of them jake smiled somebodys got to do it muller nodded again id take the russians any day theyre touchy but they dont write home your bunch is more trouble so why are you going to let it pass you getting out to potsdam ordinarily i wouldnt but i dont see that its done anybody any harm he paused i served with general patton he said to look out for you you were a friend to the army everybodys a friend to the army you wouldnt know it from the papers back home they come over here dont know the first thing just point fingers to get themselves noticed maybe im no different maybe not but a man puts in time with the army hes more likely to see the whole thing not try to make a mountain out of a molehill jake looked over the rim of his glass i found a mans body and so far nobodys even asked me about it is that the molehill you had in mind muller stared back all right im asking you is there anything we should know i know he was shot i know he was carrying a lot of cash i may be a friend to the army but you try to keep what i do know quiet and its like waving red meat at a dog i get curious muller sighed nobodys trying to hide anything he looked away at the party then back at jake nobodys going to start anything either there are almost two hundred reporters assigned to berlin theyre all looking for something to write about so they go see the bunker cash in some cigarettes over at zoo station next thing you know everybodys in the black market well maybe everybody is a little whats ordinary here isnt ordinary at home is it ordinary to get shot more than youd think he said wearily the wars not over here look at them he said indicating the russians toasts their men are still all over drunk half the time last week a jeepload of them start waving guns down in hermannplatzour zoneand before you could say boo one of our mps starts shooting and were back at the ok corral three dead one ours so we protest to the russians and they protest back and there are still three people dead ordinary he turned to face jake his eyes gentle look were not angels here you know what an occupation army does it occupies they pull guard duty they stand in front of buildings theyve got nothing but time so they bitch and chase girls and make a little money selling their px rations which theyre not supposed to do but they figure theyre entitled they won the war and maybe theyre right and sometimes they get into trouble sometimes they even get shot it happens he paused but it doesnt have to be an international incident and it doesnt have to make the army look bad its what happens here but theyll file a report its still not that ordinary is it and you want to see it im curious thats all i never found a body before muller looked at him appraising it might take a while we dont know who he is yet i know who he is muller raised his eyes i thought there werent any tags i knew his face we were on the plane together lieutenant tully muller said nothing just stared then slowly nodded his head come to my office tomorrow ill see what i can do elssholzstrasse which is where schoneberg behind kleist park the drivers will know the old supreme court thats right muller said surprised it was the best we could find not too much damage maybe god has a soft spot for judges even nazi judges take grinned by the way did anyone ever tell you i know judge hardy i suppose it could be worse i dont know i havent seen the movies he glanced at jake tomorrow then thats two favors you owe me now come and meet some russians sounds like things are revving up he motioned toward the front room where the piano had switched from cole porter to a thumping russian song theyre the real story in berlin you know theyve been running things for two monthsits their town and look at it remind me to show you another report tomorrow infant mortality six out of ten babies are going to die here this month maybe more die of course thats politics scandal sells papers im not looking for any scandal jake said quietly no you might find some though muller said his voice weary again i dont suppose your lieutenant was up to much good but if you ask me thats not the real scandal six out often not just one soldier lifes eheap in berlin try that story i have all the facts you need for that one he stopped catching himself and finished off his drink well lets go promote some allied cooperation they seem to be doing all right jake said trying to be light its turning into a russian party it always does muller said we just bring the food but language had divided the party into its own occupation zones the russians jake met nodded formally tried a few words in german and retreated back into their steady drinking the piano had returned to the american zone with the lady is a tramp but the russian player hovered behind ready to reclaim the keyboard for his side even the laughter getting louder came from isolated pockets separated by untranslatable jokes only liz gliding in with a quick wink to jake seemed to bring the party together suddenly drawing both sets of eager uniforms around her like scarlett at the barbecue jake looked around the room hoping to find bernie and his armload of questionnaires but got caught instead by a burly russian covered with medals who knew english and surprisingly also knew jake you traveled with general patton he said his eyes twinkling i read your dispatches you did how its not forbidden you know to read our allies he nodded sikorsky he said introducing himself his voice accented but amused and sure of itself an officers gift of rank in this case i confess we were interested to know where you were a very energetic soldier general patton we thought he might even reach russia his face fleshy but not yet sagging with jowls creased with good humor i read your description of camp dora before the general pulled back to your own zone i dont think he was thinking much about zones then just germans of course as you say sikorsky said gracefully you saw nordhausen then i saw it too a remarkable place yes remarkable jake said the word absurdly inadequate the underground rocket factory two vast tunnels into the mountain crisscrossed with shafts hollowed out by walking corpses in striped pajamas ingenious to put it there safe from bombs how was it possible we wondered with slave labor jake said flatly yes the russian said nodding solemnly but still remarkable we called it aladdins cave whole production lines some of the vs still waiting assembled machine shops and tunnels full of parts dripping with moisture from the rock bodies scattered in dark corners because no one had bothered to clear them away in the frantic last days of course the russian went on there were no treasures in the cave when we got there what could have happened do you think i dont know the germans must have moved it all somewhere hmm but where you didnt see anything yourself just the endless line of american trucks hauling their spoils west crates of documents tons of equipment pieces of rockets on flatbeds seen but not reportedthe generals request when he became a friend to the army no i saw the gantries where they hanged the prisoners that was enough for me and the camps yes i remember the hand you could not shake off jake looked at him surprised you did read the piece well you know we were interested in nordhausen such a nuzzle so much to vanish like that what is the expression a disappearing trick strange things happen in wartime in peace too i think at our zeiss works for examplefour people he waved his fingers like that into thin air another disappearing trick telling stories out of school vassily muller said joining them mr geismar has not heard about our trouble at the zeiss factory i thought perhaps he would be interested now vassily well save that for the council meeting you know we cant control what people do sometimes they vote with their feet sometimes they are given transportation the russian replied quickly under nacht und nebel night and fog the old nighttime arrests that was himmlers technique muller said not the american armys still one hears these stories and people vanish we hear them too muller said carefully in the american zone berlin is full of rumors but if they are true this one isnt muller said ah the russian said so its a mystery like nordhausen he said to jake then lifted his empty glass in a mock toast and politely headed away for a refill what was that jake said the russians are accusing us of snatching some scientists from their zone which we wouldnt do which we wouldnt do muller said they would though so they always suspect the worst theyre still kidnapping people mostly political not as bad as in the beginning but they still do it we protest so they protest like having each other over for drinks muller smiled in a way and whats zeiss optical works bomb sights precision lenses the germans were way ahead of us there but not for long muller shrugged you never stop do you i cant help you with this one a few engineers took off thats all the story i know if it is a story personally i wouldnt blame anyone for trying to get out of the russian zone so our friends just blowing smoke well thats what they do best dont let him fool you just because he speaks english doesnt mean hes a friend who is he exactly vassily general sikorsky hes at the council does a little bit of everything like all the comrades but our counterintelligence boys know him so i always thought he had a finger in that pie maybe even a kidnapping or two i wouldnt put it past him so i should watch my back you muller smiled amused dont worry even the russians wouldnt want a reporter jake moved past the front parlor where a group had begun singing and down the hall toward the french doors in the back open to let the smoke drift out it was still light the late light of a northern summer and he looked at the muddy garden where grass and canvas chairs must have been now trampled over and uprooted like everything else in berlin there had been mud at nordhausen too so much that the trucks had slid in it spattering the work party as they roared away with aladdins treasures no nacht und nebel just gumchewing t units loading their convoys of steel prizes for the trip west where now somewhere over the rhine maybe even already in america getting ready for the next war if he asked now hed be told it had never happened a disappearing trick and hed let that story go without a qualm happy to oblige because there was always another until suddenly they were gone all the big war stories leaving nothing but rubble hey jackson liz said standing hesitantly in the doorway as if she were afraid to interrupt whats up nothing just arguing with myself who won she said coming over jake smiled my better instincts that must have been close she lit a cigarette offering him one catch any flak about today not much nobody seems to think its anything special they wonder why i care why do you jake shrugged its an old superstition if a story falls in your lap its bad luck to waste it old superstition sorry about the camera no i got it back a nice russian brought it to the press camp seemed to think i might go out with him me being so grateful they didnt use to ask i hear he looked over at her i wish id used it in case i need to prove he was shot theyre denying it no but theyre not shouting about it either i dont know why not a soldier shot in the russian zoneyoud think theyd be jumping up and down they spend half the time here squawking at each other he jerked a thumb toward the party so why not this time liz shook her head nobody wants to raise a stink while the conference is on no i know the army somethingsoff nobody just gets shot what was he doing here you met him he say anything to you on the plane no she said he was too busy trying to keep his stomach in one place i was thinking about that too why fly if you hate it so much what was important enough to get him on a plane oh jake lots of people fly maybe he was ordered hes in the army you know was then why didnt somebody meet him if he was ordered remember that at the airport frankly no where was he everybody else had a ride he took a breath theres something liz sighed okay have it your way sherlock you going to need some pictures a little strong for colliers jake smiled maybe i have something else in mind too liz raised her eyebrows track down the old office staff see what happened to them berlin stories theyd use those pictures if youre interested youre on old friends she said not just one no he said ignoring it everybody i can find i want to know what happened here not just in the bunker this other thingi dont know maybe youre right maybe theres nothing he paused thinking except the money theres always a story in money liz dropped her cigarette and rubbed it out well you keep arguing with yourself let me know how it comes out looks like im off she said glancing through the door again can i help it if im popular before she could move away a tall soldier vaguely familiar came to the door ill be with you in a sec she said to him clearly not wanting him to come out he lifted his beer bottle and turned back in to the house the lucky guy not yet but he says he knows a good jazz club ill bet jake looked through the door ah he said remembering the congressmans driver liz dont be a snob she said slightly flustered anyway hes not a driver hes an officer and a gentleman are any of you at least this one doesnt talk with his mouth full jake laughed that sounds like the real thing no she said looking straight at him thats when somebody comes back for you four years later but hell do he started to follow her inside but a roar of laughter like a blast of warm air caught him at the door and turned him around he wanted to be in his berlin sipping beer in some fading garden light not in this odd pocket of allied goodwill glasses clinking like fencing swords but that berlin had been gone for years packed away with the garden lanterns into cellars he crossed the garden and opened the back gate a footpath not wide enough to be an alley fed into the next street all the houses were quietno dinner conversation coming through the windows no radioas if they were hunkered down waiting for the party noise in gelferstrasse to become a brawl another raid that might pass over in the silence you could hear your feet he turned down one of the narrow roads that led to the institute grounds where the streets were named for scientists not generals and hohenzollerns farradayweg emil had worked here miles away from pariserstrasse in his own world the district still had the leafy enclave feel of a university but now windows were knocked out the chemistry building half charred a roof gone at the far end of the street he could see lights in a modern brick building but the institute itself was dark still the main building was standing thielallee a big folly of a building spiked round turrets on each corner like kaiser helmets pickelhaubes he walked up the steps to look more closely maybe it was still operational somewhere he could ask tomorrow nein nein jake started in the quiet a voice as surprising as a shot he turned an old man walking a scrawny dog wearing a jacket and a tweed hunters hat as if he were expecting the summer evening to turn chilly the dog made a noise almost a growl then leaned against the mans leg too listless to make the effort the man wagged his finger at jake correcting him then pointed to the brick building across the intersection kommandatura he said loudly pointing again kommandatura each syllable pronounced slowly instructions to a lost foreigner no i was looking for the institute jake said in german closed the man said automatically but now it was his turn to start surprised to hear german yes do you know when it opens in the morning it doesnt open its closed kaput he dipped his head reflex manners forgive me i thoughtan american i thought you were looking for the kommandatura come schatzie the berlin kommandatura jake said coming down before he could move away thats it he looked toward the brick building now taking in the flags the windows with lights burning thin square columns to give it an entrance what was it before the dog began sniffing at his leg so jake leaned over and patted her a gesture that seemed to surprise the old man more than his speaking german an insurance company the man answered fire insurance it was a joke you know the one building that didnt burn he looked down at the dog still sniffing jakes hand dont worry she wont trouble you not so much energy these days its the food you see i have to share my ration with her and its not enough jake stood up noticing now the mans own skinny frame a heartless illustration of the old saw that owners resembled their pets but the scraps at gelferstrasse were blocks away instead he took out a pack cigarette the old man took it and bowed thank you you dont mind if i save it for later he said carefully tucking it into his pocket here save that one smoke this jake said suddenly wanting company the man looked at it amazed at his windfall then nodded and bent over to the lighter you are about to see something interesting a cigarette in berlin actually being smoked its another joke one sells to another and another but who smokes them he inhaled then leaned his hand against jakes upper arm forgive me a little dizziness thank you how is it that you speak german he said making conversation his tongue set loose by tobacco i lived in berlin before the war ah its not the best you know your german you should study a voice from a classroom jake laughed yes he said then nodded toward the mans pocket how much will you get for it five marks maybe its for her he looked down at the dog im not complaining things are as they are but its difficult to see her like this how can you feed a dog they say when people are hungry but what should i do let her die an innocent who else is so innocent in berlin thats what i say to themwhen youre innocent ill feed you too that shuts them up theyre the worst the golden pheasants jake looked at him lost now wondering if hed found not a man in the street but a crank golden pheasants the big party members now of course they know nothing you brought this on us i say to them and you want to eat id rather feed a dog a dog so theyre still around the old man smiled crookedly no there are no nazis in berlin not one only social democrats so many all those years how could the party have survived with so many against them well its a question he took another drag and stared at the glowing tip all social democrats now the bastards they threw me out he looked toward the institute building years of work ill never make it up now never its all kaput youre a jew he snorted if i were a jew id be dead they had to leave right away the rest of us they waited hoping we would join then it was an orderparty member or out so i was out i really was a social democrat he smiled of course you may not believe me but you can check the records you were at the institute jake said interested now since he said proudly they had places you see after the influenza so i was lucky it counted for something then just to be here well those days i remember when we got the measurements from the eclipse for einsteins theory he said a teacher explaining catching jakes blank expression if light had mass then gravity would bend the rays starlight the eclipse made it possible to measure einstein said it would be seconds of an arc the angle and do you know what it was so close can you imagine in that one minute everything changed everything newton was wrong the whole world changed right here in berlin right here he extended his arm toward the building his voice following it in some private reverie so then what champagne of course but the talk all night talking we thought we could do anythingthat was german science until the gangsters then down the drain i had a friend at the institute jake said breaking in before the old man could drift further im trying to locate him thats why perhaps you knew him emil brandt the mathematician yes of course emil you were his friend yes jake said his friend i was hoping someone would know where he is you dont no no its many years but do you know what happened to him that i couldnt say i left the institute you see and he stayed jake said slowly piecing together dates but he wasnt a nazi my friend anyone who was here after he stopped seeing jakes face and looked away but perhaps he was a special case he dropped his cigarette thank you again i must say good evening now the curfew i knew him jake said he wasnt like that like what goering many people joined not just the swine people do what they have to do you didnt he shrugged and what did it matter emil was young a fine mind i remember that numbers he could see in his head not just on paper who can say whats right to give up your work for politics maybe he loved science more and in the end he paused looking again at the building then back at jake you disturb yourself over this i can see it let me tell you something for the price of a cigarette the eclipse in the freikorps were fighting in the streets then i myself saw bodies spartakists in the landwehrkanal who remembers now old politics footnotes but in that building we changed the world so whats important a party card i dont judge your friend we are not all criminals just the golden pheasants a mild smile conceding the point yes them i dont forgive im not yet a saint what does it mean anyway golden pheasants who knows bright feathersthe uniforms the wives left in fur coats before the russians came maybe it was that they flew out of the bushes as soon as they heard the first shots ha he said the joke for himself maybe thats why there are no nazis in berlin he stopped and looked again at jake it was a formality you know just a formality he tipped his hat good night jake stood for a minute in front of the gloomy institute unsettled emil must have joined there wouldnt have been any exceptions but why did it surprise him millions had a formality except jake hadnt known all that time something unsaid a pleasant man with gentle eyes quiet at parties diffident who saw numbers in his headsomeone jake never thought about at all not a nazi one of the good germans standing with his arm around lena had she known how could he not tell her and how could she stay with him knowing but she had it was getting dark so he started down thielallee a jeep had pulled up in front of the kommandatura dropping off two soldiers who hurried up the stairs with briefcases new politics soon to be as old as the freikorps what was important people do what they have to do she had stayed jake had left that simple except emil wasnt simple anymore which changed things had she known those afternoons when they drew the shades to keep berlin outside jake felt suddenly disoriented his mental map redrawn like the citys streets no longer where they were supposed to be when he turned right off thielallee he saw confused that he was literally lost the side street didnt connect back to gelferstrasse as hed thought it would and your german isnt the best either anymore he thought to himself smiling but he had never known this part of town the streets here had always gone this way it was the other berlin the one he had known where you now needed a compass to find your way some needle pulled by gravity strong enough to bend starlight contents previous chapter next chapter chapter four almost all the other buildings in elssholzstrasse had been knocked out so the control council headquarters stood even larger now a massive hulk of prussian stone its grim streetfront must have seemed an appropriate way station in the old court days when the judges inside party members all had sentenced their victims to worse prisons the main entrance however around the driveway into kleist park presented a lighter face tall windowed doors flanked by carved floating angels who looked down across what had been a formal lawn bordered with hedges toward two symmetrical colonnades at the other end an unexpected piece of paris the whole place was noisy with activitycars crunching on the gravel a work party repairing the roof banging tileslike a country house getting ready for a big weekend party four bright new allied flags had been hung over the entrance nd airborne guards in white spats and shiny helmets were posted at the doorway even the dusty grounds were being tidied up raked by a detachment of german pows the letters stenciled on their backs while a handful of bored gis kept watch standing around idly and taking the sun jake followed a group of husky russian women in uniform through the chandeliered hall and up a grand marble staircase an opera house entrance he was met surprisingly by muller himself i thought you might like a look around muller said heading them down the corridor were still trying to get things in shape place took a fair amount of damage maybe not enough given what it was well we have to use what we can biggest place we could find over four hundred rooms they say although i dont know whos counting maybe they threw in a closet or two of course only part of its usable this is where the council will sit he opened the door to a large chamber already converted to a meeting room with long tables arranged in a square in each corner near their respective flags were desks with shorthand typewriters for recording secretaries a stack of ashtrays and notepads sat on one table waiting to be distributed nobodys been here yet muller said youre the first if that means anything to you jake looked around the empty room feeling he was back at the cecilienhof counting chimneys no press section no press section we dont want to encourage speecheshard to resist with the press around give them an audience they cant help themselves we want working sessions nice and private no he nodded to the recording desks therell be minutes the council will meet once a quarter he continued the coordinating committee once a month the subcommitteeswell all the time theres a lot to do jake fingered the stack of notepads all organized on paper muller said leaning against the table his back to the window so that his silver hair developed a halo of light actually nobody knows how its going to work until we do it were making it up as we go along nobody planned on this running the country he noticed jakes raised eyebrows not this way they trained a few people somewhere down in virginiato help the germans with the transition he said drawing out the word transition i dont know what they expected the last war i suppose get a peace treaty hand the country over to the good guys and go home but not this time there wasnt anybody to hand it over to twelve years even the mailmen were nazis and the countryyouve seen it its just shot to hell nobody expected them to fight to the end why would they you dont expect a whole country to commit suicide they had a little help from bomber command muller nodded i dont say they didnt ask for it but now its flat and weve got it no food nothing runningberlin hq has got its hands full just fixing the water mains he took a breath and looked directly at jake weve got twenty million people to feed in our zone alone the ones who arent starving are stealing bicycles just to get around weve got a winter coming with no coal epidemics if were not lucky which we probably wont be dps he waved his hand as if overwhelmed hed run out of words we didnt sign on for any of this he said his voice as tired as his eyes but weve got it anyway so theres a lot to do he glanced at the room seen enough jake nodded thanks for the look and the speech he added easily you wouldnt be trying to tell me something by any chance muller smiled patiently judge hardy again maybe just a little ive been regular army all my lifewere used to protecting our flanks people who write about mg maybe they should have some idea what were up against a little perspective were not allwell come on ill give you what you came for how did you end up here anyway jake said following him out into the long hall like everyone elsethey dont need us in the field now so weve got to serve our time out somewhere i didnt volunteer if thats what you mean tactical units dont have much use for mg think were just office boys i wasnt any different nobodys going to get a promotion for fixing sewer lines but nobodys getting promoted in the field now eitherthe wars over they tell meand i have a while to go before they pension me off so were long on old farts here the civilians thats something else most of the time its some lawyer who sat out the war in omaha and now wants a commission so he can call himself captainthey wont sign on for the lower ranks they get it too the rank what the rest of us had to work years for it rubs a little if you let it but you dont i did but its like anything elsethe work takes over you serve your country he said flatly without a hint of irony i didnt ask for it but you know what i think were doing one helluva job here given everything or does that sound like another speech to you no jake smiled it sounds like they ought to promote you they wont muller said evenly then stopped and faced him you know this is probably my last post i wouldnt want to seeany mess if youre going to start flinging mud around id appreciate a little early warning im not i know youre just curious so are we a mans been killed and the truth is we have no way of finding out what happened we dont have scotland yard here just some mps arresting drunks so we may never know but if theres anything that might well be a problem for us that we do need to know what makes you think there is i dont but thats what youre fishing for isnt it he started walking again look all im asking is you meet me halfway on this i dont have to release any information if you hadnt been there at potsdambut you were and you knew him so now ive got a situation i cant pretend it didnt happen but i dont have to open this up to a lot of speculation either im releasing it to you not anybody else if you do turn up something okay youve got yourself a story but if i dont then you dont guess out loud no mystery body no unsolved anything you might get some mileage out of that in the papers but all wed get is a lot of questions we cant answer that just eats time we cant afford that theres too much to do all im asking is a little discretion and tell you in advance what im going to say i didnt say you couldnt say it just tell me if its coming so you can deny it no muller said deadpan so i can duck he stopped at a door paned with translucent glass here we are jeanie should have the copies by now jeanie was a pretty wac whose red fingernails seemed too long for serious typing she was putting carbon sheets into two beige folders and threw muller a smile that jake amused guessed was more than secretarial muller however was all business got those reports she handed him one of the folders then a message slip the general wants you at ten come on then he said to jake leading him into a plain office with an american flag in the corner muller belonged to the clean desk schoolthe only things on the empty surface were a pen set and a framed picture of a young soldier your boy jake asked muller nodded he was hit on guadalcanal i m sorry no not killed wounded at least hes out of it now then avoiding any more intimacy he opened the folder took out two carbon flimsies and pushed them across the desk to jake service record casualty report youre calling it a casualty its what we call the report muller said slightly annoyed its just a form anyway now you know what we know jake skimmed the first sheet a spare listing of dates and assignments patrick tully natick mass a little older than the boy in the picture on the desk the casualty report jake could have written himself not much is it he said no what isnt here any trouble before that didnt make it into the record not that i know of service records clean no flags a distinguished member of the united states armed forces thats what were going to write to his mother anyway yes jake said a person not a number a kid with a family not as lucky as young muller what about the money shell get that too with his effects apo money order it was his as far as we know lets hope she thinks he saved his back pay how much was there it doesnt say muller looked at him then nodded fiftysix thousand marks they convert at ten to one so roughly five thousand dollars thats what the russians gave us anyway they say some of it blew away so figure twice that thats a lot of back pay maybe he was good at cards muller said what brings in that kind of money on the black market watches mostly if it ticks the russiansll buy it a mickey mouse can go for five hundred bucks thats still a lot of watches that depends how long he was doing it if he was doing it look on the record there is no black market sometimes supply depots come up a little short things disappear one of the facts of wartime the germans are hungry theyll buy food any way they can its about food naturally were doing what we can to stop it and off the record off the record everybody does it how do you stop a kid in a candy store want to do some quick arithmetic a gfs allowed a carton of cigarettes a week at the px a nickel a pack fifty cents a carton on the street its worth a hundred dollarsthats five thousand dollars a year add in some chocolate four bottles of liquor a month another five thousand dollars a package of food from home maybe some tuna fish a can of soup more lots more it adds up a guy can make a years salary just from his rations you try stopping that officially theres no fraternization either so how do we explain all the vd jake glanced down at the sheet hed only been in germany since may what do you want me to say some of our boys are more enterprising than others you dont have to be a big operator to make money in germany last month our troops were paid about a million dollars they sent three million home he paused off the record jake stared staggered by the figure i didnt think the germans had that much money the germans theyre selling silverware for a stick of margarine whatever theyve got left the russians have the money jake thought of the ragtag guards at the chancellery the peasants wheeling carts through potsdamerplatz as primitive as a muddy village the russians have that kind of money he said dubiously since when muller looked at him since we gave it to them he hesitated how far off the record are we farther every minute muller sat back im going to hold you to that you see the original plan was to issue occupation marks something all the forces could use here and the locals would accept not gum up the works with four different currencies fine so the treasury made up the engraving plates and like idiots gave a set to the russians same money of course the idea was theyd keep a strict accounting of theirs since it would have to be convertible to hard currencydollars pounds whatever instead they just started the presses and kept going nobody knows how much they made most of their troops hadnt been paid in three years they got it all in occupation marks the hitch is they cant take them homethe russians wont convert themand now youve got a whole army with more money than theyve ever seen before in their lives and one place to spend it here so they buy watches and whatever else they can carry home at any price its monopoly money to them and meanwhile since the currency has to be honored our boys take the marks they get and send them home as dollars and the treasury has one hell of a drain on its hands we yell and scream of course but id lay you even moneyin dollarsthat were never going to see one ruble for those plates the russians say their marks just circulate in germany keeping the local wheels goingthe germans tab and we have a small problem explaining why so many are flooding back home since there is no black marketso we pay were paying in fact for the russian occupation here but nobody wants to touch that story he smiled and neither do you im not even sure i understand it nobody understands money except whats in his pocket which is lucky for the treasury if wed pulled a stunt like that theyd courtmartial us out of here in no time so what are you going to do about it thats the ten oclock meeting general clay wants to limit the amount a man can send home to his actual pay itll be a headache for the apo just keeping track and it wont solve everything but at least itll stop the worst of the bleeding of course they can still send goods home but the money will stay here where it belongs ultimately the only thing thats going to work is a new currency but dont hold your breath how fast do you think the russians would agree to that i mean what are you doing on the ground how do you police it well its a problem mp raids the worst spots from time to time but thats just a little finger in the dike berlins an open citypeople go where they wantbut its just administered in zones so we cant patrol zoo station thats the brits alexanderplatz is in the russian zone like potsdam muller looked up at him like potsdam theres nothing we can do there what about off the street this much moneysomebody must be running things you mean gangs professionals that i dont know and id doubt it you hear rumors about the dps but people like to blame the dps for everything nobody polices them the kind of thing youre talking about youd have to go back to bavaria or frankfurt where theres still something to steal warehouses big hoardings it happens and i suppose frankfurt must have somebody on it if youre interested but berlin its been picked pretty clean what youve got here is a lot of small money that adds up thats a fair description of the numbers racket too a reluctant smile i guess muller paused spreading his hands on the desk look a soldier sells a watch maybe he shouldnt and maybe you dont think were doing enough to stop him but ill tell you thisive seen lots of men die in the last few years ripped up holding their guts in good men kids nobody thought they were criminals then now theyre picking up a few bucks maybe its wrong but you know what im still a soldier i think theyre worth two million a month so do i jake said slowly i just dont like to see them get shot it doesnt seem right for a watch muller looked at him disconcerted then lowered his head no well is there anything else lots but youve got a meeting to get to jake said standing up i dont want to wear out my welcome any time muller said pleasantly also getting up relieved thats what were here for no youre not i appreciate the time jake folded the flimsies into his pocket and these oh one more thing can i see the body the body muller said literally taking a step back in surprise i thought you had seen it isnt that why were here itsgone it was shipped back to frankfurt that was fast no autopsy no muller said slightly puzzled why would there be an autopsy we know how he died should there have been one jake shrugged at least a coroners report he caught mullers expression i know youre not scotland yard its just a little skimpy thats all he said patting the sheets in his pocket it might have helped to examine it i wish youd waited muller looked at him then sighed you know what i wish geismar i wish youd never gone to potsdam jeanie was arranging her set of carbons when he came out she looked up and smiled without stopping like a casino dealer shuffling the third sheet to the bottom then tossing the folder into an out box for filing all set jake smiled back the army never changed a world run in duplicate he wondered if there was another girl to do the filing to save those wonderful nails for now he said still smiling but she took it as a pass arching her eyebrows and shooting him a look were here nine to five she said a dismissal thats good to know he said playing along colonel keep you pretty busy all the livelong day stairs are down the hall to your right thanks he said lifting his fingers to his forehead in a salute on the entrance steps he was blinded by the light and shaded his eyes to get his bearing the sun already hot was streaming in from the east filtering through the dust that hung over the ruins beyond the graceful colonnades the work party bent over their rakes had got rid of their shirts but not jake noticed their initials p on one trouser leg w on the other the war had branded everybody even tully now just some initials on a carbon flimsy he stood for a minute his mind full of engraving plates and watch prices all of which led him nowhere which was probably where muller wanted him to go he smiled to himself thinking of jeanie two brushoffs in one morning one more direct than the other it was muller whod taken the circular way around leaving him back on the steps not even sure hed been through a revolving door except something nagged a missing crossword piece that would leap to the eye if you looked at it long enough he told the driver he wanted to walk walk the soldier said amazed you mean back no meet me at zoo station in about an hour you know where that is the soldier nodded sure its a hike from here i know i like to walk helps me think explaining himself he made a mental note to ask ron for his own jeep but the soldier like jeanie had been around i get it you sure you dont want me to drop you i mean i dont care its your business everybody does it jake thought as he headed across the battered park a lot of small money that adds up so whom had tully done business with a gunhappy russian a dp with nothing to lose anybody five thousand dollars more people got killed every day in chicago for less just for skimming a numbers collection life would be even cheaper than that here but why come in the first place because the russians were here flush with cash not porcelain knickknacks and old silver to trade cash honey for bears everybody does it the park gates opened onto lower potsdamerstrasse and a small stream of military trucks and civilians on rickety bicycles all that was left of the traffic that used to roar by to the center on foot berlin was a different city not the spectacle hed seen from a touring jeep but something grittier a wreck in closeup he had loved walking in the city exploring the miles of flat irregular streets as if just the physical touch of shoe leather made it personal brought him into its life sundays in the grunewald afternoons wandering through districts where the other journalists never went prenzlauer or the tenement streets in wedding just to see what they were like his eyes gliding from building to building oblivious to curbs now he had to step carefully skirting clumps of broken cement and picking his way through plaster and glass that crunched underfoot the city had become a trail hike full of obstacles and sharp things hidden under stones steel rods twisted into spiky shapes still black from fire the familiar rotting smell at the corner of pallasstrasse the remains of the sportpalast where bicycles used to whiz by in the racing oval and hitler promised the faithful a thousand years only the giant flak tower was standing like the ones at the zoo too sturdy even for boombs a soldier was propped against the wall with one hand talking to a girl and fondling her hair the oldest black market in the world across tile street a few other girls in thin dresses leaned against a standing wall gesturing to convoy trucks at ten oclock in the morning the side streets were clogged with debris so he kept to the main roads turning left on bulowstrasse for the long walk up to the zoo this was a part of town hed known well the elevated station hulking over nollendorfplatz with its ring of bars a movie marquee had slid down to the pavement nearly intact as if the building had been whipped out from under it like the magic trick with a tablecloth a few people were out one of them pushing a baby carriage filled with household goods and jake realized that the dazed plodding movement hed seen from the jeep two days ago was the new pace of the city as careful as his own nobody walked quickly over rubble why would anyone come to berlin had tully been before there must be traveling orders something to check the army ran in duplicate more blocks of collapsed buildings more groups of women in headscarves and old uniform pants cleaning bricks a woman in heels stepped out of one building smartly dressed as if she were heading up the street as usual for some shopping at kadewe instead she wobbled over some broken plaster to a waiting army car and straightened her nylons as she pulled her legs in a different kind of excursion and kadewe in any case was gone ripped through by bombs and sagging into wittenbergplatz not even a window mannequin left they used to meet here sometimes by the wurst stands on the food floor where you were likely to run into anybody then leave separately for jakes flat across the square taking different sides so that jake could see her through the crowd as he waited at the stoplight watching to see that no one followed no one did a game to make it more exciting getting away with something then up the stairs where shed be waiting a ring to make sure hal was out and inside sometimes grabbing each other even before the door clicked shut the flat would be gone now too like the afternoons a memory except it wasnt jake looked across the street shading his eyes again a piece of the building had been knocked out but the rest was there with his corner flat still facing west onto the square he took a step elated then stopped what would he say i used to live here and i want to see it again he imagined another frau dzuris looking puzzled and hoping for chocolate a woman came to the window opening it wider to the air and for an instant he stopped breathing straining to see why couldnt it be but it wasnt lena wasnt anything like lena a truck went by blocking the view and when it passed the broad back was turned to the window so that he couldnt see her face but of course hed know just the movement of her arm at the window even from across the square he dropped his hand feeling foolish a friend of the landlords no doubt eager to snap up the flat when hal finally left someone who wouldnt know him might not even believe hed been there at all why should she the past had been wiped out with the streets but the flat was there real a kind of proof that everything else had happened too if he looked long enough maybe the rest of the square would come back with it busy the way it all used to be he turned away and caught a glimpse of himself in a broken shard of plate glass from the store window nothing was the way it used to be not even him would she recognize him now he stared at the reflection not a stranger but not the man she had known either a livedin face older with two deep lines bracketing his mouth dark hair thinning back from the temples a face he saw every day shaving without noticing it had changed he imagined her looking at him smoothing away lines with her fingers to find him but faces didnt come back either they got cluttered with assignments and frantic telegrams squint lines from seeing too much theyd been kids only four years and look at all the marks his face was still there like the flat but scarred now too not the one hed had before but the war had changed everybody at least he was here not dead or turned into a set of initials pows dps he stopped a tiny nagging jolt initials he took out the carbon sheets and scanned them again that was it he put the top sheet under glanced over the second then automatically shuffled for the third and stopped emptyhanded but jeanie had had three carbons he squinted trying to remember yes three like a stacked deck he stood for another minute thinking then put the sheets away and started up the street again toward the zoo where small amounts of money were being made the driver took him back to bernies office a small room in the old luftwaffe building crammed with files and stacks of questionnaires that spilled off the couch and rose in piles on the floor a mares nest of paper how did he find anything the desk was worse more stacks and loose clippings stale coffee cups even an abandoned tieeverything in fact but bernie who was out again jake flipped open one of the files a buffcolored fragebogen like one lena might have filled out a life on six typed pages but this was herr gephardt whose spotless record deserved he claimed a work permit dont touch anything said a soldier at the door hell know believe it or not any idea when hell be back i keep missing him you the guy from yesterday he said you might be by try the document center hes usually there wasserkafersteig he said breaking it into syllables where the soldier smiled mouthful huh if you hold on a sec ill take youi was just going myself i can find it i just cant spell it they drove west past the press camp to the ubahn station at krumme lanke where a handful of soldiers and civilians huddled in a miniature version of the reichstag market then turned right down a quiet street at the far end jake could see the trees of the grunewald he thought of the old summer sundays with hikers in shorts heading out to the beaches where the havel widened into the series of bays berlin called lakes today in the same hot sun there were only a few people gathering fallen branches and loading them into carts an axe chipped away at a broad stump pathetic isnt it the soldier said they chop down the trees when nobodys looking there wont be anything left by winter a winter with no coal according to muller at the edge of the woods they turned up a narrow street of suburban villas one of which had been turned into a fortress with a high barbedwire double fence floodlights and patrolling sentries theyre not taking any chances jake said dps camp out in the woods once its dark whats in there gold better for us anyway party records he showed a pass at the door then led jake to a signin ledger in the entrance hall another guard was inspecting the briefcase of a soldier on his way out neither spoke the council headquarters had had the busy shoeclicking hum of a government office this was quieter the lockedin hush of a bank one more id check took them into a room lined with filing cabinets christ fort knox jake said berniell be down in the vault the soldier said smiling counting the bars this way whered you get it all jake said looking at the cabinets all over the party kept everything right to the endmembership applications court records guess they never thought theyd lose then they couldnt destroy them fast enough he spread his hand toward the cabinets as they walked we got the ss files too even himmlers personal one the big haul though thats downstairs index cards the central party registry in munich kept duplicates of all the local cardsevery single nazi eight million and counting sent them to a paper mill in bavaria finally to pulp them but before the owner could get around to it the seventh army arrived so voila now weve got them here we go he went down a staircase to the basement teitel you here i found your guy bernie was bent over a broad table whose littered surface was a mirror image of the mess in his office the room an alcoved cellar that might once have held wine was now walled from floor to ceiling with wooden drawers like card catalogues in a library when he looked up his eyes were confused as if he had no idea who jake was sorry to barge in like this jake said i know youre busy but i need your help oh geismar right youre looking for a friend im sorry i forgot all about it he picked up a pen ready to work dont forget to sign him out the driver said to bernie drifting back up the stairs what was the name brandt but i need something else bernie looked up his pen still poised to write jake pulled out a chair a soldier was killed in potsdam yesterdaywell killed the day before he washed up on the conference grounds yesterday hear about it bernie shook his head waiting no i guess not jake said not down here anyway i was there so i got interested he had some money on him a lot five thousand maybe closer to ten i thought that was interesting too but apparently im the only one mg just gave me the brush this morningpolite but a brush this one came with a lecture happens all the time black markets a nickelanddime game no big players nobody gets excited when a russian shoots one of our men just when they do anything else so go away please now im even more interested then i hear the bodys already been shipped back to frankfurt thats a little too efficient especially for mg following me so far who was the brush muller jake said bernie frowned fred muller hes a good man old army i know so they say keep a lid on it and he keeps a lid on it look i dont blame him hes a timeserver and he doesnt want any trouble he probably thinks im a pain in the ass probably but why keep a lid on it he promises me an exclusive and gives me a casualty report but not all of it theres a sheet missing jake paused the kind of thing the das office used to pull bernie smiled so why come to me because you were a da ive never met one yet who stopped being a da somethings funny here you can feel it in your gut bernie looked over at him i dont feel anything yet no try this muller wants me to think its a gi making a few bucks on the side okay not nice but nothing special either but he wasnt just a gi psd thats public safety division isnt it thats what it says on the charts bernie said slowly well thats what it says on the casualty report too psd he was one of you ever met a police department that couldnt be bothered when a cop got shot thats one organization takes care of its own bernie looked at him again then reached over for his coffee cup were not exactly a police department you know he said carefully its not the same but you run the mps you run the local police youre responsible for law and order such as it is i dont run anything youre asking the wrong guy im special branch i just chase rats i know but youre still in the department you must know people anyway youre the only one i know so bernie took another sip of coffee berlin psd no he flew in from frankfurt another interesting point by the way then no wonder fred sent him back put it in somebody elses inbox its the mg way he paused look i dont have time for this whatever it is you want somebody over in cid criminal investigation jake shook his head cids army not military government knife fights this is being handled by public safety he took the sheets out of his pocket here see for yourself bernie put his hand up in a stop sign no i mean it i dont have the time somebody elses inbox jake said bernie put down the cup and sighed what are you looking for anyway why nobody wants to know the way the storys supposed to go is the russians loot we just liberate a few souvenirs ive told it that way myself and public safety the last place youd expect to find a bad apple wrong barrel but my guess is that he had something going not just a couple of cartons of cigarettes and ill bet its mullers guess too the difference is he doesnt want to know and this time i do so would a da mans dead bernie ran his hand through the tight waves of his hair and stood up as if the chair had been confining him he moved a folder onto a pile then walked over to another pretending to be busy im not a da here he said finally im mg too maybe freds right you know the guy closed his own case maybe were all better off except for one thing what if he wasnt acting solo a man comes to berlin to make a deal and ends up dead so who was he coming to see a russian you said he moved another pile must have been but who set it up hes operating all by himself there have to be some other apples in that barrel chances are he had friends its a friendly kind of business friends in public safety bernie said looking up somewhere thats the way it used to work in chicago thats chicago bernie said waving his hand and berlin its always the same more or less heres a big city with no police and a lot of money floating around put out that kind of cheese and the usual mice come out and pretty soon somebody has to organize it to make sure he gets a little more its always the same the only question is whether patrick tully was one of the mice or one of the rats who took a little more who patrick tully the victim jake handed over the sheet to bernie twentythree afraid of flying so why come to berlin who was he coming to see bernie stared at the paper then at jake thats the report jake said half of it anyway maybe the other half can tell me i can tell you bernie said evenly his body finally still he was coming to see me what a word to fill time too surprised to say anything else for a second neither of them spoke bernie looked again at the sheet yesterday he said quietly thinking aloud thats why i canceled you he never showed i told mike to keep an eye out thats probably who he thought you were why he brought you herewere offlimits to press tully was coming to see you jake said still taking it in want to tell me why i have no idea he glanced up that isnt a brush i dont know you didnt ask bernie shrugged people come through from frankfurt all the time somebody from psd requests a meeting what am i supposed to say no half the time theyre just looking for an excuse to come to berlin everybody wants to see it but youre supposed to have a reason for being here so they liaise and fart around in meetings nobody has time for and then go home with five thousand dollars he didnt get it from me if thats what youre asking he said irritably he didnt show or do you want mike to verify that keep your shirt on fm just trying to figure this out you didnt know him not from adam psd out of frankfurt thats all never worked with him on a case i dont even know if he was special branch i suppose i could find out a crack in the door still a da after all but what did you think he wanted just like that out of the blue bernie sat down ruffling his hair again a face meeting with frankfurt out of the blue it could have been anything grief usually the last time it was legal complaining about my methods he said giving the word an edge they like to do that personally bring you in line frankfurt thinks im a loose cannon not that i give a shit why a loose cannon bernie smiled slightly ive been known to break a regulation once or twice so break another one jake said looking at him because you have a gut feeling i dont know you from adam either no but somebody comes to see you makes a stop along the way and gets shot now two of us are interested bernie met his eyes then looked away you know i didnt come to germany to catch crooked soldiers jake nodded not saying anything waiting for bernie to pop up again instead he stopped squirming and leaned forward like a negotiator at the cecilienhof finally down to business what do you want the other sheet theres nothing here jake pointed at the report not even ballistics there must be someone you could ask quietly just nosing around bernie nodded then a call to frankfurt naturally youd be curious someone doesnt show so who was he what did he want scuttlebutt there should be talk all over the place now somebody comes back in a box oh did you know him what the hell happened you trying to tell me how to do this any rumors jake went on maybe something valuables gone missing some liberated souvenirs its a long shot but you never know and a picture would be nice for publication bernie said wary no for me there must be one in his file there if you can get hold of it without upsetting the horses im not sure how but maybe something will come to you maybe something will traveling orders who authorized the trip what for youd want to know he was coming to see you yes bernie said thoughtful again then sprang up and began moving around the room jiggling change in his pocket and whats all this supposed to get you not much its not much to ask either just what youd want to know if youd never talked to me if an appointment turned up dead so what else i need a partner i cant work this alone bernie held up his hand forget it not you a name who covers the black market for public safety whod know the snitches the people out on the street if tully had something big to sell who would he have gone to see he sure as hell didnt come to berlin to stand on a corner i need someone who knows the players i cant help you with that cant there isnt anybody like that not that ive ever heard of covers it like a beat youre still back in chicago you could ask jake said getting up now too bernies restlessness contagious no i couldnt im in public safety technically you dont shit where you sleep not for long anyway nobody else will either once they know what youre after tully was psd too you think he had friends where do you think he had them i have things to do here not play cops and robbers with my own department you do that one alone he looked up with a hint of a smile well see how good you are but youll make the call youll do that yeah ill make the call he said busying himself again with the folder pile i hate it when people dont show up he stopped and looked directly at jake his eyes friendly ill call now how about clearing out of here and letting me get back to work jake walked over to the card catalogues and fingered the brass pulls on the drawers catching real criminals he said in here thats right real criminals careful of the merchandise thats the most valuable thing in berlin i heard about the paper mill some break maybe god figured he owed us one finally he said a gravelly voice mind if i have a look see what theyre like jake said pulling open a drawer before bernie could answer the bs were near the back a row of brandts helga helmut no helene he pulled his hand away feeling relieved and ashamed at the same time how could he have thought there would be but how could you be sure who anyone was anymore he remembered that first night looking down on the old woman in the garden wondering what did you do were you one of them the girls on potsdamerstrasse the bicycles going past kadewe the woman in his old flateveryone in berlin had become a suspect who were you before but bernie knew it was all here in blackandwhite typed on cards his fingers flipped again perhaps he was a special case the professor had said berthold dieter there emil not a special case but maybe a different emil brandt he took out the card no his address her address all the time jake had known him his eyes went down the card a party decoration for what an ss appointment in ss emil a nice man who saw numbers in his head he looked up to find bernie standing next to him your friend no her husband christ you didnt know jake shook his head it says he was decorated it doesnt say why that would be in his party file these are the registry cards you want me to find out chasing rats jake shook his head again just where he is you mean if shes with him bernie said studying his face yes if shes with him but hed never imagined them together just lena opening the door the surprised look in her eyes throwing her arms around his neck he put the card back and closed the drawer what was her name helene brandt she used to live in pariserstrasse ill write it down for you he went over to the desk for a piece of paper can i give you a few others he said writing i want to track down the old office staff for a story i know youre busy bernie spread his hands a whatelseisnew gesture then took the list ill put mike on it itll give him something to do theyd have to be in berlin you know yes jake said let me know what frankfurt says get going before i change my mind bernie said retreating behind the desk but youll make the call bernie looked up you could get to be a real pain you know that jake went back up the stairs and through the quiet archive room records of everything just lying here waiting millions of due bills maybe emil had been decorated as part of a group a ceremony with families applauded for their services to the state doing what teaching mathematics now filed away in one of these cabinets to make another case for the prosecution sign out please the indifferent guard chewing gum jake scribbled in the ledger then stepped outside into the click of a photograph well look whos here liz was bent on one knee shooting up at the doorway and the tall blond soldier who stood posing in front of it last nights date jake stepped aside as she took another the soldier pulled back his shoulders cool eyes an illustrators jaw the kind of aryan looks emils group would have liked okay liz said finished jake meet joe shaeffer like the pen j oe i know who you are the soldier said shaking hands pleasure he turned to liz five minutes he said then nodded stiffly at jake and went inside something for your personal collection jake said pointing to the camera it was how was the jazz wouldnt you like to know whats it like inside anything interesting he thought of the files every one a story then realized she meant anything to photograph like a library he said great a grimace still some trophy huh you know they got it all in a paper mill she said her voice as excited as the drivers jake looked at her the war had become a kind of scavenger hunt rockets at nordhausen engineers at zeiss now even pieces of paper decorations and promotions the magazine spread would show tall joe opening a file yeah i heard he said moving away watch yourself in there lots of dark corners arent you funny he grinned and was about to start down the steps when he heard his name shouted inside geismar a second shout followed by bernie in a mad dash almost colliding with liz another piece of gelferstrasse china good i caught you jake smiled you know liz you share a bathroom bernie barely managed a confused nod to her then grabbed jakes arm i need to talk to you his face was flushed from the exertion of the run this list that was fast jake said easily then saw bernies eyes holding him as firmly as the hand on his arm what come here bernie said moving them down the stairs out of earshot naumann he said holding the list up renate naumann how do you know her renate she worked for me at columbia they all did thats the first ive heard of it jake looked at him bewildered off the books i used her as a stringer she had a great eye bernie made a face as if jake had told a bad joke then looked away great eye yes he said his voice filled with disgust you know her jake said still puzzled bernie nodded i thought shed be dead you know where she is shes in jail bernie looked around then took jakes arm again and began walking out past the sentries i hate this fucking barbed wire it gives me the willies when they reached the jeep bernie leaned against it his energy finally spent what do you mean jail jake said some friends youve got bernie took out a cigarette she was a greifer you know greifer grabber catcher of what jews thats impossible she was a jew i know a jew to catch jews they thought of everything even that but she jake started but bernie held up his hand you want to hear this he took a pull on his cigarette the first big roundup here was in fortytwo february after that any jew in berlin was illegal underground uboats there were still thousands if you can imagine it some had a placeif a gentile was protecting them the others they had to move around place to place during the day you had to keep moving so the neighbors wouldnt suspect wouldnt report you he said almost spitting the word berlins a big city you could stay lost in the crowd if you kept moving unless somebody knew you a greifer i dont believe it no ask the jews she caught a few survived a few or we wouldnt have caught her thats when i had to break a few regulations he looked up it was worth it to catch her worth it he moved away from the jeep pacing in a small circle how it worked some covered the railway stations renate liked the cafes usually kranzlers or the trumpf over by the memorial church the big one in olivaerplatz the heil a drink you watch the people sometimes a jew you actually knew from the old days sometimes someone you just suspected so some talk a little fishing a hint you were a uboat yourself then snap a visit to the ladies room for the telephone they usually took them on the street so it wouldnt cause a disturbance in the cafe finish your drink theyre just rounding up some jews everyone but renate the next day another cafe she had a great eye you see he said glancing back at jake she said she could tell just by looking not even streicher could do thatto him it was all cartoon noses renate was better than the nazis she didnt need the star patches not with that eye and you know people are foolish so careful day after daycan you imagine what thats like and then the relief a friendly face if you cant trust another jew a few even asked her out a date under those conditions just let me powder my nose in the ladies he flicked the cigarette into the street and then jake said helpless wanting to know the collection point a gestapo building so disturbances didnt matter anymore lots of screaming there they put them on the trucks then out to the trains for the trip east the neighbors told us the noise was terrible theyd keep their windows closed until the trucks left maybe she didnt know jake said quietly she lived there with the other catchers they kept them on a short leash maybe a reminderyou could be next but she wasnt she saved herself he paused i saw the room where she lived its on the courtyard she could see them loading the trucks so maybe she closed her window too he looked harder at jake she knew the day seemed to have stopped around them the empty street as still as the archives inside birdless trees sentries standing motionless in the sun thats jake sputtered then stopped like a candle without air the worst thing you ever heard bernie prompted stay in germany when you think youve heard the worst theres something more always something worse loaded into trucks while she watched how many jake said does it matter jake shook his head a girl with bright eyes and curly hair but who was anybody anymore can i see her could you arrange that if you want i should tell you you wont be the first your buddies were all over this one a nazi old news but a jew that they went for ach he waved his hand again as if he were swatting the whole thing away like a gnat theres a trial coming up if you have the stomach fork does she admit it theres no question about this one bernie said looking at him we have witnesses but if they forced her she did it thats what matters you know she did it he took a breath the people she caught are dead nobody made excuses for them no so bernie said exhaling the word case closed not what you expected is it no no bernie said im sorry its a lousy business all of it stick to the black market id still like to see her bernie nodded maybe shell tell you something why ill never understand it we werent here we dont know what it was like i had family here bernie snapped i know what it was like for them jake looked back at the quiet villa through the high barbed wire that gave bernie the willies whatll happen to her prison bernie said flatly shes a womanthey wont hang her maybe its worseshell have to live with it in a cell with the nazis who made her do it she decided that herself when she became one of them i said it was a lousy business how do you think i feelher greifer another jew was i right you tell me jake lowered his head i dont know i dont either bernie said quietly a tiny crack in his voice that left his face unguarded for a second the boy again practicing mendelssohn so you just do the job it was you who got her personally no gunther behn our bloodhound he stopped then grabbed jakes arm wait a minute it didnt occur to me before i kept thinking public safety youre looking for someone who knows the streets gunthers expolice every alley you might try him assuming hes willing you have any expense money to throw around maybe berlin police a detective good when hes sober how do you know him i told you he helped me with the naumann case i thought the police were nazi they were theyre not police anymore either not if they were lieutenant or higher so hes out of a job and you gave him a new one i thought you werent supposed to work with them were not hes still out of a job he just helped me out on this he looked up i broke a regulation you used a nazi bernie lifted his face a slight thrust of the jaw we caught her how much did you pay him nothing he had a special interest renate caught his wife he was married to a jew they divorced so he could keep his job later he broke off letting the pieces assemble themselves had he hidden her or just let her drift through the streets waiting for the pounce youre in berlin theres always something worse and you think he might help thats up to you take a bottle of brandy he likes that maybe you can talk him into it he knows the black market well thats the thing bernie said with the first trace of a smile hes in it contents previous chapter next chapter chapter five gunther behn lived as far east as you could go in kreuzberg and still be in the american sector in the old days it would have been a short walk to police headquarters in alexanderplatz now the way was blocked by a hill of bricks and a gutted tram that had been upended as a tank barricade and never removed the top of the building had been blown away leaving only gunthers groundfloor flat and the floor above half open to the sky it took several knocks to bring him to the door a pair of thick glasses peering suspiciously around the edge gunther behn my name is geismar bernie teitel sent me a surprised look hearing german then a grunt can i come in gunther opened the door youre an american you can do whatever you want he said shuffling indifferently back to an armchair where a cigarette was burning the room was crowdeda table a daybed an old console radio shelves of books and a giant map of greater berlin that covered an entire wall in one corner a stack of px cans he hadnt bothered to hide i brought you this jake said holding out the brandy a bribe he said what does he want now he took the bottle french in the warm room stale with smoke he was wearing a cardigan closecropped hair almost as short as the gray stubble that covered his unshaven chin not yet old probably early fifties behind the glasses the glazed eyes of a drinker a book lay open on the armchair what is it is there a date for the trial no he thought you might be able to help me with what he said opening the bottle and sniffing a job he looked at jake then put the cork in and handed back the bottle tell him no im finished with that business even for brandy not for bernie a job for me jake nodded at the bottle its yours either way what is it another greifer no an american his cheek moved in a tic of surprise which he covered by walking over to the table and pouring two fingers of brandy into a glass how is it you speak german he said i used to live in berlin ah he tossed back a healthy swig how do you like it now i knew renate jake said to his back hoping for a point of contact gunther took another gulp so did many people that was the problem bernie told me im sorry about your wife but gunther seemed not to have heard a willed deafness in the awkward quiet jake noticed for the first time that there were no pictures in the room no reminders at all the visual traces locked away somewhere in a closet or thrown out after the divorce so what do you want some help bernie said you were a detective retired the amis retired me did he tell you that yes he also said you were good im trying to solve a murder a murder he snorted a murder in berlin my friend there were millions who cares about one i do gunther turned looking him up and down a policemans appraisal jake said nothing finally gunther turned back to the bottle a drink he said since you brought it no its early coffee then real coffee not ersatz not grudging an invitation to stay you have it another gift he said holding up the glass one minute he headed toward the kitchen but detoured to peek out the window did you disable the motor the distributor cap ill chance it dont take chances in berlin he said scolding not now he shook his head americans jake watched him open the door to the kitchen more packing cases a pile of canned goods cartons of cigarettes gifts he was still sipping the brandy but moved around the small space with steady efficiency one of those drinkers who never seem affected until they pass out at night jake went over to the shelves rows of westerns karl may the german zane grey gunfights in yuma sheriffs and posses tracking through sagebrush an unexpected vice at the edge of kreuzberg where did you get the map jake said the whole city dotted with pins my office it wasnt safe in the alex with the bombs now i like to look at it sometimes it makes me think berlin is still out there all the streets he came into the room with two cups its important to know where you are in police work the where very important he handed jake a cup where was your murder potsdam jake said glancing involuntarily at the map as if the body would appear in the ribbons of blue lakes in the lower left corner potsdam an american he followed jakes eyes to the edge of the map with the conference no he had ten thousand dollars jake said baiting a hook gunther looked at him then motioned him to a table chair sit he sank into the armchair moving the book aside so tell me it took ten minutes there wasnt much to tell and gunthers expression discouraged speculation he had taken off his glasses his eyelids lowered to slits and he listened without nodding the only sign of life a steady movement of his hand from coffee cup to brandy glass ill know more when i hear back from bernie jake finished gunther pinched the bridge of his nose and rubbed it in thought then put back his glasses what will you know he said finally who he was what he was like you think that would be useful gunther said who dont you usually he said taking a drink if this were before now let me explain something to you i saved the map he cocked his head toward the wall but everything else was lost fingerprint files criminal picture files general files we dont know who anyone is in berlin no residency records lost something is stolen you cant look in the hock shops the usual places theyre gone if its sold to a soldier he sends it home no trace no policeman in berlin can solve a crime now not even a retired one its not a german crime then why come to me because you know the black market you think so you get a lot of gifts yes im so rich he said lifting his hand to the room tins of corned beef a treasure you know how it works or you wouldnt be eating you know how berlin works how berlin works gunther said grunting again even now germans run the market probably the same ones who ran things before youd know them so which one did tully know he wasnt making a casual deal he wasnt in berlin he came to berlin gunther slowly took out a cigarette and watched jake as he lit it good thats the first point you saw that what else a detective testing a recruit jake leaned forward the point is the money theres too much gunther shook his head no you missed the point the point is that he still had it i dont follow you herr geismar a man sells something the buyer shoots him would he not take the money back why would he leave it jake sat back disconcerted the obvious question overlooked by everybody except a bent cop still on the job behind the brandy haze meaning meaning the buyer and the killer are not necessarily the same in fact not the same how could it be youre looking for the wrong man jake got up and walked over to the map the one leads to the other has to theres still the money yes the money gunther said following him with his eyes that interests you its the other point that interests me where potsdam jake said dully looking at the map potsdam gunther repeated which the russians have closed off no one has been there for days not even the people you think i know he took another drink for them a real inconvenience no market daya serious loss but they cant get in and your soldier can how is that maybe he was invited gunther nodded the final point but for you also the end a russian children with guns they dont need a reason to shoot you will never find him the black market doesnt work by sector its all over the city this much moneyeven a russiansomeone will know something people talk jake went back to his chair and leaned forward again theyd talk to you they know you gunther lifted his head i can pay jake said im not an informer no a cop retired gunther said sourly with a pension he raised his glass to the packing cases and how long do you think that will last once the mps get started an american killedthey have to do something about that clean things up at least for a while you could use a little insurance from the americans gunther said deadpan to find someone they dont want found they will theyll have to if somebody makes enough noise he paused holding gunthers eyes you never know when a favor might come in handy you are the noisemaker i take it gunther looked away and took off his glasses again and what do i get for my services my persilschein persil jake said confused trying to translate like the detergent persil washes everything clean gunther said rubbing the glasses on the cardigan remember the advertisements the persilschein washes everything too even sins an american signs a certificate andhe snapped his fingersthe record is clean no nazi past go back to work i cant do that jake said then hesitated maybe i can talk to bernie herr geismar im not serious he wont persil me i was in the party he knows that now im inbusiness my hands are he stopped looking down at them anyway i dont want to go back to work its finished here when you leave the russians will take over not even a persilschein would make me work for them then work for me why he said more a dismissal than a question jake glanced around the airless room a short walk from the old office all the teletypes and radio calls now just a map on the wall because youre not ready to retire and ill miss all the points he nodded at the book you cant sit around all day reading karl may he isnt writing any new ones gunther looked at him for a second a bleary scowl then put on his glasses and picked up the book leave me alone he said retreating again behind the haze but jake sat still waiting him out for a few minutes there was no sound but the quiet ticking of the wall clock the silence of a standoff like the one on the book jacket sixshooters drawn finally gunther peered over his glasses there is maybe one more point jake raised his eyebrows still waiting did he speak german tully i dont know i doubt it a difficulty then for such a transaction gunther said carefully working through a checklist if he was meeting a german who run the market you say all right then who else this talkit would be private i have to protect my pension he said private as a confessional you know ronnys on the kudamm i can find it try there tonight ask for alford he said pronouncing the english correctly he likes ronnys an american a tommy not german so maybe hes heard something who knows its a start mention my name jake nodded but youll be there that depends on what gunther looked down at the page dismissing him again whether i finish the book he got back to gelferstrasse to find a crowd halfway down the block from the billet mps in jeeps and a whole truckload of soldiers all milling around two women who stood looking at a house hands to their cheeks as if they were watching an accident in the open truck ron stood next to some newsreel cameras deserted by the rest of the press for the sidewalk show the mps were trying to get the women to move but without much success barking in english while the women wailed in german plaster dust was floating out of the windows like smoke he speaks german tommy ottinger said to one of the mps waving jake over tell them in kraut they cant go in the mp said frustrated one floors gone alreadythe rest of its going to cave what happened jake said to tommy they had a bomb in the back that weakened the house and now the whole things shaky kitchen ceiling just went and another walls about to pop and theyre still trying to get in the two women now shouted at jake they want to get their things he translated before it goes no can do the mp said christ these people dont know when theyre lucky they could have been in there you got to hit them over the head to make them understand anything my clothes one of the women cried in german i have to have clothes how do you live without clothes its dangerous jake said to her wait till it settles maybe itll be all right the house answered with a groan almost a human sound the joists pressed down by weight a piece of plaster fell inside sending out another puff of dust helmut the other woman said holding herself now really alarmed whats that her dog the mp said i dont know jake said is anybody coming to help are you kidding what are we supposed to do prop the walls hed seen it done in london support beams put against a damaged house like improvised flying buttresses just a few pieces of lumber buddy the mp said then stopped the idea too absurd to deserve a response so what are they doing jake said indicating the soldiers them theyre on their way to the game why dont you take it easy and tell the krauts to come over here before they get hurt fuck their things jake looked up at the truck where ron was standing with his hands on his hips obviously annoyed at the delay were going to be late he said to the men what game football ron said come on guys lets go a few of them moved climbing reluctantly into the truck the britsll wait tommy said i cant leave him the woman said this could take all day ron said but the house was groaning again as compelling as a fire working to some kind of end helmut the woman said hearing the rumble and then before anyone could stop her bolted up the pavement to the door and raced inside hey the mp shouted but no one moved frozen like a crowd held at gunpoint fuck he said watching her disappear well thats one less to worry about the words seemed to push jake by the shoulders he glared at the mp then broke away without thinking and ran after her the entryway was littered with plaster frau he yelled come its not safe no one answered he stopped listening in the creaking house for an animal whimper the terrified helmut being rescued instead a calm one moment came from the front room she was standing in the middle just looking around holding a picture frame you must come out he said gently going over to her its not safe she nodded yes i know its all i have you see she said looking down at the picture a boy in a wehrmacht uniform he took her elbow please he said leading her away she began to walk with him then stopped at an end table near the doorway and picked up a porcelain figurine one of those pinkcheeked shepherdesses that gather dust in parlors for elisabeth she said as if she were apologizing for taking her own things the house having held its breath for a few minutes now exhaled again with a loud thump in the back she started and jake took her by the shoulder to keep her going so that his arm was around her when they came out on the stoop hold it the voice oddly of a policeman catching looters but it was only ron next to the newsreel camera for a brief moment as they stood on the stoop jake realized that it was running and worse that what it had hoped to catch was his death american journalist killed in berlinsomething finally worth filming anna the other woman shouted hysterical are you crazy are you crazy but anna was undisturbed now the picture clutched to her chest she left jakes side walked calmly down the steps and handed the figurine to the other woman fucking boy scout the mp said to him aint he though tommy said probably do the same for a cat where is fucking helmut anyway the mp said disgusted its her son jake said he turned to the truck get a good picture he said to ron sorry it didnt fall down for you maybe next time ron grinned come on hop up next stop allied games the boys who fought together play together colliers will love it jake looked up at him the truth was colliers would the allies in peace conference table to playing field not nazi cops and homeless berliners he could file this week before the impatient telegrams started coming the russians too theyve been invited hey buddy said the mp subdued now ask them if theyve got someplace to go jake spoke with the women standing now arm in arm their backs to the soldiers she has another sister in hannover shell need a travel permit for that tell her well get her to the dp camp down in teltowerdamm its not bad but the word once translated jolted them the clang of a cell door closing not a camp the woman with the figurine shrieked not a camp you cant make us she clutched jakes arm whats lager the mp said camp theyre afraid they think its a concentration camp yeah like the ones they used to run tell them its an american camp he said certain this would be a comfort they look to you like they ran anything what the hell krauts before jake could answer the side wall finally gave way collapsing inward and taking the weakened body of the house with it in a roar there was a crack of wood splintering and masonry smashing down all the sounds of an explosion so that when the dust rose in a cloud from the center it seemed the house had been bombed after all one of the women gasped holding her hand over her mouth everyone stood still mesmerized in the truck the cameras were running again grateful for a little spectacle after the dud rescue some of the neighbors had run over and joined the crowd standing away from the two women as if their bad luck were catching no one spoke a part of the back wall buckled another crash more dust then a series of thuds like aftershocks as bits of the house detached themselves and slid into the center heap until finally the noise stopped and they were looking through the standing facade at another one of rons decayed teeth the woman holding the figurine started to cry but anna simply stared at the wreck without expression then turned okay okay the mp said waving his white stick lets break it up shows over jake looked at the house hundreds of thousands of them the truck driver started the engine a signal to the others and the soldiers began to climb on shoving goodnaturedly and joking what about the women jake said to the mp you cant just leave them what are you the salvation army come on jake tommy said theres nothing you can do here and in fact what could he do take them home and ask them to tell him their troubles for colliers the old couple from the billet had begun to lead them away a night or two in the cramped basement perhaps living off the b rations from upstairs then a travel pass to hannover and another basement or maybe not maybe just a tramp through the tiergarten with the others dps because of a minute of falling plaster you know we didnt start the fucking war the mp said evidently reading his face no they did jake said confusing him and followed tommy into the truck they drove up into the british sector past the radio tower where jake had made the columbia broadcasts and out to the olympic stadium the area around it was the usual mess trees blasted into stumps but the stadium even scarred by shelling looked just the way jake remembered it it had probably been the best of the nazis monumental buildings deceptively horizontal until you went through the gate and saw the long steps dropping down into the sunken amphitheater he recognized the spot where hed sat with the dodds watching the games his first job in berlin miles of loudspeakers had been strung from the stadium out across the city to flash the news of each event to the center goebbels idea a modern marvel to impress the visitors it was the first time hed seen hitler taking the salute in his emperors box fresh out of chicago years before lena today groups of soldiers were lying shirtless on the patchy grass drinking beer and getting some sun before the game the rows and rows of seats that had held thousands now had only a few hundred but still a larger crowd than hed expected about the same as at a high school game back home they were clustered at one end of the vast oval where a football field had been chalked out in lime british and americans side by side with a few french near the end wearing hats with red pompoms no russians on the sidelines a few soldiers sat in a circle playing cards grumbling when they had to move for the newsreel camera crew in the middle of the field the players in jerseys and shorts were jumping up and down in warmup exercises an occupying army with nothing to do but occupy so the russians didnt show jake said to ron whos playing the french theyre here for the track events thats all the russians are scheduled for too so theyll probably turn up want to interview some of the players ill just watch whered the brits learn to play ron shrugged they say rugbys close were mixing the teams just in case keeps things fair youre a born diplomat no weve got the british reels to consider he said pointing to another crew with tripods they dont want to show their guys getting trounced do they whod watch that allied games remember but in fact after the kickoff it was an american show gi quarterbacks calling the plays the british blocking and everyone getting scraped by the rough field in pileup tackles the crowd cheered every play even the referees throwing red foul flags and swapped money in side bets and whooped until finally the high spirits were infectious like a saturday somewhere in the big ten a piece of home even the players healthy and pink in the sun seemed to be in another country miles from the pasty grim bodies in the streets outside jake hadnt seen football in years and now unexpectedly the sounds on the field took him back to sunny afternoons when nothing mattered except the next ten yards and who you might be seeing after the game america where all the houses were intact but it was the homesickness of an exilewhat you missed was your own youth not a place hed been back only once since hed first sat in this stadium a week between assignments and after that all hed known was the overseas america of the war the field mess parties and uso shows that werent really home but a movie of home hed be a stranger there now but wouldnt everybody theyd all been gone too long were all different even the mp at the house maybe a football player who now thought a dead woman was one less german to worry about he shifted in his seat embarrassed by his own nostalgia leave the amber waves to quent reynolds making his mother queen for a day at toots shors he knew better the america hed left the late editions and cops on the take was the same unholy mix as anywhere else and yet there it was the unexpected longing triggered by a football game who he was as inescapable and permanent as a birthmark a touchdown the crowd jumped up around him yelling and slapping backs someone passed him a beer from the corner of his eye he saw ron leave the cameras to greet congressman breimer he introduced him to a small group of soldiers presumably utica boys who shook hands and posed for army photographers souvenirs for the folks then he led breimer over to the newsreel crew positioning him in front of the play and testing a microphone jake left his seat and walked down to the sidelines breimer had already begun speaking in this stadium where that great american jesse owens exposed the nazi lie of racial superiority were seeing today proof of another victory this great allied coalition that won the war is now winning the peace still side by side still determined to show the world we can work together and play some pretty good football a pause here as the soldiers around him laughed our task here is not easy but can anyone doubt looking at these fine boys that were going to succeed were going to help this country up out of the ashes extend our hands to the good germans whove prayed for democracy during all these dark years and make a world where war will never happen again thats what theyre fighting for now today these men are playing but tomorrow theyll be back at work hard work building our future if you could see them here in berlin as i can youd know theyre going to win that one too impromptu without notes the sort of thing he could rattle off without even thinking huffing and puffing another piece of home jake looked at him wondering what hed been like beforeprobably the kid waving his hand in class volunteering to clap erasers and deliver the milk bottles destined even then for better things and now im told the eightysecond airborne has a little halftime entertainment for us ron gave a stage managers signal and the cameras swerved to an opening beneath the tiers of seats a row of white helmets came trooping out playing a sousa march the soldiers cheered the cameras tracked the band onto the scrubby playing field brass horns shinins as they lined up in formation the noise was deafening where are the pompom girls jake said to ron very funny ron said he pointed to the seats they love it and they did jake looked up at the crowd stamping and whistling winning the peace for movietone news then he saw brian stanley a few tiers farther up leaning back on his elbows in a patch of sun eyes closed the only still thing in the stands the band started in on another march jake climbed back up the stairs enjoying the game brian opened his eyes for a second then closed them again i was until the honorable started in jake sat down next to him watching the band below the music boomed through the stadium my god brian said do you think they could turn it down a little late night brian managed a small grunt then slowly pulled himself up wiping his forehead you know im worried about winston hes been blathering on about the polish borders why why not jake said looking back from the field the conference almost forgotten while hed been taking coffee with gunther because they were decided the minute uncle joe crossed them all this carrying on its not like him maybe hes playing for time no hes distracted the election i expect pity coming right during the conference i think its put him off his game not like your honorable he nodded toward breimer who was applauding the band coming off the field still blaring lovely piece of work isnt he extending his hand he said doing a passable imitation thats what hes usually doing as long as youve got something to put in it brian smiled that leaves the germans out then extend our hands on the plane i seem to remember they were getting what they deserve ah peace at last this to the field where the band had finally been replaced by a referees whistle beginning the thirdquarter play a background noise by comparison brian leaned on his elbows again and whereve you been by the by i looked for you at the briefing chasing the furlines no a story on the black market youre not serious brian said closing his eyes thats an old old story well so are the polish borders brian sighed and went back to the sun down on the field breimer was detaching himself from the press corps and walking over to a waiting soldierlizs date alone now his manner brisk and serious breimer put a hand on his shoulder drawing him away from the crowd in a backroom huddle jake watched them for a few minutes their heads nodding in conversation more than just a driver thick as thieves arent they brian said following jakes stare hmm why the interest hes seeing liz you cant blame him for that i wouldnt mind a lookin myself the crowd suddenly started shoutinganother touchdownbut the two heads didnt turn so whats he doing with breimer brian yawned indifferent building our future been at it for days they have he met him at the airport he did jake looked over at brian still as a lizard you dont miss much do you well its my job isnt it all you have to do is keep your eyes open he said closing his again now the two men were moving apart their business finished breimer signaling to a gi that he was ready to leave shaeffer hurried out of the stadium without even glancing at the game hey brian jake said thinking you were on the plane remember the guy who was afraid of flying the boots who met him did you notice no brian said why did you talk to him on the plane notice anything about him brian opened his eyes i take it theres a reason youre asking he turned up dead at potsdam what the one they fished out jake nodded and and id like to know why i think theres a story in it dear jake back on the old beat and heres poor poland hanging in the balance so did you talk to him not a word i dont think anyone did as i recall the hon did most of the talking this your black market story he made a deal here picked up quite a bundle that nice young man brian said maybe not so nice five ten thousand dollars really brian said interested now with what what do you mean well he didnt have any luggage what was he trading he didnt have any luggage jake said trying to picture the scene at tempelhof no i did notice that i thought thats odd then i thought well hes from berlin no he wasnt notice anything else my boy i didnt even notice that until you brought it up a chap without luggagewhats there to that jake didnt answer what would gunther see the obvious point overlooked a deal with nothing to trade but you didnt get ten thousand for nothing small enough then to carry in a pocket damn brian said to another roar from the field one of ours too now i have to write it up in the british stands some soldiers held up a union jack suppose a russian shot him ah brian said slowly a little awkward just now wouldnt it be he waved toward the game and just when we were all getting along so nicely is that where youre going with this a little stink bomb for the conference i dont know they wouldnt like that who any of them jake looked around the stadium any of them the story nobody wanted him to do which meant it was the only one worth doing he glanced toward the newsreel crew half expecting to see breimer winning the peace again instead he saw bernie coming toward them head down in his usual terrier hurry he searched the crowd then smiled at jake and waved him down jake took a breath hed tracked him herenews that couldnt wait elated he left brian and ran down the stairs you found her what oh the woman bernie said looking flustered no im sorry shes not there but hed been smiling you looked theres no record i put in a query for the husband he might be easier if hes pow he paused letting the thought drift and watching jakes face you might try the message boards sometimes it works jake nodded not really listening everyone filed a fragebogen if they wanted a ration card unless they were buried somewhere under a collapsed wall no record well thanks anyway he said his voice dropping i guess thats that but what had he expected people do turn up i said it was i know anyway nice of you to come no bernie said embarrassed again it wasnt that i mean theres something else jake looked up something interesting bernie said his five oclock shadow creasing in another smile i found out why muller didnt want you to see the other sheet you were right there was a ballistics report he pulled a carbon from his pocket and paused making jake wait it was an american bullet contents previous chapter next chapter chapter six it wasnt hard to find ronnys the british had drawn the flashy stretch of the kurfiirstendamm in the partition and the swarm of british army vehicles outside the club marked it like a neon sign drivers sat smoking on the fenders keeping guard catching snatches of music as officers pushed inside holding girls by their waists some of them already weaving from drink in the street only a few cars passed the broken storefronts and gutted hotels bicycles had disappeared with the fading light in an hour the kudamm would be as dark as a country road lit by a sliver of moon and the phosphorus strips left over from the blackout jake parked behind a british jeep and walked along the cleared sidewalk to the entrance the store next door was in ruins the old plate glass replaced by plywood covered with pieces of paper and bits of cardboard with messages set inside the window to shelter the ink from rain it was just light enough to see some of them had been neatly written out in the formal gothic script of the gymnasiums but most were hastily scribbled the scrawls carrying their own sad urgency winter boots felt lined excellent condition will trade for childrens shoes any information anna millhaupt previously at marburgerstrasse your future revealed madame renaldi personalized charts marks or coupons war widow two children attractive seeking german husband must have flat excellent cook jake turned away and opened the door to a blast of music hed expected a basement cave something out of the old grosz drawings but ronnys was bright and noisy decked out with white tablecloths and pictures on the wall waiters in starched shirts wriggled past the cramped tables like eels carrying plates holding them away from the jostling on the small dance floor a fivepiece band was playing an uptempo sweet lorraine and a crowd of allied uniforms and girls in summer dresses bumped around the packed floor in a quick foxtrot the girls were dressed to go outreal dresses and bright lipstick and opentoed shoes not the uniform trousers and kerchiefs of the rubble cleaners but the familiar smell had penetrated even here lying unmistakably under the smoke and perfume it occurred to him a detail for a piece that on the raucous crowded floor they were literally dancing on graves gunther was sitting in a thick haze of smoke at the end of the raised bar that ran along the side wall jake walked past a burst of laughter and a rattle of glasses as a small group of russians banged the table for service the band without a pause switched to this years kisses gunther was huddled with another civilian and barely acknowledged jake when he reached the bar giving a quick nod and then a jerk of his head toward a table in the corner hes over there jake followed his eyes to the table a young soldier thin hair slicked straight back like noel cowards sat between two bottle blondes eating dinner heads bent over their plates but i have some news jake said let me finish my business gunther said ill join you a moment the gun jake continued it was american gunther looked at him directly his eyes alert behind their brandy film so he said noncommittal whos this the other german said gunther shrugged a new man from the alex he said the old headquarters im breaking him in the other man found this funny from the alex he laughed thats good ill be with you in a minute gunther said nodding again at the table with the blondes jake squeezed between tables until he reached the english soldier a kid skinny and brighteyed not the grizzled thug hed imagined alford danny you gunthers friend have a drink he said pouring one gunther said to fix you up anything you like is it okay to talk jake said looking at the girls as he sat down who them right as rain the only word they know is fuck isnt that right use hello one of the girls said evidently her other word and went back to her plate a piece of gray meat and two potatoes the size of golf balls danny must have eaten elsewhere there was nothing in front of him but a bottle of scotch dont know where she gets the appetite danny said does the heart good doesnt it to see her go at it now was there something special you like something a bit out of the way or just straight up youre an officer right he said glancing at jakes shoulder patch they wont go unless its an officer but theyre all clean i insist on that checked once a week we dont want to take any surprises home do we was there something special no jake said embarrassed its not that not girls right danny said picking up his glass but not missing a beat my mistake now the boys are a bit more you understand theyre only out once a night get used up otherwise you know he looked at jake all hitler youth every one of them with uniforms if you like cheerful as a street vendor in whitechapel jake flustered shook his head no you dont understand im looking for some information you a copper danny said wary no well a friend of gunthers youd have to be all right wouldnt you he lit a cigarette watching jake while the end caught what sort of information a man made ten thousand dollars monday you hear about anything like that ten thousand he said impressed in one go thats very nice friend of yours an acquaintance why not ask him then hes gone back to frankfurt i want to know where he made it want to do a little business yourself is that it what are you selling jake shook his head again i want to know what he was selling behind them there was applause as the band stopped for a break the vacuum of the sudden quiet soon filling with louder talk why come to me ten thousand thats not girls that isnt gunther said youre a guy hears things not this danny said firmly squashing his cigarette in the ashtray want to ask around i could pay danny peered at him you could pick up a phone and get frankfurt too no hes dead danny stared at him you might have said shows a want of trust maybe youd better piss off i dont want any trouble no trouble look lets start over man i know came to berlin monday to do some business and got killed im trying to find out who did it gunther know him too no hes helping me the man only spoke english gunther thought you might have heard something a man gets killed people talk not to me they havent now piss off i just want to know if youve heard anything now you know danny took out another cigarette look i make a nice little living here a bit of this a bit of that no trouble i dont have ten thousand dollars and i dont shoot people and i keep my nose to myself you get all kinds here live and let live and you live longer isnt that right use the girl looked up and smiled blankly if someone did have ten thousand dollars what would he buy with it jake said switching tack in one go i dont know i never had that much but he was intrigued now the big stuff thats more of a swap like friend of mine got hold of a factory shipmentlovely cloth parachute qualityand the next thing you know hes got trucks coming in from denmark tinned ham now hes got something you can sell that anywhere but no money till it hits the street if you see what i mean cash antiques maybe but see i wouldnt know one from another so i steer clear of that what else medicine theyd pay cash for that but thats a dirty business medicine i wont touch that jake looked at him fascinated ham but not penicillin a new kind of hairsplitting he was carrying it with him whatever it was jake said no truckloads not even a box something small enough to carry jewelry then now thats a specialty of course danny said as if he were referring to one of his girls you have to know what youre about would you ask around i might as a favor to gunther mind ah here we go again he said seeing the band come back on the stand he poured jake another drink warming to the subject small enough to carry not goldtoo heavy paper maybe what kind of paper the band had started in on elmers tune causing a new rush to the dance floor jake felt his chair pushed from behind a russian maneuvered through with his hand stuck firmly on a girls behind another russian now loomed over the table smiling at use and twirling his finger in the international sign language for dance piss off mate cant you see the ladys eating the russian reared back surprised he didnt realize she was with you a voice behind them said in accented english apologies jake turned ah mr geismar general sikorsky yes an excellent memory excuse my friend he thought hes a friend of yours danny said to jake well thats all right then use give him a whirl theres a good girl you dance she said to the russian getting up and taking him by the arm thank you sikorsky said very kind dont give it a thought danny said all geniality what about yourself another time he said looking at the other blonde good to see you again mr geismar a different sort of party he glanced toward the dance floor where use and the russian were already locked together i enjoyed our conversation aladdins cave jake said trying to remember yes perhaps we can discuss it again one day if youd like to visit our sector it is not so lively as this though good night he turned to danny and made a little bow preparing to move off my comrade thanks you for your help mind you bring her back danny said teasing sikorsky looked at him then took out a wad of bills peeled a few off and dropped them next to dannys glass that should cover it he said and walked away danny stared at the bills stung as if someone had slapped his face jake looked away his eyes following sikorsky across the room to the bar where he was saying hello to gunthers friend it bleeding well doesnt cover it danny was saying red bastards what kind of paper jake said turning back what oh all kinds you ask me what would you buy with ten thousand dollars and it comes to me i have i buy paper you know deeds you own property here a cinema that was the first now its flats of course you want the right areas but now a cinema thats always worth something isnt it what happens when you go home jake said curious home no i like it here lots of girlsthey cant do enough for you and ive got my property what have i got in london five quid a week and thank you very much theres nothing in london youve got all the opportunity in the world right here jake sat quietly for a minute at a loss another colliers piece theyd never want the cheeky private with a corner table at ronnys i doubt he was selling deeds he said finally well thats just an example isnt it here have one more he said pouring enjoying himself its single malt not your blended he sipped some lots of valuable things on paper ids discharge papers get you an honorable if you like fudged but whos to know of course the germans are the ones for paper persilscheins jake said to wash away your sins thats right you might get two thousand for one of those if its good sell a few more and he stopped putting down the glass hang on a minute ill tell you what has been going around havent seen one myself of course but i did hearvery good prices too what camp letters character witnesses some jewish bloke writes that soandso was in the camp with him or soandso tried to keep him out of the camp best sort of persilschein cleans the record up right away if its authentic well the writer is of course most wont do it you can understand that but if you really need the moneyto get out of the country say something like thatwell whats one letter jake stared at his glass appalled exonerate your own murderer always something worse christ he said a sigh of disgust almost inaudible under the noise of the band danny shifted in his seat uncomfortable again as if jake had thrown more money on the table i dont see it that way you cant hold a grudge in this life i mean look at me three years in that pow camp and it was hell i can tell you thisll never be the same he touched his ear deaf as a post i picked that up there but i picked up some german too thats the bright side i didnt know it would come in handy and now thats all over and done with and whats the use of going on about it you have to get on thats what i think for a wild moment jake heard breimers voice an unlikely echo it was a different kind of camp jake said let me tell you something mate when you spend three years pow you tell me how different it was sorry i didnt mean thats all right danny said expansively no offense taken tell you the truth im not much for camp letters myself stinks really after what theyve been through i mean its not like theyre volunteering you know what i mean need the money is what it is poor bleedersyou can see them here theyve still got those pjs on it tears you right up so the lettersi wont touch stuff like that its taking advantage jake looked at him the man with boys in hitler youth uniforms can you find out whos peddling them why an appointment with a public safety lawyer maybe a connection after all he thought of bernies office stacked high with paper a hunch its not jewelsthat doesnt feel right lets follow the paper trail he glanced at dannys dubious face id pay you of course tell you what friend of gunthers id like to oblige as far as it goes let me poke around a bit no promises mind anything turns up ill set you a price you cant ask fairer than that can you no hello rog danny said looking up at a british private all set ive got the major outside right thats you darling he said to the blonde who put down her napkin and took out a lipstick just as you are love no sense doing your mouth given where its going off you go wiedersehen she said politely to jake getting up and following the private safe home danny called after her choice goods that one enjoys it sure you dont want a go can i ask you something why jake said then stopped not sure how to ask it i mean i thought all it took was a couple of cigarettes so why well some gents are shy like thats how it started see im not shy so i was in a way to make a few introductions some appreciate that the convenience officers they dont want to pick something up off the street you dont know what youre getting do you a little surprise for the wife hello whats this nasty its the hygiene really ive got a doctor checks them decent chap takes care of any accidents too if you know what i mean of course the girls prefer it saves wear and tear all that walking about why only officers danny smiled got the money for a start but you know its really the girls all the same arent they looking for love and a ticket out london why not anywhere but here now an enlisted man isnt going to do that is he you need an officer and do they what take them home naw quick suck and a poke is what they like still you never know i always tell the girls look on the bright side theres always a chance just put your heart and soul into it and maybe something will come of it and they believe you danny shrugged theyre not whores see nice girls some of them temporaries theyre just trying to get by you have to give them something to hope for what do you tell the boys thats just a side danny said he ran his hand over his slick hair embarrassed again it takes all kinds are they really hitler youth course viktor anyway hes uses brother quite a family well you know i think he was that way the others i dont know bit reluctant at first but theyre glad of the money and whos to know really viktor finds themfriends of his as i say its just a side here watch this one hes good he is regular benny goodman he pointed to the bandstand where a clarinet player had stood up licking his reed as he waited for the leadin when he started he did play goodman memories of you the sad opening notes mellow as liquid another sound of home the music so unexpectedly beautiful that it seemed a kind of reproach in the smoky room on the dance floor couples drew closer swaying instead of bouncing as if the clarinet were charming them the player swayed too eyes closed blotting out the bright ugly room to let the music take him somewhere else everything seems to bring the music of romance not good times and quick gropes a song for girls looking for love jake watched them move dreamily on the floor heads leaning on uniformed shoulders giving themselves something to hope for at the tables people had grown quieter pretending to watch the solo but really drawn by something else the world theyd known before ronnys brought back close enough to touch by the sentimental notes memories of you even here there was lenas dress across the floor the same deep blue her goingout dress he remembered the way shed brush the back as she got up a quick touch to smooth out the wrinkles so that it clung to her afterward moving with her on the front thered been a patch of glitter going up to the shoulder little fingers of bright sequins like a sprinkling of stars but wool too warm for a summers night in a crowded room and this one had a wet patch showing between the shoulder blades stretched over a girl too big for it with blond hair piled on top of her head like betty grable still the same deep blue when the band came in behind the clarinet ending the solo there was a restless stirring at the tables a kind of relief to be out of the spell back to just music what did i tell you danny said his eyes shiny but jake continued to watch the dress the damp spot now covered by an american soldiers hand fragebogen message boards why not here dancing at ronnys but the waist was too thick bulging over the belt gunther was making his way steadily across the room skirting the dancers there was a sudden roar at the door as a large party swept in looking for tables memories of you floated away gunther you old sod danny said standing up a show of respect take a pew he pulled out a chair gunther sat down and poured a drink meet the general jake said nodding in sikorskys direction i know the general sometimes a useful source but not this time jake said reading his face not yet he downed the glass and sat back so youve had a good talk dannys been telling me about his real estate hes a landlord yes a kino for parachute silk gunther said shaking his head amused steady danny said no tales out of school now gunther ignoring him raised his glass you will dress half the women in berlin i salute you parachutes you cant beat it for quality danny said but silk hadnt reached the dance floor yet just the cheap cotton prints from the last wartime ration lenas dress was gone from the floor hidden somewhere among the crowded tables the band had started a jazzy version of chicago you have the actual report gunther said jake pulled the flimsy from his breast pocket and watched gunther look it over sipping as he read a colt pistol he said nodding a western fan m is that special no very common fortyfivecaliber very common he handed the paper back so now what jake said now we look for an american bullet that changes everything why not why herr geismar where potsdam all along its a problem the russians closed down the market but there are two things in potsdam the market but also the conference with many americans he wasnt at the conference but perhaps at the compound in babelsberg invited there what could be more likely all the americans are there even truman just down the road from the conference site on the same lake in fact he looked pointedly at jake he was found at the cecilienhof but was he shot there the night before the conference no one there guards only he shook his head bodies drift an obvious point frigging scotland yard isnt it danny said frankly admiring youre a caution gunther no mistake but what isnt obvious is the money jake said always with you the money gunther said because it was there lets say he did have a pass to the compound that he saw an american he still picked up ten thousand dollars you only make that kind of money in the market so all right an american in the market whos also at the conference most of those guys were just flown in theyre not allowed out you dont see any of them here he waved his hand toward the noisy room that is to their credit gunther said dryly nevertheless he was in potsdam and so was an american bullet yes jake said and who is at the conference we can except herr truman washington people state department aides jake said ticking them off not at the meeting in babelsberg everybody jake said thinking of brians requisition list the last blowout of the war cooks bartenders guards theyve even got somebody to mow the lawn everybody except press a wide net gunther said glumly so we eliminate not everybody can authorize first you will find out who issued his papers then after he drifted off back to his own list that still doesnt tell me what he was selling or buying danny said casually what did you say gunther said wide awake putting his hand on dannys arm well any transaction theres two sides isnt there gunther said nothing for a second then patted his arm thank you my friend a simple point yes two sides i mean danny said encouraged hed have dollars wouldnt he an american what it wasnt dollars jake said marks occupation marks oh you might have said russian or american i thought they were the same engraving plates handed over theyre worth the same of course but now the look here danny picked up one of sikorskys dropped notes now this is russian see the little dash before the serial number you wont see that on the american ones somebody in the treasury department careful after all jake wondered if muller knew you sure things like that you notice danny said i thought it was fake see so i asked doesnt make any difference really just something to keep track i reckon who has the money gunther asked jake ive got one of the bills not on me back in the drawer of the frilly pink vanity next to the still of viktor staal then look gunther said but they circulate back and forth dont they gunther nodded it might be suggestive however he turned to danny raising his glass well my friend to your good eye most helpful on the house gunther on the house danny said clinking glasses pleased with himself but if he was buying what was he buying jake said insistently thats an interesting question gunther said as danny poured another drink more difficult why because whatever it was he never got it he still had the money gunther said repeating an earlier point to a slow pupil jake felt a door close how could you trace what was never exchanged now what now we find out who he was what would he buy has teitel spoken to frankfurt i dont know then we wait gunther said sitting back his eyes drooping a little patience so we do nothing gunther opened one eye no you will play the policeman find out who authorized his pass im retired im going to have a brandy jake put his drink down ready to leave the room was even more crowded the bar almost invisible behind a wall of people and the noise was rising now with the smoke covering the band sleepy time down south the clarinet again peppier straining to be heard a girl squealed somewhere then laughed he took a breath claustrophobic but no one else seemed to mind they were all young some as young as danny who was tapping the table in time to the music hed never taken lena dancing in her blue dress the clubs by then had become shadowy dimmed by the nazis taking notes in the audience during the comedy sketches no longer fun just something to show the tourists who wanted to see the femina with the telephones on the tables nobody had been young then not like this and it only came once back in a sec danny said standing up goes through you dont it keep an eye on guntherhe goes right out when he naps jake watched the slick head move through the crowd how many nights did gunther sit here finally oblivious even to the smell the couples on the floor had taken on a kind of blur this is probably what he saw people bouncing through a haze the music almost an echo it occurred to jake that he was probably a little drunk himself another dream song ill get by there was the dress again leaning against the soldier the overweight blonde he narrowed his eyes if you blocked out the rest the dress would come into focus as it had been without the bulges and damp spots moving with her he remembered the press club party when hed sat watching across a different room the dress finally turning her eyes laughing at him in secret a quick flash like the sequins the blonde turned the dress hidden now by the uniform only the shoulder visible shimmering with sequins jake blinked not drunk not a trick of the eye the same dress he stood up and began to cross the room a swimmer people sweeping past him like water when the blonde looked up her face alarmed he saw what he must look like a drunk plowing through the crowd with the crazed determined steps of a sleepwalker her eyes darted away anxious with fear no not fear recognition not as plump as shed been in the office but still a big girl fraulein schmidt a poor typist goebbels spy hannelore he said going up to them go away a rasp nervous where did you get the dress he said in german the soldier had stopped dancing annoyed hey buddy get lost jake grabbed her upper arm the dress where did you get it where is she she wrenched her arm out of his grip what dress go away its hers where is she the soldier placed himself between them holding jakes shoulder whats the matter with you you deaf or something blow i know her jake said trying to get past him yeah well she doesnt want to know you beat it the soldier said shoving him fuck off jake pushed him aside and the soldier staggered a little jake took her arm again where leave me alone a wail loud enough to draw attention people around them stopping in midstep she reached for her soldier steve the soldier grabbed jakes shoulder spinning him around blow or ill deck you you fuck jake swatted his hand away and moved toward her again i know its hers mine she screamed moving away his eyes were still on her so that he missed the punch a hard jab to the stomach making him double over winded now beat it chairs scraped behind them jakes mouth filled with the taste of sour whiskey without thinking he lunged for the soldier trying to push him away but the soldier was waiting he stepped aside then smashed his fist into jakes face sending him backward jake heard the shouts around him as he reached out to grab the air a stunned weightlessness going down until he felt his head crack against the floor another crash as the crowd moved back against a table then everyone leaning over him pushing away the soldier with his fist still raised when jake tried to lift his head blood filling his mouth he felt a surge of nausea and closed his eyes to hold it down dont black out the band stopped more yelling some men were dragging the soldier away another soldier bent down you okay then to the crowd give us some air for christs sake jake tried to get up again clenching his mouth against another taste of bile dizzy take it easy faces bent over him a girl with bright red lipstick but not hannelore wait dont let them go jake said trying to rise i have to the soldier held him down what are you crazy he started it someone said i saw it then gunther was there alert dabbing the corner of jakes mouth with a handkerchief he reached up pulling a bottle from the next table and pouring whiskey over the cloth hey use your own fucking booze a sharp cauterizing sting as surprising as the first punch jake winced heroics gunther said wiping jakes mouth can you move your head jake nodded another sharp pain then seized gunthers arm and pulled himself up dont let them get away he said looking around wildly and starting for the door a dozen hands grabbed him pinning his arms sit the fuck down you want the mps in here he was pushed into a chair someone motioned to the band to start playing it was her dress jake said to gunther who looked at him dumbly he with you the soldier said to gunther we dont want any trouble here you dont understand jake said standing the soldier grabbed him again no you dont its over verstehe you make one move and ill fucking deck you too ill take him home gunther said calmly moving the soldiers hand away no more trouble he clutched jakes arm and forced him to walk slowly toward the door people stared as they squeezed past the tables i have to find her jake said outside the same parked cars and drivers the street black jake looked in both directions everything swallowed up in the dark now my friend what happened jake felt the back of his head a trickle of blood there isnt time go back ill be all right he went over to one of the drivers you see a blonde in a blue dress the driver looked at him suspiciously come on its important big girl with a soldier whats it to you tell him gunther barked suddenly a cop the driver jerked his thumb east toward the memorial church gunther held him theyre gone he said simply its not safe but jake had already thrown off his hand and started to run he could hear gunther call out behind him then even that died away covered by the ragged sound of his own breathing clouds had covered what little moon there was so that the dark seemed tangible like a fog you could brush away theyd been gone only a few minutes not long enough to vanish but there was no one in the street what if the driver was lying he ran faster then rammed his foot into a stray brick lying on the pavement the pain shot up through him joining the dull ache in his head and he stopped holding his stomach to catch his breath they couldnt be far theyd stick to the kudamm hoping for the lights of a cellar bar the side streets would be impossible clogged with unseen rubble assuming they went this way at all up ahead a tiny light flickered in a doorway jake started again limping slightly his sore foot slowing him like a brake hello tommy a soft voice called out where the light had been then another flicker a flashlight shining up under the whores chin bathing her tired face in a ghosts light did you see a couple go by he said in german a blond girl come with me why not fifty marks did you he said insistent go to hell she snapped off the flashlight saving batteries and disappeared in the dark he could make out the jagged edges of the bombed church against the sky as a truck swept around the intersection the old heart of the west end flashing with theater lights now just dark shadows he remembered london in the blackout buses appearing out of nowhere headlights dimmed to slits like crocodile eyes he had always hated it the blindness stumbling over curbs but the ruins here made it worse disturbing twisted shapes in a nightmare a jeep swung out of the broad tauentzienstrasse lighting up the sidewalk for a second a pack of soldiers coming out of a bar and there beyond them holding a flashlight a tall soldier with a fleshy blonde jake picked up his pace ignoring the pain in his foot they were heading toward wittenbergplatz the way he used to go home down past the kadewe windows dont lose her now they had walked so it couldnt be far maybe another club hannelore schmidt goebbels spy who didnt want to be recognized arm in arm with the new order he wondered what shed put on her fragebogen not the calls to nanny wendt where had she got the dress ransacking the old flat in pariserstrasse maybe a trade for food coupons shed know something not a pointless search through bernies files a real connection jake saw them crossing the street now guided by the weaving flashlight which picked up a group of dps huddled in the square shed be safe with steve a handy man to have around in a fight jake touched the corner of his mouth tender still streaked with blood they were across wittenbergplatz it was then he stopped in front of the broken plate glass window watching the tiny beam of light move toward the familiar heavy door almost a joke there all along his old flat passed around the columbia staff until finally hal reidy had left too had hal given it to her a farewell bonus or had she simply moved in another spoil to pick up like the french cognacs and danish hams that flooded into the city that last year the meek inherited after all even hannelore schmidt now what race up the stairs for another punching session with steve now he knew where she was he could come back tomorrow bring some coffee a peace offering and talk to her calmly a light went on in his window his window he imagined hannelore draped over his couch with her gi lenas dress flung aside sequins crumpled on the floor where did she get it he crossed the square warily circling the dps and went into his street a walk hed taken a million times he pushed open the tall wooden door pitch dark the hall light either gone out or stolen in one corner he could hear the dripping of water in a bucket but this was home stairs he could climb with his eyes closed he felt his way up the banister a turn at the landing then up to his floor along the railing to the door he knocked not loud a force of habit the most terrifying sound in germany a knock on the door harder now hannelore what if she refused to open he tried the doorknob locked his flat he knocked again then banged his open palm against the door a steady pounding hannelore finally the sound of the lock clicking the door opening a crack then wider a woman with frightened eyes standing with the light behind her not hannelore a gaunt woman with stringy hair sickbed pale another ruin but over the dark circles her eyes widened im sorry he said embarrassed turning away jacob she whispered he glanced back startled her voice and now the face familiar was taking shape too behind the pale skin not the way hed imagined it the same weightless feeling falling into ronnys tables lena my god his voice also a whisper as if sound would chase her away a ghost not yet real jacob she reached up her hand touching the blood at the corner of his mouth and he realized that he was the ghost wildeyed and bloody someone from another world you came back he took her hand from the streak of blood and moved it to his mouth kissing it grazing the fingers not yet able to take in any more just the fingers real alive she moved them along his lips a braille touch trying to make sense of the ridges you came back he nodded too happy to say anything weightless but not falling rising now a balloon watching her eyes fill still too startled to smile youre hurt she said touching him but he took her fingers away holding them as he shook his head no no it doesnt matter lena my god and then he reached out for her drawing her to his chest arms around her he kissed the side of her face moving his head with hers kissing her everywhere as if he were still afraid shed evaporate unless he touched her lena just saying it holding her tightly his face in her hair feeling her against him until suddenly she let go slumping a dead weight and he realized shed fainted contents previous chapter next chapter chapter seven jake carried her inside there was a pillow on the couch where hal used to flopevidently her bed struggling under her weight he moved past the bathroom to the bedroom door no hands free to open it so he kicked the door was flung open by steve down to dog tags and boxer shorts his socks still on behind him hannelore in a slip let out a squeak steve started toward him boy you dont quit do you she passed out help me get her on the bed steve looked at him dumbfounded its all right im an old friend ask her he cocked his head toward hannelore come on give me a hand steve stepped aside who is he he said to hannelore from before the war no she said to jake as he carried lena in thats my bed shes on the couch a few days she said and now look go fuck in the hall for all i care shes sickshe needs the bed he put her down gently stepping on the blue dress lying on the floor do you have any brandy brandy where would i get brandy steve walked over to his dropped uniform took out a pint bottle and handed it to jake a few drops on her lips then a faint choke eyes half open he wiped sweat from her forehead feverish you going to tell me whats going on here steve said whats wrong with her jake asked hannelore i dont know i took her in she was all right i thought well two rations its a help you know now this she just lies there all day its always the same when youre kindhearted people take advantage her voice hard and aggrieved has she seen a doctor who has money for doctors you look like youre doing all right you cant talk to me like that what do you know about it coming here like this its not your flat its mine now this your place steve asked it was she used to work for me jake said looking at hannelore and dr goebbels she tell you that thats not true you cant prove anything she looked at steve then walked over to the nightstand and lit a cigarette defiant i knew it was trouble when i saw you you never liked me what did i do i take in a friend kindhearted now youre going to make trouble jacob lena said faintly then clutched his hand holding it with her eyes closed get her something to drink shes burning up some water you can spare that cant you hannelore glared at him then started for the kitchen maybe its good youre here you can feed her now im finished with this business nice girl jake said as she left friend of yours steve shrugged a few times shes all right jake glanced over at him ill bet here hannelore said returning with a glass of water jake raised lenas head and made her drink then dipped his handkerchief in the water and put it on her forehead her eyes were open now you came back she said i never thought its all right now well get you a doctor no dont leave she said still holding his hand he looked up at steve listen i need your help we have to get a doctor shes german isnt she army docs dont treat civilians theres a man back at ronnys he knows me ask for alford alford i know alford hannelore said good then you go with him tell him its urgenttonight and have his doctor bring medicine penicillin i guess whatever he has say its a personal favor to me he stood up pulling out his wallet here tell him its a down payment if its more ill pay him tomorrow whatever he wants hannelores eyes widened at the sight of the money dont even think about it jake said every mark ill check go to hell she said offended go get him yourself then listen hannelore for two cents id turn you in theyll make you a rubble lady its hell on the nails he looked at her red fingertips now get dressed and do it hey you cant talk to her and ill have you up for fraternizing with a nazi and assaulting an officer i can do it too steve stared at him tough guy he said finally please jake said shes sick for christs sake you can see that steve glanced over at the bed then nodded and began to put on his pants im not a nazi hannelore said i was never a nazi never shut up and get dressed steve said throwing her the dress you were always trouble for me she said to jake still disgruntled pulling the dress over her head always and what made you so perfect sneaking around with her i knew all the time everybody knew here jake said handing steve the money you take it hes a young guy slick hair he took a key from his pocket my jeeps there if you want to drive back steve shook his head she can walk what do you mean she can walk where are you going hannelore said still arguing with him as they went out the door you mustnt be angry with her lena said in the sudden quiet shes had a hard time jake sat on the bed looking at her still trying to take her in youve been here all the time he said as if that were the remarkable thing i passed the other day i knew she had the flat there was nowhere else the bombs he nodded pariserstrasse i know i looked for you everywhere i saw frau dzuris remember she smiled poppyseed cakes shes not fat anymore he wiped her brow letting his hand rest on the side of her face have you been eating yes shes good to me she shares her ration and of course she gets a little extra from the soldiers how long has that been going on she shrugged we eat how long have you been sick a little while i dont know the fever this week do you want to sleep i cant sleep not now i want to hear but in fact she closed her eyes how did you find me i knew the dress she smiled her eyes still closed my good blue lena he said smoothing her hair my god oh i must look terrible do you even recognize me he kissed her forehead what do you think thats a nice lie youll look even better after the doctor fixes you up youll see ill bring some food tomorrow she held her hand to his head looking at him i thought id never see you again never she noticed his uniform are you a soldier were you in the war he turned slightly and pointed to his shoulder patch correspondent tell me she paused blinking as if caught by a sudden pain where to begin tell me everything that happened to you did you go back to america no once a visit then london all over and nowhere i told you id come back didnt you believe me he took her by the shoulders everythings going to be the same she turned her head its not so easy to be the same yes it is youll see were the same her eyes already shiny with fever grew moister but she smiled yes youre the same he brushed the bare hairline above his temple almost anyway he looked down at her youll see just like before she closed her eyes and he busied himself wetting the handkerchief disconcerted by his own words not like before so you found hannelore he said trying to be conversational then wheres emil i dont know she said her voice curiously detached dead maybe it was terrible here at the end he was in berlin no up north for the army oh he said not trusting himself to say more he stood up ill get some more water try getting a little sleep before the doctor gets here like a nurse she said closing her eyes thats right im going to take care of you go to sleep dont worry ill be here it seems impossible i just opened the door her voice drifting he turned to leave then stopped lena what makes you think hes dead i would have heard she moved her hand up covering her eyes everyones dead why not him youre not no not yet she said wearily he glanced at her thats the fever talking ill be right back he walked through the main room to the kitchen everything the same in the bedroom littered with hannelores clothes and bottles of lotion he could imagine being somewhere else but here it was his flat the couch against the wall the little table by the window not even rearranged as if hed simply gone away for the weekend the kitchen shelves were barethree potatoes and a few cans of c rations a jar of ersatz coffee no bread how did they live at least hannelore had her dinner at ronnys surprisingly the gas ring worked a kettle to make coffee no tea the room itself felt hungry its cold she said when he put a new wet cloth on her forehead its good for the fever just keep it there he sat for a minute looking at her an old cotton wrapper dotted with patches of sweat wrists thin enough to snap like one of the grim dps hed seen plodding across the tiergarten where had emil been i went to the elisabeth he said frau dzuris said you worked there with the children there was no one to help so she winced so i went there did they get out before the raid not bombs shells the russians then the fire she turned her head eyes filling no one got out he turned the cloth over feeling helpless dont think about it now no one got out but she had somehow another berlin story tell me later he said softly get some sleep he smoothed her hair again as if it would empty her head and in a few minutes it seemed to work the little gasps evened out and became almost soundless so that only the faint movement of her chest showed she was breathing at all where was hannelore he watched her sleep for a while then got up and looked around the jumbled room clothes had been flung over the chair a pair of shoes resting on top without thinking he began putting things away filling time a messy room is the sign of a messy mindhis mothers old saying ingrained after all he realized absurdly that he was tidying up for the doctor as if it mattered he opened the closet door he had left a few things with hal but they were gone traded perhaps on one of the message boards in their place a fur coat was hanging next to some dresses a little ragged but still fur the kind of thing hed heard they collected to send to the troops on the eastern front but hannelore had kept hers a present no doubt from a friend in the ministry or maybe just salvaged after one of the bombing raids when the owner hadnt got out he went into the living room there wasnt much to straighten herethe lumpy couch a suitcase neatly set underneath some stray cups that hadnt been washed near the window table something newan empty birdcage hannelores one addition to the room otherwise just as before he washed the cups in cold water then wiped off the sink counter settling in when there was nothing left to do he stood by the window smoking thinking about the hospital what else had she seen all the time hed imagined her in the old flat getting dressed to go out frowning at herself in the mirror safe under some bell jar of memory the last four years were only supposed to have happened to him a few cigarettes later he heard hannelore on the stairs leave the door open she said switching off her flashlight hell never find it otherwise wheres the doctor hes coming they had to get him how is she sleeping she grunted and went into the kitchen pulling down a bottle hidden over the top shelf wheres steve jake said you ruined that for me she said pouring a drink hell never come back now dont worry therere plenty more where he came from you think its so easy what am i supposed to do now ill make it up to you ill pay for the room too she cant sleep out here no only me is that it how can i bring people to a couch i said id pay you can take a vacation give yourself a rest you could use it go to hell she said then noticed the washed cups on the counter ha maid service too my ship has come in but she sounded mollified now already counting the money you have a cigarette he gave her one and lit it ill move her out as soon as shes better here take this he handed her some money i cant move her now all right all right nobodys throwing anybody out i like lena she was always nice to me not like some she said looking at him she used to come sometimes during the war bring coffee have a little visit not for me i knew why she came she wanted to be here just sit in the flat make sure it was still here it reminded her i suppose such foolishness everything just so hannelore you moved the chair didnt you like it over here i knew what she was up to and my god what did it matter with the bombs every night where a chair was if it makes you so happy move it back id say and you know she would foolishness she finished off the drink yes jake said another bell jar did hal give you the apartment of course he was a friend of mine you know no i didnt know he said genuinely surprised oh you you never noticed anything just her thats all you could see hal was very nice i always liked the americans even you a little you werent a bad sort sometimes she added then paused dont make trouble for me i was never a nazi i dont care what you think never the bdm onlyall the girls in school had to join but not a nazi do you know what theyll do theyll give me a number v ration cardthats a death card you cant live on that i dont want to make trouble for you im grateful to you huh she said putting out her cigarette but im still on the couch well let me get my things when she came back she was in a silk nightgown her heavy breasts bulging hals friend does it embarrass you she said almost coquettish well i cant help that if im out here she spread a sheet on the couch is she still sleeping hannelore nodded she doesnt look so good she said how long has she been sick a week maybe two when she came i thought she was just tired you know everyone looks tired now i didnt know what could i do there wasnt much to eat ill bring some food tomorrow for both of you and some cigarettes maybe she had begun wiping her face with a damp cloth taking off years with the rouge how old would she be now twentyfive sure herr geismar she said to herself shaking her head back in berlin who would have thought even the old room eh ill wait up jake said sleep if you like oh with a man in the room not likely maybe just a little rest but in a little while she was out her mouth open the sheet barely covering her breasts the unconcerned sleep of a child more waiting staring out into the eerie darkness of wittenbergplatz he made mental listsfood medicine if he could get it from the dispensary faking an illness if not gunther who could get anything but what medicine he glanced at his watch onethirty what kind of doctor came at two in the morning he came at three a little tapping up the stairs then a skeletal frame in the doorway clearing his throat as if he were ringing a bell he was almost grotesquely thin with sunken concentration camp eyes where had danny found him a rucksack for a medicine bag youre the doctor rosen he nodded formally where is she jake pointed to the bedroom watching rosen take in the sleeping hannelore on the couch first somewhere to wash my hands jake assumed it was a euphemism but in the bathroom rosen really did wash his hands then dry them methodically like a surgeon should i boil some water jake said at a loss why is she having a baby in the bedroom jake woke her gently then stepped aside as rosen felt her throat with his clean hands presumably testing for swelling a palm on her forehead instead of a thermometer how long i dont know she said a week or so too long why didnt you call before but that was too complicated to explain so jake just stood there hovering can i do something you can make some coffee im not often up at this hour jake went to the kitchen sent off like an expectant father superfluous filling the kettle a small pop as the gas lit in the living room hannelore moaned and turned over he went back to the bedroom and stopped at the door rosen had opened her robe so that she lay naked on the bed his hands spreading her legs to examine her an unexpected intimacy the body jake had seen so many times stroking it to life now being prodded like a slab shes not one of dannys girls he wanted to shout but rosen had already caught his look of dismay ill call you he said curtly go make the coffee jake backed out of the doorway why examine her there the only thing dannys doctor would know but who else could he have called he saw the hands on her white thigh in the kitchen he stirred the fake coffee in a cup no sugar nothing he heard them talking down the hall questions lenas faint replies he picked up the cup to take it in but rosen didnt want him there instead he put it on the table and sat watching it grow cold hannelores hair had come undone a messy girl even in her sleep when rosen finally came out he washed his hands again under the kitchen tap jake started for the bedroom no ive given her something to sleep he poured some of the kettle water into another cup and dropped in a syringe needle she should be in a hospital why did you wait whats wrong with her these girls rosen said shaking his head who did the abortion what abortion jake said stunned you didnt know he went over to the table and sipped some coffee they shouldnt wait so long is she all right yes its done but there was an infection lack of hygiene perhaps jake sat down feeling sick another bed hands probing not washed what kind of infection dont worry not venereal she can work again you dont understand shes not rosen held up his hand thats your affair i dont ask but shell need more penicillin i only had the one dose can you make an injection no i thought not ill come back meanwhile use these he put some tablets on the table not as strong but you need to bring the fever down make her take them never mind the taste thank you jake said taking them they are expensive that doesnt matter a valuable girl rosen said wryly shes not what you think it doesnt matter what i think just give her the tablets he glanced toward the couch you have two here jake turned away feeling like danny stung by sikorskys money but who cared what rosen thought did she tell you she had an abortion jake said she didnt have to thats what i do are you a real doctor youre a fine one to ask for credentials rosen said then sighed and took another gulp of coffee i was a medical student in leipzig but of course i was thrown out i became a doctor in the camp no one asked for a degree there dont worry i know what im doing and now you work for danny you have to live somehow you learn that in the camp too he put down the coffee cup ready to go so the tablets dont forget he said getting up ill come tomorrow you have something on account jake handed him some money is this enough he nodded the penicillin will be more anything just get it but shell be all right if you keep her off the streets at least no russians theyre all diseased shes not a whore well im not a doctor either such niceties he turned to go what time tomorrow after dark but not so late as this please not even for danny i cant thank you enough you dont have to thank me at all just pay me youre wrong about her jake said wondering why it mattered shes a respectable woman i love her rosens face softened surprised at the words something from a forgotten language yes he said he turned away again his eyes weary then dont ask about the abortion just give her the tablets jake waited until the steps had died away in the stairwell before he closed the door dont ask but how could he not worth putting your life at risk a matter of hygiene he put the cup in the sink then turned out the light and started down the hall exhausted she was sleeping her face smooth in the soft glow of the lamp the way he had imagined it the two of them in bed his bed even holding each other as if the war hadnt happened but not yet he sank onto the chair and took off his shoes hed wait here until it was light then wake hannelore to keep watch but the chair was springy poking at him like thoughts he went over and lay down on his side of the bed still in uniform on top of the sheet so he wouldnt disturb her when he reached over to switch off the light she stirred with a kind of dreamy restlessness then as he lay staring up at the dark she took his hand and held it jacob she whispered ssh its all right im here she tossed a little her head moving in a slow rhythm so that he realized she was still asleep that hed become part of the dream dont tell emil she said her voice not quite in the room about the child promise me i promise he said and then her body relaxed her hand still locked in his peacefully while he lay staring at the ceiling wide awake lena slept through most of the next day as if his being there had finally allowed her to be really sick not to have to make the effort to get up he took the time out to get things the jeep miraculously still there money from his army account supplies at the px goods bulging on the shelves and piled high on the floor a change of clothes at gelferstrasse life errands he threw his battered portable into the bag with his clothes then told the old couple hed be away for a day or two and was there any food he could take more cans the old man handed him something wrapped in paper about the size of a bar of soap nobody in germany has had butter for a long time he said and jake nodded a conspirator at the press camp where he went to collect messages there were sandwiches and doughnuts he filled another bag well somebody got lucky i see ron said handing him a press release todays schedule if you care and details on the us dinner a good time was had by all it was too i hear churchill got pissed take the ham sandwiches its what they like cant get enough ham the frauleins need any rubbers somebody ought to spank you ron grinned youll thank me later believe me you dont want to go home with pus between your legs by the way they loved you in the newsreel maybe theyll use it jake looked at him puzzled then shrugged it off not wanting to talk dont be a stranger ron said as he hurried out but he already was potsdam even tiddly churchill felt a million miles away when he passed the flags in front of the headquarters building he felt he was leaving a foreign country saluting itself a provider of tins he glanced at the full sacks on the seat beside him theyd eat out of cans but theyd eat in the bright sunshine the villas and trees in grunewald were as lovely as ever why hadnt he noticed before he didnt see the rubble as he sped up the kurfurstendamm just the happy morning light for a moment it seemed still lined with shops the important thing was to get fluids into her to prevent dehydration soup every mothers remedy as ron had predicted hannelore fell on the sandwiches ham my god and white bread no wonder you won the war to eat like this we were starving save one okay he said watching her gobble it down hows lena sleeping how she can sleep that one whats that soup he said putting the pot on the ring soup she said a child at christmas is there another tin maybe my friend annemarie she would be so grateful the thought of getting her out of the house made him generous he handed her two cans then a pack of cigarettes these are for you luckies she said in english youre not a bad sort when he took the soup in lena was awake looking out the window still pale he felt her forehead not as bad as before but still feverish he began to spoon soup for her but she took it from him sitting up no i can feed myself hike doing it youll make me an invalid i feel so lazy never mind ive got nothing better to do you should work she said and he laugheda sign of life the way she used to scold him back to the typewriter would you like anything a bath but theres no hot water its terrible how we all smell i hadnt noticed he said kissing her forehead let me see what i can do it took forever the boiling water seemed to turn cold the minute it touched the porcelain so he had to carry more pots from the gas ring like a slow conveyor belt until finally he had a shallow bath not really hot but a little better than tepid he thought of gelferstrasse and its steaming tub soap she said where did you get it us army come on hop in but she hesitated the old selfconsciousness you dont mind she said indicating the door you didnt use to be so shy in the same tub bubbles covering her breasts laughing at him when he patted her dry getting himself wet please im so thin he nodded and closed the door behind him then went into the bedroom musty despite the open window rumpled sheets hannelore probably hadnt changed in weeks but how could she have washed them the smallest household task had become an ordeal he found another set in the closet and changed the bed while he listened to the splashing next door hospital corners everything stretched tightly he was in the kitchen washing up when she came out toweling her hair she looked brighter as if the dark circles under her eyes had been merely dirt ill do that she said no you get into bed im going to spoil you for a few days your typewriter she said moving to the table and touching the keys not the same one though thats still in africa somewhere i had a hell of a time getting this one she touched the keys again he saw that her shoulders were shaking and he went over to her turning her around so silly she said crying a typewriter then she fell against his shoulder holding him so that his face was in her hair a fresh smell now and he burrowed into it lena he said feeling her shudder still crying the way it should have been at the train station some involuntary release her head nodded against him and they stood that way for a minute just holding each other until he felt the heat through her hair and pulled away brushing tears from the corners of her eyes with his fingers maybe some rest huh she nodded again its the fever this she said wiping her eyes collecting herself so silly thats what it is he said just hold me she said like you used to and for a moment he didnt want to do anything else so happy the room around him seemed to melt away but her hair was damp with sweat again and he could feel her sag against him come on well put you to bed he said his arm around her as he walked her down the hall clean sheets he said pleased with himself but she didnt seem to notice she slipped into bed and closed her eyes ill let you sleep no talk to me its like medicine tell me about africa not the war what it was like egypt yes egypt he sat on the bed brushing back her hair on the river its beautiful you know sailboats she frowned as if trying to see it boats in the desert and temples huge ill take you someday he said and when she didnt respond he went on describing cairo and the old souk the pyramids of spices until he saw that she had finally drifted on another sailboat he finished washing up then out of habit sat down at the typewriter lena was right he should work theyd expect something in a day or two and here was the old table where he used to type out the broadcasts looking into the busy square the street was almost deserted now just the usual thin stream of army trucks and refugees but the spell had caught him all the familiar props when he started typing the clicking sound filled the room like an old phonograph record found at the bottom of the pile potsdam up close something he could make up from hearsay and pictures but with a chance to put himself on the spot facetoface with the big three almost as if hed been at the baize table too talking to them the only journalist there something colliers would like maybe even a cover line dressed up with eyewitness detailsthe red star of geraniums the chimneys the patrolling russians then the contrast to central berlin his trip that first day churchill at the chancellery putting himself in brian stanleys place who wouldnt mind and who probably wouldnt see it anyway our man in berlin not what had really happeneda squalid murder getting his life backbut what mattered to colliers enough to keep the contract going the football game as a finish building the peace even while the big three negotiated when he finished it was a thousand words too long but colliers could worry about that he was back in business let them cut quent reynolds rosen came before dinner not furtive this time even apologetic mr alford explained the situation forgive me if i never mind youre here thats what matters shes been sleeping yes good you didnt say anythingwhat i told you sometimes its a little sensitive even after everything their sweethearts come back they think everyone waits its difficult i dont care no its not always the case another berlin story that didnt make the piece arguments and tears he thought of the soldiers crossing the landwehrkanal that day almost home this time rosen had brought a thermometer a little better he said at the bed reading it the penicillin must be working a miracle drug from mold imagine how much longer until shes better he said vaguely you cant kill the infection with one shot not even a miracle drug now you gnadige frau drink sleep thats allno shopping a friendly bedside phrase as if there were shops think good thoughts sometimes thats the best hes taking care of me lena said he changed the sheets noticing after all so rosen said amazed still a german man outside jake gave him money do you need any food he said pointing to the cans on the counter px perhaps some tinned meat if you can spare jake handed him a can i remember rosen said looking down at it when we got out the americans gave us these we couldnt eattoo rich it wouldnt stay down we threw up everything right in front of them they were offended i think well how could they know excuse me for last night sometimes its not only the body that vomits the spirit goes too you dont have to explain i saw buchenwald rosen nodded and turned to the door keep up with the tablets dont forget lena insisted on getting up for dinner so the three of them sat around the table hannelore bubbling over with high spirits as if the ham sandwich had been another kind of injection wait till you see what i got at zoo station lena for ten cigarettes she wanted the pack and i said who gets a pack for a dress even ten was too many you know but i couldnt resist in good condition too ill show you she got up and held the dress to her body see how well cut she must have known somebody i think you know and see how it fits not too small here she took off her dress without a hint of embarrassment and slid the new one over her slip see maybe a tuck here but otherwise perfect dont you think perfect lena said eating soup a little more color than before i couldnt believe the luck i can wear it tonight youre going out jake said an unexpected bonus to the shopping trip the flat to themselves of course im going out why not you know they opened a new cinema in alexanderplatz the russians lena said grimly well but some are nice they have money too who else is there no one i guess lena said indifferently thats right of course the americans are nicer but none of them speak german except for the jews are you not going to finish that jake handed her his piece of bread white bread she said a child with a sweet well id better get ready you know theyre on moscow time everything so early isnt that crazy when they have all those watches leave the dishes ill do them later thats all right jake said knowing she wouldnt in a minute he heard a trickle of water in the bathroom then a spray of perfume lena sat back finished looking out the window ill get coffee jake said i have a treat for you she smiled at him then looked again out the window theres no one in wittenbergplatz it used to be so busy here try this he said bringing her the coffee and giving her a doughnut its better if you dunk its not polite she said laughing but dipped it daintily and took a bite see youd never know they were stale how do i look hannelore said coming in hair pinned again like betty grables doesnt it fit well a tuck here she pinched the side then gathered up her purse feel better lena she said unconcerned dont bring anyone back jake said i mean it hannelore made a face at him oddly like a rebellious teenager and said ha too full of herself to be annoyed look at you an old couple dont wait up she said pulling the door behind her an old couple lena said stirring her coffee im not yet thirty theres nothing to thirty im thirtythree i was sixteen when hitler came think of it my whole life nazis nothing else she looked out again at the ruins they took everything didnt they she said moodily all those years youre not ready for a cane yet jake said and when she managed a smile he took her hand across the table well start over she nodded its not so easy sometimes things happen he looked away why bring it up at all but it seemed an opening lena he said still not looking at her rosen said you had an abortion was it emils emil almost a laugh no i was raped she said simply oh he said just a sound does that bother you no a quick lie without missing a beat how how the usual way a russian when they attacked the hospital they raped everybody even the pregnant mothers christ not so unusual it was ordinary then at the end look how squeamish you are men do the raping but they never want to talk about it only the women thats all we talked about thenhow many times are you diseased i was afraid for weeks that i had been infected but no instead a little russian then when i got rid of it a different infection rosen says it isnt venereal no but no more children either i think where did you get it done he asked picturing a dark alley the cliche warning of his youth a clinic there were so many the russians set up a clinic troop excesses first they rape you then they wasnt there a doctor in berlin there was nothing my parents were in hamburg god knows if theyre alive there was nowhere else to go a friend told me about it free she said so another gift from the russians where was emil i dont know dead anyway not here his fathers still alive but they dont speak i couldnt go to him he blames emil for all this if you can imagine because he joined the party she nodded for his work thats all it was but his father she looked up you knew you never told me no what would you have said do you think it would have made a difference to me maybe to me i dont know and this room when we came here it was away from all that emil everything somewhere away do you know what i mean yes anyway he wasnt one of them not political the institute thats all he cared about his numbers what did he do during the war he never said it wasnt allowed to talk about such things but of course it was weapons thats what they all did the scientistsmake weapons even emil his head always in a book what else could they do she looked up i dont apologize for him it was the war i know he said stay in berlin its better he didnt want me to be part of all that but then the bombing got so bad they allowed the wives to go there with them so the men wouldnt worry but how could i leave then she said staring into the cup her eyes beginning to fill what did it matter i couldnt leave berlin not after peter her voice caught drifting into some private thought whos peter she looked up i forgot you dont know peter was our son your son he said stung in spite of himself a family with someone else where is he she stared back at the cup he was killed she said her voice flat in a raid almost three her eyes filled again he put his hand on hers you dont have to tell me but she hadnt heard him the words spilling out now a purge i left him in the kindergarten why did i do that in the shelter all night i had him with me he would sleep in my lap not cry like the others and i thought well thats over another night but then the americans came thats when they started like thatthe british at night the americans in the day no letup eleven oclock i remember i was shopping when the warning came and of course i ran back but the wardens caught meeveryone into the shelter and i thought the nurserys safe they had a deep cellar she stopped for a moment looking away to the window then after the raid i went there and it was gone gone all buried we had to dig them out all day digging but maybe there was a chance then the screaming when they brought them out one after another we had to identify them you see screaming i went a little crazy be quiet be quiet youll frighten them imagine saying such a thing and the crazy thing waspeter not a scratch no blood how could he be dead but of course he was blue later they told me it was asphyxiation you just stop breathing no pain but how do they know i just sat there in the street with him all day i wouldnt move not even for the wardens why do you know what its like to lose a child both of you die nothings the same after that lena he said stopping her all you can think is why did i leave him there why did i do that he got up and stood behind her smoothing his hands on her shoulders calming her itll pass he said quietly she took out a handkerchief and blew her nose yes i know at first i didnt believe it but hes dead i know thats all there is to it sometimes i dont even think about it anymore isnt that terrible no i dont think about anything thats what its like now you know what i used to think during the war that you would come and rescue mefrom the bombs everything here how i dont know out of the sky maybe something crazy youd just appear at the door like yesterday and take me away a fairy tale like the girl in the castle now youre here and its too late dont talk like that he said turning her chair and bending down looking up at her its not too late no you still want to rescue me she ran her fingers across his hair i love you she stopped to hear that again after all these terrible things thats over im here yes youre here she said her hands at the sides of his face i thought nothing good would ever happen to me again how can i believe it you still love me i never stopped you dont stop but such terrible things and now im an old woman he reached out and touched her hair were an old couple that night they slept close together his arm around her like a shield even bad dreams couldnt get through contents previous chapter next chapter chapter eight each day was better so that by the following weekend she was able to go out hannelore had found a friend temporarily and theyd been alone for days a reclusive happiness that had finally become confining jake had done a second pieceadventures in the black market russians and mickey mouse watches the food situation danny and his girls discreetly left outand lena had slept and read getting stronger but the weather had grown sultry the humid berlin summer that used to drive everyone to the parks now just swirled the rubble dust coating the windows with grit even lena was restless neither of them had seen the russian sector lena because she refused to go there alone so jake drove east through the mitte past gendarmenmarkt then opernplatz where theyd made bonfires of books everything gone when they saw the cavedin berliner dom in the distance they were too dispirited to go on and decided to stroll up the linden instead the old sunday outing no one was out walking now in the ruins a makeshift cafe that had been set up just before friedrichstrasse was crammed with russians sweating in the heat theyll never leave lena said its finished here now the trees will grow back jake said looking at the black stumps my god look at the adlon but jake was looking at the figure coming through the door the building evidently only partially ruined sikorsky noticed him at the same time and came over mr geismar you decided to visit us after all he said shaking hands for the afternoon tea perhaps they still have it oh yes its a tradition im told not so formal now but more democratic yes in fact everyone jake could see at the door brimmed with medals and decorations a generals playground in the back there are still some rooms from mine you can see goebbels garden or so they tell me it was excuse me he said turning to lena i am general sikorsky a polite bow im sorry jake said fraulein brandt why not frau brandt he said looking at her carefully its a common name in germany yes yes youre a berliner you have family here no all killed when the russians came she said an unexpected provocation but sikorsky merely nodded mine too my wife two children in kiev im sorry for that lena said embarrassed now he acknowledged this with another nod the fortunes of war how is it a beautiful woman is still unmarried i was hes dead then i am sorry for that sikorsky said well enjoy your walk a sad sight he said looking at the street so much to do goodbye so much to do lena said after he walked away and who made it like this russians did you see the way he looked at me i dont blame him he has an eye for a pretty girl jake stopped and put his hand to the side of her head you are you know look at you youve got your color back like before she looked up at him then shook her head embarrassed again no not that something else suspicious the russians are suspicious of everything i heard he was in intelligence they look at everybody that way come on they walked past the brandenburg gate still plastered with giant posters of the big three no trees she said oh jake lets go back tell you what well go out to the grunewald take a walk in the woods you up for that its not like this no cooler too ill bet he said wiping sweat from his face something for the lady a german in an overcoat and fedora detached from the group milling around the reichstag no lena said go away prewar material the man said opening his coat and pulling out a folded garment very nice my wifes scarcely worn see he was unfolding the dress no please im not interested think how shell look he said to jake for summer light here feel how much no jake i dont want it look how old from before the war but thats what had caught his eye the kind of dress she used to wear you have cigarettes the man said eagerly jake held it up against her cinched waist blouse top the way she had always looked its nice he said you could use something no really she said flustered as if she were being dressed in public where everyone could see she looked around expecting mps with whistles put it away itll look pretty on you he took out a fresh pack of cigarettes what had hannelore said was the going rate but just then mps did appear british soldiers with white sticks beginning to scatter the crowd like chickens the german snatched the pack flinging the dress at jake a thousand thanks he said hurrying a bargainyou wont regret it he began to run toward the arch his overcoat flapping oh such foolishness anyway its too much a whole pack thats all right i feel rich he looked at her i havent bought you anything in a long time she began folding the dress look its wrinkled itll steam out youll look nice he put his hand up to her hair with your hair down she looked up at him i dont wear it that way anymore maybe once a few pins he said taking one out she brushed his hand away oh you youre impossible nobody wears it that way anymore back in the jeep they drove through charlottenburg down more long avenues of ruins dust hanging in the heavy air until finally they could see trees at the edge of the grunewald and beyond them the water where the river widened to make the lakes it was cooler but not much the sun blocked by clouds now turning the water to slate the air still thick with listless heat at the old yacht club union jacks hung from flagpoles not even stirred by a breeze they could see two boats on the water becalmed their sails as motionless as two white dabs in a painting but at least the city was behind them nothing now but the broad water and across it suburban houses in gatow poking through the trees they took the road rimming the water ignoring the charred patches in the forest and smelling pines the clean air of before the boats should come in its going to storm my god its hot she patted her face with a handkerchief lets put our feet in but the little stretch of beach deserted was littered with bottles and pieces of artillery shells that had washed up on shore a bathtub ring of debris so they crossed the road to the woods the air was sticky but peaceful no hikers shouting out to each other no clomping horses on the riding trails alone in a way theyd never been before hiding from the sunday crowds once theyd made love here behind some bushes the sound of trotting horses just a few yards away the threat of being discovered as exciting as flesh getting away with something remember the time he started yes i know what youre thinking i was so nervous you liked it yes i did he said looking at her surprised to find himself aroused just remembering it im sure they saw theres no one here now he said moving her against a tree on impulse kissing her oh jake she said a light scold not here but she let him kiss her again opening her mouth then suddenly felt him against her and gasped breaking away no i cant its all right theres no one not that she said shaking her head distressed anybody touching there im not anybody i cant help it she lowered her head its the same please he touched her face im sorry you dont know what it was like she said still looking down it wont be like that he said softly but she broke away leaving the tree like a knife she said choking a little tearing stop how can i stop you dont know you think everything goes away it doesnt go away i can still see his face one touch there and i see his face is that what you want no he said quietly i want you to see me now she did stop and she rushed over to him putting her hand on his chest i do its just i cant he nodded oh dont look like that how did he look a flush of shame and disappointment the first bright day out of the sickroom as murky now as the overcast sky its not important he said you dont mean that he put his finger under her chin lifting it i want to make love to youtheres a difference ill wait she leaned her face into his chest im sorry i still well take it a little bit at a time a light kiss see he stopped and held her by the shoulders it wont be like that for you she said stinging him so that he drew away a little something new a voice he hadnt heard before but who knew her better every part of her a little bit at a time he said kissing her again easing her out of it and then what she said moodily a little more he said but before he could kiss her the sky finally broke a loud crackle and streak of light and he smiled laughing at the cue then that thats what happens see she looked at him how can you joke he stroked her face its supposed to be fun the first drops fell come on we dont want you to get wet she looked down again biting her lower lip what if it never happens she stopped and clutched at his shirt ignoring the rain ill do it if you want to she said flatly right here like the other time if you want with your eyes closed ill do it he shook his head i dont want to be somebody elses face she looked away now youre angry i thought you wanted the way it used to be not like this he put his finger to her hair anyway im getting wet theres nothing like a cold shower to take your mind off things he said trying to be light but watching her still uneasy im sorry she said head down no dont he said wiping the rain off her cheek we have lots of time all the time we want come on youre soaked she kept her head down preoccupied as he led her back to the road the rain had picked up drenching the jeep and it cut into them when they started to drive he left the open road for the woods as if crazily the trees would shelter them forgetting that the trails were dirt at this end of the park full of ruts and puddles he went faster when they hit the straight road heading east worried now that the wet would chill her make her sick again she had crouched down behind the windshield curled up against the rain an excuse to withdraw into herself the woods were dreary and somber and he cursed himself for taking the shortcut no drier and filled with shadows like the rest of the day what had he expected sunlit meadows and a picnic rug wet with sex too soon but what if it was always going to be too soon when she had stood by the tree shuddering hed felt he was back in the collapsing house its joints creaking too wounded to be propped up again a gasp just at a touch it wont be like that how did he know only one of them had gone through it and he had pushed maybe ruined things like some kid eager to get laid except he hadnt planned anything it had just happened trying to get it back one of those afternoons when everything had been good when they both wanted it too soon he stopped to take cover at the avus underpass army trucks roaring on the concrete trestle over their heads but she was shivering no warmer than out in the rain walls dripping clammy better to make a run for it change clothes not huddle in the wet but where wittenbergplatz was miles at least get out of the woods they passed krumme lanke almost through now and he saw the street leading to the document center maybe bernie was there snug in his cellar of index cards but what good would he be jake looked over at her alarmed still hunched and shivering all the healing of the past week about to be undone a hot bath he remembered carrying pots to the tepid tub speeding now past the press camp maybe liz had something dry to wear no civilians in the billets but who would stop him the old couple he was lucky there was no one at gelferstrasse the house so empty you could hear the clock she hesitated at the door is this where you live its allowed say youre my niece he said pulling her in their wet shoes squeaked up the stairs leaving prints in there he said pointing to his door ill start a bath for you water so hot it steamed he opened the tap as far as it would go then saw a jar of bath salts liz had left on the shelf and poured some in a little foam the smell of lavendermaybe a present from tall joe she was standing inside the door looking around her dress dripping your room its so funny pink like a girls it was here he handed her a towel better get those off the baths all yours he went over to his closet stripping down and throwing the wet clothes in a pile he pulled out a clean shirt and went over to the drawer for underwear when he turned he found her watching him and suddenly shy held up the shirt to cover himself youre still dressed he said yes she said and he realized she was waiting for him to leave modest again afraid to reveal anything okay okay he said grabbing his pants ill be downstairs take as long as you wantthe heatll do you good id forgotten she said what you looked like he glanced up at her disconcerted then picked up dry shoes and headed for the door thatll give you something to think about in the tub come on off he said pointing to her dress dont worry i wont look theres a woman lives next door she wont mind if you borrow something no i have my new dress she said unfolding it only a little damp here see a bargain he said closing the door downstairs he put on his shoes then sat staring out the window at the rain a little bit at a time and yet there theyd been almost naked in a room looking at each other he could hear the water running but more slowly now keeping it hot while she soaked like strangers as if theyd never been to bed lying there afterward watching her at the mirror but that had been before he got a drink from one of the labeled bottles in the dining roommuller who could certainly spare itand brought it back to the window the rain was falling straight not even hitting the open sill the kind of steady rain that could go on for hours good for crops and staying indoors there was a phonograph near the piano and he went over and flipped through the stack of records v discs the nat cole trio clearly somebodys favorite he took a record out of its sleeve and put it on straighten up and fly right light and silly american he sat down with a cigarette and put his feet on the windowsill brooding despite the music the last thing hed anticipated so sure how it would be when the song repeated itself he frowned and got up to take it off no water now no sounds upstairs shed be drying herself toweling her hair pinning it back up he heard a soft movement like mice and knew she must be crossing the hall in his room he took a handful of records and put them on in a stack so he wouldnt hear anything else no rustling nothing to make his thoughts dart back and forth just a piano bass and guitar and the steady rain he put his feet back up on the sill the old afternoons had never been long enougha rush to get dressed back into the city now the minutes stretched out with nowhere to go as formless and lazy as the cigarette smoke curling up in the empty house he didnt hear her when she came in just felt some change in the air behind the music a smell of lavender he turned his head and saw that she was standing still waiting for him to see her making an entrance tentative he stood up staring his mind turning over the bath had given her color pink as his room her old face but there was more the dress was a little big and she had belted it tightly making it blouse over on top a dress she had combed out her hair to go with it letting it fall down around her face in the old style all arranged like an invitation everything hed asked for she smiled shyly taking his silence for approval and took a few steps toward him then turned to the phonograph a girl on a date looking for something to say what does it mean youre the cream in my coffee she said looking at the record that they go together he said absently still staring at her its a joke she said making small talk he nodded hearing the lines now because she seemed to be listening like that my worcestershire dear worcestershire stumbling over it in english a sauce she glanced over at him do i look all right yes i borrowed the shoes and then nothing just looking at him while the record changed waiting a slower song now ill string along with you the kind they dreamed to at ronnys she came over to him swaying a little in the unfamiliar shoes and put her hand on his shoulder do you still know how i think i forget he smiled and put his hanc on her waist beginning to move with her they danced in a small circle not close letting the song lead through the thin material he could feel that she had nothing on underneath and it startled him as if she were naked past the fumbling hooks and snaps of getting undressed all ready he moved away slightly still unsure of her but she held him her eyes on his keeping him with her no sound but the rain you didnt have to do this he said touching her hair i wanted to you like it this way a smile pleased with herself still looking up at him until finally he didnt know what it meant what had happened upstairs except that questions would ruin it and they were moving together just dance a little bit at a time the record changed she moved closer warm against him so that he could feel the swell of her down below the faint scratch of her hair through the material teasing him he started to move back its all right she said i want to feel you but she had blinked like the gasp at the tree and when she put her head on his shoulder it was to close her eyes willing herself against him lena you dont just hold me they danced through the song not hearing it their feet moving by themselves an excuse for being close and the music worked he felt her let go an easy leaning into him a little bit more but she surprised him again pressing tighter to feel him there and putting her arms around his back her mouth to his ear lets go upstairs she whispered youre sure she didnt answer just led him slowly across the room so that their going seemed another part of the dance rhythmic and dreamy one leg after another up the stairs now it was he who was tentative not sure what to do following her watching her stop halfway up to take off the shoes a slow erotic gesture undressing for him bending gracefully to pick them up then the bare feet pale white as if they were the most intimate thing about her he followed the rest of the way watching her skirt brush against her legs and then they were in his room the music went away distant and he could hear himself breathing he stood waiting still at a loss while she let the shoes fall and turned to him and opened the top button of his shirt then the next movements as deliberate as steps she opened the shirt smoothing her hands across his chest making his skin tense at the surprise of it then went back to the buttons down almost to the last when she stopped and leaned her head against his bare skin resting there help me she said he put his hand to her neck moving the hair aside and stroking it gently until she tipped her head back to look up at him again nodding for him to go on he undid her belt hearing it drop to the floor then slowly began pulling the dress up gathering it until she raised her arms trancelike and it was over her head and off then somewhere on the floor and she was naked both hands now along her neck as he kissed the top of her head rubbing his face in her hair he moved his hands down her back resting at the bottom then walked her to the bed sitting her down on the pink spread he started to undo his belt buckle but she reached up and did it for him the shirt falling away then pulled the zipper and put her hands on his hips pushing pants and underwear down at the same time until he sprang free and she was looking at him she touched his penis moving her hand over it slowly making it familiar and he stood rigidly his eyes closed trying not to feel her finally he took her hand away and dropped to the bed moving next to her so that they were facing each other his hand on her hip as they kissed slowly a little bit at a time he began stroking her softly every piece of skin familiar the curve of her back the hollow just before her hip the underside of her breast brushing it with the back of his hand until it rose with her breathing trying to imagine her feeling it to do it for her everything familiar except the pleasure the feeling itself always new different every time like the sky too immediate to hold in memory you remembered skin the shape of a curve but the rest disappeared and you spent your whole life coming back to it again and again only to find it was never the same each time a surprise so private no one else could ever feel it he tried to hold himself back emptying his mind but she pressed up against him and there it was again insistent but not now a little at a time the grateful luxury of simply touching her all this time and he hadnt remembered anything just the outline just enough to want it again lena he said a whisper are you sure but she covered his mouth an open kiss willing them quiet and he wondered where she was not lost in the feeling with him but somewhere inside her head maybe in the past where they no longer needed to go he moved his hand down to her thigh trying to reach her the soft inside the most vulnerable place in the world gently light enough to coax her back when he ran his finger along her bush trying to open the lips he could feel she was still dry still closed away for all the kissing and rubbing against him not ready a little more he put his finger in his mouth wetting it then placed it over her clitoris just resting it until he heard her intake of breath a connection and began moving it lightly in a circle the merest graze moistening it circling wider and moving smoothly now getting slick with her own wet her pelvis moved against him as if she were trying to close her legs but instead they went slack opening to his finger oh she said an involuntary sigh as he slipped it farther down still rubbing lightly back and forth until it was wet enough then farther parting the lips slipping finally inside her feeling the heat as she closed around him he paused to let her catch her breath but she put her hand over his forcing him to keep moving it and his finger continued in a steady back and forth lingering near the top to circle the nub then down the lips spreading wider until she was open and wet everywhere riding his finger she turned to open her mouth to him again as wet as below reaching behind his head to lock him to her as her hips kept moving when she broke away gasping for air shaking a little it was to take hold of his penis with you she said drawing it to her the head jumping when it touched the slick open skin slowly he covered her resting above her on his arms and she guided him in he could feel the walls give way and forced himself to stop letting it slide in slowly a little at a time so that it felt she were doing it pulling him in deeper when their bodies met all the way in she put her arms around him holding his head down next to hers and they lay still for a moment listening to each other breathe then a slight movement so small it seemed impossible it could cause the feeling that went through him and he was determined now to make it last not give in to it because he wanted her with him slowly like a dancer practicing steps not going faster even when he heard her in his ear her breath almost a pant a long stroke in and out as slow as a tease then the short steady movements inside again one after another so far in they seemed joined and suddenly he felt her rippling around him not waiting anymore and there was a gasp in his ear so that he knew she was coming grabbing his back he held still for a moment to make sure her head turned away as her insides clutched him an unmistakable spasm she turned her head back to kiss him her breathing still ragged opening her eyes i see you and when they kissed he started moving again still slowly because now there was no urgency they were there and he felt they would never have to stop if he didnt go faster and theyd never have to let the feeling go more his face was in her hands now as she kissed him his body still suspended over her and he realized that she was moving faster hurrying him even wetter its all right she said its all right almost a sob but smiling freeing him to pleasure himself except that it was already everything he wanted the intimacy both of them there and he kept moving the same way not even aware anymore that his prick was filled with blood to bursting just keep moving no end he felt her hands on his buttocks clasping him pushing him in deeper because she was still moving too something he hadnt expected rocking and now he had to hold out because he heard little cries could feel her wrapped around him the feeling no longer individual spreading over them both so that when she came again a series of shudders it spurted out of him too and he saw that what he thought he wanted before wasnt everything after all this was everything even as it went away he wasnt aware of falling down next to her his arm still around her not even of his penis slipping out only of her shoulders shaking beside him dont cry he said touching her im not crying i dont know what it is nerves nerves its so long he ran his hand over her shoulder feeling the shaking begin to subside i love you you know that she nodded wiping her eyes i dont know why i do such terrible things how can you love a person who does terrible things babbling he continued stroking her shoulder it must be your jokes he said softly my jokes you say i never make jokes then i dont know why she smiled a little then sniffed is there a handkerchief in my pants he watched her get up languid walk over to the pile of clothes and take out his handkerchief and gently blow her nose her body still flushed with patches of red love marks she stood for a minute letting him look at her then held up the pants do you want a cigarette you always used to like a cigarette i left them downstairs never mind come here she curled up next to him her head on his chest you didnt notice the curtains were open no i didnt notice she said and even now made no move to cover up or try to draw the spread around her why did you when i saw you before she said easily so white like a boy a boy my lover she said putting her hand on his chest i thought i know him i know him hes my lover yes maybe i can feel that again she turned her head to look at him how i was with you the words went through him a flush of wellbeing so complete that all he ever wanted to do was lie there holding her and listening to the rain it used to frighten me she said how it made me feel i thought it was wrong to feel that way i wanted to have a normal life be a good woman i was raised for that no he said stroking her for this and now its all gone anyway that life it doesnt matter anymore she put her head back lying quietly looking across his chest at the room whats going to happen she said well go to america germans are so popular there i he war s over i dont think for us even here thec americans look at you what do they think we did never mind them somewhere else then where nobody knows who we are africa he said playing africa what would you do there this all day long if its hot well close the shutters we can do this anywhere thats the idea he said pulling her up and kissing her she hung over him her hair falling around his face somewhere new she said thats right he ran his hand over her buttocks no more terrible things her face clouded and she turned away facing the wall theres no place like that yes there is he kissed her shoulder youll forget i cant she said then turned back to face him i killed him do you know what that means i cant forget the blood it was everywhere in my hair ssh he said then put his hand up to stroke her head its not there anymore its gone but to kill somebody you had to no it was finished i couldnt stop him from that then i killed him anyway with his gun while he was still on me killed him and i didnt have to you think im the same person she lowered her head i wanted to be pretending to look like before but its not before no its now lena listen to me he raped you he might have killed you we all had to do terrible things in the war did you yes what things he took her face between his hands and looked straight at her i forget how can you forget because i found you again i forget the rest she looked away you mean you want me to you will were going to be happy isnt that what you want she smiled a little well start here he turned her face and began kissing it the cheek then the lips drawing a map of their place weve already started you forget everything when you make love thats why they invented it finally they drifted off not quite asleep but hazy like the vapor that hung outside after the rain they were still lying there holding each other when he heard a door close footsteps next door the world coming back we should get dressed she said no wait a little he said his arm around her i have to wash she said but she didnt move either content to lie there still drifting until they heard the quick knock on the door oh she said flipping the end of the spread up to cover them only halfway there when liz opened the door and stopped in surprise eyes wide with embarrassment oh sorry she said a gulp ducking away and closing the door behind her my god lena said swinging out of bed grabbing clothes and holding them up in a bunch you dont lock the door he looked at her from the bed grinning how can you laugh look at you covering yourself come here like a farce she said ignoring him what will she think what do you care its not nice she said then hearing herself began to smile too im a respectable woman you were she put her hand to her mouth to cover her smile a girlish gesture then tossed his pants over to the bed and started wriggling into her dress what will you say to her tell her to knock longer next time he said up now and putting on his pants it happens so often is that it no he said coming over and kissing her just this once get dressed she said but smiling she turned to the mirror oh look at me my hairs a mess is there a comb in the drawer he nodded at the frilly vanity he buttoned his shirt and started tying his shoes watching her at the mirror the same absorbed concentration she opened a drawer searching on the right he said you shouldnt leave your money around she said its not safe what money she held up tullys hundredmark note and no lock either anyone could he went over to the dressing table oh that its not money its evidence he said easily the word as far from his thoughts as tully or anything else what do you mean evidence but he wasnt listening now looking at the bill what had danny said a dash before the number he turned the bill over a dash russian money he stood for a second trying to think what it could mean then gave it up indifferent his mind still hazy not wanting anything to interrupt the day he put the note back in the drawer and leaned down to kiss her head the lavender was still there mixed now with the smell of them ill be down in two minutes she said eager to leave as if the billet were a hotel room theyd rented for the afternoon all right well go home he said pleased at the sound of it he picked up lizs shoes on the way out in the hall he waited until she answered his knock hey jackson she said still looking embarrassed sorry about that next time put a tie on the door your shoes he said handing them to her i borrowed them ill bet you looked swell hers were wet she looked up at him its against the house rules you know its not what you think no you could have fooled me what did you want anyway he said feeling too good to want to explain mostly to see if you were alive you still live here dont you ive been busy uhhuh and here i was worried men people have been asking for you by the way later he said unconcerned thanks again for the shoes she tipped one to her head in a salute anytime hey jackson she said stopping him as he turned to go dont let it throw you it s only its not what you think he said again she smiled then stop grinning ami ear to ear was he he went down the stairs wondering if his face were really a flushed sign giving them away slaphappy all the intimacy reduced to a popular song lyric but who cared he turned off the phonograph and finally had a cigarette pacing now instead of lying in bed the usual ritual turned around like everything else how long since shed come down the stairs dressed like that wanting to outside the wet leaves were gleaming in the new light shiny as coins russian money tullyd had russian money his mind still vague was toying with it when he heard stamping at the door bernie wiping his feet on the mat and shaking out an umbrella a careful boy who practiced piano where the hell have you been he said hurrying in ive been looking for you for days a faint accusation working jake said the only legitimate excuse was he grinning ive got other things to do you know playing errand boy and you take a powder bernie said his voice as raspy as an alarm clock you heard from frankfurt jake said waking to it plenty we need to talk you didnt tell me there was a connection he put the files hed been carrying on the piano as if he were about to roll up his sleeves and start to work can it wait jake said still elsewhere bernie stared at him surprised okay jake said giving in what did they say but bernie was still staring this time beyond him to lena coming down the stairs her hair pinned back up proper again but the dress swaying with her another entrance she stopped at the door lena jake said i want you to meet someone he turned to bernie i found her bernie this is lena brandt bernie kept staring then nodded awkwardly as embarrassed as liz we got caught in the rain jake said smiling lena mumbled a polite hello we should go she said to jake in a minute bernies been helping me with a story he turned so what did they say it can wait bernie said still looking at lena flustered as if he hadnt seen a woman in weeks no its all right what connection curious now well talk later bernie said looking away i wont be here later then taking in his embarrassment its all right lenaswith me come on give any luck bernie nodded reluctantly some he said but he was looking at lena weve located your husband for a minute she stood still then slumped to the piano bench holding on to the edge hes not dead she said finally no i thought he was dead her voice a monotone where is he kransberg at least he was its a prison she said her voice still flat a castle near frankfurt not a prison exactly more like a guesthouse for people we want to talk to dustbin i dont understand she said confused thats what they call it theres another near parisashcan dustbins where theyve stashed the scientists you know he was part of the rocket team she shook her head he never talked to me about his work really she looked at him never i dont know anything then youll be interested bernie said his voice hard i was he did the numbers trajectories fuel capacity everything but the casualties in london you blame him for that there were casualties in berlin too jake had stood following them as if he were at a tennis match and now looked at her surprised at the strength of her return a kindergarten covered with concrete slabs not from flying bombs bernie said we didnt have the benefit of his expertise and now you will she said unexpectedly bitter in prison she got up and went over to the window can i see him bernie nodded if we find him the phrase shook jake awake what do you mean bernie turned to him hes missing about two weeks now just up and left its got them all foaming apparently hes a particular favorite of von brauns he said glancing toward lena cant do without him i made a routine query and half of frankfurt jumped down my throat they seem to think he was coming to see you he said to lena von braun anyway says he tried it before there they were safe and sound down in garmisch waiting for the end and he makes a beeline for berlin to get his wife out before the russians got here is that right he didnt get me out lena said quietly but he was here yes he came for meand his father but it was too late the russians she glanced over to jake he didnt get through i thought they killed him those last daysit was crazy to take that risk maybe it was worth it to him bernie said anyway thats what they think now in fact theyre looking for you forme in case theyre right they want him back do they want to arrest me too no i think the idea is that youre the bait hell come looking for you why else would he want out everyone else is trying to get in kransbergs for special guests we like to keep the big nazis comfortable hes not a nazi lena said dully well thats a matter of opinion dont worry i cant touch him the technical boys put kransberg offlimits scientists are too valuable to be nazis whatever they did he should have stayed where he was nice and cozy a little pingpong in the evenings i hear makes you wonder doesnt it bernie jake began yeah i know leave it alone you cant fight city hall every time we start getting somewhere on one of them the tech units yank the file special case now i hear they want to take them to the states the whole fucking team theyre arguing over salaries salaries no wonder they wanted to surrender to us he nodded to lena lets hope he finds you soonyou dont want to miss the boat he paused or maybe you do he said glancing at jake youre out of line jake said sorry dont mind me bernie said to lena it comes with the job were a little shorthanded he looked at jake again now the tech units thats something else nothing but manpower there he turned back to lena if he turns up give one of them a call theyll be glad to hear from you and if he doesnt jake said you said two weeks then start looking i think youll want to find him jake looked at him puzzled what exactly is he accused of strictly speaking nothing just leaving kransberg a little rude for an honored guest but it makes the rest of them jumpy they like to stick togetherimproves their bargaining position i guess and of course the tech boys have had to beef up security which takes away from the country club feel of the thing so theyd like him back he just walked out no thats the part that will interest you he had a pass all official why would that interest me bernie walked over to the piano and flipped open a file folder take a look at the signature he said handing jake a carbon sheet lieutenant patrick tully jake said reading aloud his voice falling he raised his eyes to find bernie watching him i was wondering if you knew bernie said i guess not not with that face interested now what is it lena said a soldier who was killed last week jake said still looking at the paper and you blame emil for that she said to bernie anxious he shrugged all i know is two men went missing from kransberg and one of thems dead jake shook his head youre offbase i know him that must keep things friendly bernie said jake looked up at him then passed over it why would tully sign him out well thats the question isnt it what occurred to me was its a valuable piece of paper the only problem with that is the guests dont have any moneyat least theyre not supposed to who needs cash when youve got room service courtesy of the us government jake shook his head again it wasnt emils money he said thinking of the dash before the serial number but bernie had leaped elsewhere then somebody elses but there must have been some deal tully wasnt the humanitarian type he picked up another folder here bedtime reading hes been in one racket or another since he hit the beach of course you wouldnt know it from thisjust a series of transfers the usual mg solutionmake him somebody elses problem then why send him to a place like kransberg bernie nodded i asked the idea was to get him away from civilians he was mg in a town in hesse and things got so bad even the germans complained hauptmann toll they called himcrazy hed prance around in those boots carrying a whip they thought the ss was back so mg had to get him out of there next a detention camp in bensheim no market there maybe a few cigarettes but what the hell what i hear though is that he was selling discharge papers dont bother to lookrecord just says relieved that was sweet the way they nailed him is he ran out of customers so he started having them arrested once they were outfigured theyd pay again one of them screams bloody murder and the next thing you know hes off to kransberg they probably thought what harm could he do there no one wants to check out except emil jake said evidently but what did they say when emil didnt come back people just come and go the guards figured it must be okay if he had papers and tully drove him see the idea is its not a prisononce in a while the scientists go into town with an escort so nobody thought anything of it then when he didnt come back tully says hes as surprised as anybody wasnt he supposed to stay with him what can you do tully had a weekend passhe didnt want to play nursemaid he says he trusted him it was personala family matter he didnt want to be in the way bernie said glancing again at lena and nobody says anything oh plenty but you cant courtmartial a man for being stupid not when he thinks hes doing one of the guests a favor best you can do is transfer him out id lay you even money it was just a matter of time before those papers were in the works again but then he went to potsdam which is where you came in jake had flipped open the folder and was staring at the photograph stapled to the top sheet young not bloated from a night of drifting in the jungfernsee he tried to picture tully striding through a hessian village with a riding crop but the face was bland and open the kind of kid you found on a soda fountain stool in natick mass but the war had changed everybody i still dont get it he said finally if it was that loose why pay to get out from the sound of it he could have jumped out a window and run couldnt he theoretically look nobodys trying to escape from kransberg it doesnt occur to them theyre scientists not pows theyre trying to get a ticket to the promised land not run away maybe he wanted the passyou know what theyre like about documents so officially he wouldnt be awol its a hell of a lot to pay for a pass anyway where did the money come from i dont know ask him isnt that what you wanted to know in the first place jake looked up from the picture no i wanted to know why tully was killed from the sound of it there could have been a hundred reasons maybe bernie said slowly and maybe just one just because a man signed a piece of paper bernie spread his hands again maybe a coincidence maybe a connection a man gets out of kransberg and heads for berlin a week later the man who gets him out comes to berlin and ends up killed i dont believe in coincidence it has to connect somewhere you add two and two i know this man he didnt kill anybody no well id sure like to hear it from him ask him about the ss medal while youre at it since you know him so well he went over to the piano anyway hes your lead you wont even have to go looking hes coming to you he hasnt turned up yet does he know where you are bernie said to lena she had slumped onto the bench again staring at the floor his father maybe his father knows then sit tight hell show up or maybe youd rather he didnt he said to jake a little inconvenient all things considered whats gotten into you jake said surprised at his tone i dont like putting nazis in hotels thats all he didnt do it jake said maybe maybe you dont want to do the math anymore add it up two and two he gathered the other folders off the piano im late frau brandt he said a courtesy nod that became a parting shot he turned to jake it connects he was halfway across the room before jake stopped him bernie try this one two and two tully comes to berlin but the only one we know he was coming to see was you bernie stood quietly for a moment meaning numbers lie when bernie left the room seemed as still and airless as a vacuum tube the only movement the ticking of the hall clock dont mind him jake said finally he just talks tough he likes to be mad lena said nothing then got up and went over to the window folding her arms over her chest and staring out so now were all nazis thats just bernie everybodys a nazi to him and its better in america your german girlfriend was she a nazi too thats how he looks at me and hes your friend frau brandt she said imitating bernie thats just him no i am frau brandt i forgot for a little while she turned to him now its really like before there are three of us no two she smiled weakly yes it was nice we should go now the rains finished you dont love him he said a question love she said dismissing it she turned to the piano ive scarcely seen him he was away and after peter everything changed it was easier not to see each other she looked back but i wont send him to prison either you cant ask me to do that im not yes im the baitisnt that what he said i saw your facelike a policeman all those questions hes not going to prison he didnt kill anybody how do you know i did that was different maybe it was different for him too he looked at her lena what is it you know he didnt and you think that matters to them a german they blame us for everything she stopped and looked away i wont send him to prison he went over to her turning her face with his finger do you really think id ask you to do that she looked at him then moved away oh i dont know anything anymore why cant we leave things as they are this is the way they are he said quietly now stop worrying everythings going to be all right but we have to find him before the others do you see that she nodded would he really go to his father you said they didnt speak but theres no one else he came for him you know even after everything so where were you pariserstrasse she shook her head it was bombed already the hospital he said to wait for him there but then he didnt get through so he wouldnt know where else to look hed try his father yes i think so anyone else frau dzuris hadnt seen him fraudzuris i tried her first remember youre not so easy to find he paused wait a minute she said thered been a soldier maybe thats why tully cameto find you me well emil to get him back that would explain why he wanted to see bernie tooto check the fragebogens thats bernies department maybe he thought hed find yours there except you didnt fill one out why didnt you by the way she shrugged a party members wife they would have made me work on the rubble i couldnt i was too weak and for what a class v card i had that much from hannelore but tully wouldnt have known i didnt so hed want to check if he was looking for me it makes sense finding emil would get him out of a lot of hot water but if hed already paid jake shook his head bernies wrong he didnt get money from emil russian marks arent floating around frankfurt he got it in berlin then why did he let him out thats what i want to ask emil now youre a policeman again a reporter bernies right about one thing emils the only lead ive got there must be a connectionjust not the one he thinks he wants to make trouble for emil you can see that its so important this soldier who was he nobody just a story at least he was now hes something else if you really want to keep emil out of trouble wed better find out who did kill him lena took this in brooding then went over to the phonograph and fingered one of the records as if she were waiting for the music to start again a little while ago we were going to africa he came up behind her touching her shoulder nothings changed no except now youre a policeman and im bait contents previous chapter next chapter chapter nine the next day was hot again berlin was literally steaming the rain that had washed the dust from the air now rising in wisps over the wet ruins making the smell worse emils father lived in charlottenburg a few streets away from the schloss in what was left of an art nouveau block of flats divided into rooms for bombedout families the street hadnt been cleared so theyd had to leave the jeep on schloss strasse and thread their way through the rubble on a footpath dotted with housenumber sticks planted in the debris like trail markers they were sweating when they arrived but professor brandt was dressed in a suit and a high starched collar from the weimar era stiff even in the wilting heat his height took jake by surprise emil had been jakes size but professor brandt towered over him so tall that when he kissed lena on the cheek he bent at the waist an old officers bow lena its good of you to come he said more polite than warm as if he were receiving a former student he looked at jake taking in the uniform and his eye twitched hes dead he said flatly no no a friend of emils lena said and introduced them professor brandt offered a dry hand from happier days i think yes before the war jake said you are welcome then i thought perhapsan official visit a flicker of relief even his composed face couldnt hide im sorry i have nothing to offer guests its difficult now he said indicating the cramped room whose light came in shafts through a boardedup broken window perhaps you would care to walk in the park its more pleasant in this weather we cant stay long well a little walk then he said clearly embarrassed by the room and eager to go out he turned to lena but first i must tell you im so sorry dr kunstler was here you know i asked him to inquire in hamburg your parents im sorry he said his words as formal as a eulogy oh she said the sound catching in her throat like a whimper both yes both oh she said again she sank to a chair covering her eyes with a hand jake expected professor brandt to reach out to her but instead he moved away leaving her isolated alone with her news jake looked at her awkwardly stuck helpless in his role a friend of the family unable to do more than be silent some water professor brandt said she shook her head both its certain the recordsthere was so much confusion you can imagine but they were identified so now theres no one she said to herself in a small voice jake thought of breimer looking out of the plane window at the wrecked landscape what they deserved seeing buildings are you all right jake said she nodded then stood up smoothing out her skirt visibly putting herself in order i knew it must be its justto hear it she turned to professor brandt perhaps a walk would be better some air he picked up a hat clearly relieved and led them down the hall away from the front entrance lena drifted behind ignoring jakes arm well go out the back theyre watching the building he said who jake said surprised young willi they pay him i think hes always in the street or one of his friends with cigarettes where do they get them he was always a sneak that one who pays him professor brandt shrugged thieves perhaps of course they may not be watching me someone else in the building waiting for their chance but i prefer they dont know where i am are you sure jake said looking at the white hair an old mans imagination protecting a boardedup room herr geismar every german is an expert at that weve been watched for twelve years i would know in my sleep here we are he opened the back door to the blinding light no one you see i take it emil hasnt been here jake said still thinking is that why youve come im sorry i dont know where he is dead perhaps no hes alive hes been in frankfurt professor brandt stopped alive with the americans yes thank god for that i thought the russians he started walking again so he got out he said the spandau bridge was still open i thought he must be crazy the russians were he left frankfurt two weeks ago jake said interrupting him for berlin i was hoping hed come to you no he wouldnt come to me to find lena i mean jake said awkward no only the russian a russian was looking for him for lena he said hesitant as if i would help him swine me lena said listening after all professor brandt nodded avoiding her eyes what for jake said i didnt ask questions professor brandt said his voice almost prim but he didnt want emil jake said thinking aloud why would he i thought he give you a name they dont give names not them you didnt ask a russian making inquiries in the british sector professor brandt stopped upset as if hed been caught in an impropriety i didnt want to know you understandi thought it was personal he looked at lena im sorry dont be offended i thought he was perhaps a friend of yours so many german women one hears it all the time you thought that she said angry its not for me to judge these things he said his voice correct and distant she looked at him her eyes suddenly hard no but you do you judge everything now me you thought that a russian whore she looked away oh why am i surprised you always think the worst look how you judge emilyour own blood my own blood a nazi lena waved her hand nothing changes nothing she said and strode ahead visibly walking off her anger they crossed the street quietly jake feeling like an intruder in a family quarrel shes not herself professor brandt said finally its the bad news i think he turned to jake is there some trouble this russianits to do with emil i dont know but let me know if he comes back professor brandt looked at jake closely may i ask what exactly you do in the army im not in the army im a reporter they make us wear the uniform for your work thats what emil said too youre looking for himas a friend nothing else as a friend hes not under arrest no i thought perhapsthese trials theyre not going to put him on trial no why should they as far as i know he hasnt done anything professor brandt looked at him curiously then sighed no just this he said gesturing toward the gutted schloss thats what theyve done him and his friends they were approaching the palace from the west the ground still covered with pieces of glass from the smashed orangerie berlins versailles the building had taken a direct hit the east wing demolished the rest of the standing pale yellow walls scorched with black lena was walking ahead into the formal gardens now unrecognizable a bare field of mud littered with shrapnel it was always going to end this way professor brandt said anyone could see that why couldnt he see that they destroyed germany the books then everything it wasnt theirs to destroy it was mine too wheres my germany now look at it gone murderers emil wasnt that he worked for them he said voice rising as if they were in court the case hed been arguing for years be careful when you put on a uniform its what you become always the work you know what he said to me i cant wait for history to change things i have to do my work now after the war we can do wonderful things space we who mankind after the war he says this while the bombs are falling while theyre putting people on trains no connection what are you going to do in space i said look down on the dead he cleared his throat calming himself you agree with lena you think im harsh i dont know jake said uncomfortable professor brandt stopped looking at the schloss he broke my heart he said so simply that jake winced as if a bandage had been lifted off the old mans skin exposing it she thinks i judge him i dont even know him he said his words seeming to droop with him but when jake looked up he stood as stiffly as before his neck still held up by the high collar he started into the park well now the americans will do it we didnt come here to judge anybody no then who else do you think we can judge ourselves our own children maybe nobody can then they will get away with it the wars over professor brandt nobody got away with anything jake said looking at the charred remains of the building not the war no not war you know what happened here i knew everybody knew grunewald station you know they liked to send them from there not in the center where people would see did they think we wouldnt see there thousands of them in the cars the children did we think they were going on holiday i saw it myself my god i thought how we will pay for this how we will pay how could it happen here in my country a crime like this how could they do it not the hitlers the goebbelsesthose types you can see any day in a zoo an asylum but emil a boy who played with trains blocks always building ive asked myself a million times over and over how could this boy be a part of that and what answer did you get jake said quietly none no answer he stopped to remove his hat then took out a handkerchief and patted his forehead no answer he said again you know his mother died when he was born so there were just the two of us just two i was too strict maybe sometimes i think it was that but he was no troublequiet a wonderful mind you could see it working when he playedone block after another just so sometimes i would sit there just watching his mind jake glanced over at him trying to imagine him without the collar stretched out on a childs floor in a jumble of building blocks and later of course at the institute a wonder everyone predicted great things everyone instead this he spread his hand taking in the past along with the tornup garden how how could such a mind not see how can you see only the blocks nothing else a missing piece like all the rest of them some missing piece maybe they never had it but emil a good german boyso what happened to be with them he came back for you at the end yes do you know how with ss do you expect me to get in that car i said with them the ss came for you for me no files even then with the russians here they came to get files outimagine it to save themselves did they think we didnt know what they did how can you hide something like that foolishness then here its the only way emil said they have a car theyll take you he switched voices tell the old shit to hurry or well shoot him too they said drunk i think but they did that shot people even in those last days when everything was lost good i said shoot the old shit that will be one bullet less dont talk like that emil says are you crazy youre the crazy one i said the russians will hang you if youre with these swine no spandaus open we can get to the west id rather be with the russians than with scum i said arguing even then the ss voice again leave him we dont have time for this and of course it was trueyou could hear the artillery fire everywhere so they left thats the last i saw him getting into a car with ss my son his voice grew faint and stopped as if he were rewinding a spool of film in his head the scene played out again trying to save you jake said but professor brandt ignored him retreating back to conversation how is it you know him lena worked with me at columbia the radio yes i remember a long time ago he glanced toward lena waiting for them near the edge of the garden where the sluggish water of the spree made its bend she doesnt look well shes been sick shes better now professor brandt nodded so thats why she hasnt come she used to after the raids to see if i was all right the faithful lena i dont think she told him she turned as they approached look at the ducks she said still here who feeds them do you think a kind of apology for her outburst simply by not mentioning it so have you finished finished professor brandt said then peered at jake what is it you want jake took the photograph of tully out of his breast pocket has this man been here have you seen him an american professor brandt said looking at it no why hes looking for emil too he may have been he knew emil in frankfurt hes police professor brandt said so quickly that jake looked up in surprise what was it like to be watched for twelve years he was hes dead professor brandt stared at him and thats why you want to see emil as a friend thats right as a friend he looked at lena its true hes not trying to arrest him do you think i would help with that she said no jake said answering for her but im worried two weeks is a long time to be missing in germany these days this is the last man who saw him and hes dead what are you saying you think emil no i dont think i dont want to see him end up the same way either he paused taking in professor brandts startled expression he may know something thats all we need to find him he hasnt been to lenas the only other place hed go is to you no not to me he did before yes and what did i say to him that day with the ss he said running the film again dont come back he looked away he wont come here not now well if he does you know where lena is jake said putting the picture back i sent him away professor brandt said still in his own thoughts what else could i do ss i was right to do that yes you were right youre always right lena said wearily turning away nowlook lena oh no more im tired of arguing always politics not politics he said shaking his head not politics you think it was politics what they did she held his eyes for a moment then turned to jake lets go youll come again professor brandt said his voice suddenly tentative and old she went over and put her hand near his shoulder then brushed the front of his suit as if she were about to adjust his tie a gesture of unexpected gentleness he stood straight letting her smooth out the material a substitute for an embrace ill press it for you next time she said do you need anything food jake can get food some coffee perhaps he said hesitant reluctant to ask lena gave his suit a final pat and moved away not waiting for them to follow ill walk a little now professor brandt said then glanced toward lenas back shes like a daughter to me jake simply nodded not knowing what to say professor brandt drew himself up shoulders back and put on his hat herr geismar if you find emil he stopped choosing his words carefully be a friend to him with the americans there is some trouble i think so help him youre surprised i ask that this old german so strict but a childits always there in your heart even when they becomewhat they become even then jake looked at him standing tall and alone in the muddy field emil didnt put people on trains theres a difference professor brandt lifted his head toward the scorched building then turned back to jake lowering the brim of his hat you be the judge of that when they got back to the jeep jake took a minute to look into professor brandts street but no one was there not even young willi keeping watch for cigarettes nothing had changed at frau dzuristhe same dripping hallway the same boiling potatoes the same holloweyed children watching furtively from the bedroom lena my god its you so you found her children look whos here its lena come but it was jake who drew their attention pulling out chocolate bars which they snatched up tearing off the shiny hershey wrappers before frau dzuris could stop them such manners children what do you say a mumbled thanks between bites come sit oh eva will be sorry to miss you shes at church again every day church what are you praying for i say manna tell god to send potatoes shes well then and your son still in the east she said dropping her voice i dont know where maybe she prays for him but theres no god there not in russia jake had expected to stay two minutes a simple question but now sat back at the table giving way to the inevitable visit it was a berlin conversation comparing survivor lists greta from downstairs the block leader who chose the wrong shelter frau dzuris son safe from the army then trapped at the siemens plant and hauled off by the russians and emil frau dzuris said with a sidelong glance at jake i dont know my parents are dead lena said changing the subject a raid yes i just heard so many so many frau dzuris said shaking her head then brightened but to see you together againits lucky yes for me lena said with a weak smile looking at jake he saved my life he got me medicine you see the americansi always said they were good but its a special case with lena eh she said to jake almost waggish yes special you know he may not come back she said to lena you cant blame the women the men made the war and then its the women who wait but for how long evas waiting well hes my son but i dont know how many come back from russia and we have to eat how will she feed the children without a man lena looked over at them still eating the chocolate her face softening theyve grown i wouldnt recognize them she seemed for a moment someone else back in a part of her life jake had never known that had happened without him yes and whats to become of them living like this potatoes only its worse than during the war and now well have the russians jake took this as an opening frau dzuris the soldier who was looking for lena and emilhe was a russian no an ami this man he handed her the picture no no i told you before tall blond like a german a german name even he gave you his name no here she said putting her finger above her breast where a nameplate would have been what name i dont remember but german i thought its true what they say no wonder the amis wonall german officers look at eisenhower she said floating it as a light joke jake took the picture back disappointed the lead suddenly gone so he wasnt looking for emil lena said to the picture sounding relieved somethings wrong frau dzuris said no jake said i just thought it might be this man the american who was heredid he say why he came to you like youthe notice in pariserstrasse i thought he must be a friend of yours she said to lena from before when you worked for the americans oh not like you she said smiling at jake she turned to lena you know i always knew a woman can tell and now to find each other again can i say something to you dont wait not like eva so many dont come back you have to live and this one to jakes embarrassment she patted his hand to remember the chocolate it took them another five minutes to get out of the flat frau dzuris talking lena lingering with the children promising to come again frau dzuris jake said to her at the door if anyone should come dont worry she said conspiratorial misunderstanding i wont give you away she nodded toward lena starting down the stairs you take her to america theres nothing here now in the street he stopped and looked back at the building still puzzled now whats the matter lena said you see it wasnt him its good yes no connection but it should have been it makes sense now im back where i started anyway who did come your friend said the americans would look for emil someone from kransberg maybe but not tully he said stubbornly still preoccupied you think everyones looking for emil she said getting into the jeep to leave he started around to his side then stopped looking at the ground except the russian he was looking for you she glanced over at him what do you mean nothing trying to add two and two he got in the jeep but i need emil to do that where the hell is he anyway you were never so anxious to see him before jake turned the key nobody was murdered before emil didnt come the next few days fell into a kind of listless waiting looking out the window listening for footsteps on the quiet landing when they made love now it seemed hurried as if they expected someone to come through the door at any minute their time run out hannelore was back her russian having moved on and her presence chattering oblivious to the waiting made the tension worse so that jake felt he was pacing even when he was sitting still watching her lay out cards on the table hour after hour until her future came out right you see there he is again the spades mean strength thats what frau hinkel says lena you have to see heryou wont believe it how she sees things i thought you know well its just fun but she knows she knew about my motherhow could she know that i never said a word and not some gypsy eithera german woman right behind kadewe imagine all this time its a gift to be like that heres the jack againyou see two men just as she said only two lena said smiling two marriages i said one is enough but no she says it always comes up two whats the good of knowing that all during the first youll be wondering about the second hannelore sighed i suppose still you should go you go lena said i dont want to know it was true while jake waited and worked the crossword puzzle in his headtully down emil across trying to fit them togetherlena seemed oddly content as if she had decided to let things take care of themselves the news of her parents had depressed her and then seemed to be put aside a kind of fatalism jake assumed had come with the war when it was enough to wake up alive in the mornings she went to a dp nursery to help with the children afternoons when hannelore was out they made love evenings she turned the canned rations into meals busy with ordinary life not looking beyond the day it was jake who waited at loose ends they went out there was music in a roofless church a humid evening with tired german civilians nodding their heads to a scratchy beethoven trio and jake taking notes for a piece because colliers would like the idea of music rising from the ruins the city coming back he took her to ronnys to check in with danny but when they got there drunken shouts pouring out to the street she balked and he went in alone but neither danny nor gunther was there so they walked a little farther down the kudamm to a cinema the british had opened the theater hot and crowded was showing blithe spirit and to his surprise the audience all soldiers enjoyed it roaring at madame arcati whistling at kay hammonds floating nightgown dressing for dinner coffee and brandy in the sitting room afterwardit all seemed to be happening on another planet it was only when the lush color changed to the grainy blackandwhite of the newsreel that they were back in berlinliterally so attlee arriving to take churchills place another photo session at the cecilienhof the new three arranged on the terrace just as the old three had been that first time before the money started blowing across the lawn then the allied football game with breimer at the microphone winning the peace and fists raised in the end zone as the british made their unlikely score jake smiled to himself in the jumble of spliced film at least they had won the game the clip switched to a collapsing house another kind of touchdown as an american newsman makes a daring rescue my god its you lena said gripping his arm he watched himself on the porch arm around the german woman as if they had just emerged from the wreck and for an instant even he forgot what had really happened the films chronology more convincing than memory you never told me she said it didnt happen that way he whispered no but you can see and what could he say that he only appeared to be where he was the film had made it real he shifted in his seat disturbed what if nothing was what it seemed a ball game a newsreel hero how we looked at things determined what they were a dead body in potsdam a wad of money one thing led to another piece by piece but what if you got the arrangement wrong what if the house collapsed afterward when the lights came on she took his silence for modesty and you never said so now youre famous she said smiling he moved them into the swarm of british khaki in the aisle how did you get her out lena said we walked lena it never happened but from her expression he could see that it had and he gave it up they moved into the lobby with a crowd of british officers and their hannelores well the man of the hour himself brian stanley tugging at his sleeve a hero no less i am surprised jake grinned me too he said and introduced lena fraulein brian said taking her hand and what do we think of him now very boys own i must say come for a drink another time jake said oh its like that enjoy the film apart from yourself that is they passed through the door to the warm evening air sure make you homesick jake said dear boy thats the england that never was were the land of the common man now havent you heard mr attlee insists of course im common myself so i dont mind it still looks pretty cushy on film jake said well it would made before the war you know couldnt release it while the play was on and of course it ran forever so theyre just now getting around to it you see how young rex looks the things you know jake said another trick of chronology brian lit a cigarette how are you getting on with your case the chap in the boots im not ive been distracted brian glanced at lena not by the conference i gather i never see you around at all the thing is you got me thinking a bit about the luggage and all that what occurred to me was how did he get on the plane in the first place what do you mean well it was a scramble you remember had to pull strings just to get on the damn thing so what strings did he pull jake said finishing for him something like that there we were packed in like sardines the honorable and everyone and then one more all very lastminute no bags as if he hadnt expected to go more like hed been summoned if you see what i mean but jake had leaped ahead to something elsehow had emil managed it no one just walked onto a plane certainly not a german i dont suppose they found any travel orders brian was saying not that i know of of course it may have been the old greased palmive done it myself but if someone okayed it i mean if youre so curious about him it might be useful to know yes jake said who had okayed emil you never know with the armythey keep a record of everything except whats useful but there must have been some kind of manifest anyway its just a thought keep thinking for a minute jake said how would a german get here how does anybody military transporthed have to hitch a ride there isnt any civilian transport i supposed he could bicycle in if he didnt mind the russians running him off the road they do it for fun i hear yes lena said brian looked at her surprised that shed been following the conversation anyone particular in mind he said to jake just a friend of mine jake said quickly before lena could interrupt hes been due for over a week well theres nothing to that do you have any idea what its like out there he swept his hand in a broad gesture to the dark space beyond the city chaos absolute bloody chaos seen the autobahns refugees going this way and that poles going home and good luck to them sleep anywhere you can hes probably in a hayloft somewhere rubbing his feet a hayloft well a bit of color i shouldnt worry hell turn up but if he flew jake said still thinking a german need to pull some big strings for that anyway hed be here wouldnt he jake sighed yes hed be here he looked at the thinning crowd as if emil might suddenly appear strolling down the kudamm well ive got a drink waiting fraulein he nodded at lena mind you stay out of falling houses he said winking at jake once lucky lovely how we won the game wasnt it lovely jake said smiling theres a thing by the way whats he up to the honorable why would he be up to anything hes still here now your average poobah theyre in and out not that i blame them but theres the honorable lingering lingering makes you wonder doesnt it jake looked at him does it me no made tommy ottinger wonder though says hes really just a point man for american dye and and tommys going home i hate to see a story go to waste you might want to look into itif youve got the time that is another quick glance at lena tommys giving away stories now well you know tommy a few drinks and hell tell you anything strictly an american affair of course so no good to me anyway theres a tip i have to say i rather like the idea of catching the honorable with his hand in the till his hand in what till well tommy thought he might be up to some private reparations just a little something for american dye which to their way of thinking is pretty good for the country too so its patriotic looting really they talk their heads off at potsdam about reparations and meanwhile theyre stripping the place clean i thought it was the russians doing the stripping and not your cleancut american boys football players one and all if you believe the films no this is the game the russians dont know what to takejust pack up the power plants and anything shiny and hope for the best but the alliesoh were doing it too god bless usnow thats something different experts weve got tech units all over the country just hauling off the good bits blueprints formulas research papers picking their brains you might say you were at nordhausen they got all the documents therefourteen tons of paper if you can believe it and of course you cant because nobody can get the storyyou get near it and poof off it goes classified ghosts theres a thoughtmaybe we should give madame arcati a go she might get somewhere he stopped his expression serious thats what id look into jake this is a real story and no ones got itjust a whiff once in a while the russians get fussed and bark at usyou kidnapped the engineers at zeiss then of course they turn around and do the same thing and on it goes until theres nothing left to steal i guess reparations thats the story id go after why dont you i dont have the legs for it not anymore needs someone young who doesnt mind a bit of trouble why breimer jake said what makes you think hes doing anything but making dumb speeches well the man at the stadium for one thing remember him thick as thieves hes with one of the tech units how do you know i asked brian said raising an eyebrow jake looked at him steadily then grinned you dont miss a thing do you not much he said returning the smile well im off youve got a tired young lady wanting to go home and here i am blathering on fraulein he nodded to lena again then turned to jake think about it will you be nice to see you back at work again jake put his arm around lena and headed them toward olivaerplatz away from the streetwalkers and cruising jeeps there was moonlight so that you could see the broken tops of buildings against the sky spiky like jagged pieces of gothic script is it true what he says about the scientists they want to pick emils brain too that depends on what he knows he said evasive then nodded yes now them everybody wants to find emil he must have flown jake said still thinking nobody walks from frankfurt so either he hasnt got here yet or hes hiding somewhere why would he hide a mans dead if they did meet still the policeman or he got a ride he did before when he came for me you mean with the ss some ride he wasnt ss he came with them his father told me oh hell say anything so bitter to think the only family i have now a man like that to send away a child hes not a child anymore but ss emil why would he lie lena he said gently turning to her it must be right she took this in then turned away literally not facing it right hes always right you like him though i could see well i feel sorry theres nothing for him now not even his work he resigned when they fired the jews thats when the fighting started with emil so he was right but now look what did he teach mathematics like emil they said at the institute he was their bachpassing the gift you know just alike the two professor brandts then one maybe emil should have resigned too she walked for a minute not answering its easy to say now but thenwho knew it would end sometimes it seemed the nazis would be here forever it was the world we lived in can you understand that i was here too but not a german there was always something else for you but emil i dont knowi cant answer for him so maybe his fathers right but your friend he wants to make him a criminal he was never that not ss they gave him a medal its in his file i saw it services to the state you didnt know she shook her head he never told you but didnt you talk you were married how could you not talk she stopped looking across olivaerplatz empty and moonlit so you want to talk about emil yes why not hes here like in the film the ghost who comes back always in the room no he never told me maybe he thought it was better services to the state my god for numbers she looked up i didnt know what can i say to you how can you live with someone and not know him you think its hard its easy at first you talk and then she trailed off back in her head again i dont know why the work i think we didnt talk about thathow could we i didnt understand it but he lived for that and then after the war started everything was secret secret he wasnt allowed so you talk about daily things little things and then after a while not even that you dont have the habit anymore theres nothing left to talk about there was a child she looked at him uncomfortable yes there was a child we talked about him maybe thats why i didnt notice he was away so much i had peter thats how things were with us then after petereven the talking stopped what was there to say then she turned away i dont blame him how can i he was a good father a good husband and me was i a good wife i tried that once and all the time we were she faced him again it wasnt him me i stopped why did you marry him she shrugged making a wry smile i wanted to be married to have my own house in those days you know it wasnt so easy if you were a nice girl you lived at home when i came to berlin i had to live with frau willentzshe knew my parentsand it was worse she was always waiting at the door when i came in you know at that age she paused it seems so silly now i wanted my own dishes dishes and you know i was fond of emil he was nice came from a good family his father was a professoreven my parents couldnt object to that everybody wanted it so i got my dishes they had flowerspoppies then one raid and they were gone just like she looked at the crumbled buildings then picked up the thread again now i wonder why i wanted them all that life i dont knowwho knows why we do what we do why did i go with you because i asked yes you asked she said still looking at the buildings i knew even that first time at the press club that party i remember thinking nobody ever looked at me this way as if you knew a secret about me what secret that i would say yes that i was like that not a good wife dont jake said so i couldnt be faithful to him she said as if she hadnt heard but i dont want to hurt him isnt it enough to leave him now we have to be policemen too waiting here like spiders to trap him nobodys trying to trap him according to bernie they want to offer him a job picking his brain and then what oh lets go now leave berlin lena i cant get you out of germany you know that youd have to be your wife she finished a resigned nod and im not not yet he said touching her itll be different this time he smiled at her well get new dishes stores in new york are full of them no you only want that once now its something else what she turned her head not answering then leaned against him lets just love each other its enough now she said just that she started walking again pulling his hand lightly with hers look where we are they had turned without noticing into the end of pariserstrasse the heaps of rubble like pockets of shadow along the moonlit street the washbasin was still perched on the mound of bricks where lenas building had been its porcelain dull in the faint light but frau dzuris notice had fallen over the ink now streaked by rain we should put up a new one he said in case why he knows im not here he knew it was bombed jake looked at her but the american who went to frau dzuris didnt know that he came here first so so he hasnt talked to emil where did you go after a friend from the hospital her flat sometimes we just stayed at work the cellars were safe there what happened to her she died in the fire there must be someone think where would he go she shook her head his father he would go there like always jake sighed then hes not in berlin he went over and righted the notice stick wedging it in the bricks well we should do it for her so her friends can find her friends lena said almost snorting all the other nazis frau dzuris of course during the war she always had the pin you know the swastika right here she touched her chest she loved the speeches better than the theater she used to say shed turn the radio up loud so everyone in the building would hear too if they complained shed say dont you want to hear the fiihrer ill report you always the busybody she looked away from the rubble well thats finished too at least no more speeches you didnt know no he said disconcerted a lover of poppyseed cakes a truck roared into the street catching lena in its headlights look out he grabbed her hand and pulled her toward the bricks frau frau guttural shouts followed by laughs in the open back of the truck a group of russian soldiers holding bottles komme one of them shouted as the truck slowed jake could feel her freeze beside him her entire body rigid he stepped into the street so that his uniform was visible in the light get lost he said jerking his fingers at the truck amerikanski one of them shouted back but the uniform had its effect the men who had started to get off the back stopped one of them now raising a bottle to toast lena someone elses property a joke in russian went around the truck the men saluted jake and laughed beat it he said hoping his tone of voice would be the translation amerikanski the soldier said again taking a drink then suddenly pointed behind jake and shouted something in russian jake turned in the moonlight a rat had stopped on the porcelain basin nose up before he could move the russian took out a gun and fired the noise exploding around them making jakes stomach contract he ducked the rat scampered away but now other guns were firing too a spontaneous target practice hitting the porcelain with a series of pings until it cracked a whole piece of it lifting up and flying away like the rat behind him he could feel lena clutching his shirt a few steps and they would be in the line of fire as unpredictable as a drunken aim and then abruptly it stopped and the men started laughing again one of them banged the roof of the cab to get the truck moving and looking at jake threw a vodka bottle to him as it drove off jake caught it with both hands a football and stood looking at it then tossed it onto the bricks lena was shaking all over now as if the smash of the bottle had released everything her fear had kept still pigs she said holding on to him theyre just drunk he said but he was rattled you could die here in a second on a triggerhappy whim what if he hadnt been here he imagined lena running down the street her own street being chased into shadows as his eyes followed the truck he saw a basement light go onsomeone waiting in the dark until the shooting passed only the rats could run fast enough lets go back to the kudamm she said its all right they wont come back he said holding her were almost at the church but in fact the street frightened him too sinister now in the pale light unnaturally still when they passed a standing wall the moon disappeared behind it for a minute and they were back in the early days of the blackout when you picked your way home by the eerie glow of phosphorus strips but at least thered been noise traffic and whistles and wardens barking orders now the silence was complete not even disturbed by frau dzuris radio they never change lena said her voice low when they first came it was so terrible we thought its the end but it wasnt its still the same at least theyre not shooting people anymore he said easily trying to move away from it theyre soldiers thats all its just their way of having fun they had their fun then too she said her voice bitter you know in the hospital they took the new mothers the pregnant women they didnt care anybody they liked the screaming they laughed i think it excited them ill never forget that everywhere in the building screams thats over now he said but she seemed not to hear then we had to live under them two monthsforever to know what they did and then see them in the street wondering when it would start again every time i looked at one i heard the screams i thought i cant live like this not with them ssh jake said reaching up to her hair the way a parent soothes a sick child trying to make it all go away thats over but he could see in her face that it wasnt she turned away lets go home he looked at her back he wanted to say something more but her shoulders were hunched away from him waiting now for more soldiers in the shadowy street they wont come back he said as if it made any difference contents previous chapter next chapter chapter ten tommy ottingers farewell party coincided with the end of the conference and so became without his intending it a goodbye potsdam bash at least half the press corps were leaving berlin too as much in the dark about the actual negotiations as when they arrived and after two weeks of bland releases and cramped billets they were ready to celebrate by the time jake got to the press camp it already had the deafening noise and littered bottles of a blowout the typing tables had been pushed to one side for a jazz combo and a sprinkling of wacs and red cross nurses took turns like prom queens on the makeshift dance floor everyone else just drank sitting on desks or propped up against the wall shouting over each other to be heard in the far corner the poker game that had begun weeks ago was still going on oblivious to the rest of the room cut off by its own curtain of stale smoke ron looking pleased with himself was circulating with a clipboard signing up people for tours of the cecilienhof and the babelsberg compound finally open to the press now that everyone was gone see the conference site he said to jake of course youve already been not inside whats in babelsberg see where truman slept very nice ill pass what are you so happy about we got through it didnt we harrys gone back to bess uncle joeswell who the fuck knows and everybody behaved himself almost everybody anyway he said glancing at jake then grinning seen the newsreel yeah i want to talk to you about that just part of the service i thought you looked pretty good fuck the thanks you get anybody elsed be pleased by the way you ought to check your messages ive been carrying this for days he pulled out a cable and handed it to jake jake unfolded it newsreel everywhere where are you wire firsthand account rescue asap colliers exclusive congrats some stunt christ jake said i ought to make you answer it me im just the errand boy he grinned again use your imagination something will come to you i wonder what youll do after the war hey the movie star tommy came over putting his hand on jakes shoulder wheres your drink the top of his bald head was already glistening with sweat here jake said taking the glass out of tommys hand you look like youre drinking for two why not auf wiedersehen to this hellhole so who gets my room ron lou aaronsons been asking what am i the desk clerk weve got a list this long of course some people dont even use theirs another glance at jake i hear breimers still around jake said take an act of congress to get that asshole out tommy said slurring his words a little now now ron said a little respect whats he up to jake said nothing good tommy said he hasnt been up to anything good since fucking harding was president here we go again ron said rolling his eyes bad old american dye give it a rest why dont you go shit in your hat what do you know about it ron shrugged pleasantly not much except they won the war for us yeah well so did i but im not rich and they are how do you figure that ron thumped him on the back rich in spirit tommy rich in spirit here he said pouring a drink and handing it to him on the house ill see you later theres a nurse over there wants to see where truman slept dont forget about the room tommy said to his back as he melted into the crowd he took a drink to think hes just a kid with years to go so what do you know tommy brian said you might have a story for me he did huh you care im listening what about breimer tommy shook his head thats a washington story he looked up mine by the way ill crack the sonofabitch if i have to go through every patent myself its a beaut too how the rich get richer how do they you really want to hear this holding companies licenses fucking paper maze half the time their own lawyers cant trace it american dye and chemical you know they were like that with farben he said holding up two fingers folded over each other before the war during the war share the patents and one hand washes the other except theres a war on and you dont trade with an enemy company looks bad so the money gets paid somewhere elseswitzerland a new company nothing to do with you except funny there are the same guys on the board you get paid no matter who wins not very nice jake said can you prove it no but i know it how because im a great newspaperman tommy said touching his nose then looking down into his drink if i can get through the paper youd think it would be simple to find out who actually owns something wouldnt you not this time its all fuzzy just the way they like it but i know it remember blaustein the cartel guy farben was his baby he said hed give me a hand its all there somewhere in washington you just have to get your hands on the right piece of paper of course you have to want to find it he said lifting his glass to his colleagues in the noisy room dancing with wacs so whats breimer doing in berlin then plea bargaining help his old friends except hes not getting very far he smiled you have to hand it to blaustein make enough noise and somebody finally listens hell even we listen once in a while result is that nobody wants to go near farbenthe stinks too strong mgs got a special tribunal set up just for them theyll nail them toowar crimes up the kazoo not even breimers going to get the biggies off hes trying to kick the teeth out of the denazification program with all those speeches he makes but even that wont do it this time everybody knows farben christ they built a plant at auschwitz whos going to stick out his neck for people like that thats it speeches jake said beginning to feel that ron might after all be right that tommy was riding a hobbyhorse barely touching the ground what else would breimer be doing well he does what he can the speeches are part of it nobodys really sure what denazification meanswhere do you draw the line so he keeps whittling away at that and pretty soon youre a lot less sure than you were people want to go home not try nazis which of course is what american dye is hoping so their friends can go back to work but not everybodys in jail what i get is that hes offering employment contracts jake raised his head employment contracts they already have the patents the idea is to get the personnel nobody wants to stay in germany the whole placell probably go commie anyway and then where are we problem now is getting them in the state department has this funny idea about not giving visas to nazis but since everybody was a nazi and since the army wants them anyway the only way in is to find a sponsor somebody who can say theyre crucial to their operations like american dye tommy nodded and theyll have the war department contracts to prove it the army gets the eggheads and american dye gets a nice fat contract to put them to work and everybodys happy were talking about farben people chemists sure theyd be a natural fit for american dye i talked to one he wanted to know what utica was like anybody else not farben could be look put it this way american dye will do anything the army wantstheir business is the army army wants a wind tunnel expert theyll find a use for him especially if the army gives them a wind tunnel contract you know how it works its the old story yeah with a new wrinkle jobs for nazis well that depends what kind of stink comes off the record nobodys finding work for goering but most of them you know just kept their heads down nominal nazis what the hell it was a nazi country and the thing is theyre goodthats the kicker best in the world you talk to the tech boys their eyes get all dreamy just thinking about them like theyre talking about pussy german science he shook his head taking another drink its a helluva country when you think about it no resources they did it all in laboratories rubber fuel the only thing they had was coal and look what they did almost jake said look at it now tommy grinned well i never said they werent crazy what kind of people would listen to hitler frau dzuris jake said to himself who nobodyjust thinking hey tommy he said brooding you ever hear of any money actually changing hands what to germans are you kidding you dont have to bribe themthey want to go whats here seen any chemical plants with help wanted signs out lately and meanwhile breimers recruiting maybe a little on the side hes the type likes to stay busy he looked up from his drink whats your interest hed have a lot of money to throw around jake said not answering if he wanted something uhhuh tommy said peering at jake what are you getting at nothing honestly just nosing around now why is that i know you you dont give a flying fuck about farben do you no dont worry the storys all yours then why are you pumping me i dont know force of habit my mother always said you learn something every time you listen tommy laughed you didnt have a mother he said not possible sure even breimers got one jake said lightly ill bet shes proud as anything yeah and hed sell her too if you put the money in escrow he put the glass down on the table probably runs the goddamn garden club while her boys collecting envelopes from american dye its a great country none better jake said easily and i cant wait to get back to it figure that one out listen do me a favor if you come up with anything on breimer let me know will you since youre just nosing around you get the first call and dont reverse the fucking charges you owe me jake smiled im going to miss you tommy me and your bad tooth now what the hell is he up to he said cocking his head toward a drum roll coming from the band ron was standing in front of the combo holding a glass listen up cant have a party without a toast toast toast shouts from around the room followed by a chorus of keys tinkling against glasses come on up here tommy groans and whistles the goodnatured rumble of a frat party soon people would be balancing bottles on their heads ron started in on something about the finest group of reporters hed ever worked with then grinned as the crowd shouted him down held up his hand and finally gave in just by raising his glass with a good luck some airplanes made of folded yellow typing paper floated in from the crowd hitting rons head so that he had to duck laughing speech speech go fuck yourselves tommy said which hit the right note making the crowd whistle again come on tommy what do you say a voice next to jake benson from stars and stripes slightly hoarse from shouting tommy smiled and lifted his glass on this historic occasion aw more hoots and another paper plane gliding by lets drink to free and unrestricted navigation on all international inland waterways to jakes surprise this brought down the house prompting a whoop of laughter followed by chants of inland waterways inland waterways tommy drained his glass as the band started playing again whats the joke jake said to benson trumans big idea at the conference they say the look on uncle joes face was worth a million bucks youre kidding who could he actually insisted they put it on the agenda i thought the sessions were secret that one was too good to keep quiet they had five leaks in about five minutes whereve you been busy couldnt get him off it the way to lasting peace he laughed open up the danube i take it this didnt make the final agreement you nuts they just pretended it wasnt there like a fart in church he looked over at jake busy with what after that the party grew louder a steady din of music and voices that kept rising until it finally became one piercing sound like steam whistling out of a valve nobody seemed to mind the nurses were getting the rush on the dance floor but the noise had the male boom of all the occupation parties nearly stag civilian girls confined by the nonfraternization rules to the shadow world of kudamm clubs and groping in the ruins liz waved from the dance floor signaling for jake to cut in but he gave a mock salute and went to the bar instead fifteen more minutes to be polite and hed go home to lena the whole room was jumping now as if everyone were dancing in place except for the poker game in the corner whose only movement was the methodical slapping of cards on the table jake looked down at the end of the bar and smiled another pocket of quiet muller was putting in a reluctant appearance more than ever judge hardy silverhaired and sober like a chaperone at a high school dance jake felt an elbow then a slosh of beer on his sleeve and moved away from the bar to make a last circuit around the room a burst of laughter from a huddle nearbytommy at it again near the door a corkboard hung on the wall cluttered with pinnedup sheets of copy and headlines clipped out of context his potsdam piece was there the margins like all the others filled with scribbled comments in code nooyb not one of your best a story on churchill leaving the conference wgwte when giants walked the earth the backslapping acronyms of the press camp as secret and joky as the passwords in a schoolboys club how hed spent the war admiring your handiwork he turned to find muller standing behind him his uniform army crisp in the sweaty room whats it mean anyway muller said pointing to the scribbles reviews in shorthand ootag jake said pronouncing it as a word one of the alltime greats nooybnot one of your best like that you men have more initials than the army thatll be the day the only one i hear these days is fyigmofuck you i got my orders home that is he said as if jake had missed it i suppose youll be heading home too now that potsdams over no not yet im still working on something muller looked at him thats right the black market i saw colliers theres more jake shrugged you know every time theres a story like that its an extra days work for somebody explaining it maybe somebody should clean it up instead were trying believe it or not how muller smiled how do we do anything new regulations but even regulations take time especially if some of the people making them are sending money home too muller threw him a sharp look then backed off come for a smoke he said a gentle order jake followed him out a line of jeeps stretched along the dusty broad sweep of argentinischeallee but otherwise the street was deserted youve been busy muller said handing him a cigarette i saw you in the movies yeah how about that i also hear somebodys been making inquiries in frankfurt about our friend tully i assume thats you you forgot to mention what a colorful character he was hauptmann toll meister toll since you like to be accurate not that it matters comes to the same thing another weak smile not one of our best the whips a nice touch he ever use it lets hope not he drew on his cigarette find what you were looking for im getting there no thanks to mg want to tell me why youre holding out on me for the sake of accuracy nobodys holding out on you how about a ballistics report on a second sheet that wasnt there i suppose that got mislaid muller said nothing so let me ask you again why were you holding out muller sighed and flicked his cigarette toward the street thats easy i dont want you to do this story clear enough some lowlife gets in trouble in the black market and the papers start yelling corruption in the mg we dont need that he glanced at jake we like to clean up our own mess including murder with an american bullet including that muller said evenly weve got a criminal investigation department you know they know what theyre doing keeping it quiet you mean no getting to the bottom of itwithout a scandal go home geismar he said wearily no muller looked up surprised at the abrupt answer i could make you go home youre on a pass here just like everyone else you dont want to do that im a heroits in the movies you dont want to run me out of town now how would that look muller stared for a minute then smiled reluctantly i admit there are better options at the moment then why not stop being army brass for five seconds and give me a little cooperation youve got an american dead the cid isnt going to do a damn thing and you know it you could use the help from you youre not a policeman youre just a pain in the ass he grimaced now how about letting me serve out my time in peace go make trouble somewhere else while youre waiting would it interest you to know the money on him was russian mullers head snapped up then held still the one thing that always got the mgs attention yes it would he said finally looking steadily at jake how do you know the serial numbers ask the boys in the cid since theyre so professional still want me off the case muller looked down at the ground moving his foot in a small circle as if he were making a decision look nobodys trying to hold out on you ill get you the ballistics report thats all right ive seen it muller raised his head i wont ask how but while youre being so friendly you could do me another favor kind of make it up to me you didnt find any travel orders on him thats right what about an airport okay who got him on the plane i need somebody to check the dispatchers july sixteenth but that could take i figure your secretary might have some time on her hands if she could call around for me id appreciate it theyd listen to you me it might take weeks you havent had any problem so far muller said looking at him carefully but this time id have some help from the top for a change you know how it is and while shes at it one more thing check a flight listing for an emil brandt previous week and since he took in mullers blank expression hes a scientist tully sprang from kransberg dustbin heard of it where are you going with this muller said quietly just have her do it dustbins a secret facility jake shrugged people talk hang around the press camp more youd be surprised what you pick up you cant write about it its classified i know dont worry im not interested in dustbin just meister toll im not sure i understand the connection if im right just wait a little and you can read all about it in the papers thats one thing i have no intention of doing jake smiled why dont you wait and see how it comes out you might change your mind he glanced up at him serious now no black eyes do i have your word on that would you take it why not just say you have my best intentions and leave it at that but id appreciate the calls muller nodded slowly all right but i want you to do something for mework with the cid on this carbons in triplicate no thanks i wont have you running around like a loose cannon you work with them understand now im on the team a minute ago you were sending me home mullers shoulders sagged thats before the russians were involved he said glumly now we need to know even if that means using you he paused thinking youre sure about the money the serial numbers thats the first ive heard of it i thought it was all the same theres a little dash a friend in the black market tipped me off its the sort of thing they notice turns out the treasury department isnt as dumb as you thought that makes me feel a whole lot better muller straightened up i wish you did all right lets go back in before i change my mind he said leading jake to the door they stopped on the threshold hit by the blast of noise a conga line was snaking through the room legs flying out on the onetwothreekick nobody quite on the same beat the ladies and gentlemen of the press muller said shaking his head my god i wish i was back in the army drink you have mine im on my way home where is that these days i havent seen you at dinner lately keeping company somewhere colonel there are rules about that mm strictly enforced he said wryly like everything else he turned to go then stopped geismar dont make me regret this i can still kick your ass home ill keep that in mind jake said just make the calls please he said goodbye to tommy now in a sloppy bearhugging mood the conga line had broken up and with it the rest of the dancing but the party showed no signs of slowing down the drinking had reached the stage when jokes could turn into arguments without anyone noticing liz was taking some group shots a line of reporters with their arms draped over each others shoulders and their faces fixed in bleary grins a cheer went up when someone arrived with more ice it was time to go he was almost at the door when liz caught up with him hey jackson hows your love life she was carrying her shoes in one hand and a camera case in the other her eyes shiny with drink okay hows yours away since you ask no more tall joe keep your shirt on hes back tomorrow she made a face they always come back how about a lift i dont think i can make it in these she said holding up the shoes little unsteady on your feet jake said smiling these they gave out about an hour ago come on here she said handing him the shoes let me get my bag he stood there shoes dangling from his fingers and watched her weave over to the table and struggle with a strap that kept missing her shoulder as she tried to fling it in place finally he went over and took the bag from her sliding it onto his own shoulder well arent vou nice stupid thing come on you could use some air what have you got in here she giggled oh i forgot you ive got you in there wait a minute she said stopping him and fumbling with the zipper fresh out of the darkroom well fresh ive been carrying these around for days she pulled out some glossies and shuffled to find the right one here we are our man in berlin not bad considering he looked at himself stepping into the right half of the picture leaving the document center behind thinning over the temples a surprised expression ive looked better he said the same feeling hed had seeing his reflection in kadewes windowsomeone else no longer the young man in his passport photo thats what you think off to the left joe stood posing as tall and blond as a poster aryan one of the tech boys according to brian breimers friend jake dropped the picture on the pile then stopped and pulled it back looking again hey liz he said staring at it whats joes last name again shaeffer why a german name he shook his head nothing maybe can i keep this sure she said pleased ive got a million more where that came from blond like a german frau dzuris had said the right fit but was it in the picture another camera trick he and jake were standing on the steps as if theyd been together all along nothing was what it seemed he glanced at his watch frau dzuris would be getting ready for bed disturbed by a knock on the door but not asleep yet he grabbed lizs arm and began tugging her across the floor wheres the fire lets go i have to see somebody oh she said an exaggerated drawl she reached over and took her shoes not this time let her wear her own jake ignored her hurrying them to the jeep you know its none of my business she began as she got in then dont say it touchy she said but let it go leaning back in her seat as they started down the road you know what you are youre a romantic not the last time i looked you are though she said nodding her head having a conversation with herself whats joe doing in berlin jake said but the drink had taken her elsewhere she laughed youre right hes not anyway what do you care she turned to him its not serious you know with him hes justaround doing what she waved her hand hes just around she put her head back against the seat cushioning it as if it were too much trouble to hold it upright on the bumpy road for a second jake wondered if she was going to pass out but she said idly im glad you like the picture its a fast shutter zeiss no blurs the blur instead seemed to be in her speech they had circled the old luftwaffe building and were heading into gelferstrasse almost there in front of the billet he idled the motor and reached for the shoulder bag can you manage he said fitting the strap in place still in a hurry huh i thought you lived here not tonight okay jackson she said softly ill take a hike and then surprising him she leaned over and kissed him on the mouth a full kiss what was that for jake said when she broke away i wanted to see what it was like youve had too much to drink yeah well she said embarrassed gathering her bag and getting out my timing isnt the best either she turned to the jeep funny how that works it might have been nice though dont you think it might have been a gentleman she said hitching up the bag ill bet youre the type wholl pretend to forget about it in the morning too but in fact it stayed with him all the way to wilmersdorf the unexpected mystery of people who they really were hed been right about frau dzuris ready for bed and clutching her wrapper frightened by the knock and hed been right about the picture yes you see like a german frau dzuris said thats the one you know him hes a friend but in the dim light of the doorway his eyes never went to the photo caught instead by the empty space on the cloth over her left breast where a pin once would have been the next day it was liz who didnt remember she was on her way to potsdam with one of rons tour groups thinned out by hangovers and seemed surprised that he mentioned joe at all what do you want to see him for he has some information for me uhhuh what kind of information missing persons you going to tell me what youre talking about you going to tell me where he is she shrugged giving up hes meeting me as a matter of fact in potsdam why potsdam hes getting me a camera jake pointed to the one she was carrying with the prized fast shutter he get you that too whats it to you she smiled palms up hes a generous guy jake grinned yeah with requisitioned cameras he say where he got it ask him yourself you coming or not she pointed to rons car an old mercedes two reporters were dozing in the back legs spread out waiting for the trip to start too crowded ill follow better stick with me look what happened the last time we went so in the end she rode with him they followed rons car until they reached the avus then lost it when it jerked into autobahn speed weaving in and out of the stream of cars heading out of berlin the traffic surprised him in the bright sunshine it seemed everyone was going to potsdamtrucks and jeeps and cars like rons snatched from garages for new owners behind them an old black horch filled with russians barely kept up but the others were racing on the open highway prewar driving with the trees of the grunewald rushing past when they got into town the bomb damage hed missed before leaped to the eye the stadtschloss a roofless ruin had taken the worst of it and only sections of the long colonnade were left facing the market square the nikolaikirche opposite had lost its dome the four corner towers looking more than ever like odd minarets only the palladian rathaus seemed likely to survive with atlas still perched on top of its round tower holding up a gilded ball of the world a kind of bad jokethe british bombers had spared the kitsch the alten markt however was lively a rickety tram was running in front of the obelisk and the huge open square was crammedhundreds perhaps a thousand people milling between stacks of goods bargaining openly as noisy as the medieval market that had given the space its name it reminded him improbably of the souk in cairo a dense theater of exchange hawkers grabbing buyers by the sleeve the air full of languages but drained of color no open melons and pyramids of spices just scuffed pairs of shoes and chipped hummel knickknacks and secondhand clothes closets stripped for sale but at least there was none of the furtiveness of the tiergarten market one eye keeping watch for raiding mps the russians were buying not guarding eager to be back in business after the hiatus of the conference no one whispered two soldiers walked by with wall clocks balanced on their heads none of this would have been here when tully came jake imagined instead a meeting in some quiet corner maybe even in the neuer garten just steps from the water selling what they left the jeep near the empty space in the colonnade where the fortuna portal had been and wandered into the crowd liz snapping pictures rons car was nowhere in sight probably still headed for trumans villa but jake noticed amused that the horch had had to squeeze in behind the jeep the only place in berlin with a parking problem where are you meeting him jake said he said by the colonnade were early look at thisdo you think its real meissen she picked up the soup tureen giltedged handles and pink apple blossoms the kind of thing you could have found by the dozen in karstadts before the war but the german woman selling it gaunt and sagging had come to life meissen ja naturlich what are you going to do with that jake said make soup its pretty lucky strike the woman said in accented english camel liz handed it back and motioned to the woman to pose as the camera clicked the woman smiled nervously holding out her dish still hoping for a sale and jake turned uneasily feeling ashamed as if they were stealing something the way primitive people feared a camera took souls you shouldnt do that he said as they moved off the woman shouting after them in disappointment local color liz said unconcerned why do they all wear pants theyre old uniforms the men arent allowed so the women wear them they arent she said pointing to two girls in summer dresses talking to french soldiers whose red berets flashed like bird feathers in all the khaki and gray theyre selling something else really liz said curious right out in the open but they posed too arms around the soldiers waists less selfconscious than the woman with porcelain they had made a halfcircle to the obelisk past the cigarette dealers and watch salesmen and piles of px cans on the steps of the nikolai a man had spread out carpets a surreal touch of samarkand nearby a onearmed veteran was offering a box of now useless hand tools a woman with two children at her side held out a pair of baby shoes they found shaeffer near the north end of the colonnade looking at cameras you remember jake liz said breezily hes been looking for you oh yes find anything she said taking the camera from him and putting it to her eye just an old leica not worth it he turned to jake you looking for a camera not unless its got a zeiss lens jake said nodding at lizs case you pick that one up at the plant the plants in the soviet zone last i heard shaeffer said looking at him carefully i heard one of our tech units paid it a visit is that a fact i thought they might have picked up some souvenirs now why would they do that you can get anything you want right here shaeffer spread his hand toward the square so you havent been there what is this twenty questions dont race your motor liz said to him handing back the leica jakes always asking questions its what he does yeah well go ask them somewhere else you ready he said to liz hey the babe with the camera two american soldiers running over to them remember us hitlers office like it was yesterday liz said how you boys doing we got our orders one of the soldiers said end of the week just my luck liz said grinning want a shot for the road she held up the camera hey great get the obelisk in can you jake followed the cameras eye to the gis the market swirling behind them he wondered for a second how theyd explain it at home russians holding wristwatches to their ears to check the ticking tired german ladies with tureens at the church two russians were holding up a carpet a general with medals hovering off to one side as a tram pulled in dividing the crowd the russian turned his face toward the colonnade sikorsky holding a carton of cigarettes jake smiled to himself even the brass came to market day for a little something on the side or was it payday for informants the gi was scribbling on a piece of paper you can send it there hey st louis liz said you too webster groves no shit long way from home huh he said looking toward the bombedout schloss say hi to the folks liz said as they moved off then turned to shaeffer how do you like that lets go he said bored one more question jake said but shaeffer had begun to walk away why are you looking for emil brandt shaeffer stopped and turned for a second he stood still staring his face a question what makes you think im looking for anybody because i saw frau dzuris too who the neighbor from pariserstrasse another hard stare what do you want im an old friend of the family when i tried to look him up i found your foot sticking in the door now why is that an old friend of the family shaeffer said before the war i worked with his wife so let me ask you againwhy are you looking for him shaeffer kept his eyes on jake trying to read his face because hes missing he said finally from kransberg i know shaeffer blinked surprised then whats your question my question is so what who is he to you if you know kransberg you know that too hes a guest of the us government on an extended stay thats right were not finished talking to him and when you do hes free to go i dont know about that thats not my department which is what exactly none of your fucking business what do you want anyway i want to find him too just like you he glanced up any luck shaeffer looked sharply at him again then eased off taking a breath no and its been a while we could use a break maybe youre the break a friend of the family we dont know anything personal about him just whats in his head what is shaeffer looked down a lot hes a fucking walking bomb if he talks to the wrong people meaning russians shaeffer nodded you say you knew his wife know where she is now no jake said avoiding lizs eye why we figure hes with her he kept talking about her lena lena liz said its a common name jake said to her a signal that worked because she looked away quiet he turned again to shaeffer what if he doesnt want to be found thats not an option shaeffer said stiffly he looked down at his watch we cant talk here come to headquarters at two is that an order it will be if you dont show up you going to help or not if i knew where he was i wouldnt have asked you his backgroundyou can brief us on that there must be someone hed see maybe youre the break he repeated then shook his head christ you never know do you its been a long time i dont know who his friends arei can tell you that now i didnt even know hed been a nazi so everyone was a nazi shaeffer looked over at jake suspicious again you one of those those what guys still fighting the war looking for nazis dont waste my time with that i dont care if he was hitlers best friend we just want to know whats up here he said putting a finger to his temple an echo from another conversation at a dinner table one more question jake said first time i saw you you were picking breimer up gelferstrasse july sixteenth ring a bell whered you go shaeffer stared again his mouth drawn thin i dont remember thats the night tully was killed i see you know the name i know the name shaeffer said slowly psd at kransberg so what so hes dead i heard good riddance if you ask me and you dont want to know who did it why to give him a medal he just saved somebody else from having to do it the guy was no good and he drove emil brandt out of kransberg and that doesnt interest you tully liz said the man we found jake glanced at her surprised at the interruption then at shaeffer a jarring moment because it occurred to him for the first time that it might have been shaeffers interest all along a flirtation to see what she knew who was anybody thats right he said then turned to shaeffer but that doesnt interest you and you dont remember where you took breimer i dont know what you think youre getting at but go get it somewhere else before i paste you one all right thats enough liz said save it for the ring i came here to get a camera not to watch you two square off kids she glared at jake you take some chances now how about giving me a nice smilei want to finish off this rolland then you run along like a good boy that means you too she said to shaeffer surprisingly he obeyed turning to face the camera with jake two oclock dont forget he said out of the side of his mouth quiet liz said crouching a little to frame the picture come on smile as she bent the sound of a shot cracked through the square followed by a scream jake looked over her shoulder a russian soldier was running past the obelisk dodging people who flew out of his way like startled geese another shot off to the right from a handful of russians near the parked horch guns out but in the split second of his glance jake saw that the guns werent pointing at the obelisk but had tracked farther along aiming now at lizs back down he yelled but instead she jerked up surprised so that when the bullet came it thudded into her neck a frozen second then another crack a sharp whistle shaeffer staggered backward hit and crumpled to the ground before jake could move he felt lizs body falling forward toppling him against the colonnade its weight forcing him back until he was falling too his head hitting the column as he went down screams everywhere now in the square the sound of feet running on stone another shot glancing off the colonnade he tried to breathe under the weight then realized that what stopped his mouth was blood pumping out of her throat coating him more shots the market erupting with guns so many guns that they seemed fired at random not aimed people hugging the paving stones to get out of the crossfire in a panic jake tried to roll liz away pushing her hips as another rush of blood spurted into his face he wriggled out from under and reached over to grab shaeffers pistol from its holster then snaked behind the column breathing in gulps the russians by the horch were still firing shooting in all directions now as soldiers around the square crouched and fired back jake aimed the gun trying to steady his weaving hand but when he fired the shot missed smashing the headlight of the car a bullet from somewhere else caught one of the russians instead flinging his body back against the car and then before jake could fire again it was suddenly over the other russians scurrying away behind the horch quick as rats and gone the square empty except for a body lying near the obelisk everything still he heard a gurgle next to him then a shout in german near the nikolai he crawled over to liz feeling his shirt sticky with blood her eyes were open still wide with terror but moving and the blood had stopped gushing just a steady flow into the pool next to her head he pressed his hand on her neck to stop it but a trickle oozed through his fingers wetting them dont die he said well get help but who shaeffer rolled slightly and groaned no one moved in the square dont die he said again his voice catching her eyes were looking straight at him and he wondered for a second if she could see if he could will her to hold on simply by looking back at her a girl from webster groves he turned his head to the square somebody help he shouted but who knew english hilfe as if an ambulance might come screeching down the street where there were no ambulances he looked at her eyes again its going to be all right just hold on he pressed harder on her neck his hand now completely red how much blood had she lost footsteps behind him he looked up one of the tourist gis stunned by the blood jesus christ he said help me jake said they got fred he said groggy as if it were an answer ask one of the germans we have to get her to a hospital krankenhaus the gi looked at him bewildered krankenhaus jake said again just ask the boy moved away unsteadily a sleepwalker and sank to his knees by the obelisk where the other gi lay a few people had crept back into the square looking left and right wary of more fire dont worry he said to liz just hold on well make it but at that moment he knew a shudder through his body that they wouldnt that she was going to die no ambulance was going to come no doctor in a white coat to make everything better there was only this and he saw that she knew wondered how you filled those last minutesa roar in the head or was it utterly still taking in the sky in the time it took to snap a picture her eyes moved frightened and his moved with them keeping her here and then she opened her mouth as if she were about to speak and he heard the gasp not dramatic quiet a little intake of ragged air that stopped and didnt come back trapped somewhere none of the noisy theater of birth just an interrupted breath of air and you left your life her eyes had stopped moving the pupils fixed he took his hand away from her neck and wiped it on his pants smearing blood the thick smell of it he picked up the camera lying next to her still dazed every movement an effort everything gone in a second one flash at a time too fast even for a zeiss lens shaeffer groaned again and jake wobbled over still on his knees more blood a patch spreading across the left shoulder take it easy jake said well get you to a hospital shaeffer reached up with his good arm to grab jakes and squeeze it not russian he said in a hoarse whisper get me out of here its too far but shaeffer clenched his arm again not russian he said almost violent i cant jake looked toward the square filling up now people shuffling aimlessly the moment after an accident russians everywhere a russian town can you move jake said reaching behind shaeffers head shaeffer winced but lifted himself slowly stopping halfway like someone sitting up in bed he was blinking dizzy with shock jake reached under his shoulder and began pulling him up straining under the weight the jeeps over there can you stand shaeffer nodded then fell forward stalled jake glanced again toward the square anybody hey st louis he shouted waving the gi over keeping shaeffer propped up as he waited here give me a hand get him in the jeep together they managed to drag shaeffer to his feet and lugged him forward each step a mile panting fresh blood seeped out of the wound not russian shaeffer mumbled again sounding delirious then yelled in pain when his body hit the passenger seat a final heave and passed out head drooping down on his chest is he going to make it the gi said yes help me with the girl but when they got there and saw liz lying in her pool of blood the gi balked staring at her impatient jake reached under and lifted her by himself his knees shaking and staggered back to the jeep as if he were carrying somebody over the threshold with her head dangling down he laid the body in gently and went back for the gun the gi was still standing there pale holding lizs camera in his hand you got blood on you he said stupidly stay with your buddy ill send somebody jake said taking the camera the gi looked at the soldier lying on the ground jesus christ almighty he said his voice breaking i dont even know what happened a new group of russians had arrived surrounding the horch like mps examining the dead russian the running soldier who had started it all was gone swallowed up in potsdam no other bodies just liz and the boy going home at the end of the week when jake got to the jeep anxious now to leave one of the russians started toward him gesturing at shaeffer slumped in the front seat there would be questions a soviet doctorwhat hed wanted to avoid jake got in and started the jeep the soldier called out to him presumably telling him to stop no time now the closest army hospital would be hq in lichterfelde miles away the russian stood in front of the jeep holding up his hand jake raised the gun aiming it the russian cowered and stepped aside a kid no older than the gi scared who saw a madman covered in blood with a gun in his hand the others looked up then ducked away too the power of a gun as heady as adrenaline nobody stopped you when you held a gun they were still backing away toward the horch as the jeep spun out of the square and headed toward the bridge shaeffers body swayed with the initial jolt then fell limply against jakes side leaning on him as they drove out of potsdam when they sped past the sector crossing jake could see the guards alarmed expressions and realized his face was still bloody he wiped it with his sleeve sweat streaked with dark red now that they were on the road racing he found himself gulping in air his chest heaving as if hed been holding his breath underwater a dream except for the body in the back and the heavy soldier lying against him head bobbing i dont even know what happened but he did when he played the dream again in his mind it stopped after the soldier ran to the obelisk when he saw the guns pointing beyond the soldier at liz a diversionary run the guns always intended for someone else but who would want to kill liz a mistake he looked over to shaeffer someone else a man whod rather risk his life than be taken away by russians contents previous chapter next chapter chapter eleven lizs body was shipped home by military transport and shaeffers lay in a hospital bed mending without visitors mg filed an official complaint with the russians who promptly sent one back and the incident floated between in trays waiting for the kommandatura to meet and quarrel jake retreated to the flat and tried to write a piece about liz then gave it up in stars and stripes she had already become a kind of soldier on the front lines why say anything else it was the newsreel all over again more real than real if you watched it on the screen what would you actually see an accident in crossfire not a girl stepping into someone elses bullet only jake had looked over her shoulder at the pointing gun when he went to gelferstrasse he was unnerved to hear footsteps next door but it was only ron folding her clothes onto a pile near an open satchel give me a hand will you he said holding up some underwear it feels funny going through this stuff never seen panties before it feels funny thats all ron said strangely subdued and jake knew what he meant as each piece of silk dropped into the satchel he felt finally that liz was really gone now just a bundle of neatly folded effects why dont you get the woman downstairs to do it a german there wouldnt be much left you know what theyre like jake held up a pair of shoes the ones lena had danced in and stood for a second looking at them take them if you want ron said why not a whole suitcase of things lena could use impossible to buy hed become a berliner scavenging the dead he dropped the shoes in the satchel they might mean something to somebody is there family ron shrugged what about these he said pointing to a small collection of cosmetics christ women a half tube of lipstick some powder a jar of creamall ordinary not worth sending back let downstairs have them the old lady she can trade them ill bet shes got her eye on the cameras theyre already making noises about the storage room in the basementyou know where she set up a darkroom they say they need the space ill clear it out jake said picking up a camera from the bed the one shed used in potsdam still flecked with blood he twisted the knob to the end then popped out the last roll youd better clean this before you pack it he said holding the camera out to ron who looked at it squeamishly wheres it all going anyway home not cid why cid ron said surprised well she was killed wasnt she she might have been hit by a bus too we dont send them the bus what are you talking about well what jake looked at the lipstick a folded blouse none of it evidence only what had flashed in his eyes as unreliable as a newsreel he walked over to the desk stacked with photographs hell of a way to go though ron was saying finishing the packing all through the war without a scratch and then bam jake started flipping through the pictures churchill at the chancellery ron at the airport in a blur of uniforms another of joe what about shaeffer he lost some blood but they stitched him up all right they said no visitors it was a lot of blood ron said looking at him since when were you two so friendly just asking what happens to these jake said holding up the pictures damned if i know the news service i guess technically think theres anything the family would want i doubt it shes not in any of them the other side of the camera so that you left without a trace well have a look just get them out of herewere going to need the room he snapped the satchel shut thats that not a lot is it she liked to travel light yeah except for her goddamn equipment he said nodding at the packed case by the door some girl though yes ron looked over at him you two ever ever what you know i always thought she had a soft spot for you no it might have been nice just old shaeffer huh you saved the wrong one if you ask me she was already dead ron shook his head fucking dodge city nobodys safe out there jake thought of gunther reading westerns going through his points so we fire the police he said were the police ron said looking at him curiously anyway what difference would it make he turned to go you never know do you when your numbers up thats it that wasnt it somebody shot her well sure ron said then turned back what are you saying im saying somebody shot her not an accident ron peered at him are you all right there were only about a hundred witnesses you know theyre wrong everyone but you then who did it what who did it somebody shoots not an accident its the first thing id want to know jake stared youre right who was he some russian ron said at a loss nobodys just some russian who was he he said to himself then gathered up the photographs to leave thanks where are you going to see a policeman a real one but it was bernie who answered the door in kreuzberg you picked a fine time come on as long as youre here we have to get him on his feet jake looked around the roomthe same messy hodgepodge as before everything smelling of fresh coffee gunther was bent over a mug breathing in the steam head nodding the map of berlin behind him whats up the trial hes in the witness box in an hour so what does he do goes on a bender i get here hes on the fucking floor what trial your pal renate the greifer todays the day here help me get him up herr geismar gunther said looking up from the mug eyes bleary drink the coffee bernie snapped all these weeks and now he pulls this gunther was rising unsteadily think you can manage a shave or should we do it for you i can shave myself gunther said stiffly what about clothes bernie said you cant go looking like that a dirty undershirt marked with stains gunther nodded toward the closet then turned to jake so how goes your case i thought you had given up no ive got lots to tell you good bernie said talk to him maybe thatll wake him up he opened the closet and pulled out a dark suit this fit of course it better youre going to make a good impression if i have to hold you up its so important to you gunther said his voice distant she sent your wife to the ovens isnt it important to you gunther looked down and took another sip of coffee so what is it you want herr geismar i need you to talk to your russian friends find out about somebody there was a shooting in potsdam always potsdam gunther said a grunt a russian shot a friend of mine i want to know who he is was gunther raised his eyes somebody shot back his name isnt on the report gunther said a cops question not just his name who he was ah the who gunther said drinking more coffee so another case the same case the same bernie said following the conversation from the closet they said it was an accident a robbery it was in the papers it wasnt a robbery jake said i was there it was a setup he looked at gunther the shooting was the point they just happened to get the wrong person that was your friend jake nodded the man they wanted took one in the shoulder not a sharpshooter then gunther said using the western term its easy to miss in a crowd you know what the markets like all hell broke loose shooting all over the place ask your friend sikorsky gunther looked up from his coffee he was in the market in potsdam jake smiled peddling cigarettes maybe he was buying a rug i dont know he got out fast enough when the shooting started just like everybody else then he didnt see the first shots i saw them go on gunther said talk while you shave bernie said nudging him toward the bathroom ill get more coffee gunther shuffled to the sink obedient and stood for a minute in front of the mirror looking at himself then started to lather his face with a brush jake sat on the edge of the tub dont be long bernie said from the other room we have to go over your testimony one last time weve been over my testimony gunther said to the mirror grimly his grizzled face slowly disappearing under a film of soap you dont want to forget anything dont worry gunther said to himself now leaning on the sink i wont forget he picked up a straightedge razor his hand shaking are you going to be all right jake said quietly do you want me to do that you think i might hurt myself no he held up the razor looking at it do you know how many times ive thought how easy it would be one cut thats all and its over he shook his head i could never do it i dont know why i tried i put the razor here he said touching his throat but i couldnt cut you think it would cut me now an accident he turned sideways to look at jake i dont believe in accidents he faced the mirror again so tell me about our case jake shifted on the tub rim disconcerted not the drink talking the voice behind the drink suddenly naked not even aware of being exposed like someone in a window taking off his clothes what goes through your head when you feel a razor on your throat but now it was there again taking a calm neat stroke upward through the soap guided by a survivors steady hand jake started to talk his words following the rhythmic scraping trying to match the logical path of the shave down one cheek curving around the corners of the mouth but soon the story went off on its own darting from one place to another the way it had actually happened there was a lot gunther didnt know the serialnumber dash kransberg frau dzuris even young willi loitering in professor brandts street at times jake thought gunther had stopped listening stretching his skin to draw the razor closer without nicking but then he would grunt and jake knew he was registering the points his mind clearing with each swipe of his soapy face bernie came in with more coffee and stayed leaning against the door and watching gunthers expression in the mirror for once not interrupting a russian kneeling in front of a horch gun out meister toll gunther rinsed the blade and splashed his face clean is this presentable enough for you he said to bernie just like new heres a shirt he said handing it over so what do you think jake said everythings mixed up gunther said absently wiping his face ive confused you its more i think that you have confused yourself jake looked at him herr geismar you cannot do police work by intuition follow the points like a bookkeeper you have two problems so you make two columns keep them separate dont leap from column to column but they connect only at kransberg who knows maybe the one coincidence the obvious point you know is that tully wasnt looking for herr brandt the others yes not him he shook his head slipping into the shirt no put your numbers down in order each in its own column it is only when the same number comes up that you have a match the connection maybe they connect at potsdam that keeps coming up yes and why gunther said buttoning the shirt ive never understood about potsdam what was he doing there and that day a closed city you asked me to check on that bernie said passes into the american compound zero no tully but he was found there jake said russian sector russian money yes the money its a useful point gunther picked up the coffee cup again drinking if he got russian money it must have been here but not from an ivan buying watches i think who has so much have you heard anything from alford no try again the tie also he said to bernie you want to look your best for the judge bernie said jake sighed stymied danny wont get us anywhere we have to find emil gunther turned to the mirror slipping the tie underneath his collar keep your columns separate there isnt yet the connection and i suppose the shooting in potsdam wasnt connected either no there a number matches shaeffer you mean herr geismar you have a gift for ignoring the obvious a gift he leaned toward the mirror knotting his tie there are three people standing in the market close when you describe it you see a gun pointing at the photographer but i see her bending down i see it pointing at you for a second jake just stared at gunther the sharp eyes no longer cloudy now cleared by caffeine me he said little more than a surprised intake of air a man who finds a body who investigates a murder do you mean this hasnt occurred to you who else a soldier for raiding the zeiss works perhaps the lady and it might be you knowyoure quick to look away from her the person shot is usually the one intended but lets say this time youre right a piece of luck luck for you stepping into his bullet dead because he was lucky i dont believe it when did you first see the horch on the avus you said soon after you left gelferstrasse that doesnt mean anything try this point nobody started shooting until we met shaeffer away from the crowd and if you had both been shot an incident no longer just you but why because you are dangerous to someone of course a detective is i dont believe it jake said his voice less sure than before gunther picked up a hairbrush and ran it back over his temples have it your way but i suggest you move if they know gelferstrasse they may know the other i take it this is where the lady friend lives the good lena its one thing to put yourself in danger jake cut him off do you really believe this gunther shrugged a precaution why should lena be in any danger why was a russian looking for her you didnt find it interesting that point the russian at professor brandts asks for her not for the son to find the son jake said watching gunthers face then why not ask for him all right why not another obvious point gunther shook his head more a possibility but it suggests itself he looked up at jake they already know where he is jake said nothing waiting for more but gunther turned away taking the coffee cup with him into the other room is it time he said to bernie you sober hold out your hands gunther stretched one arm outa mild trembling so im on trial now he said we want a credible witness not a drunk im a policeman ive been in a courtroom before not this kind jake had followed them brooding that doesnt make sense he said to gunther not yet as i say a possibility he put down the cup but i would move her i would hide her jake glanced at him disturbed i still want to talk to shaeffer he said hes the one they shot and he couldnt wait to get out of there even wounded its all he cared about he paused anyway where could we go its not easy to move in berlin no unless you have to i moved marthe fourteen times gunther said looking down at the floor fourteen i remember every time you dont forget guntzelstrasse blucherstrasse every time will they ask me about that he said to bernie no bernie said just the last time with the greifer he said nodding a coffee we thought it was safe she had papers safe jake looked at him surprised a uboat trail gunther helping i thought you divorced her he said she divorced me it was better he looked up you think i abandoned her marthe she was my wife i did what i could flats papers for a policeman not so difficult but not enough the greifer saw her by chance just like that so it was all for nothing every move he stopped and turned to bernie forgive me im not myself you going to be sick gunther smiled weakly not sick a little his voice trailed off suddenly frail perhaps one drink for the nerves nothing doing bernie said but jake glanced at him his body shrunken in the old suit eyes uneasy and walked over to the table and poured out a finger of brandy gunther drank it back in one gulp like medicine then stood for a second letting it work its way through him dont worry he said to bernie i wont forget anything lets hope not he reached into his pockets and pulled out a mint here chew this the russiansu smell it on you a mile off the russians jake said its a russian trial to show us they can do it too not just string people up especially when we help catch them come on well be late can i get in id like to see this see renate the press slots were gone days ago everybody wants to see this one jake looked at him feeling like gunther asking for a drink all right bernie said well put you on the prosecution team you can keep an eye on our friend here which is getting to be a job he glanced at gunther no more gunther handed the glass back to jake thank you and then as a kind of return favor ill talk to willi for you willi its a type i know well hell talk to me i mean why him jake said intrigued to see gunther still working behind everything to keep the figures neat the little details whats the english dot the is and cross the ts still a cop gunther shrugged it pays to be neat not overlook anything what else did i overlook not overlookignore perhaps sometimes when its not pleasant we dont want to see such as the car the horch again whats so important about the horch no herr brandts car that weekto drive into berlin how was it possible the city was burning at war and yet he comes to get his wife how was that allowed it was an ss car yes his you think the ss was offering lifts while the city was falling either he was one of them or he was their prisoner but they stop to collect the father so not a prisoner one of them a mission for the sswhat kind even the ss didnt send cars for relatives those last days his father said they were picking up files and they risk coming to berlin what files i wonder thats easy to find out bernie said they surrendered in the west therell be a record somewhere one thing weve got plenty of is files more folders gunther said looking at the stack bernie had brought with him for the trial for all the bad germans lets see what they say about herr brandt what makes you think hes in them jake said what do you save when a citys on fire you save yourself he was trying to save his wife but he didnt gunther said then looked away somewhere else of course sometimes its not possible he picked up his jacket and put it on ready to go that last weekyou werent here fires russians in the streets we thought it was the end of the world he looked back at jake but it wasnt now theres this the reckoning the courtroom had an improvised look to it as if the russians had set up a stage without knowing where the props went their denazification program had run to group executions not trials but the greifer was a special case so theyd taken over a room near the old police headquarters in the alex built a raised platform of raw wooden boards for the judges bench and assigned the press haphazard rows of folding chairs that squeaked and scraped the floor as reporters leaned forward to hear the prosecution attorneys and their allied advisers were crammed together at one table a lopsided stacking of cards against the defense lawyer and his one assistant who sat by themselves at another along the wall female soviet soldiers made transcripts with steno machines handing them to two civilian girls for translation the trial was in german but the judges three senior officers shuffling papers and trying not to look bored evidently understood only a little so the lawyers also in uniform occasionally switched to russian afraid to let their points drift away to the steno keys unheard there was a heavy chair for witnesses a soviet flag and not much else it was the format of an inquisition starker even than the roughandready frontier courtrooms of karl may not a robe in sight people were frisked at the door renate stood behind a cagelike railing of new plywood next to the bench facing the room as if her expression during the testimony would be recorded as a kind of evidence behind her stood two soldiers with machine guns gazing stolidly at her back bernie said she had changed but she was recognizably the samethinner with the hollowedout look you saw everywhere in berlin but still renate only her dark hair was different cropped close and turned a premature indeterminate pale she was dressed in a loose gray prison shift belted her collarbones sticking out and the face he remembered as pretty and animated seemed rearrangedbeaten perhaps or somehow disfigured by her life but there were the eyes sharp and knowing glancing defiantly around the crowd as if she were even now looking for news items the same way jake thought she must have hunted for jews she spotted him instantly raising her eyebrows in surprise then dropping them in bewilderment a friend sitting at the table of her accusers did she think he was there to testify against her what would he have said a girl with a quick smile who liked to take chances bold enough to cadge a cigarette from a nazi on a train platform a sharp eye trained for snatching prey in the street how could she have done it but that was always the questionhow could any of them have done it he wanted suddenly to signal some absurd reassurance i remember who you were not a monster not then how can i judge but who could three russian soldiers on a makeshift platform whose fleshy faces seemed to ask no questions at all they were only minutes into the trial before jake realized they hadnt come to establish guilt just the sentence and was there any doubt the germans had kept records of her activity more columns of numbers as the prosecution read out its indictments jake watched her lower her head as if she too were overwhelmed by the sweep of it all the snatches one by one until finally there were enough to fill boxcars so many had she known them all or just guessed smelling fear when it walked into one of her cafes each number a facetoface moment real to her not anonymous like a pilot opening the bomb bay the method was as bernie had describedthe sighting the hurried call the nod of her head to make the arrest her colleagues bundling people into cars as she walked away why hadnt she kept walking instead shed gone back to the collection center her room there its own kind of short leash but still not a prison why not just keep walking away gunther had moved his wife fourteen times but he had had papers and friends prepared to help no uboat could survive alone where after all would she have gone the russian prosecutor then switched oddly to a detailed account of renates own capture the manhunt that finally ran her to ground in a basement in wedding for a moment jake thought the soviets were simply congratulating themselves for the press now busily taking notes then he noticed bernie in a lawyers huddle heard gunther mentioned by name as the hunter and saw that it was something morethe old das ploy establishing your witness the good guy in the neat jacket and tie he neednt have bothered the story with its breathless chase seemed lost on the first judge who shifted in his seat and lit a cigarette the russian next to him leaned over and whispered the judge annoyed put it out and gazed at the window where a standing fan was lazily moving the stuffy air apparently an unexpected western custom jake wondered how long it would take to call a recess hed assumed from the buildup that gunther would be the star witness who else was there the records supplied the mechanics of the crime but its victims were dead no longer able to accuse gunther had actually seen her do it and a da always started with the police to weight his case at the beginning the first person called however was a frau gersh a more theatrical choice a frail woman who had to be helped to the witness chair on crutches the prosecutor began solicitously with her feet from frostbite on the death march she said halting but matteroffact they made us leave the camp so the russians wouldnt find out we had to walk in the snow if you fell they shot you but you were fortunate no i fell they shot me here she said pointing to her hip they thought i was dead so they left me but i couldnt move in the snow so the feet she spoke simply her voice low so that chairs creaked as people strained forward to hear then she looked over at renate the camp where she sent me she said louder spitting it out i didnt know renate said shaking her head i didnt know the judge glared at her startled to hear her speak but unsure what to do about it no one seemed to know what the rules were supposed to be least of all the defense attorney who could only silence her with a wave of his hand and nod at the judge an uneasy apology she did the woman said forceful now she knew frau gersh the prosecutor said deliberately as if the outburst hadnt happened do you recognize the prisoner of course the greifer she was known to you personally no but i know that face she came for me with the men that was the first time you saw her no she talked to me at the shoe repair i should have known but i didnt then that same afternoon the shoe repair one of the judges said confusing the past with the crutches now on display one of her contacts the prosecutor said people in hiding wore out their shoesfrom all the walking to keep moving so fraulein naumann made friends with the shoe men whos been in today any strangers she found many this way this particular shop he made a show of checking his notes in schoneberg hauptstrasse thats correct yes hauptstrasse frau gersh said jake looked at renate clever if thats what you were after collecting items from cobblers all her newsgathering tricks offered to murderers so she talked to you there yes you know the weather the raids just to talk i didnt like iti had to be carefulso i left and went home no i had to be careful i walked to viktoria park then here and there but when i got back she was there with the men the othersgood german people helping mewere already gone she sent them away too i must point out the defense lawyer said that at this time it was against the law for german citizens to hide jews this was an illegal act the judge looked at him amazed we are not interested in german law he said finally are you suggesting that fraulein naumann acted correctly im suggesting that she acted legally he looked down at the time go on the judge said to the prosecutor finish it you were taken away then on what charge charge i was a jew how did fraulein naumann know this you hadnt told her frau gersh shrugged she said she could always tell i have papers i said no she told them shes a jew and of course they listened to her she worked for them the prosecutor turned to renate did you say this she was a jew you could tell how the look she had what kind of look was that renate lowered her eyes a jewish look may i ask the prisonersuch a skillwere you ever mistaken renate looked at him directly no never i always knew jake sat back feeling sick proud of it his old friend continue frau gersh you were taken where the jewish old age home grosse hamburger strasse a precise detail coached and what happened there we were held until they had enough to fill a truck then to the train then east she said her voice dropping to the camp the prosecutor finished yes to the camp to the gas i was healthy so i worked the others she broke off then looked again at renate the others you sent were killed i didnt send them i didnt know renate said this time the judge held up his hand to silence her you saw you saw the woman shouted frau gersh the prosecutor said his calm voice a substitute for a gavel can you positively identify the prisoner as the woman who came to your house to arrest you yes positive bernie leaned over in another huddle and did you see her again jake glanced at the prosecutor wondering where he was heading yes from the truck she was watching us from her window when they took us away watching an echo of the story from bernie a shoe shop in schoneberg the american sector so bernie had found her another gift to the russians the same woman youre positive now the woman was shaking slipping out of control the same the same she started to rise from the chair staring at renate a jew killing your own you watched them take us away the beginning of a sob no longer in court your own people animal eating your own like an animal no renate shouted back the judge slapped the desk with his palm and said something in russian presumably calling a recess but the prosecutor hurried up to the bench and began whispering the judge nodded slightly taken aback then said formally to the room we will stop for fifteen minutes but first the photographers will be allowed in the prisoner will remain standing jake followed the prosecutors signal to the back of the room where ron appeared from the press section opening the door to let the photographers in a small group filed down the center of the room flashing lights went off in renates face causing her to blink and turn shaking her head as if they were flies the judges sat erect posing a soldier helped frau gersh onto her crutches for a second jake expected to see liz snapping history then the flashbulbs died out and the judge stood fifteen minutes he said already lighting a cigarette in the corridor outside the crowd of reporters had to press against the wall to let frau gersh pass on her crutches evidently there would be no crossexamination brian stanley was standing off to one side drinking from a pocket flask not up to moscow standards is it he offered jake a drink not the same without the confessions thats what they likeall that bloody handwringing of course theyve got a lot to confess the russians have its a farce jake said watching frau gersh leave course it is cant expect the old bailey here he looked down at his bottle still not the nicest girl in berlin is she she used to be nice brian looked at him confused unaware of the connection yes well he said at a loss then slowly shook his head never mistaken brought out the best in everybody didnt it by the way i found you a boat a boat you asked about a boat didnt you anyway theyve got a few still over at the yacht club just mention my name he looked up you did ask the afternoon hed promised lena sailing on the lake away from everything yes sorry i forgot thanks mind you dont sink it theyll make me pay is that a drink benson said appearing with ron it was brian said handing him the flask what are you doing here benson said to jake then turned to ron and you promised stars and stripes exclusive dont look at me how did you get in he said to jake they said no more passes im helping the prosecution she used to be a friend of mine an embarrassed silence christ ron said finally you always turn up one way or the other dont you can you get me an interview i can request one so far nothing she hasnt been in a talking mood i mean what do you say after that what can you i dont know maybe shell say it to me youd have to share ron said working everybody wants this story fine just get me in he looked at benson that was a good piece on liz she would have liked it thanks benson said a little uncomfortable with the compliment hell of a thing i hear the boyfriends all right though he got out this morning jakes head snapped up what yesterday he couldnt have visitors and todays he out of there how did that happen what i hear is hes got friends in congress benson said trying to make a joke who the hell wants to stay in the infirmary they kill more than they cure anyway hes sitting pretty got a nurse in his billet and everything whats it to you jake turned to ron still agitated did you know about this what are you talking about i told you he said grabbing rons arm she took a bullet for himsomebody wants him dead are there guards whos with him in the billet what do you mean took a bullet benson said but ron was moving jakes hand away staring the us army ron said to jake thats who pull fucking guard duty yourself if it makes you so nervous whats wrong benson said nothing ron said geismars been seeing things thats all maybe you ought to check into the infirmary yourself have them give you a onceover youre not making a lot of sense these days theres someone there all the time uhhuh ron said still looking at him no russians allowed ever so i can see him thats up to you he isnt going anyplace why dont you take him some flowers and see what it does for you christ geismar he glanced toward the crowd shuffling back into the courtroom theres the bell you coming or do you want to run right over and play nurse he said then looked at jake seriously i dont know what this is all about but you dont have to worry about him hes as safe as you are he nodded at the russians by the door maybe safer i didnt know you and shaeffer were friends benson said still curious geismars got friends stashed all over berlin havent you ron said beginning to move how do you know this one by the way he said jerking his thumb toward the court she was a reporter jake said just like the rest of us i trained her ron stopped and turned that must give you something to think about he said then followed benson through the door bernie was standing at the end of the table with gunther but came over as jake took his seat the judges were just returning walking in single file so he said to jake how do you think its going so far jesus bernie crutches bernies face grew tight the crutches are real so was the gas why not just take her out and shoot her because we want it on the recordhow they did it people should know jake nodded so shes what a standin no shes the real thing no different from otto klopfer no different he took in jakes blank expression the guy who wanted the exhaust pipe fixed or maybe you forgot already people do he looked back to the press section a restless scraping of chairs maybe theyll listen this time they made her do it you know that thats what otto says too all of them you believe it jake looked up sometimes which gets you where everybodys got a sad story and the ends always the same one thing i learned as a dayou start feeling sorry for people you never get a conviction dont waste your sympathy shes guilty as hell the prosecutor began by calling gunther to the stand but before he could take the chair the defense attorney jumped up stirred finally to some activity may i address the court what is the purpose of these witnesses this emotionalism the nature of the prisoners work is not in ques tion here she herself has described it for the court he held up a transcript work i would add that she performed under the threat of her own death she has also let us remember helped us identify her employers given her full cooperation so that the soviet people can bring the real fascists to justice and what is her reward this we have here a matter for the soviet people to decide not the western press i ask that we dispense with these theatrics and proceed with the serious business of this court this was so clearly unexpected that for an instant the judges just sat expressionless then they turned to each other what they asked however was that he repeat his statement in russian and jake wondered again how much of the trial they really understood renate stood impassively as the pleas rolled out again in russian her full cooperation beaten out of her or had she sat down willingly and filled sheets with names a new assignment catching the catchers when the lawyer finished the judge dismissed him with a scowl sit down he said then looked at gunther proceed the lawyer lowered his head a schoolboy reprimanded for speaking out of turn and jake saw that he had missed the point the business of the court was the theater what happens when its over the summer after the war not clearing the rubble not the shuffling dpsperipheral stories what happened was this season of denunciations personal reprisals all the impossible moral reparations tribunals shaved heads pointed fingersauto da fes to purge the soul everyone like gunther would have his reckoning they started his testimony carefully a slow recitation of the years of police service his voice a calm monotone a return to order after frau gershs crying bernie knew his audience you could soften them with crutches but in the end they would respond to this the sober reassurance of authority the judges were listening politely as if ironically they had finally recognized one of their own and would it be fair to say that these years of training had made you a good observer i have a policemans eye yes describe for us then what you saw that day at the he broke off to check his notes cafe heil olivaerplatz down the street from lenas flat where the world had gone on around them the cafe was familiar to you no thats why i paid particular attention to see if it was safe for your wife you mean yes formarthe she was in hiding at that time she had to walk during the day so the landlady would think she was at work public places where people wouldnt take notice zoo station for instance tiergarten and you met her during these walks twice a week tuesdays and fridays gunther said precise to make sure she was all right give her a meal i had coupons every week for years waiting for a tap on the shoulder and this was where usually aschingers by friedrichstrasse station it was always crowded there the big cafeteria where jake had often gone himself grabbing a bite on his way to the broadcast jake saw them pretending to meet jostled by the lunch crowd at the standup tables eating blueplate specials but it was important to change places her face would become familiar so that day olivaerplatz this was in march seventh onethirty what is the importance of this the defense attorney said standing sit down the judge said waving his hand the big roundups had started in two years of fading into crowds your memory is excellent herr behn the prosecutor said please tell us the rest gunther glanced toward bernie who nodded i arrived first as always to make sure the prisoner was there in the back with coffee a newspaperordinary then marthe came she asked me if the chair was free a pretense you see so we would not seem to be together i noticed the prisoner looking at us and i thought perhaps we should go but she went back to her paper nothing wrong so we ordered the coffee another look i thought you know she was looking at me perhaps she was someone i had arrestedthis happened sometimesbut no just a busybody then she went to the toilet there is a phone therei checked laterso that was when she called her friends and did she come back yes she finished her coffee then she paid the bill and walked right past us to the door thats when they came for marthe two of them in those leather coats who else had leather coats in fortyfour so i knew excuse me herr behn you know for a fact the prisoner called them how is that gunther looked down because marthe talked to her a foolish slip after being so careful but what difference did it make in the end she talked to her she knew her from school schoolgirls renate is it really you she said just like that so surprised to see her marthe must have thought she was in hiding too another uboat so many years marthe said and just the same foolish and did fraulein naumann recognize her oh yes she knew youre mistaken she said and of course that was right marthe shouldnt have said anything it was dangerous to be recognized they tortured the uboats sometimes to find the others to get names but she knew he stopped his eyes moving away then began to talk more quickly wanting it over she tried to leave then of course but they came the coats so she couldnt get out and thats when i saw they looked at her one of them first around the room searching then at her to tell them she could have said shes gone she just left she could have saved her her old school friend but no thats the one she says shes a jew so they grabbed marthe renate she said thats all the name but the greifer wouldnt look at her and you the lawyer said in the quiet room what did you do of course people were looking then what is this i said theres some mistake and they said to her the greifer him too and she had no idea who i was you see so they were ready to take me too but then marthe saved me hes nobody she said we were just sharing the table nobody and she moved away with them so they wouldnt even think about it quietly you know no commotion not even another look to give me away jake sat up his mind darting of course if you didnt know your victim someone had to point him out mistakes could be made a crowded cafe a crowded market square but nobody had been there to save liz herr behn im sorry to ask again so theres no confusionyou state positively that you saw and heard the accused identify your wife for deportation a woman known to her there is no doubt no doubt i saw it he looked at renate she sent her to her death no renate said quietly they said a labor camp to her death gunther said then looked back to the prosecutor and she went with them in the car the same car all the greifers together i didnt want to renate said a stray detail thank you herr behn the lawyer said dismissing him and thendo you know what gunther said bernie raised his head surprised something outside the script what the lawyer said uncertainly you want to know what it was like those days the waitress came over are you paying for both she said you ordered two coffees he stopped so i paid the end of the column his final point thank you herr behn the lawyer said again the defense attorney rose a question herr behn were you a member of the national socialist party yes let it be entered that the witness is an admitted fascist all policemen were required to join the party the prosecutor said this is irrelevant i suggest that this testimony is biased the defense attorney said a nazi official who enforced the criminal laws of the fascist regime who testifies for personal reasons this is absurd the prosecutor said the testimony is the truth ask her he pointed to renate now both lawyers were standing what formal procedures there had been slipping away in a crossfire that darted from lawyer to witness to accused were you at the cafe heil did you report marthe behn did you identify her answer yes renate said not a stranger a woman you knew the prosecutor said his voice rising i had to she looked down you dont understand i needed one more that week the quota there were not so many left then i needed one more jake felt his stomach move a number to fill the truck to save yourself not for myself she said shaking her head not for myself fraulein naumann the defense said formal again please tell the court who was also being held in custody in grosse hamburger strasse my mother under what conditions she was kept there so that i would come back in the evening when my work was finished she said resigned now aware that it wouldnt matter but she had lifted her head and was looking at jake the way a public speaker pinpoints a face in an audience talking only to him a private explanation the interview they probably would never have they knew i wouldnt leave her we were taken together first to work at siemenstadt slaves then when the deportations started they told me they would keep her name off the list if i worked for them so many every week i couldnt send her east so you sent other jews the prosecutor said but then there were not so many left she said still to jake towhat did you call them labor camps yes labor camps but she was an old woman i knew the conditions were hard to survive that but thats not all you did is it the prosecutor said pressing now your superiorhe glanced at a paperhans becker we have testimony that you were intimate with him were you intimate with him yes she said her eyes on jake that too and did he keep your mother off the list for your good efforts at first then he sent her to theresienstadt he said it was easier there she paused he ran out of names tell the court what happened to her there the defense said she died but you continued your work after that the prosecutor said you still came back every night didnt you by then where could i go the jews knew about mei couldnt hide with them there was no one except hans becker you continued your relations with him yes even after he deported your mother yes and you still say you were protecting her does it matter to you what i say she said wearily when its the truth yes the truth the truth is that he forced me over and over he liked that i kept my mother alive i kept myself alive i did what i had to do i thought theres nothing worse than this but it will end the russians will come not much longer then you came and hunted me down like a dog beckers girlfriend they called me girlfriend when he did that to me what is my crime that im still alive fraulein thats not the crime here no the punishment she said to jake still alive yes gunther said unexpectedly from the witness chair but not looking anywhere so that no one was sure what he meant the russian prosecutor cleared his throat im sure were all enlightened to hear that the nazis are to blame for everything fraulein a pity perhaps that you did their work so well i did what i had to do she said still staring until finally jake had to look away what did she expect him to say i forgive you are you finished with the witness the judge said restless one more question the defense said herr behn youre a large man strong you did not struggle with the men in the cafe with gestapo no no you saved yourself a pointed look at renate or to be exact your wife saved you i believe thats what you said yes she saved me it was too late for her once they knew and after this you remained on the police force yes enforcing the laws of the government that had arrested your wife the racial laws were not our responsibility i see some of the laws then not all but you made arrests of criminals yes and they were sent where to prison so late in the war most were sent to labor camps werent they gunther said nothing tell us how did you decide which laws to enforce for the national socialists decide it wasnt for me to decide i was a policeman i had no choice i see so only fraulein naumann had this choice i object the prosecutor said this is nonsense the situations were not at all similar what is the defense trying to suggest that this testimony is compromised from start to finish this is a personal grievance not soviet justice you hold this woman accountable for the crimes of the nazis she had no choice listen to your own witness no one had a choice the only possible defense left everyone was guilty no one was guilty she had a choice gunther said his voice thick the defense nodded pleased with himself finally where he wanted to be did you dont answer the prosecutor said quickly but gunther raised his head unflinchinga moment hed expected even if bernie hadnt the other reckoning not to be put off even by a bottle to blot himself out he gazed straight ahead eyes stone yes i had a choice and i worked for them too he said his voice as firm and steady as the hand on the razor her murderers even after that the room suddenly embarrassed was silent not the answer any of them had wanted a little death pulled out of him like lizs gasp one cut he turned to renate we all did he said his voice lower now but youyou could have looked away your friend just the once at this she did look away facing the stenographers so that her words were almost lost i needed one more she said as if it answered everything one more another awkward silence in the room broken finally by the judge the witness is not on trial here he said are you disputing what he saw the defense shook his head as eager as everyone else now to move on good then youre finished the judge said to gunther step down he glanced at his wristwatch we will meet tomorrow but we have other witnesses the prosecutor said anxious not to let his momentum stall then call them tomorrow its enough for today and next time stick to the facts which were what jake wondered another column of numbers when no one moved the judge waved his hand at the room adjourned adjourned he said irritably then rose motioning for the other two to follow jake heard the sound of chairs being moved a low buzz lawyers gathering papers gunther stayed in his chair still looking straight ahead the guards surprised by the abrupt dismissal nudged renate away from her railing and began to lead her at gunpoint out of the room jake watched her pass in front of the bench her eyes meeting his as she approached the prosecution table she stopped so its really you she said to him her old voice you came back the guards not sure whether she was allowed to speak looked around for instructions but the judges had gone the room emptying with them jake nodded not knowing what to say its good to see you again collarbones sticking out it wasnt for myself she said to jake her eyes on him waiting jake looked down unable to respond bernie was watching from the side waiting too but what could anyone say a guard took her arm in a minute shed be gone one word something he fell back on the empty courtesy of a prison visit can i get you anything she looked at him for another moment disappointed then shook her head more russian insistent now the guards pushed her away from the table jake stayed until the room was almost cleared just a hum coming in from the hall gunther was still in his chair when bernie went over to get him he looked up once then brushed him aside getting up stiffly and walked toward jake one deliberate foot in front of the other ill give you a lift bernie said but gunther ignored him he stopped for a second at the table ill talk to willi he said to jake then kept walking out of the room bernie disconcerted went over and began putting files back in his briefcase what about you he said jake looked up i have the jeep he stood up to leave then turned still think all the stories end the same way he said bernie shoved the last file in the case marthe behns did contents previous chapter next chapter chapter twelve outside jake avoided the alex where everyone had parked and took one of the side streets instead too numb to face ron and the others swapping notes gunther had already disappeared somewhere in the rubble a walk anything to get away but the courtroom followed him a dead hand on his shoulder what happens when its over he looked around no one in the street not even the usual children climbing over bricks the raids had done their worst herenot a wall standing the air still thick with sour dust flies buzzed over a deep bomb crater now a gray pond of sewage from a broken main but poison had been seeping into berlin for years when had hans becker told renate about her mother while they were in bed always something worse even when it was ordinary a waitress collecting her check knowing what it was like day after day for the first time jake wondered if breimer might be right if this wasteland was what they deserved some biblical retribution to wipe out the poison once and for all but here it still was a giant hole filling with sludge uri the russian startled him coming out of nowhere uri the soldier said again pointing to jakes arm no watch the russian scowled ja uri he said pointing to the old bulova on jakes wrist he pulled a wad of bills from his pocket and held them out no now piss off a hard stare menacing so that suddenly jake felt his blood jump a spurt of fear a deserted street it could be this easy capricious like shooting at rats another incident but the russian was turning away disgruntled stuffing the notes back in his pocket as jake watched him go breathing again the street felt even emptier no market crowds here if gunther was right if hed been the target they could pick him off easily now not even a witness if they wanted him he stood still for a moment back in potsdam a shell game of a crime knowing the killer but not the victim three of them what if it had been him he moved his hand to his hip an involuntary reflex wishing he had a gun not that it had done liz any good he stopped but she hadnt been wearing it that day her cowgirl holster where was it on the way back to webster groves he tried to remember ron in her room folding clothes no gun did it matter but something unexplained he looked at the pond unsettled follow the points you play a shell game by elimination three of them in the market usually the one intended but why would anyone want to kill liz which left two one of them now ready for visitors in gelferstrasse he turned and started back up the street hand still on his hip when he reached the jeep another russian reading a newspaper glanced up at him uneasily and moved away as if he were in fact carrying a gun he found breimer reading what seemed to be the same paper at shaeffers billet a villa across the street from the collapsed house an army nurse was flicking through life half listening as breimer read snatches out loud apparently unable to stop talking even outside a sickroom door two thousand times more than the townbuster that was the biggest we had two thousand times he looked up as jake walked in ah good hes been asking for you well its a great day isnt it it wont be long now when jake said nothing confused he handed him the paper i see you havent heard he said and you call yourself a newspaperman well all be going home after this twenty thousands tons of tnt size of a fist hard to imagine jake took the paper stars and stripes us reveals atom bomb used first time on japs the other war almost forgotten a city hed never heard of two square miles wiped out in one blast the mess behind the alex a warmup by comparison its over now for sure breimer said but what jake saw was the russians face by the jeep uneasy how does it work he said scanning the page a chart of the other bombs getting bigger toward the bottom youll have to ask the eggheads that all i know is it did they say you still cant see through the smoke two days no wonder old harry was playing hardball with the reds you have to hand it to himhe sure kept this one close to the vest jaunty in a doublebreasted suit on the cecilienhof terrace smiling for lizs camera with an ace up his sleeve yes sir a great day breimer said still excited when i think of all those boyscoming home theyll all be coming home now in one piece too thank the lord jake looked at the fleshy face moving into another kiwanis speech but wasnt it true who would wish a single marine dead on a honshu beach on okinawa theyd had to drag the japs out of caves with flamethrowers one by one still something new worse than before breimer was starting in again hows the patient jake said interrupting on the mend on the mend breimer said thanks to corporal kelly here too pretty to be a nurse if you ask me but you should see her make them hop to no monkey business with this one not with a hypodermic in your hand anyway she said dryly but her plain face was smiling flattered can i see him joe would want to see him breimer said to the nurse clearly in charge he put his hand on jakes shoulder thats a hell of a thing you did getting him out of there were all grateful i can tell you that we who we everybody breimer said dropping the hand americans thats an important boy weve got in there one of the best you dont want the russkies getting their hands on him hes not a favorite of theirs breimer took this as a joke and smiled not exactly not joe he lowered his voice shame about the girl yes jake moved to the door shes on duty when he said nodding toward the nurse twice a day make sure everythings all right i come when i can of course least i can do joes been a real help to me can you get someone round the clock use some pull there ought to be someone here breimer smiled now dont get all excited hes not that sick main troubles keeping him in bed wants to do things too soon the russians took a shot at him once they can do it again jake spread his hand toward the front door wide open to the street breimer looked at him troubled they said it was an accident they werent there i was id get somebody just in case maybe youre a little jumpy were not in the russian zone here congressman the whole citys a russian zone you want to take the chance breimer met his eyes all business now let me see what i can do not even a quibble armed jake said then opened the door shaeffer was propped up in bed barechested with a wad of gauze and adhesive tape covering one side theyd given him a haircut in the hospital and now with his ears sticking out he seemed ten years younger no longer a poster aryan smaller out of uniform like a high school athlete without the shoulder pads he was reading the newspaper too but dropped it on the sheet when jake came in well finally i was hoping youd come i wanted to thank save it jake said easily casing the room ground floor an open window facing the bed the room had been a library a few books were still leaning on their sides on the shelves evidently not worth ransacking you should have stayed in the hospital oh im all right shaeffer said cheerful taking it for medical concern you hang around there long enough some sawbones wants to take a leg off you know the army i mean its safer any rooms upstairs he walked over to the window and looked out safer i asked breimer to get a guard out front what for you tell me tell you what why the russians took a potshot at you at me the congressman seemed to think they dont like you very much breimer he sees russians in his dreams yeah well i saw them in potsdam shootingat you now suppose you tell me why theyd want to do that he pulled up a chair next to the bed i havent the faintest idea jake said nothing staring at him from the chair finally shaeffer restless looked away got a smoke he said the nurse took mine says ill live longer not the way youre going jake said lighting the cigarette and handing it to him still staring look i owe you something i guess but i dont owe you a story i cant the works classified i dont have any notebooks out this ones for me not the papers you almost got me killed out there too i figure im entitled to know why now how about it shaeffer took another drag following the smoke up with his eyes as if he were leaving the room with it you know fiat no field information agency technical fancy way of saying we take care of the scientists debriefing detention centers whatever like kransberg jake said shaeffer nodded like kransberg and whats the whatever finding them in the first place its possible we set up a team to cover berlin its possible the russians dont like that why theyve been here since may whats left shaeffer smiled expansive plenty the russians were so busy shipping out the hardware it took them a little while to realize they needed the guys who ran it by that time a lot of them had disappearedgone west maybe into hiding the russians have a hard time recruiting people arent falling over themselves to travel east not when they can get a fat contract from american dye jake said nodding to the door shaeffer looked at him then stubbed out the cigarette dont push me hes out of it or we stop here understood i hear you anyway thats not it the russians have been offering good salaries too if you want to go to work in the fucking urals instead of beautiful utica shaeffer looked again i mean it jake held up his hand okay they dont go to utica no they dont dayton since you want to know theres a facility near wright field he stopped aware that hed given something for free then shrugged the first group goes to dayton if we can get them over satisfied i dont care one way or the other whats the holdup denazification those guyswed be lucky to get ike cleared they want the good germans so find me one you dont think the russians give a rats ass jake got up and walked toward the shelf but they do about youassuming your team exists assuming been doing anything you shouldnt from their point of view winning the russians have been here two months and theyre still going through their wanted list weve been here three weeks and were picking it clean once you start one leads you to another theyve been waiting for us to come just holding on luftwaffethe whole aeromedical staff they even kept the research papers kwistill a lot of warm bodies over there if you can dig them out its not hardtheir friends help theyre around all right out for a stroll walking the dog engineers at zeiss jake said thats in the eastern zone we dont go into the eastern zone thats not what the russians say they like to make a stink what i hear is the engineers wanted to come they just needed a helping hand shaeffers eyes followed him to the bookshelf then looked away its possible their bombsight optics were years ahead of ours years aheadworth a risk to get its possible someone wanted to send the russians a message they have this habit of kidnapping people maybe we wanted to show them we could do it too make them think twice next time and did it more or less nobodys gone missing lately anyway except emil brandt yes except emil so now hes on your list hes on everybodys list he did all the calculationshe knows the whole program i told you we dont want to lose this one not now for sure jake raised his eyebrows why not now the rocket team schaeffer picked up the newspaper can you imagine if the vs had carried one of these babies no i cant jake said london gone theyre everybodys top pick shaeffer said but we got them and were going to keep them all of them what if they dont want to go they do even brandt he just wants to take his wife always the wife we almost lost him once after nordhausen we get the rockets the blueprints the teams stashed away in oberjoch and he gives the slip and takes off for berlin on some fucking wild goose chase he was lucky to get out alive with his files jake said casually a shot shaeffer waved his hand admin not worth a damn thing all the tech files were at nordhausen that was just an excuse to get his wife admin i thought they were ss files it was an ss program they took it over by that time they were taking over everything for what it was worth they gave him a medal they gave everybody a medal the scientists werent too thrilled about the ss taking over not the coziest guys you could think of but what the hell who gets to pick his boss so they hand out some medals and its smiles again they had a ton of them a floor in the chancellery heaped with iron crosses finally we get them to kransberg shaeffer was saying keep them together see and he does it again the others we tell them the dependentsll come later and they dont like it much but this one no he has to go shack up with her somewhere have a little reunion as if we dont have enough to do go chasing her now and were shorthanded as it is and now this he gestured to his wound hes not with his wife jake said she doesnt know where he is shaeffer looked at him not saying anything for a moment then he took another cigarette from the pack on the bed still buying time thanks for saving me the legwork he said calmly want to tell me where she is no in our zone jake nodded she doesnt know anything well thats a relief anyway what is where she is what do you thinks been keeping me up nights what if the russians get her first thatd be an offer we couldnt compete with wed lose him for sure bait jake looked out the window feeling another jump of blood as if the soldier behind the alex had appeared again shed be better off with us you know shaeffer said still calm shes all right where she is but was she the russian had asked for her want to tell me how you found her shaeffer said watching him we tried everything no fragebogen no neighbors nothing you might have tried his father why didnt you by the way his father shaeffer said surprised his fathers dead whered you get that idea brandt told me so himself im the one who debriefed him you never mentioned that you didnt ask shaeffer said moving a checker into place well hes alive i saw him why would emil say that shaeffer shrugged why didnt you tell me where his wife was people like to keep a little something back question of trust maybe he know anything no he hasnt seen him either nobody has nobody since tully but youre not interested in him shaeffer looked down smoothing out the sheet look lets smoke a little pipe here since youve got your nose under the tent i could use the help doing what what youve been doing we still have to find him im out of commission youre not no thanks to you lets start with tully and see how we do they were friends at kransberg well friends brandt spoke english and tully liked to listen latenight stuff brandt was the moody type depressed how everything had gone wrong you know booze talk tully told you this well its possible the rooms were bugged so we could hear what the guests had to say nice the nazis put the taps in we just took them over when we moved in some difference i dont think you understand how it is there the scientists are bargaining they want to make sure theres work some deal to get them out so they dont give everything all at once a little at a time to keep us interested they check with von braun before they tell us anything i dont blame themtheyre just looking out for number one but weve got to know not just whats on paperwhats up here he tapped his temple all right so theyre pals and brandt waltzes out of there and tully drives him and no one tells us so that by the time we do hear about it hes mr innocent and brandts gone and still nobodys making the right connection which is they think its a fuckup brandt cons tully into giving him a pass just a nice guy and you dont think so i dont believe in the easter bunny either i checked the guys an operator you know he was selling releases to germans i heard a real piece of work twice sometimesthats how it came out but they couldnt prove it his word against theirs a bunch of germans squealing whos got time to investigate that but brandt thats something else i get interested and heres the thingit was tullys idea skipping out so i figure hes up to his old tricks tullysidea nobody thinks to check the taps shaeffer said we only make transcripts when the guests are talking science the rest of the time our guys are reading a comic or taking a leak or something so i get the monitor for that night and ask him what they were talking about nothing he says personal stuff like what nothing tully just told him theyd found his wife nothing he said sarcastically but they hadnt no but i didnt know that then what i knew was that tullyd got himself a paying customer the one thing brandt wanted so i figure they negotiate a little private business brandt never made any noises about leaving before he doesnt clear it with von braunhe just goes tully even drives him out so when i hear that i blow some whistles to yank tully in but by that time hes gone too to berlin why payday probably they didnt have money at kransberg i figured brandt got the cash from his wife but he never found her then tully had one pissedoff german on his hands no jake said shaking his head thinking they didnt meet up again in berlin why would tully want to do that if hed lied about the wife well i didnt know he had see i told you we could use you he leaned back turning it over but he came anything in the taps about friends in berlin tully know anybody here shaeffer glanced up at him he knew emil brandt you trying to say emil killed him im trying to say i dont care i just want him back tullys not important he was important enough to shoot him maybe he just got in the way shaeffer said irritably adjusting his bandage maybe jake said like a girl taking pictures be useful to know not anymore shaeffer said wincing now distracted by the bandage all i know is he was going to lead me to brandt and he didnt he looked up glad to hear about the wife though thats something at least the bastard didnt get paid no he got paid jake looked again out the window another jolt with russian money yeah i guess shaeffer said meaning the bullet what is it he said following jakes stare nothing just thinking move her he picked up his cap id better go you want the nurse for that he nodded at the bandage just thinking huh shaeffer said studying him then his face hardened back in the poster dont think too much i want him back i dont care what he did if he did you just find him he said evenly then smiled christ the wife we could make a good team the two of us jake shook his head people get shot around you he looked out the window again what if the russians already have him then id want to know that too where so you can organize another raiding party the russians wouldnt like that so what you might not be so lucky next time liz wont be there to take one for you shaeffer glared at him thats a hell of a thing to say all right skip it he looked down i liked liz she was a good egg a kid in a soda fountain booth all right jake said again an apology youve got some fucking nerve anyway what makes you so sure it was me you cant tell anything with the russians how did they even know id be there tell me that why were you shopping in the russian zonenot the smartest idea in your line of work that was liz she wanted a camera i figured why not how would they know how did they know maybe a greifer spotted you whats that a kraut word sort of a lookout scout jake started for the door then turned a greifer the name sikorsky mean anything to you vassily thats right he was in the market that day would he know you by sight shaeffer looked away silent jake nodded make sure breimer gets the guard dont worry i can take care of myself he pulled a gun out from under the sheet and patted it jake stood still for a second just a casual extension of his hand like a fielders mitt you always keep one in bed or just lately he reached for the doorknob better stay away from the window shaeffer aimed the gun there target practice a colt will stop anything at this range jake looked over at him a colt stopped tully too shaeffer turned frowning still holding the gun says who the ballistics report so its a standardissue piece of equipment there are only about a million of them around not in german hands or do you think tully gave him one with the pass whats that supposed to mean that emil didnt do it not with one of those shaeffer glanced up then smirked thats right i remember you think i did where were you and breimer on the night of whatever the fuck it was july sixteenth jake said and where were you shaeffer lowered the gun go fuck yourself he put it back under the covers you dont listen im the only one who wanted him alive he was going to lead me to brandt remember he stared at jake for another second then let it pass shaking his head youve got a funny way of making friends are we im still trying to figure that one another sharp look just find him shaeffer sank back against the pillows with a grunt forcing a smile youre all alike you guys smart talk always something smart he looked up his eyes steel again aryan gray just dont forget whose uniform youve got on were on the same team over here the same team is that the same one liz was on yeah well he said looking down things happen dont they wartime were not at war with the russians shaeffer looked over at the newspaper with its black headline then raised his head says who afternoon light was streaming into the flat but hannelore was already putting on lipstick to go out a little early isnt it jake said watching her lean into the mirror its a tea party its supposed to be early a jause no a russian tea party he said amused a table of stolid commissars with the mad hatter pouring out no my new friend a tommy a real tea party he said you know like before with cups and everything spiked followed by another party on the couch she blotted her lips you just missed lena shes at frau hinkels you should go too you cant imagine what she knows she went to a fortuneteller its not like that not a gypsy she knows things she really does jake looked out the window toward wittenbergplatz searching the street windows fronting the square exposed the wonderful light suddenly a liability hannelore have you noticed anyone hanging around outside a russian dont be silly she said gathering her purse he went back hes not looking for me no i meant he said then stopped why would hannelore notice anything come on ill show you she said its behind kadewe he locked the door behind them and followed her down the stairs your friends he said anyone know about another flat she turned stung you want me to leave this is my flat you know mine just because im kindhearted no not for you for lena her own place its an inconvenience for you like this oh i dont mind really im used to it its cozy you know and youre so good about the food how would we eat and where would she go nobody has a flat unless unless what unless she has a friend you know important not like me he said smiling no a general maybe someone big thats who has flats and the whores a world of difference in her mind a work party was clearing one edge of wittenbergplatz women in army trousers loading carts in the hot sun everything smelled of smoke hes from london hannelore said as they crossed the street her high heels wobbling on the torn pavement would i like it there do you think i did well but its all the same now she spread her hand to take in the ruined square all like this not like this yes they said so on the radio during the war everything was bombed no just a few parts why would they lie about that she said sure of herself goebbels audience there she said when they reached kadewe in the next street theres a sign with a hand how do i look like an english lady yes she fluffed her hair looking in the shard of plate glass still there then waved him off oh you she said laughing and teetered away toward the west the sign was a crudely drawn palm with three lines sketched inpast running along the top present through the middle and a spur with future snaking across the heel how many wanted the upper part read now frau hinkel was on the second floor marked with a zodiac and he opened the door to a crowd of women sitting quietly in chairs like patients in a doctors waiting room berlin had become a medieval city again black markets to transmute watches into gold witches to glimpse the future in a pack of cards a few years ago they had measured the curve of light but what did it matter there was lena a surprised smile spreading across her face as he entered a woman happy to see you he thought like nothing else even better than good fortune jacob she said the others looked up at him frankly interested then lowered their eyes the familiar reaction to a uniform the woman next to lena moved making a place how did you know i was here hannelore i know its silly but she kept after me she said still smiling leaning close in a whisper away from the others whats wrong you look so he shook his head nothing just the day i went to a trial what trial but it was the smile he wanted not another terrible story not renate not gunther not any of them blue skies he glanced at his watch lets get out of here someone found me a boat its still lightwe could go for a sail a boat she said delighted then frowned oh but i cant were expecting some children at the nursery i have to help pastor fleischman dont be disappointed tomorrow all right look how dusty you are she said brushing his arm proprietary what just looking she flushed then busied herself again with his sleeve you should have a bath hannelores just gone out he said an invitation wed have the flat to ourselves ssh she glanced over at the others you could take one with me she stopped moving her hand and made a face mischievous darting her eyes to signal that they were being overheard he leaned closer whispering ill tell you your fortune a small laugh tickled by his breath in her ear yes she said then grinned all right ill come some other time its such a wait here but as they got up a small boy presumably a little hinkel darted behind the curtain into the other room and before they could reach the door frau hinkel herself appeared holding back the curtain and looking at jake come she said you jake looked at the line of customers embarrassed but no one said a word resigned to ceding place to soldiers lena pulled him toward the curtain eager the room like frau hinkel was plain and ordinaryno beads no turbans and crystal balls just a table with some chairs and a worn deck of cards the cards can tell us what is and what might be but not what will be do you understand she said as they sat a seers insurance policy but simply delivered her voice soft and comforting she held the deck out to lena to shuffle you go first lena said nervous not touching the cards i dont jake started but frau hinkel had put them in his hands an old deck slick with use the face cards looking like hohenzollerns when she started laying them out in rows he felt an unexpected prick of apprehension as if despite all reason they might actually reveal something he knew it was just theater a fairway con but he found himself wanting to hear good news whether it was real or not a fortune cookies message of happy journeys and long life cloudless but didnt everybody he thought of the tired faces outside all hoping for a lucky sign you have lucky cards frau hinkel said as if she had heard him you have been lucky in life absurdly he felt relieved but was anyone unlucky here for twentyfive marks yes its good because you have been close to death a safe guess after years of war he thought beginning to enjoy the act but protected here you see by a woman it seems he glanced up at her but she was laying out more cards covering the first set absorbed in them a woman lena said yes i think so but perhaps simply by this luck i cant tell a symbol now its the opposite she said staring at the fresh row now you are the protector a risk some danger but the luck is still there a house the newsreel lena said quietly there again the protector like a knight a sword perhaps a rescue you are a warrior she said easily the archaic word natural to her no then a judge the sword of a judge yes that must be it there is paper all around you lots of paper there you see lena said hes a writer frau hinkel pretended not to hear busy with the cards but its difficult for you the judge you see here the eyes face in two directions not just one so its difficult but you will she laid out another set you have interesting cards contradictions the paper keeps coming up the luck but also deception that explains the eyes looking both ways because there is deception around you speaking as if she were working it out for the first time what must have been a routine and always a woman strong at the center the restits hard to say but the woman is always there you keep coming back to her at the center may i see your hand she reached over and traced a line down his palm yes i thought so my god such a line in a man so deep you see how straight one your whole life you have a strong heart the rest contradictions but not the heart she looked up at him you must be careful when you judge the heart is so strong she turned to lena still holding his hand the woman who finds this one will be lucky one love no others her voice sentimental a professional after all lena smiled she laid out one more set lets see yes the same death again close still the luck but take care we have only what might be and deception again does it say who no but you will see the eyes face one way now you will see it jake shifted in his seat uncomfortable is there travel he said leading them back to the fortune cookie oh yes many trips offhand as if it were too obvious to bother about a trip on water soon another safe guess for an american home no short many trips you will never be home she said softly an abstraction always somewhere else but its not a sadness for you the place is not important you will always live here she tapped the heart line in his open palm so its a lucky life yes she said turning over the cards and handing them to lena to shuffle then mine will be lucky too lena said cheerful count on it jake wanted to say just pay the twentyfive marks but when frau hinkel laid out lenas set she looked at it for a moment puzzled then gathered up the cards again what does it say i cant tell sometimes when there are two of you it confuses the cards try again she handed the deck to lena they need to have your touch only jake watched her shuffling earnest the way hannelore must have listened to the radio yes now i see frau hinkel said laying down the rows a mothers cards very lovingso many hearts its important to you children yes two of them two yes two frau hinkel said sure not even looking up for confirmation jake glanced at lena wanting to wink but she had grown pale disconcerted two of everything frau hinkel said two men kings she looked up intimate there was another lena nodded frau hinkel took her hand just as she had jakes getting a second opinion yes there two two lines running there they cross each other lena said yes frau hinkel said then moved on not explaining but only one in the end one perhaps has died another safe guess for anyone in the waiting room no ah then you have decided she turned the hand to its side there are the children you see two she went back to another row of cards much sorrow she said shaking her head but happiness too there is an illness have you been ill yes but no longer you see this card it fights the illness the one with the sword jake said frau hinkel smiled pleasantly no this one it usually means medicine she looked up im glad for you so many these daysno medicine even in the cards another row you were in berlin during the war yes frau hinkel nodded her head destruction i see this all the time now well they dont lie the cards she placed down a black card then quickly drew out another to cover it what does that mean lena said alert frau hinkel looked at her in berlin it usually means a russian excuse me she said suddenly shy a shorthand message but that is the past see how they come now more hearts you have a kind nature you must not look at the past you see how it tries to come backsee this onebut never strong not as strong as the hearts you can bury it she said oddly you have the cards laying them on another row of red and now what will happen what might happen frau hinkel reminded her fixed on the cards still two decide on the man if you have done that then you will be at peace you have had sorrow in your life now i see she stopped scooping her cards together and when she began again her voice had become airier now truly the voice of a fortune cookie good health prosperity love given and received when lena gave her the money smiling frau hinkel patted her hand in a kind of benediction but as she opened the curtain for them it was jakes arm she took holding him back a moment she said waiting until lena was in the other room i dont like to say what will be its not my place what is it her cards are not good you cannot hide everything with hearts some trouble i tell you this because i see your cards mixed with hers if you are the protector protect her for a second flabbergasted jake didnt know whether to laugh or be furious was this how she got them all to come back time after time some worrying trick thoughts that go bump in the night a hausfrau with a waiting room full of anxious widows maybe shell meet a handsome stranger instead ill bet you see a lot of those in the cards she smiled weakly yes its true i know what you think she glanced toward the other room well whats the harm she turned to him again but whos to say sometimes its right sometimes the cards surprise even me fine ill keep an eye outlooking both ways as you wish she said dismissing him by turning her back what did she want lena said at the door nothing some american cigarettes they started down the stairs lena quiet well there goes fifty marks jake said but she knew things lena said how did she know what things what did she meanclose to death a woman who knows more mumbojumbo no i saw you look at her it meant something to you tell me she stopped at the doorway away from the glare of the street remember the girl in gelferstrasse at the billet she was killed the other day an accident i was standing next to her so i thought she meant that thats all an accident yes why didnt you tell me before i didnt want to worry you it was just an accident frau hinkel didnt think so well what does she know she knew about the children lena said looking down two yes two my russian child how could she know that she looked away upset a mothers cards and i killed it no hearts for that one come on lena he put his hand to her chin and lifted it its all foolishness you know that yes i know it was just the child i dont like to think about that to kill a child you didnt its not the same thing it feels the same sometimes i dream about it you know that its grown a boy stop jake said smoothing her hair she nodded into his hand i know only the future she raised her head as if she were physically pushing the mood away and took his hand in hers tracing the palm with her finger and thats me yes such a line in a man she said doing frau hinkels voice jake smiled they have to get something right or people wont come now how about the bath she turned his hand over to see his wristwatch oh but look now its late im sorry she leaned up and kissed him a peck i wont be long and what will you do she said as they started for the square im going to find us a new place to stay why hannelores not so bad i just think its a good idea why she stopped theres something else youre not telling me i dont want you to be bait anymore what about emil hannelores still there if he comes she looked up at him you mean you dont think hes coming tell me i think its possible the russians have him no i wont believe that she said so quickly that jake looked over at her disturbed two lines i said its possible the man who got him out of kransberg had russian money i think he was selling informationwhere emil was i dont want them getting to you russians she said to herself they want me they want emil youre his wife they think i would go with them never they dont know that they started again across the square where the women were still sorting bricks its just a precaution she looked up at their building standing whole in the stretch of damage its not safe anymore i always felt safe there all during the war i knew it would be all right its still safe i just want something safer the protector lena said wryly so she was right come on get in he said swinging up into the jeep she glanced again at the building then climbed in waiting for him to start the motor safe at the hospital they wanted me to be a nun wear the robes you know put this on youll be safe they said but i wasnt pastor fleischman had lost whatever flesh hed hadrail thin with an adams apple jutting out over his white collar he was waiting in front of anhalter station with a handcart so that in his clerical suit he looked oddly like a porter lena i was getting worried see what i found he pointed to the cart oh but a car he looked eagerly at the jeep lena turned to jake embarrassed you wouldnt mind i dont like to aski know its not permitted but theyre so tired after the train its such a long way to walk youll help no problem he said to the pastor then extended his hand and introduced himself how many are you expecting im not sure perhaps twenty its very kind well have to take them in shifts then jake said but the pastor merely nodded unconcerned with details as if the lord would multiply the jeep like the loaves and the fishes they waited on the crowded platform open to the sky through a rib cage of twisted girders fleischman had brought another woman to help and while she and lena talked jake leaned back against a pillar smoking and watching the crowd people sitting around in clumps dispirited holding on to rucksacks and bags the usual station clamor slowed to a kind of listless stupor a pack of teenage boys feral looking for something to snatch a russian soldier wandering up and down probably after a girl tired women everything ordinary what passed for peace he remembered his goingaway party the platform alive with champagne and crisp uniforms renate winking getting away with something how is it you speak german fleischman asked something polite to pass the time i used to live in berlin ah do you know texas texas well forgive me an american of course its a large country theres a church you see fredericksburg texas a lutheran church so i think maybe german people once theyve offered to take some of the children of course its a chance for them a future but to send them so far after everythingi dont know how do i select how many do they want five they can take five he sighed now we send our children well god will take care of them just as he did here jake thought looking at the scorched wall theyre orphans fleischman nodded from the sudeten the parents were killed during the expulsion then silesia now here tomorrow who knows cowboys im sure theyre good people if they offered yes yes i know its the selection how do i select he moved away not expecting an answer before jake could say anything names in a hat outside the light was fading people were still milling aimlessly the train was now an hour late im sorry lena said i didnt know do you want to leave no im fine here sit get some rest he sank to the bottom of the pillar pulling her down with him her head against his shoulder its boring for you no gives me time to think but what he thought about his mind drifting in the half wakefulness of waiting was the cards eyes facing in two directions deception nonsense he wished he had a crossword puzzle where one clue led to another rational a man gets on a plane one across with no baggage but a piece of information the one thing you didnt have to carry worth money russian so information to a russian in potsdam where hes dead by nightfall how did he spend the rest of the day not looking for emil but neither was the russian at professor brandts a possibility gunther had said they already know where he is but then who wanted tully dead not the paymaster presumably or why pay in the first place maybe he just got in the way whose his head dropped onto his chest nudging his eyes open for a second he wondered if he was really awake the station had grown black dotted with harsh little pools of light from a row of bare bulbs strung between the pillars a dream landscape where things crept in the dark lena was still leaning against him breathing softly safe he closed his eyes you couldnt solve a crossword without the key no matter which way he worked it the central piece was always emil who knew where the columns met without him it was just tea leaves the chance arrangement of cards sometimes they surprise even me but people heard what they wanted to hear the shriek of the train whistle woke everybody people scrambled to their feet the dim rails growing brighter as the engine headlight inched its way toward the platform as if the weight were too much for the engine to pull people covered the roofs of the cars and hung along the sides perched on running boards or just holding on to whatever piece of metal was available like the trains hed seen in egypt bursting with fellaheen a few boxcars with feet dangling from the open sliding doors everyone worn and stiff so that when they dropped onto the platform they moved slowly awkward with cramps a hiss finally of exhausted steam and a clang of brakes now the platform crowd moved forward with their bundles shoving to get on even before the train had emptied in the confusion pastor fleischman was running back and forth trying to locate his charges he waved lena over frau schaller the other helper was already lifting children off the train their heads had been shaved for delousing skeletal short pants legs like sticks slips of paper hanging on strings around their necks as makeshift ids faces dazed as people pushed around them they stood fixed blinking a few had dark blotches on their skin look at that have they been beaten jake said no its the edema from no food any sore will bruise pastor fleischman began loading the smaller ones into the handcart while the others looked on blankly huddled together no luggage a little girl with mucus crusted under her nose another story colliers would never runwho had really lost the war jake leaned over to help with the loading reaching for one of the younger boys but the child reared back screaming nein nein some of the platform crowd turned in alarm lena stepped between them bent down and spoke softly to the boy she looked back over her shoulder at jake its the uniform hes afraid of soldiers say something in german i only want to help jake said to him but you can go with the lady if you like the boy stared at him then hid behind lena its like this sometimes she said apologetic any uniform jake turned to another child are you afraid of me no kurts afraid hes young see how he wet himself then he pointed to jakes pocket do you have chocolate not today im sorry ill bring you some tomorrow the boy looked downtoo long away to imagine frau schaller had opened a bag and was handing out chunks of bread which the children held to their chests as they ate they began moving down the platform pastor fleischman pulling the cart the others straggling behind lena and frau schaller herding from the rear the older children were looking around eyes wide not the berlin theyd heard about all their lives kudamm lights and leafy boulevards instead swarms of refugees and fireblackened walls and through the arches dark mounds of brick but the grownups were reacting in the same way literally staggering through the doors now that they were here where did they go jake thought of the weary dps in the tiergarten that first day just moving they managed to squeeze the youngest group into the jeep lena holding the boy whod wet himself the nursery was in a church in schoneberg and before they were halfway there the children had begun to nod off back in the rocking motion of the train no sense of where they were the streets a maze of moonlit ruins what about the people who hadnt been met jake remembered walking out of tempelhof that day as confused as the refugees tonight getting lost in the streets on the way to hallesches tor and he knew berlin but of course they had been met breimer bundled into his official car liz and jake piling in with ron everyone taken care of except tully how was it possible a hasty trip as if hed been summoned brian thought left to find his way through the debris someone who didnt know berlin he must have been met berlin sprawled potsdam was miles away no taxis here ron had said certainly not to potsdam someone in the crowd at tempelhof he thought of lizs picture of ron a fuzzy background of uniforms why couldnt she have taken one of tully made everything easier he must have been there somewhere one of the blurs in the doorway while jake had been staring across the street at rubble missing it take another look maybe it was there the connection no one just arrived in berlin except refugees from silesia the church basement had been fitted out with a few cots and rows of mattresses scavenged from bomb sites in one corner an old woodstove was heating soup the room was bareno crayoned drawings or cutouts no piles of toys as he watched lena settle the children he saw for the first time how exhausting the work must be keeping them busy with imaginary games kurt still clung to her burying his head whenever jake caught his eye but the others raced for the stove id better get the rest before the soup goes jake said relieved to have an excuse to get out the return trip took longer fleischman insisted on bringing the cart and hanging it over the back with his body wedged against it for support so that each bump in the road threatened to dislodge it with a crash they seemed to move by inches as slow as the train at the church it finally did fall then needed a heave to turn it upright thank you its for the wood you see otherwise the stove jake imagined him working his way through the rubble in his white collar picking up splintered pieces of furniture they had to carry the sleeping children in dead weight even the thinnest of them heavy when he got to the basement doorway a boys head against his chest lena looked up and smiled the same unguarded welcome as at frau hinkels but softer now as if theyd already been to bed and were holding each other the soup was watery cabbage thickened by a few chunks of potato but the children finished all of it and sprawled on the mattresses waiting for sleep a line for the one toilet some squabbling refereed by an exhausted fleischman lena washing faces with a damp cloth an endless night the girl with the mucus was crying comforted by frau schaller stroking her hair what will happen to them jake asked fleischman the dp camp in teltowerdamm its not badtheres food at least but still you know a camp we try to find places sometimes people are willing for the extra rations but of course its difficult so many the few children still awake were given books the old bedtime ritual lena and frau schaller reading to them in murmurs jake picked one up a childrens picture book of bible stories left over from sunday school his german could manage that he sat down with the chocolate eater and opened the book moses the boy said showing off yes he read a little but the boy seemed more interested in the picture content just to sit next to him and gaze egypt exactly the way it still was everyones first imaginary landscapethe blue river bullrushes a boy on a donkey turning a waterwheel date palms in a thin strip of green then brown desert running to the top of the page in the picture women had come down to the waters edge to rescue the floating wicker basket excited in a huddle just the way they had pulled tully out in potsdam drifting toward shore but moses was supposed to be found set into the current toward a better future tully had been flung in to disappear how thrown from the bridge leading to town dragged in until the water took him dead weight a grown man much heavier than an emaciated child a struggle for someone why bother at all why not just leave him where hed fallen what was another body in berlin where the rubble was still full of them jake looked at the picture again the excited women because tully wasnt meant to be found jake tried to think what this meant not enough to get rid of him he had to vanish first simply awol then missing a deserter then finally irretrievable a file nobody would follow up nothing to investigate permanently out of the way every trace even the dog tags supposedly at the bottom of the jungfernsee with him but the riding boots had slipped off not held by laces and hed floated carried by the water and the wind until a russian soldier had fished him out like pharaohs daughter where he wasnt supposed to be found he looked up to find lena watching him her face drawn so tired her eyes seemed weak almost brimming the boy had fallen asleep against his shoulder we can go inge will stay with them jake moved the boy gently onto the mattress and covered him pastor fleischman thanked him as he walked them to the door a formal courtesy about the climate its hot there so perhaps i should send the healthiest he sighed how can i select jake looked back at the sleeping children curled up in clumps under the blankets i dont know he said hes a good man lena said in the jeep you know the nazis arrested him he was in oranienberg and the parishioners got him out it was unusual to do that what it was like day to day a waitress collecting a check a thousand cruelties then the odd act of grace did you know him before i mean was this your church no why i was wondering if anyone could trace you through him oh she said quietly he glanced at her her head nodding not yet asleep but drowsy as peaceful as one of the children not just bait but living with a man asking questions vulnerable either way there had to be another place somewhere nobody knew but who had flats generals girls and whores you passed the street she mumbled as he sped up tauentzienstrasse toward the memorial church i have to make a stop just for a minute he doubleparked in front of ronnys in a row of jeeps here she said puzzled i wont be long he turned to one of the waiting drivers do me a favor will you and keep an eye on the lady now i need a guard lena said softly watch her yourself the gi said then took in jakes uniform patch and stood up sir he said with a salute there was the usual blare of music as he went through the door a trumpet leading let me off uptown loud even in the noisy room the club seemed more crowded than before but danny still had his own corner table noel coward hair slicked back drumming his fingers to the music a permanent piece of the furniture only one girl tonight and next to him gunther staring into a glass well heres a treat danny said come to cheer old gunther up have you he nudged gunther who barely managed an acknowledging glance before going back to his glass bit down in the dumps he is not the best advert for the girls you remember trude a hopeful smile from the blonde got a second jake said i need a favor danny stood up such as can you fix me up with a room a flat if youve got it for yourself a lady jake said leaning closer not wanting to be overheard how long do you need danny said glancing at his watch no a place to live oh you dont want to be getting mixed up in that get their hooks in and then what you want to spread the wealth cheaper in the end can you doit danny looked at him narrowly ready for business itll cost you thats all right but nobodys to know he met dannys eyes she has a husband can you fix it with the landlord well thatd be me wouldnt it you own it i told you nothing like property you see how it comes in handy mind ill have to chuck somebody outthey wont like that a bit theyll need a little something for relocation thatd be extra done danny glanced up surprised not to have to bargain right give me a day and not with the other girls i dont want people coming and going respectable like yes well its your lookout smoke he opened a gold cigarette case a prop from private lives take my advice dont do it you don t want to settle in makes it worse after me i like a choice i appreciate this jake said ignoring him he took out some money do you want something down danny looked away embarrassed again by actual cash youre good for it arent you friend of gunthers he turned and pulled out a chair here have a drink come on gunther share and share alike pour out pour out thats all right jake said ive got somebody waiting he nodded at the bottle looks like id have a lot of catching up to do you been here all day he said to gunther no gunther said calmly working for you looking at him steadily so that jake understood the trial that morning was to be put aside something gone with the rest of the bottle i spoke to willi let me guess jake said sitting down for a minute a russians been paying him to watch the house yes find out about the one in the market the sharpshooter i inquired yes one of sikorskys men he must have been vassily said he didnt know and vassily knows everyone so he looked up how did you know i talked to shaeffer the man who was shot he and sikorsky have been playing cat and mouse for a couple of weeks now sikorsky laid a trap and he walked right into it but the mouse got away so you didnt need my services after all what else do you know that tully knew where brandt was he didnt just let him go he sent him there it was a setup then he collects some russian money they do connect thats what he was sellinginformation about brandt gunther considered this for a moment then picked up his drink yes it was the money that was confusing so much people are cheap in berlin you can sell them for less not this one hes important your friend sikorsky would be interested for instance my friend he said almost snorting a business acquaintance he smiled slightly at jakes expression everybody does a little business the russians must have emil you thought so this morning a nod its the logic and you think vassily would tell me on these matters im afraid a man of principle if he knows then maybe hell tell you who drove tully to potsdam ive been thinking about that how did he get there the general is not a chauffeur herr geismar somebody met tully at the airport somebody drove him to potsdam and killed him it had to be a russian the same man what do you mean would you spend all day with someone you intended to kill what would you do with him all day no you would do it he made a chopping motion with the side of his hand hes got you there mate danny said surprising jake whod forgotten he was at the table but the driver anyway jake said annoyed at being interrupted hed be russian why not ask because you would learn nothing gunther said serious nothing and you would make yourselfconspicuous never be conspicuous with the russians not a patient people they strike he lifted a finger for emphasis keep your head down until you know be a policeman follow the numbers this is where they lead gunther shrugged the airport yes thats interesting the driver what would that tell me unless its the same manbut how could that be he shook his head its the wrong question besides you know i have my interests to protect yeah everybody does a little business gunther took a drink looking down into the glass you forget im a friend to the soviet peoples the accented german of the prosecutor bitter the trial still there after all who knows he said almost airy now playing with it maybe soon an employee the general admires my work there are not so many opportunities youd work for him jake said thrown by this youd work for the russians my friend what difference does it make when you leave who will be here we have to live calm yourself he said waving his hand for now its not attractive im working on a case he raised his glass a reassuring toast you see danny said thats what he likes old sherlock its not the money with him then ill try to keep you interested jake said getting up he looked down at gunther placidly draining his glass thats quite a future you have in mind you and vassily you know he was in the market when shaeffer got hit i guess that would make him the greifer gunther lowered the glass drawn by the word his face was slack eyes lost and empty like one of the children on the platform he looked at jake for a moment then grunted slowly moving the glass aside pushing it out of sight with everything else be careful he doesnt become yours he said his voice composed neutral but jake said then stopped but you have someone waiting gunther said the other matter we discussedthe living arrangements its taken care of jake said deliberately not looking at danny good sometimes its enough just moving he looked down of course not always outside the street was full of drivers bored privates in khaki standing by while their officers danced the gi on guard duty was talking to lena leaning casually against the jeep he says he knows texas she said smiling as jake approached there are hills there so thats good it took jake a second preoccupied to realize she was back with the children thats right lots of hills the soldier said in a cowpoke drawl any driver maybe even him pulled out of the pool to escort the visitor around theyll like that she said as jake started the motor like home rolling silesian hills lets hope so what were you doing seeing a man about a place we can have it tomorrow he swung into the street so soon why not theres not much to pack oh its easy for you thats how you live a gypsy she said but smiling well im used to it he said tents and hotels and rented rooms no you like it he glanced over at her will you of course she said a forced brightness well be gypsies one suitcase you dont think i can do it he smiled well maybe two cases there was no one in the street outside the flat still safe and no one inside either hannelores party as expected running late i have to wash she said i wont be long look at the mess shes left well i wont miss that ill clean it up no in the morning its so late am i standing up but when the bathroom door closed he went over to the sink anyway thinking of when shed been sick washing the dishes to fill the time waiting for the doctor tidying up as a kind of medicine only three weeks ago there wasnt much to docups some scattered papers near the typewriter most of his clothes were at gelferstrasse not even one suitcase it would take only minutes to leave another room and yet it occurred to him that frau hinkel was wronghe was home here all the years before the war then these last weeks when it seemed a kind of sanctuary here longer than anywhere hed ever been his place nothing remarkablethe rumpled sofa where hal used to pass out the table where lena had sat with coffee sunlight pouring across her robe his private piece of berlin but not a refuge anymore a trap he heard the click of the door as lena left the bathroom and he walked over to the window turning out the light behind him nothing wittenbergplatz was quiet he looked up and down the street eyes in two directions maybe frau hinkel was wrong about that too but uboats kept moving his cards were lucky pariserstrasse was rubble in a day this flat would be gone but lena was still here brushing out her hair probably sitting on the bed in her nightgown waiting for him he looked around in the dark just rooms in the bathroom he brushed his teeth then washed off the days layer of grime coming alive with the water shed be wearing the prewar silk a sentimental choice for their last night here straps hanging loose on her shoulders maybe already packing ready to go somewhere new but when he opened the door he saw her lying on the bed in the dim lamplight curled up like one of the children eyes closed a long day he stood for a moment looking at her face damp from the heat but not the fever of those days when hed kept watch a few of her things had been folded in a neat pile life in a suitcase the last thing she wanted but shed said it he turned off the light undressed and slipped quietly onto his side of the bed trying not to wake her thinking of that first night when they hadnt made love either just lay together he turned on his side and she stirred jacob she said only half awake oh im sorry its all right go to sleep no i wanted ssh he smoothed her forehead whispering get some sleep tomorrow well go to the lakes like a bedtime promise to a child a boat she murmured vaguely not really following still drowsy all right a pause thank you for everything she said oddly polite any time he said smiling at her words in the quiet he thought she had drifted off but she moved closer facing him eyes now open she put her hand on his cheek do you know something ive never loved you as much as i did tonight when was that exactly he said softly so i can do it again dont joke she said leaning her head into his she stroked his cheek never so much when you read to him i saw how it would have been if nothing had happened he saw her eyes in the basement again not tired brimming with something else a sadness out of reach hanging in the air between them like rubble dust sleep he said he moved his hand up to close her eyes but she took it in hers let me see it again she said tracing yes there satisfied her eyes closing finally contents previous chapter next chapter chapter thirteen brian had been as good as his word jakes name was listed at the grunewald yacht club and the boat was his for a signature he said youd be by the british soldier said at the marina landing ill have roger bring it round for you know how to handle a sail jake nodded course shes only a sunny nothing to it still we like to ask some of the lads he jerked his head toward the terrace cafe where soldiers sat drinking beer under a row of flapping union jacks one table in kilts still in parade dress wait here i wont be a sec lena was standing with her face to the sun oblivious to everything but the day there was a breeze off the lake fresh not even a trace of the citys smell the boat was a small singlemasted sailboat scarcely big enough for two with a toylike tiller and oars it bobbed unsteadily when jake stepped in so that he planted his feet apart and held the dock piling before he reached for lenas hand but she grinned at his concern slipping off her shoes and leaping in surefooted her skirt blowing up in the breeze half the terrace seemed to be watching heads tilted to catch her legs sit first she said to jake in control then pushed the boat off watch the current the soldier said its not really a lake you know people forget lena nodded stretching the sail out along the jib an old hand they began moving on the water i didnt know you were a sailor jake said watching her tie the sail rope im from hamburg everyone knows boats there she looked around theatrically sniffing the air my father liked it in the summer we used to go to the sea always every summer he would take me out with him because my brother was too small you have a brother he was killed in the army she said matteroffact i didnt know yes peter the same name were there others no just him and my parents theres no one left now from that life except emil she shrugged and lifted her head again pull to your left we have to bring it around my god what a day so hot deliberately pushing them away from shore and in fact the farther they went the better it became away from the war the burned pockets of woods disappearing in the distance only the standing pines visible not berlin at all little waves catching the sun in flashes postcard blue he looked across the water shading his eyes from the glare not choked with bodies like the stagnant landwehrkanalall flushed to the north sea with the current except for what had settled to the bottom bottles scraps of shells even riding boots the surface anyway was bright and clear a brother i didnt know what else i want to know everything about you so you can decide she said smiling determined to be cheerful too late youve already had the sample its like wertheimsno returns permitted sales final wertheims never said that no well i do she flicked some water over the side at him thats all right i dont want to return anything she sat back against the prow hiking her skirt up to her thighs stretching her white legs in the sun you look beautiful today you think so then lets not go back well live here on the water careful you dont burn i dont care its healthy the breeze had died down the boat barely moving as still as a beach they lay on their backs like sunbathers eyes closed talking into the air what will it be like do you think she said her voice lazy like the quiet slap of water against the side of the boat what our life why do women always ask that what happens next so many have asked you that every single one maybe we have to plan what do you tell them that i dont know she trailed her hand in the water so thats your answer i dont know no i know she said nothing for a minute then sat up im going to swim not here youre not why not its so hot you dont know whats in there you think im afraid of fish she stood holding on to the mast to steady the boat not fish he said bodies its not clean you could get sick ouf she said waving it off then reached under to slip off her underpants you know during the raids it was like that some nights you were afraid of everything then others nothing no reason you just knew nothing would happen and nothing did she took off her dress pulling it over her head then standing with her arms still up stretched out everything white but the patch of hair between her legs brazen your face she said laughing at him dont worry i wont swallow come on lena its not safe oh safe she tossed the dress aside you see a gypsy she said flinging her arms out she glanced back hold the boat she said still pragmatic you dont want it to swamp and then with a light bounce she was over slicing into the water her splash spraying the boat as it rocked in her wake he leaned over the side watching her glide beneath the surface long arms pushing back the water in smooth arcs hair streaming behind her toward the round curve of her hips a free streak of white flesh so graceful that for a second he wondered if he had made her up just an idea of a woman but she bobbed up spitting water and laughing real you look like a mermaid he said with fins she said rolling on her back in a fluid movement to point her toes upward then slapping the water with them its wonderful like silk come ill watch she plunged down in a backward dive making a circle underwater performing when she came back up she floated again eyes closed to the sun her skin glistening in the light he looked across the water they had drifted closer to the grunewald shore and he could make out the beach where theyd stood that day when the rain had caught them closed into herself not even wanting to kiss then shivering on the drive through the woods dancing to the records wanting to come back to life he thought of her moving down the stairs in lizs shoes tentative now splashing like a porpoise in the bright sun somebody else a girl who would jump off a boat lucky cards she swam over and held the side of the boat had enough he said in a minute its so cool when do we have to go back whenever i dont want to move till its dark like thieves where is it i dont know yet i have to tell professor brandt he wont know where i am i dont want him to theyre watching his house for emil for you oh she said then ducked her head in the water still holding on to the side ill have somebody check on him dont worry its just that hes alone theres no one not emil thats for sure he said he was dead dead why would he say that jake shrugged dead to him maybe i dont know thats what he said when they questioned him at kransberg so they wouldnt bother him arrest him the gestapo did thattook the families the allies arent the gestapo she looked up at him well its different for you when you think that way she turned back to the water did he say i was dead too no he wanted to find you that was the trouble thats how everything started then why not let him and finish it i dont want to hide hes not the only one looking now she glanced up a flicker of concern then turned her face to the sun and pushed away from the boat lena i cant hear you she said swimming away in long strokes he watched her head toward the club just a speck in the distance then turn over and float back toward the boat lying suspended in the still water tully would have done the same except it had been windy that night enough to stir the waves pushing the body along getting back in the boat took longer than diving out an awkward pull up one leg flung over the side to prevent it from tipping she shook herself squeezing out her hair then lay back again to dry in the sun after that they were content to drift in the gentle rocking motion like moses in his basket the boat had turned again facing down toward the pfaueninsel where goebbels had given his olympics party no lights now half the trees gone the dreary look of a cemetery island bodies must have landed here with the other debris bobbing sluggishly like tullys at the cecilienhof floating in circles until hed ended up where he wasnt supposed to be found jake felt a few drops on his face not rain lena sprinkling him awake wed better start back theres not much winditll take time she was sitting up having slipped on the dress while he was drifting let the current do it he said lazily his eyes still closed itll take us right past the club no its the wrong way he waved his fingers simple geography north of the alps the rivers flow north south south we dont have to do a thing in berlin you do the havel flows south then it curves up look at any map but the maps just showed a string of blue off in the lefthand corner look where we are already lena said if you dont believe me he raised his head and looked over the side of the boat the club was off in the distance still no wind you see if you dont turn around well end up in potsdam he sat upright almost knocking his head against the mast what did you say well end up in potsdam she repeated puzzled thats where the river goes he looked around at the bright water turning his head in a swivel scanning the shore but thats it he wasnt put in there he never went there what he just ended up there he didnt go there the where was wrong turning his head again scanning as if the rest of it would come now in a rush one piece unlocking all the others but there was only the long grunewald shore so where did he go what are you talking about tully he never went to potsdam somewhere else do you have a map nobody has maps except the army she said still puzzled watching his face gunther has one come on lets go back he said eager pushing the tiller to make a circle the current why didnt i think of it before moses christ it was right there thank you he blew her a kiss a nod but no smile her face frowning as if the day had turned cloudy whos gunther a policeman friend of mine he didnt think of it either and hes supposed to know berlin maybe not the water she said looking down at it but you did he said smiling so now were all policemen she said then turned her face back up to the sun well not yet look how still it is we cant go back yet but the idea seemed to produce its own momentum refusing to wait and in a few minutes brought a slight steady breeze that blew them back to the club in no time gunther was at home in kreuzberg sober and shaved even the room was tidied up a new leaf jake said but gunther ignored him his eyes fixed on lena and this must be lena he said taking her hand now i see why herr brandt was so anxious to come to berlin but not to potsdam he never went there tully i mean here come look jake said walking over to the map american manners gunther said to lena some coffee perhaps its freshmade thank you she said both of them walking through a formal ritual he lives on coffee jake said im german sugar he poured out a cup and indicated his reading chair for her the havel flows south jake said the body floated to potsdam we were on the water today it flows this way he moved his hand down the map thats how he got there gunther stood for a moment taking this in then walked over to the map staring at the lefthand corner so no russian driver no russian driver it solves the where gunther raised an eyebrow and this makes you excited before you had only potsdam now you have all of berlin no somewhere here jake said making a circle around the lakes it has to be you dont drive a body across town youd have to be near enough to think of it where to get rid of it fast unless you planned it then youd be on the water jake said pointing to the shoreline to make it easy i dont think it was planned they never even took the time to go through his pockets get his tags they just wanted to get rid of him in a hurry somewhere nearbywhere nobody would find him he pointed to the center of the blue patch gunther nodded an answer for everything he said then turned to lena an expert on crime our herr geismar he said pleasantly the coffees all right yes an expert lena said i have been looking forward to this meeting he said sitting down you dont mind if i ask you a question somewhere here jake was saying at the map his hand on the lake yes but where gunther said over his shoulder its miles around those lakes not if you eliminate he blocked off the western shore with his hand not kladow the russian zone he moved his hand and covered the bottom not potsdam somewhere along here he traced his finger from spandau down to wannsee the long swatch of the grunewald where would he go a man who spoke only english i would say to the americans in my experience they prefer it zehlendorf jake moved across the woods the map alive in his hand kronprinzenallee headquarters the press camp gelferstrasse the kommandatura across the street from the kwi an emil connection but the kwi was closed dark for months the grunewald itself what question lena said forgive me i was distracted just a small point i was curious about the time your husband came for you that last week you know i was in berlin thenthe volkssturm even the police became soldiers at the end a terrible time yes such confusion looting even he said shaking his head as if even now the behavior disturbed him how i wondered did you know he was here you didnt see him the telephone it was still working even through that i remember no water but still the telephone so he called from his fathers he wanted to come for me but the streets yes dangerous the russians were there not yet but near between us i think but whats the difference it was impossible the germans were just as bad shooting everybody i was afraid to leave the hospital i thought at least ill be safe here not even the russians a terrible thing for him so close and after coming so far the zoo tower was still secure i think but perhaps he didnt know that to get through that way lena looked up you mustnt blame him hes not a coward my dear lady i dont blame anyone not that week i dont mean that i told him not to come ah i was the coward frau brandt no its true she lowered her head and took a sip of coffee i was afraid wed both be killed if he waited i didnt want another death it was crazy to come thenthere wasnt time i told him to leave with his father before it was too late i didnt want to go i didnt care it was foolish but thats how it was why do you want to know this but his father didnt leave either gunther said not answering only the files did he mention them no what files a pity im curious about those files its how he got the car i think you remember there were no cars then no gas either his father said he came with ss but even they had no cars for personal matters not then so it must have been for the files what files do you think i dont know youll have to ask him or the americans he turned around to jake what do the americans say did you find out admin files shaeffer said nothing special no technical secrets if thats what you mean maybe he doesnt know how to read them not like our herr teitel a genius with files that one in his hands a weapon he raised his hand uncannily like bernie in the courtroom the invisible file a kind of gun he knows well if he does he isnt saying and hes been sitting under them for weeks now its his home away from home what is jake stared at him then turned to the map the document center he said quietly putting his finger down on wasserkafersteig a short line just a byway off the grunewald the document center he said again moving his finger left a straight line across the grunewald under the avus where theyd stopped in the rain a straight line to the lake youve thought of something tully had an appointment with bernie right the next day but he came early why would anyone want to see bernie he moved his finger back to the street files nobody knows those files better than he does hed be the man to see he thought of bernie racing in to dinner folders cascading over the startled serving manthe night in fact tully was killed he tapped his finger on the map thats where tully went the numbers connect here gunther got up and looked where he was pointing hand over chin in thought bravo he said finally if he went there unfortunately only he can tell us no they keep records a signin book hed be in there he looked at gunther want to bet even money no gunther said turning back to the map thoughtful now what jake said reading his face nothing i wonder how did he know to look emil must have said something they did a lot of talking at kransberg they were friends an expensive friend perhaps how do you mean meister tollhe wasnt the type to do anything for free jake looked at him no he never did anything for free it was late but he had to know so they made the long drive back to zehlendorf the same narrow street rising up from the dark woods the wire fence spotted with floodlights a guard chewing gum were closed bub cant you read he jerked his thumb at a posted sign i just want to see the night duty officer no can do for captain teitel jake said quickly he has a message for him a name that literally opened doors here or at least the mesh gate which instantly swung back she stays here the guard said make it quick the hallway guard half asleep with his feet propped up on the signin desk seemed startled to see anyone at this hour if tully had been here it hadnt been late captain teitel asked me to check the signin book for him what for some report how do i know can i see it or what the guard looked at him dubious but pushed the book around a desk clerk with a hotel register how far back does this go jake said beginning to leaf through it i need july sixteenth what for your needle stuck the guard pulled out another book opening it to the right page for him jake started scrolling down running his finger under the names a busy day and suddenly there it waslt patrick tully a script to match the riding boots showy signed in and out no times he looked at it for a second the closest hed been to him since the cecilienhof no longer elusive caught where the numbers connected he took the photograph from his breast pocket an off chance you ever see this guy what are you an mp you see him he glanced at the picture not that i know of you get people in and out here after a while they all look alike what did he do anybody takes a file they sign it out right nobody takes files out of here cant teitel does no he brings them in nothing goes out unless you brought it in the first place not while im on duty anyway okay thanks thats all i needed the guard began to pull the open book back wait a minute jake said his eye caught by a florid signature a few names down breimer a rounded b and underneath shaeffer where theyd gone that evening anything wrong jake shook his head then closed the book i dont know outside he stood for a moment struck by the lights just as he had when hed walked into lizs picture shaeffer had been here that day too two visits did you get what you wanted lena said in the jeep yes he was here i was right and the files tomorrow come on well go home you got some sun she looked down at her skin red under the floodlights yes you were right about that too she said with an edge whats the matter jake said as the jeep started down the hill nothing theyre so important the files tully thought so he was herei knew it more numbers for emils weapons thats whats in themnumbers not according to shaeffer but emil came for them thats what the policeman thinks not for me maybe he came for both to make more weapons the war was finished to trade thats what they have the scientistsnumbers to trade for what jake shrugged their future to make weapons for someone else lena said jake turned left at the bottom of the hill then jogged right toward the woods where are you going i want to see how it worked how long it took what to dump the body she said nothing hunching into herself the way she had the last time in the woods shivering from the rain the grunewald was dark nothing visible beyond the arc of their headlights and a small patch of moon reflecting on krumme lanke no one in the road the thick trees hiding whoever might be there small bands of dps looking for shelter no one to see them either the body could have been slumped over like a drunk easy anywhere along here not the center with its guards and lights here in the dark or on the beach itself in minutes they were there the water rippling with moonlight the last thing tully might have seen danny had a shrewd eye for real estate his building an art nouveau block on one of the side streets off savignyplatz had once been elegant and would always be well located the flat was on the first floor its door wedged open by a suitcase and some pillowcases stuffed with clothes last minute packing dont worry im leaving the girl said when she saw them almost pretty with anklestrap heels and lipstick an annoyed expression twisting her face he said by ten vultures this to herself as she flung a skirt into the last bag im sorry lena said embarrassed ha lena turned away and leaned against the wall to wait not looking at jake halfway down the hall a man carrying a rucksack was coming out of another flat he squinted and then recognizing them walked over and took off his hat hello again how are you feeling oh the doctor yes rosen youre well lena nodded i never had the chance to thank you he waved this off then turned to jake the same old eyes in the young face he glanced down at the suitcases shes living here just for a while rosen looked again at lena no recurrences the medicine worked no fever no she said with a polite smile just sunburn what do i do for that he lifted a scolding finger wear a hat the girl was glaring at them from the doorway here she said handing jake the key take care its good to see you again rosen said to lena leaving dont get too much sun he nodded at the girl marie he said then shuffled away so youre the new girl an american to payvery nice for you you already know rosen he took care of me when i was ill the girl made a face that jew i wont let him touch me not there with jew hands he saved my life lena said did he very nice for you she grabbed up one of the bags jews if it wasnt for them jake carried their cases through the door to get away im sorry to put you out lena said following him go to hell the flat had the disarray of leavetaking everything angled slightly out of place in the next room he could see an unmade bed and a wardrobe with the door left open a scarf had been draped over a lampshade turning the light a dim red nice girl he said lena walked over to the lamp and lifted the scarf then sank into the easy chair next to it as if seeing the room had exhausted her there were lots like her she lighted a cigarette she thinks im a whore is that what this place is its a flat no one will bother you he glanced out at the street then drew the curtains she smiled wryly staring at the cigarette my mother was right she said if i came to berlin id end up like that ill find someplace else if you dont like it she looked around the room no its a good size itll seem better after we clean it up you wont even know she was here jew hands she said moodily there was a girl like that at school not even a nazi a girl how do you clean that away she drew on the cigarette again her hand shaking a little you know after the russians came they made us see films of the camps germans they said this is what was done in your name imagine they did it for me so now what its my fault too all that business nobody says that yes the germans did it everyone says that and you know somebody did somebody did those things she looked up somebody made the weaponsmaybe its worse german people even my brother he came on leave just before you know what he said that terrible things were being done there in russia and no one must ever know and i thought what things would peter do a boy like that now im glad i dont know i dont have to think about that whatever he did maybe he didnt do them jake said quietly he sat down next to her lena whats this about she put out the cigarette still agitated pushing it around the ashtray i dont want to know what emil did either to think of him that way i dont want to know whats in the files his numbers maybe its terrible what they were doing making weapons but he was my husband you know when he came to berlin i thought i was saving him go i told him before its too late i said it for him now youre now im what making him a criminal for working in the war so did my brother so did everybody even your policeman who knows what they did in my name sometimes i think i dont want to be german anymore isnt that terrible not wanting to be who you are i dont want to know what they did lena he said patiently the files are there theyve already been seen emil handed them over himself theyre not about him then why do you want to see them because i think they can tell us something about the man who was killed he was in the business of selling information so what was there to sell now doesnt that make sense he said calmly coaxing a child yes then why does it worry you she looked down i dont know its the flat well move its not the flat she said dully then what she folded her hands in her lap he came to berlin for me she looked up her voice faltering and dispirited he came for me he reached over and covered her hand so did i contents previous chapter next chapter chapter fourteen the problem is the crossreferencing bernie said walking past the rows of file cabinets they just threw everything in here and were still sorting it out himmlers personal files are over there the general ss ones here but sometimes it pays to check one against the other if dates are missing you know whats personal thats assuming brandts files havent been mis filed which you cant assume they got involved in the rocket program in fortythree so you can skip all of these he waved away half the room program was designated a so we try to keep it all together in an a section but as i say it pays to crosscheck here he said pulling a drawer happy reading and these would be what brandt turned over some of them sources arent indicated but if theyre his theyd be in here of course the scientific documents were down in nordhausen von braun buried them for safekeepingin some old mine i thinkso fiats got them but you only wanted brandts right right then youre here he said tapping the cabinet christ jake said looking at the long row of files yeah i know they were so busy covering ass you wonder when they got time to fight well the army they live on the stuff dont they id hate to see ours these are a little different bernie said if you get bored try the aeromedical files over there want to know how long it takes a man to freeze to death its all thereblood temp pressure right down to the last second everything but the screams ill be downstairs if you need any help but the first folders at least were ordinarymemos staff directives summary reports the sort of thing he might have found im any office files american dye in utica except for the black ss letterheads a paper trail of a bureaucratic takeover with a trojan horse of laborers peenemunde had been built with foreign conscripts but by july the program had needed more the extra hands only the ss could supply haftlinge detainees a memorandum word for prisoners in the death camps after that first requisition the fatal bargain the real files began thick with dates and events a flurry of paper between department heads to seize opportunity while it lasted july an a demonstration for hitler who is impressed july the great fire raid on hamburg july a gets a top priority goahead to produce its rockets vengeance weapons august peenemunde bombed august as night follows day hitler orders himmller to provide camp labor to speed production three days later august himmler takes charge of constructing a new production site at nordhausen far away from the bombs august the first workers arrive the horse inside the gates the next folders followed the race to build aladdins cave clawed out of the mountain to house the vast underground factory file after file of numbing construction details weekly progress reports new camps for workers even as jakes eyes glazed over at the daytoday tallies he was watching a whole city take shape the sheer scale of the thing right there in the numbers ten thousand workers two giant tunnels reaching two miles back into the mountain fortyseven cross tunnels each two football fields long bigger every day the way the pyramids must have been built the same way in fact the ten thousand were slaves no mention of how many were dyingyou bad to guess by the requisitions for replacements from himmlers endless supply the whole terrible business obscured by engineering estimates and monthly targets in berlin the reports were dated stamped and filed away had emil seen them back at peenemunde where the scientists gathered at night over coffee to discuss trajectories meanwhile page by page the tunnels grow rockets begin to be built more camps and finally the takeover is official august hans kammler ss lieutenant general replaces dornberger as head of the program now the scientists and their wonder rockets belong to himmler medals are passed out jake looked for a minute at the memo describing the ceremony peenemunde not berlin no families a special luncheon there had been champagne toasts were exchanged more folders february the rocket team finally abandons peenemunde a request for a special train air travel too risky for scientific personnel with the skies crowded with bombers everyone south now scattered in villages near the great factory the prison population reaches forty thousandspillovers from the eastern camps as the russians get closer in spite of everything vs are still streaming daily out of the mountain on their way to london more files in marchdemands improbably for increased production and then the sudden end to the paper but jake could finish the story himself hed already written it april the americans take nordhausen a is over he leaned back in his chair but what did it mean drawers full of details not known to him but presumably known to someone nothing worth flying to berlin for getting killed for what had he missed he left the last file open on the table and went outside for a smoke sitting on the steps in the sun a yellow afternoon light washed the trees of the grunewald hours to find nothing had tully spent the day here need a break bernie said from the doorway you lasted longer than most maybe you have a stronger stomach theyre not like that office politics mostly production stats nothing bernie lit a cigarette you dont know how to read them that s not german its a new language the words mean something else haftlinge jake said an example bernie nodded poor bastards i guess it made it easier for the secretaries to type instead of what they really were see the disciplinary measures thats hanging they strung them up on a crane at the tunnel entrance so everybody had to pass under when they went to work they let them swing for a week until the smell got bad discipline for what sabotage a loose bolt not working fast enough maybe they were the lucky onesat least it was quick the others it took weeks before they dropped but they did the death rate was a hundred and sixty a day thats some statistic a guess somebody took a pencil and averaged it out for what its worth he walked over to the steps i take it you didnt find what you wanted nothing ill go through them again it has to be there somewhere whatever it is trouble is you dont know what youre looking for and tully did jake thought for a minute but not where he must have been fishing too thats why he wanted your help then maybe he didnt find it either but he came his names right there in the book it has to be here so now what now i look again he flicked the cigarette end into the dusty yard every time i think im getting someplace im back where i started tully getting off a plane he stood up and brushed the seat of his pants hey bernie can i twist your arm for another favor talk to your pals in frankfurt againsee if tullys on a flight manifest for july sixteenth on whose okay i asked mg but if i wait for them ill be eighty they have this way of getting lost in somebodys in box and see if anybody knows where he went the weekend brandt left frankfurt they said but where where do you spend the weekend in frankfurt see if he said anything does it matter i dont know just a loose end at least it gives us something to do while i figure out these files bernie looked up you know its possible he got it wrongthat there isnt anything here there must be emil came to berlin for them why would he do that if theres nothing in them nothing you want you mean nothing hed want either i just read them that depends how you look at it want a theory bernie paused waiting for jake to nod i think von braun sent him why it took about two weeks to round up the scientists after we got to nordhausen they were all over the place down there von braun himself didnt surrender until may second so what were they doing i give up what putting their alibis in order thats a da talking alibis for what for being part of what you just read about bernie said nodding toward the building it wasnt us it was the ss look its right here they did everything were just the eggheads might be a useful thing to have when people start asking questions which we did after we got a look at their factory help von braun was the team leaderhe had the technical files the real trump card but these arent bad as a bargaining chip clean hands he held up his own lets shake and make a deal here are the specs and the drawings lets make some rockets together the rest of ityou can see we werent responsible it was ss but it was ssits all there then he was right to want them wasnt he hes even convinced you come on bernie they didnt string anybody up they were in peenemunde until februaryit says so in the files how much could they know everybody knew he said sharply using his courtroom voice making another case thats what no one wants to believe everybody knew renate naumann knew gunther knew everybody in this goddamn country knew you think somebody who could get an ss car those last weeks didnt know they didnt stop hanging people after februarythey had to have seen it not to mention all the oth ers they had forty camps for workers there jake forty and people were dying in all of them they knew that doesnt make them no just accessories you think theyre any better because they knew how to work a slide rule they knew he stopped dropping his prosecutors voice and i cant touch them lucky for them the ss liked to take all the credit so theyre off a very big hook worth coming to berlin for wouldnt you say anyway its a theory got a better one then why send emil why not some flunky maybe he was the only one willing to go he had a wife here jake looked away then shook his head except he didnt come alone there were two men with him why risk sending him he knew what to look for jake sighed so did tully he came here there has to be something and im missing it bernie shrugged you read the files yes he said then looked up but im not the only one keep my seat warm will you ill be back later where are you going to get a second opinion shaeffer had moved from bed to chair but the bandage was still in place apparently itching now because he was scratching himself when jake walked in well my new partner he said pleased to have a diversion got something for me no youve got something for me jake sat on the bed you went to the document center to read the a files what did you find shaeffer looked at him a boy surprised at being caught then smiled nothing nothing thats right nothing that must have been disappointing after looking twice real shamus arent you your names in the signin book tullys there too same day but you knew that shaeffer looked up no but youre not surprised either shaeffer scratched himself again saying nothing jake stared at him then sat back folding his arms over his chest we could do this all day want to tell me what you were looking for or should we play twenty questions what something i didnt already know thats what i didnt find it jake unfolded his arms talk to me shaeffer this isnt as much fun as you think man follows tully to a place same day hes killed looks at the same files carries the same kind of gun that killed himive known people convicted on less now whos being funny for ten cents id pop you one i told you i didnt know he was there lets try it a different way brandt said something to tully i assume you picked this up on one of your taps shaeffer nodded i didnt think anything of it at first you know the monitors jot down things that might be of interestwhen theyre listening so you get these scraps you have to figure out the rest yourself unless its technicalthen they take down everything and this wasnt one of their personal chats this and that and then he says everything we did its in the files words to that effect anyway nothing funny about thatit was all there in nordhausen they didnt hold anything back tons of the stuff they want to use it themselves right so why hold anything back and then he walks and im going through the transcripts and i thought what if maybe he means the other files its worth a check but nothing new there unless you saw something i didnt so i figured he did mean the nordhausen files but tully didnt think so and he knew something you didnt what the rest of the conversation shaeffer considered this for a moment then shook his head but theres nothing there i looked twice so twice maybe my germans not as good as yours hows breimers hes in the book too is that why you asked him along or did he have reasons of his own hes out of this tell me or ill ask him myself partner shaeffer glared at him then dropped his shoulders and began picking at the adhesive tape look were walking a fine line here these guys are the best rocket team in the worldtheres nobody else near them we have to have them but theyre german and some people are sensitive about that its one thing if they just followed orderswho the hell didnt but if theres anything else well we cant embarrass breimer we need his help he cant give jobs to nazis to bad ones anyway and you thought there might be something embarrassing in the files no i didnt think that he looked away anyway there wasnt i dont know what the hell brandt meant if he meant anything the important thing is what wasnt there these guys are clean teitel doesnt think theyre so clean hes a jew what do you expect jake looked over at him maybe not to hear an american say that he said quietly you know what i mean the guys on a fucking crusade well hes not getting these guys theres nothing there jake stood up there must be something tully figured he could sell to the russians well not that they were nazis the russians dont care and neither do we shaeffer raised his head posterboy chin out not these guys outside the light had begun to fade the lingering soft end of the day in the billet theyd be getting ready for dinner the old woman ladling soup jake left the jeep and walked down gelferstrasse thinking of that first evening when liz had flirted with him in the bath about the time tully must have been reading files waiting for someone or had he been surprised start the numbers over tully arriving at the airport somewhere in the blur of lizs pictures unless they were just another empty file too the old man was setting the table as he passed by the dining room avoiding the drinks crowd in the lounge upstairs his room had been dusted and aired the pink chenille spread stretched tight maid service lizs photographs were stacked neatly on the vanity table just as hed left them in no particular order the wrecked plane in the tiergarten some dps off in the corner churchill the boys from missouri another but not a duplicate the pose slightly shifted liz was like all the photographers hed knownsnap lots of pictures and pretend the good one was the only one youd taken a random art one hed missed before him looking at the rubble in pariserstrasse shoulders slumped his face slack with disappointment in a magazine without a caption he might have been a returning soldier he glanced up at his real face in the mirror somebody else the airport he pulled the glossy out of the pile and studied it moving his eyes slowly over the picture as if he were developing it trying to sharpen figures in the blur the effect oddly was like looking at the shot in pariserstrasse a scene out of context had he really been there a second of time hed missed ron standing at the center with his cocky grin the tempelhof crowd swirling behind him the back of a head that might be brian stanleys the bald spot catching the light a french soldier with a pompom hat nothing he picked up the next photograph almost the same but angled liz having moved farther left if you flipped from one to the other the figures moved like old posture pictures off to the right a small gleam polished boots he brought the photograph close to his face fuzzier then held it out again maybe boots the right height but the face was indistinct he flipped them again but the gleam didnt move if it had been tully hed been standing still his side to the camera looking left the knock was no more than a polite tap scarcely audible jake swiveled to see the old mans head poking around the door excuse me herr geismar i dont mean to disturb you what is it for a second the old man just looked blinking and jake wondered if he was seeing his daughter again in her usual seat dusty with powder herr erlich said to ask you about the basement room the photographic equipment its not to hurry you but you understand we need the room when its convenient im sorry i forgot ill clean it out right away when its convenient he said backing out jake followed him down the stairs and was almost at the basement door when ron came out of the lounge glass in hand i thought i saw you slinking around dining in tonight the same grin as if he were still in the photograph cant im just clearing out lizs things where should i send them i dont know press camp i guess listen dont run away ive got something for you he took a folded paper from his pocket dont ask me why but they okayed it she requested it they said there something between you two i dont know about anyway youre in just show them this he held out the paper dont forget you dont own this one everybody gets a piece of this a piece of what the interview renate naumann the one you asked for remember christ here im turning cartwheels for the soviets and you could care less typical she asked to see me maybe she thought youd catch her good side i wouldnt wait on this by the way the russians change their minds every five minutes besides you could use the story the natives are getting restless he pulled a telegram from the same pocket and held it up youve read it had to regulations and great mail response hero story he quoted without opening it send new copy asap friday latest he tapped jakes chest with both papers saved by the bell hero you owe me one yeah jake said taking them put it on my bill lizs darkroom was a small musty enclosure near the coal bin with deep wooden crates in one corner for root vegetables a table with three trays for solutions under a dangling light fixed with her portable red bulb a few tins of developer and some prints hanging from a string like laundry a box of matte paper why not let the old couple have it all it was bound to be worth something in the market but who took photographs these days were there weddings anymore in berlin liz at any rate had taken a lot the table was littered with contact sheets the loose pile held down by a heavy magnifying glass the kind librarians use to read small type jake looked through it and the postagestamp frames zoomed up to life size powerful enough to see if a gleam was coming off boots he put it in his pocket then stacked the rest of the equipment at one end of the table against the wall there was a side table with another set of prints he flipped through the same pictures hed seen upstairs but different shots not quite as sharpdiscards the ones no editor would ever see the chancellery the airport again ron still grinning but the background even less clear it was when he held it up to the dim light looking for boots that his eye caught the dull shine of the gun hanging on the wall he put down the print reached for the holster and brought it over to the light a colt but everyone had onestandard issue he took it out surprised at its weight the gun she should have been wearing in potsdam three of them in the market he stared at it for a minute reluctant even now to let his mind follow the thought through had it been fired they could match the bullet the carbon firing marks as distinctive as fingerprints but this was crazy he opened the gun an empty chamber he lifted it to his nose only a hint of old grease but what had he been expecting did the smell of firing hang in the chamber like ash or did it drift away but no bullets not even loaded a showpiece to keep the wolves away so much for frau hinkel surrounding him with deception he dropped the gun onto the prints then scooped up the pile with both hands and carried it all back upstairs the magnifying glass was small but it did the trickthe background still wasnt sharp but at least the blurs took shape uniforms passing in front of other uniforms definitely boots he followed the line upan american uniform a face that might have been tullys had to be anchored by the boots so liz had caught him after all but so what there was nothing he hadnt known before tully had arrived and now stood looking left at something jake moved the glass across the picture but there was only the back of brians head the same uniforms as before none of them looking toward tully and then the white edge he sat back and tossed the picture on the table frustrated rons grin a kind of taunt when his face fell on its double in the pile he even seemed to move his head in a laugh one more liz would have been saying moving around for a better angle ron the fixed point in a stereoscope how many had she taken jake leaned forward grabbing up the prints enough for a small panorama he collected the airport shots from the discard pile and laid them out with the others in a fan shape ignoring ron piecing together the overlapping bits of backgroundbrians head on brians head moving left matching the exit doors until the edges were covered and he could look across the crowd with tully he picked up the magnifying glass and moved in a straight line left from tullys facesoldiers going about their business the annoying bulk of rons head blocking the view behind but now more faces beyond the edge of the first picture some sharper than others a few looking back in tullys direction somebody waiting with a jeep jake forced himself to move the glass slowlyin the crowd you could miss a face in a blinkso that when he neared the edge he caught it a shape out of place narrow straight board patches across the shoulders the wrong uniform russian he stopped the glass body turned toward tully as if he had sighted him and then the face almost clear among the blurs because it was so familiar the broad cheeks and shrewd slavic eyes sikorsky had met him jake looked again afraid the face would dissolve in the fuzzy crowd something he only thought he saw no mistakesikorsky whod been interested in nordhausen whod had willi watch professor brandt its a common name i think hed said to lena outside the adlon connected to emil where the numbers met and now connected to tully sikorsky whod been the greifer at potsdam a different connection jake stopped letting the glass go and reaching without thinking across the table for the gun feeling the same prickling unease hed felt behind the alex not different maybe the same connection after all a direct line to him blundering after tully the only one unwilling to let it go not shaeffer not liz he looked up into the mirror at the man sikorsky had pointed out standing behind liz in the market now that he knew what did he do with it call karlshorst for an interview he left the billet in an excited rush and then stood in the middle of gelferstrasse suddenly not sure which way to turn a few lights had come on in the dusk but he was alone in the street as deserted as a western town before a shootout he felt the gun strapped to his hip in one of gunthers stories hed be facing down the posse until the cavalry arrived with an empty gun he moved his hand away feeling helpless who could he go to gunther shopping for a new employer bernie absorbed in a different crime and then oddly enough he realized he was already where he needed to go dont forget whose uniform you have on the cavalry was just down the street scratching at a bandage breimer had joined shaeffer for dinner the two of them sitting with trays on their laps jake stopped halfway through the door what shaeffer said reading his face i need to see you shoot we dont have any secrets do we congressman breimer looked up expectantly fork in hand sikorsky has him jake said has who breimer said brandt shaeffer answered absently without looking at him how do you know he met tully at the airport liz took a pictureno mistake sikorskys had him all along fuck shaeffer said pushing away the tray thats what you thought isnt it breimer said to him i thought might well now you know jake said has great now what do we do shaeffer said not really a question get him back thats your specialty isnt it shaeffer looked up at him it would be nice to know where moscow breimer said the russians dont have to go through the damn state department to get things donethey just do it well thats that he said leaning back and after all we no hes in berlin jake said what makes you say that theyre still looking for his wife brandts no good to them if he wont cooperatethey want to keep him happy any suggestions shaeffer said thats your department put some men on sikorsky its just a matter of time before he goes visiting shaeffer shook his head thinking that might be a little unfriendly since when did that stop you you boys dont want to go starting anything breimer said unexpectedly now that were in bed again he picked up the stars and stripes on the windowsill russia joins war on japs just in time for the kill the bastards who asked them he put his fork down as if the thought had ruined his appetite so now we play niceynicey and theyd just as soon slit your throat as look at you if you ask me we picked the wrong fight jake looked at him disturbed not if you read the nordhausen files he said anyway maybe youll get another chance oh its coming breimer said ignoring jakes tone dont you worry about that godless bastards he looked over at shaeffer but meanwhile youd better keep the cowboy stuff to a minimum i guess mgll be bending over for the russians now he paused for a while its no good anyway shaeffer said still thoughtful we cant tail sikorsky theyd pick it up in a minute not if you had the right tail jake said leaning against the bookshelf arms folded such as i know a german who knows him professional he might be interested for a price how much a persil whats that breimer said but nobody answered instead shaeffer reached for a cigarette staring at jake i cant promise that he said flicking his lighter my signature doesnt mean shit hed have to work on spec of course if he actually located brandt youd find a better signature ill ask youre talking about hiring a german breimer said why not you do jake said breimers head snapped back as if hed been slapped thats an entirely different matter yeah i know reparations you dont want to get mixed up with germans breimer said to shaeffer fiats an american operation suit yourself jake said somebodys got to get to sikorsky hes the only lead weve got shaeffer looked at him through the smoke not saying anything well you guys think it over jake said moving away from the shelf impatient you wanted me to find brandt i found him at least how to find him now the balls in your court meanwhile can i borrow some ammo he patted the gun liz was fresh out same colt too he said to shaeffer i thought press werent allowed to carry arms breimer said missing the look between them thats before i started working for fiat now i get nervous i notice you carry one he nodded toward the bulge in breimers pocket for your information this is going to a boys father in my district shaeffer opened the drawer to his nightstand took out a box and threw it to jake careful you dont shoot yourself with it jake said to breimer hell of a way to lose an election he sat on the bed and fit the bullets into the gun then snapped it closed there thats better now all i have to do is learn how to use it shaeffer whod been quiet running the tip of his cigarette around the ashtray now looked up geismar this isnt going to work you know i was kidding i know how no with sikorsky were not going to get anywhere with a tail yours or ours i know him if hes got brandt stashed away even his own men arent going to know where hes careful they must have their own kransberg start there shaeffer looked down at the ashtray again avoiding eye contact you have to bring her in bring who in breimer said geismars a friend of the wifes well for christs sake no jake said shes not going anywhere yes she is shaeffer said quietly jaw set shes going to see her husband and well be right behind her its the only way weve been waiting for brandt to come to her now the funs over we have to give sikorsky what he wants its the only way to flush him out like hell it is when did you get this bright idea ive been thinking it over theres a way to work it but we need her you set it up with sikorskyor get your friend to do it even better that might be worth a persil she goes to visit well have a team on her the whole time theres no danger to her none we get them both back i guarantee it you guarantee it with bullets all over the place not a chance think again no bullets i said theres a way to work it all she has to do is get us there shes not bait got it not bait she wont do it shed do it if you asked her shaeffer said calmly jake got up from the bed looking from one to the other both sets of eyes fixed on him i wont do that why not and risk her i dont want him back that much but i do shaeffer said look the best way to do this is nicemakes for a better team effort but its not the only way if you wont bring her in ill do it myself after you find her i know where she is right across from kadewe you think we didnt watch you he said almost smug jake looked at him surprised you should have watched harder then i moved her i wanted to keep her out of the russians hands now it looks like ill have to keep her out of yours too and i will nobody touches her understand one move and were gone again i can do it too i know berlin you used to now youre just a guy in uniform like the rest of us people do what they have to do well she doesnt have to do this get another idea shaeffer he started moving toward the door and by the way i resign i dont want to be a deputy anymore go watch someone else breimer had been following this like a spectator but now interrupted his voice smoothing over folksy son i think you forget whose side youre on kind of thing happens when you get your head up some kraut skirt you need to think again were all americans here some of us are more american than others whats that supposed to mean it means you havent got my vote no your vote this isnt a town meeting theres a war going on here you fight it well i intend to and so will you what do you think were doine here i know what youre doing here the countrys on its knees and all you want to do is give favors to the people who put it there and kick everyone else in the balls that your idea of our side take it easy jake shaeffer said ive seen a lot of men die years of them they didnt do it to keep things fat for i g farben breimer flushed just who the hell do you think you are talking like that its just his mouth shaeffer said who jake said an american i get to say no thats what it means im saying no to you got it no of all the pissant drop it jake shaeffer said his voice like a hand on jakes shoulder pulling him back jake looked at him suddenly embarrassed enjoy your dinner he said turning to the door but breimer was on his feet now almost knocking over the tray as he got up you think i dont know how to deal with guys like you youre a dime a dozen you dont want to play ball ill get your ass fired right out of here bunch of pinks running around all mouth thats what you are and they love it the russians aid and comfort to the enemy thats what youre doing and you dont even know it is that why they took a shot at me jake said turning back funny thing about that though an american shot tully not sikorsky so why did sikorsky want to kill me seems like he might have been doing a favor for someone on our side the one were all on who knows maybe you breimer gaped at him but somebody one of ours makes you a little reluctant to take sides all things considered geismar see me tomorrow shaeffer said well talk the answers still no you dont want to be alone out there too long think about it thats it breimer said man thumbs his nose at the us government and just goes back to his girlfriend and thats it hell be back shaeffer said were all a little hot under the collar here he looked at jake sleep on it im only thumbing my nose at you jake said to breimer ignoring shaeffer feels good tookind of a patriotic gesture this is a waste of time breimer said abruptly to shaeffer go pick her up shell do what shes told jake put his hand on the door then turned back his voice icy maybe we should be clear about one thing you lay a hand on her one hand and you wont know what hit you you dont scare me try this theres a big hole in a national magazine waiting for me to fill it maybe a father in utica getting his boys gun theres a congressman not too busy to run an errand of mercy picture them together it practically brings tears to your eyes or maybe the same congressman in berlin not so nice lobbying for nazi war criminals on your tax dollars while our boys are still dying in the pacific heres the picture layout farben ran a factory at auschwitz we get a shot of the farben board then right next to it one of the camp one with a lot of bodies stacked up ill bet we can even find an old one prewar of the farben boys shaking hands with their friends at american dye for all i know youre in it too then a nice one of youone of lizs she always wanted a credit in colliers i figure fiat owes her jesus geismar shaeffer said thats a lie breimer said but i can write it i know how to do it ive written lots of lies for our side i can fucking write it and you can spend the next two years denying it now leave her alone breimer stood for a moment without breathing his eyes fixed on jake when he spoke his voice was hard not even a trace of back home you just burned one hell of a bridge for some german pussy jake opened the door then looked back over his shoulder at shaeffer thanks for the ammo tell you what if i do find him ill send up a flare shaeffer was looking down at the floor as if someone had made a mess but raised his head as jake walked out geismar he said bring her in jake walked past the gi guard and the nurse coming down the hallway for the trays then he was out in gelferstrasse again even more alone than before contents previous chapter next chapter chapter fifteen gunther refused the job agreeing ironically with shaeffer it would never work hes careful and you know this is not police work this is i know what it is i didnt realize you were so choosy a question more of resources gunther said blandly we know he met tally jake said so vassilys the paymaster but who else did tully meet not herr brandt i think with an american bullet the one leads to the other and sikorsky knows where emil is evidently but you keep confusing the cases who is it exactly you wish to find herr brandt or the man who killed tully both gunther looked at him sikorsky wont lead us to herr brandt but he may lead us to the other if he doesnt suspect we know you see its a question of resources so what do you intend to do just leave emil with the russians gunther shrugged my friend i dont care who makes the rockets we already made ours you can see with what results he got up from his chair to pour more coffee for now lets just solve our case herr brandt im afraid will have to wait he cant wait jake said frustrated gunther looked over the edge of his cup then read the files i read the files read again theyre complete everything he handed over then it must be therewhat vassily wants you see its the interesting point why did tully have to die at all the deal was a success vassily got what he wanted tully got paid a success so why unless it wasnt finished there must be something else vassily wants besides lena gunther shook his head dismissing this herr brandt wants her vassily is just the good host no something else in the files why else would tully read them so go read he wriggled his fingers a schoolmaster shooing jake away jake checked his watch all right later first i have to do some work the journalist more black market jake glanced up sorry now that he had mentioned it no actually renate an interview ah gunther said walking back to the chair with his cup avoiding it by the way he said sitting down did you check the motor pool no i assumed sikorsky drove all the way to zehlendorf well maybe so but i like to be neat cross the ts okay later gunther picked up the cup half hiding his face herr geismar ask her something for me jake waited ask her how it felt at the detention center near the alex he was shown into a small room as plain as the makeshift courta single table two chairs a picture of stalin the escort with elaborate courtesy offered coffee and then left him alone to wait nothing to look at but the ceiling fixture a frosted glass bowl that might once have been lighted with gas a wilhelmine leftover renate was led in through the opposite door by two guards who left her at the table and positioned themselves against the wall still as sconces hello jake she said her smile so tentative that her face seemed not to move at all the same pale gray smock and roughly cut hair renate give me a cigarettetheyll think you have permission she said in english sitting down you want to do this in english some so they wont suspect anything one of them speaks german thank you she said switching now to german as she took the light and inhaled my god its better than food you never lose your taste for it im not allowed to smoke back there where is your notebook i dont need one jake said confused suspect what no please i want you to write things down you have it he pulled the pad out of his pocket noticing for the first time that her hand was trembling nervous under the sure voice the cigarette shook a little as she lowered it to the ashtray he busied himself with his pen at a loss ask her how it felt gunther said but what could she possibly say a hundred nods watching people being bundled into cars its so difficult to look at me reluctantly he raised his head and met her eyes still familiar under the jagged hair i dont know how to talk to you he said simply she nodded the worst person in the world i knowthats what you see worse than anybody i didnt say that but you dont look either worse than anybody how could she do those things thats the first question if you like do you know the answer she didntsomebody else did in here she tapped her chest two people one is the monster the other is the same person you used to know the same look at that one can you do that just for now they dont even know she exists she said tilting her head slightly toward the guards but you do jake said nothing waiting write something please we dont have much time another jerky pull on the cigarette anxious why did you ask to see me because you know me not this other person you remember those days she looked up from the ashtray you wanted to sleep with me once yes dont deny it and you know i would have said yes in those days the americans they were all glamorous to us like people in the films everyone wanted to go there i would have said yes isnt it funny how things turn out jake looked at her appalled her voice was wavering like her hand edgy and intimate at the same time the desperate energy of a crazy person he glanced down at the notebook anchoring himself is that what you want to talk about old times yes a little she said in english please its important for them her eyes moved to the guards again then fixed back on him steady not crazy a girl getting away with something so she said in her german voice what happened to everybody do you know when he didnt answer still disconcerted she reached over to touch his hand tell me hal went back to the states he began confused watching her at least he was on his way the last time i saw him she nodded encouraging him to go on remember hannelore shes here in berlin i saw her thinner she kept his flat the small talk of catching up what did the guards make of it standing under stalin renate nodded taking another cigarette they were lovers so she said i never knew well i was a better reporter the best he said smiling a little involuntarily drawn back with her nothing escaped you he stopped embarrassed in the room again no its a talent she said looking away and you what happened to you i write for magazines no more radio and your voice was so good renate we need to and lena she said ignoring him shes alive jake nodded shes here with me her face softened im happy for you so many years she left the husband she will when they find him hes missing when who finds him the americans want him to work for thema scientist hes a valuable piece of property is he she said to herself intrigued by this and always so quiet how things turn out she looked back at him so theyre all still alive well i havent heard from nanny wendt nanny wendt she said her voice distant in a kind of reverie i used to think about all of you from that time you know i was happy i loved the work you did that for me no german would do that not then even off the books i wondered sometimes why you did not even jewish you could have been arrested maybe i was too dumb to know any better when i saw you in the court she lowered her head her voice trailing off now he knows too i thought now hell only see her she tapped the right side of her chest the greifer but you still asked to see me theres no one else you helped me once you remember who was jake shifted in his chair awkward renate i cant help you i have nothing to do with the court oh that she said waving her cigarette no not that theyll hang me i know it im going to die she said easily theyre not going to hang you its so different theyll send me east no one comes back from the east always the east first the nazis now them no one comes back i used to see them go i know you said you didnt know i knew she said pointing again then to the other side she didnt she didnt want to know how else to do it every week more faces how could you do it if you knew after a while she could do anything no tears a job its all true what they said in there the shoes the cafe heil all of it and the work camps she thought that how else could she do it thats what happened to her jake looked up nodding to her real side and what happened to her yes she said wearily you came for that go ahead write she sat up darting her eyes sideways to the guards where shall we start after you left the visa never came twentysix marks a birth certificate four passport pictures and twentysix marks thats all except somebody had to take you and there were too many jews already even with my english i can still speak it you see she said switching not a bad accent speak for a whiletheyll think im showing off for you so theyll be used to it the accents fine jake said still confused but meeting her gaze but im not sure i understand everything youre saying any change of expression from them she said no so i stayed in berlin she said in german and of course things got worse the stars the special benches in the park you know all that then the jews had to work in factories i was in siemenstadt my mother too an old woman she could barely stand at the end of the day still we were alive then the roundups started our names were there i knew what it would meanhow could she live so we went underground uboats yes thats how i knew you see how it was what they would do all their tricks the shoesno one else thought of that so clever they told me but i knew i had the same problem so i knew they would go there and of course they did but you didnt stay underground no they caught me how she smiled to herself a grimace a greifer a boy i used to know he always liked me i wouldnt go with hima jew i never thought of myself as jewish you see i waswhat german to think of that now an idiot but there he was in the cafe and i knew he must be underground too by that time i hadnt spoken to anyone in days do you know what thats like not to talk you get hungry for it like food and i knew he liked me and i thought maybe he would help me anyone who could help and did he she shrugged to the gestapo car they took me in and beat me not so bad not like some of the others but enough so i knew i wasnt german anymore and the next time would be worse they wanted to know where my mother was i didnt tell them but i knew i would the next time and then he did help he had friends there friends the devils he worked for he said he could make a bargain for me i could work with him and theyd keep us off the list my mother too if i went with him after this i said and you know what he said to me tts never too late to make a bargain in this life only in the next she paused so i went with him that was the bargain he got me and i kept my life the first time i was sent out we went together his pupil but i was the one who spotted the woman that day i knew the look you see and after the first timewell what does it matter how many its just the first one over and over what happened to him he was deported when he was with me it was all right for him we were a team but then they split us up and on his own he was not so successful i was the one i had the eye he had nothing to bargain anymore so she squashed out the cigarette but you did jake said watching her well i was better at it and becker liked me i kept my looks you see here she pointed to her left cheek folded up near the edge of her eye only this when they beat me my face was swollen but it went down only this and becker liked that it reminded him maybe i dont know of what she looked away finally distressed oh my god how can we talk this way how can i describe what it was like what difference does it make write anything you want it cant be worse you think im making excuses it was david it was becker yes and it was me i thought i could do this that we could talk but when i talk about itlook at your faceyou see her the one who killed her own thats what they want for the magazines im just trying to understand it understand it you want to understand what happened in germany how can you understand a nightmare how could i do it how could they do it you wake up you still cant explain it you begin to think maybe it never happened at all how could it thats why they have to get rid of me no evidence no greifer it never happened she was shaking her head and looking away her eyes beginning to fill now look i thought i was finished with that no tears not like my mother she cried enough for both how can you do this well it was easy for her i had to do the work not her every time i looked at her tears you know when they stopped when she got in the truck absolutely dry i thought shes relieved not to have to live this way anymore to see me jake took a handkerchief from his back pocket and handed it to her she didnt think that renate blew her nose still shaking her head no she did but what could i do oh stop she said to herself wiping her face i didnt want to do this not in front of you i wanted you to see the old renate so you would help jake put down the pen renate he said quietly you know it wont make any difference what i write its a soviet court it doesnt matter to them no not that i need your help please she reached for his hand again youre the last chance its finished for me then i saw you in the court and i thought not yet not yet theres one more chance hell do it do what oh look at this she said wiping her eyes again i knew if i started she turned to the guards and for an instant it occurred to jake that she was playing the tears part of some larger performance do what he said again please she said to the guard would you bring me some water the guard on the right the german speaker nodded said something in russian to the other and left the room write this down she said to jake in english her voice low as if it were coming from the back of a sob wortherstrasse in prenzlauer the third building down from the square on the left toward schonhauserallee an old berliner building the second courtyard frau metzger what is this renate write it please theres not much time you remember in court i told you i didnt do it for myself yes i know your mother no she looked at him her eyes sharp and dry i have a child jakes pen stopped a child write it metzger she doesnt know about me she thinks i work in a factory i pay her but the money runs out this month she wont keep him now renate please his name is erich a german namehes a german child you understand i never had it done you know

the east shell give him up to the russians you must take himtheres no one else jake if you were ever fond of me at all are you crazy yes crazy do you think after everything else ive done i couldnt ask

but hes alive i saved him with their money they gave me pocket money you know for the cafes for she stopped every pfennig was for him i thought youre paying to keep a jew alive at least one of us is

of her everything i didone more day one more day alive how can i give up now if you take him to america they can hang me at least ill know i got him out safe out of this place she grabbed his hand again hed never know what his mother did to live with that hed never know renate how could i take a child to america the west then anywhere but here you could find a place for himi trust you i know youd make it all right decent people not some russian camp what do i tell him that his mother died in the war hes so young he wont remember just some woman who used to come sometimes you can tell him you used to know her when she was a girl but she died in the war she did she said looking down its not a lie jake looked at the blotchy face the sharp eyes finally dulled by a sadness so oppressive that he felt his own shoulders sinking always something worse he nodded his head toward the side she thought was real she didnt he said her face was confused for a second then cleared almost in a smile thats only for today so i could ask you after this theres only her she said putting her finger on the other side its over it doesnt have to be at least let me talk to the lawyers oh jake to say what you were there you saw them what would mercy bea russian prison who survives that people do to come back as what an old woman back to germany and meanwhile what happens to erich no its over if you want to help me save my child ah the water she said fluttering a little as the guard came through the door with a glass and handed it to her thank you she said in german its very kind as she drank the guard looked at the other guard with an anything happen expression answered by a shrug so youll help renate said renate you cant ask me to do this im sorry but i dont in english now she said switching im not asking you im begging you what about his father dead when we were underground one night he didnt come back thats all so i knew i had the baby myself she handed back the handkerchief you be the father stop i cant do that hell die she said her eyes fixed on his now when its over after everything jake turned his head taking in the guards stalins flat iconic gaze look he said finally i know a church they work with children orphans try to place them i can talk to the pastor hes a good man maybe theres something he they find homes in the west with christians well yes they would be ill ask maybe he knows a jewish family no a german boy so hell be safe next time you want him to be german jake said amazed the endless twisted cord i want him to live americanshow can you know how people are here but promise me a home not some camp i cant promise that renate i dont know ill talk to the pastor ill do what i can ill try but youll move him from frau metzger before she gives him up renate i cant promise yes promise me lie to me my god cant you see i have to tell myself this i have to think its going to be all right i wont lie to you ill do what i can youll have to be satisfied with that because i have nothing to bargain with you mean finally no more jews jake looked away every week a new list trading yourself until there was no other way to live he had become one of her bosses what do they say about the trial he said moving somewhere else my lawyers she said a trace of scorn to be clever play the innocentthat i couldnt help what i was doing to be sorry well its not enough to be sorry its not enough for me i cant make it go away i still see the faces how they looked at me i cant make them go away one minute the guard shouted out in german renate drew a cigarette from the pack one more she said in english for the road thats right isnt it for the road yes ill come back no they wont allow that only this once but im so glad to see you someone from that world in berlin again i never thought she stopped grabbing his hand wait a minute i cant bargain with it but maybe its something if hes still there promise me renate dont do this you said they were looking for him the americans so maybe its something for you lenas husbandi know where he is i saw him jake looked up stunned where promise me she said steadily still covering his hand one last bargain he nodded where can i believe you where as if i have a choice she said time the guard called one minute she turned back to jake conspiratorial talking quickly burgstrasse the old gestapo building number twentysix it was bombed you know but they still use part they kept me there before here and you saw him there out the window across the courtyard he didnt see me i thought my god thats emil why do they have him here is he on trial too is he no what was he doing just looking down into the courtyard then the lights went out thats all is that something for you can you use that youre sure it was him of course my eyes are good you know always the guard approached the table give him some cigarettes she said in english standing theyll be nice to me jake got up and offered the pack so its good she said one last job for you jake nodded yes then promise me all right she smiled then her face twitched the skin falling slack as if she were about to weep again finally drained of all composure then its over before he could react she moved around the table to jake and while the guard stuffed cigarettes into his pocket put her arms around him almost falling into him he stood awkwardly catching her not really embracing her feeling her bones sticking through the smock brittle enough to snap she hugged him once then turned her mouth up to his ear hidden from the guard thank you hes my life she stepped back and let the guard take her arm but put her other hand on jakes chest pulling at the cloth but never tell him please when the guard tugged her arm she went with him looking over her shoulder at jake trying to smile but the walk was clumsy a halfhearted forced shuffle not even a trace of the lively steps he remembered on the platform burgstrasse was only a few blocks west of the alex but he drove feeling safer in the jeep thered be no point in stopping but he had to see if it was there at all not some lie a last attempt to keep playing the angles the street was across the open sewer of the spree from the smashedin cathedral but part of number was still standing just as shed said flying a red flag he passed it slowly pretending to be lost thick walls stripped now of plaster a heavy entrance door blocked by guards with asiatic facesthe familiar russian hierarchy mongols at the bottom behind it all somewhere emil looking out a window but how could shaeffer get in a raid in the middle of berlin bullets zinging over lenas head impossible without some trick but that was his specialty let him plan it at least now they knew renates last catch her part of the bargain he stopped near the end of the street to check his walletenough money for frau metzger until he could get fleischman to come one final payment off the books the prenzlauer building was an old tenement block three courtyards deep he followed renates instructions to the second strung with laundry then up two flights of murky stairs lighted by a hole some shell had punched through the ceiling he had to knock a few times before the door finally opened a suspicious crack frau metzger ive come about erich youve come and whats the matter with her too busy she opened the door its about time does she think im made of money nothing since june nothing on account how am i supposed to feed anyone a boy needs to eat ill pay for what she owes jake said taking out his wallet so now shes found an american well its not my affair better than a russian at least lots of chocolate for you now she said turning to a child standing near the table about four jake guessed skinny legs in short pants with renates dark eyes but larger almost too large for the face wide now in alarm come on lets get your things dont be afraid hes your mothers friend she said not unkind but brusque then turned back to jake her friend shes a fine one while the rest of us no its too much she said looking at the money she only owes for two months im not a thief only whats owed ill get his things no you dont understand ill send somebody for him i cant take him today what do you mean shes not dead is she no then he goes now im going to my sister you think im staying here with the russians ill give her one more week i said and

see how hes frightened well he never says much say hello erich ouf she waved her hand well hes like that the boy stared at him silently not fear a numb curiosity an animal waiting to see what would happen to him but i cant take him today yes today i waited and waited you cant expect she began emptying a drawer putting things in a string bag the wars over you know what does she expect here i told you theres not much she handed him the bag past arguing jake pulled out his wallet again but i cantlet me pay you something extra a gift well thats very nice she said taking it so maybe shes lucky now you see erich hes all right youll be fine come give auntie a hug she bent down barely clasping him an indifferent sendoff how long had they been together the boy stood not moving go on she said giving him a little push go to your mother the boy jerked forward jake looked at her hand on the boys shoulder stung his heart dulled by every terrible thing hed heard in berlin and now moved finally by this a single moment of casual cruelty what had happened to everybody the boy took a step looking down frau metzger flicked through jakes bills then shoved them in her apron pocket thats all you can say to him jake said just like that hes a child what do you know about it she said eyes flashing i took care of him didnt i while she had her good times i earned every mark and how long will you last i wonder well tell her not to come back when its overthe hotel is closed she had reached the door and held it open then looked down at erich with a twinge of embarrassment i did the best i could you you be a good boy dont forget dont forget your auntie and then they were in the hall the door closing behind them a soft click maybe the only thing the boy wouldnt forget a click of the door they stood motionless for a second and then the boy lifted his hand still not speaking just waiting to be led away it was no better in the jeep he sat quietly passive watching the streets go by like the children from silesia down the gentle slope of schonhauserallee then out past the pockmarked walls of the schloss to the linden bicycles and soldiers the plane wreckage in the tiergarten registering everything without a word he took jakes hand again on the walk from savignyplatz my god whos this lena said another one for fleischman erich but where did you hes renates child you remember from the office renate but i thought all the jews he stopped her its a long story ill tell you later first lets get him to the church first some food i think she said kneeling down look how thin youre hungry dont be afraid its safe here do you like cheese she led him over to the table and brought out a small block of rubbery px cheese the boy looked at it warily its real lena said thats the color it is in america here theres still some bread its all righteat he picked up the bread dutifully and took a nibble so erich its a good name i knew an erich once dark hair like yours she reached over and touched it its good the bread here try some more she broke off a piece and offered it to him by hand gently the way you would feed a stray see i told you now some cheese she fed him for a few minutes until he began to eat on his own taking in the food as quietly as the sights on the drive she looked up at jake where is she jake shook his head a notinfrontofthechild gesture hes been living with a woman in prenzlauer i think hes had a rough time he doesnt say much well its not so important is it to talk she said to the boy sometimes im quiet too when things are new well have something to eat then maybe a little rest you must be tired all the way from prenzlauer the boy was nodding at her reassured jake saw by her german familiar without jakes accent we should get him to fleischman jake said its getting late theres plenty of time she said easily then turned but if shes alive youre taking him from his mother to fleischman i promised her id find a place ill explain later he said feeling the boys eyes on him lena offered him another piece of cheese its good yes theres moretake as much as you like then well sleep what do you say her voice soft lulling lena jake said he cant stay here we cant yes i know she said not really hearing it but for one night that basement you can see how tired he is its all strange for him you know my name she said to the boy its lena she yawned an exaggerated gesture raising her hand to her mouth oh im so tired too lena jake said you know what i mean she looked at him yes i know its just for tonight whats the matter with you you cant send him away like this look at his eyes men but the eyes were still wide not drooping moving from one to the other as if he were making a decision finally he fixed them on jake got up and came over to him lifting his hand again for a second confused jake thought he was asking to leave but then he spoke surprisingly clear after the long silence i have to go to the bathroom he said holding out his hand lena smiled laughing softly to herself well youre good for that she said as jake led him two men to the toilet after that there was nothing to do but let her take charge whatever hed planned slipping away like a card move turned by an unexpected joker in the deck from the table he could see her settle the boy on the bed running her hand over his forehead and talking softly a low steady stream of words he lit a cigarette restless then glanced at his notebook renate being picked up in the cafe an idle flirtation the greifers greifer the story ron wanted him to share he looked again into the bedroom where lena was still talking the boy to sleep and not knowing what else to do started putting the notes in order to block out the story wondering how to tell it without the one thing that had really mattered but when he took a sheet of paper it seemed to frame itself opening with marthe behn then dissolving to the first cafe and working its way back one sinking twist after another to the moment of the nod not an apologia something more complicated a crime story where everyone was guilty he wrote in a rush wanting to get it done as if it would all go away once it was on paper just words the shoes the mother hans becker trading favors still beyond belief what had happened to everybody a city where he used to drink beer under trees how many had even looked up in the cafe when the men arrived not accomplices people looking the other way except renate who still saw the faces hed been writing for a while lost in it before he realized that the murmuring in the bedroom had stopped the only sound in the flat the faint scratch of his pen lena was standing in the doorway watching him a tired smile on her face hes asleep she said youre working i wanted to get it done while its fresh sewing with a hot needle she said a german expression she sat down across from him taking one of the cigarettes i dont think hes well i want rosen to look at him just in case i saw him again today hes always here it seems he takes care of the girls oh she said a little flustered i didnt realize still a doctor lena we cant keep him you dont want to get attached yes i know but for one night she stopped looking at him thats the terrible part isnt it nobodys attached to him nobody i thought standing over there its a little like a family you working like this him sleeping were not his family he said but gently no she said letting it go so tell me about renate what happened he wont hear now here he said moving the papers across the table its all there he got up and went over to the brandy bottle and poured two glasses he set hers down but she ignored it her eyes fixed on the page she told you this she said reading yes my god a slow turn of the page when she finished she pushed the papers back then took a sip from the glass you dont mention the child she doesnt want anybody to know especially the child but nobody will know why she did it does it matter what people think the fact is she did it for the child you do anything for your child thats what she said he said slightly jarred lena this is what she wanted she doesnt want him to know who he is that would be a hell of a thing to carry around with you wouldnt it all this he said touching the paper hes better off this way hell never have to know any of it not to know your parents she said brooding sometimes it cant be helped she looked up at him then put her hands on the table to get up yes sometimes she said turning away do you want something to eat i can fix no sit i have some news he paused renate saw emil she told me where he is she stopped halfway out of her chair you waited to tell me this there wasnt time with the boy she sat down so its come where the russians are holding him in a building in burgstrasse burgstrasse she said trying to place it in the east its guarded i went to see it and and its guarded you dont just walk in so what do we do we dont do anything we let shaeffers team handle ittheyre experts at this experts at what kidnapping thats what it will mean the russians arent going to hand him overthey probably wont even admit they have him so shaeffer needs to figure out a way he wanted to use you kind of a decoy she looked down at the table taking this in then picked up the glass and finished her brandy yes all right she said all right what ill do it no you wont people go to the russians they dont always come back im not taking that risk this is a military operation lena we cant leave him there he came for mehe risked his life i owe him this much you dont owe him this but russians i told you ill talk to shaeffer if anybody can get him he can he wants him hes been waiting for this and you dont is that it you dont want him its not that simple she reached over you cant leave him there not with the russians i wont a few weeks ago you thought he was dead but hes not so now its this you were the detective looking everywhere so you found him i thought thats what you wanted it was but not now not if its dangerous for you im not afraid of that i want it to be over what kind of life do you think it will be for us knowing hes there with them i want it to be over not this prisonyou dont even want me to leave the flat talk to your friend tell him i want to do it i want to get him out so you can leave him he wont thank you for that she lowered her head no he wont thank me for that but hell be free and thats the only reason she looked over at him then reached across touching his face with her finger what a little boy you are after everything thats happened to be jealous emils my familyits different not the way it is with you dont you know that i thought i did thought and then like that a schoolboy again you remember frau hinkel yes two lines she said i had to choose but i did even before the war i chose you how silly you are not to know that i still dont want you taking chances with shaeffer maybe thats my choice too mine he met her stare then looked away let me talk to him maybe he doesnt need you anyway now that we know where emil is then what then we wait we dont go into the east we dont go to burgstrasse theyll move him for sure if they think we know and we dont volunteer understand but youll tell me if they do want he nodded cutting her off then snatched her hand i dont want anything to happen to you well do you know something neither do i she said making light of it then rubbed his hand not now she tilted her head alert was that him let me check she slid her hand away and hurried to the bedroom jake sat watching her go uneasy another bargain he shouldnt have made but nothing risky whatever shaeffer said and then what three of them she came back into the room with her finger to her lips half closing the door hes asleep but restless well have to be quiet hes going to stay in there well move him later when hes really asleep she came over to him and kissed his forehead then began unbuttoning his shirt what are you doing i want to see you not the uniform lena we have to talk about this no weve already talked its decided now were going to pretendthe children are asleep but theres the couch if were quiet lets see how quiet we can be youre just trying to change the subject ssh she kissed him not a sound he smiled at her wait till you hear the couch then well go slowly its nice slow she was right the quiet itself became exciting each touch furtive as if the creak of a spring would give them away when he slipped inside her he moved so slowly that it seemed something only they knew a secret between them betrayed by the gasp of breath in his ear then the gentle rocking an endless sweet tease until finally it ended as it began the same rhythm so that not even the shuddering disturbed the room around them she kept him in her afterward stroking his back and for a few minutes he felt no difference between making love and simply being there the one drifting into the other but the couch was cramped and awkward its lumps poking into the usual forgetting the unconsciousness of sex and instead of drifting his mind began to dart away had it been like this with them another couple using the couch so they wouldnt wake their boy uncannily as if hed spoken she reached up to touch his face i chose you she said yes he said kissing her then withdrew and sat up next to her restless do you think he heard she shook her head dreamy cover me i just want to lie here for a minute how can you get up i dont know do you want a drink he said going over to pour one look at you she said watching him then stirred lifting herself up jake the boyi noticed i thought all the jewsyou know she said nodding at his penis as selfconscious as renate had been even lying there still wet with him she didnt have it done she wanted him to be german lena sat up troubled holding the dress to cover herself she wanted that even after he took a drink to protect him lena yes she said dully shaking her head my god what it must have been like for her he looked down at the story on the table with its missing piece you said it yourselfyou do anything for your child he took the glass again then stopped it halfway to his lips and put it down in a rush of course of course what nothing he said moving over to his clothes something i just thought of where are you going she said watching him dress i dont know why i didnt see it a reporters supposed to know when somethings missing you read the story and you can feel its not there he looked up finally aware of her just a hunch ill be back at this hour dont wait up he bent over and kissed her forehead and dont open the door but what ssh not now he held his finger to his lips youll wake erich ill be back he raced out of the building then up the side street where hed stashed the jeep fumbling in the dark with the ignition there was only a glimmer of moon in the narrow streets off the square but when he got up to the broad charlottenburger chausee there was an open field of light pale white and unexpectedly beautiful now when he had no time to look at it the blunt unlovely city had turned graceful making him stop in surprise its secret self maybe there all the time when everything else was dark it occurred to him fancifully that it was finally lighting the way for him like hansels white pebbles down the wide empty street then up schloss strasse making good time and still there when he needed it most picking his way through the trail in the rubble all easy going so that he knew he must be right not even a shadow at young willis lookout post just the pointing friendly light when professor brandt opened the door he no longer had any doubts at all ive come for the files he said how did you know professor brandt said as jake started to read they were sitting at a table with a single lamp a pool of light just wide enough for the pages but not their faces so that his voice seemed disembodied he told them at kransberg you were dead jake said absently trying to concentrate what possible reason could he have unless he didnt want them to find you didnt want to take the chance that i would tell them he said i see he thought that maybe he thought theyd search he turned a page a report from mittelwerks in nordhausen another piece missing from the document center not crossreferenced never handed overthe missing part of the story like renates child why did he leave them with you he didnt know how bad it was in berlin how far the russians had come not just the east almost a circle only spandau was open but for how long a rumor thats all who knew it was possible he wouldnt get outi thought so myself if they were captured so he hid them with you in case did you read them later yes i thought he had died you see i wanted to know but you didnt destroy them no i thought someday its important theyll lie all of them we had nothing to do with it even now they i thought someone has to answer for this its important to know but you didnt turn them over either then you told me he was living i couldnt hes my son you understand still he paused causing jake to look up in his dressing gown he seemed frail no longer held together by the formal suit but the scrawny neck was erect as if the old high collar were still in place was it wrong i dont know herr geismar maybe i kept them for you maybe they answer to you he turned away and now its doneyou have them so take them please i dont want them in my house anymore youll excuse me im tired wait i need your help my german isnt good enough for that your german is adequate the problem maybe is believing what you read its just what it says simple german he made a small grimace the language of schiller not the abbreviations theyre all technical heres von braun requesting special workers french is that right yes french prisoners the ss supplied the list from the campsengineering students machinists von braun made his selection from that the construction workers it didnt matter one shovels as good as another but the precision work he looked over to the word jake was pointing at die cutter so he was there of course he was there they all went there to inspect to supervise it was their factory you understand the scientists they saw it herr geismar not space all those dreams they saw this you see the other letter from lechter where he says the disciplinary measures are having an unfortunate effect the workers dont like to see men hangingit slows production exact words his solution hang them offsite yes and lechter complains that on the last visit some of his colleagues were taken to an area where cholera had broken out couldnt this be prevented in the future visitors should be taken to safe areas only to risk the health he stopped clearing his throat would you like some water he said getting up an obvious excuse to leave the table jake turned another page hearing the water run behind him a memo requesting a transfer back to peenemunde for a dr jaeger proof that hed been there a carbon for the files evidence for bernie just paper was anyone not compromised drinking brandy at kransberg waiting for visas but how much had tully known he realized for the first time a gunther point that no one had actually seen the files but professor brandt tully must have left the center as frustrated as jake had been all the way to berlin for an incomplete story heres emil he said turning to a page filled with figures yes professor brandt said over his shoulder the estimates the estimates he shuffled back to his chair but of what whats this jake pointed to one of the sets of numbers calories professor brandt said quietly not looking clearly familiar with the paper eleven hundred jake said stuck on the math thats calories he looked over at the old man tell me professor brandt took a sip of water per day at eleven hundred calories per day how long would a man survive depending on the original body weight you see the series on the left if it fellto nine hundred saythe factors average out to sixty sixty daystwo months but of course its not exact the variables are not in the numbers in the men some more some less they die at their own speed but its useful the average you can calculate how many calories it would take to extend it say for another month but they never extended it the work in the first month before they weakened was actually more productive than any extension the table near the bottom demonstrates that there was no point in keeping them alive unless they were specialists the numbers prove it he looked up he was right i checked the math the second page shows how much to increase rations for skilled workers i think you know that he was using this to persuade them to allow more food but i cant be sure the others died to the formula an average only but accurate he based them on actual numbers from the previous month not a difficult exercise he interrupted himself for another sip then continued a teacher working through a long blackboard proof the others also simple time of assembly units per twentyfourhour period you dont have to look i remember them all optimum number of workers per line sometimes they had too many the assembly was complicated better to have one skilled set of hands than three men who didnt know what they were doing he proves this somewhere you would think common sense but evidently they liked to see this in numbers these were the kinds of problems they had him working on jake looked at the paper not saying anything letting professor brandt collect himself as he drank the last of the water he must have done other work not just this yes of course its a great achievement technically you can see that the mathematics involved the engineering every german can be proud he shook his head dreams of space this is what they were worth eleven hundred calories a day jake flicked through the remaining pages then closed the folder and stared at it not just emil most of the team youre surprised professor brandt said quietly your old friend jake said nothing just numbers on paper finally he looked up at professor brandt the simple inadequate question what happened to everybody you want to know that professor brandt said nodding then paused i dont know i asked too who were these children our children and whats my answer i dont know he glanced away toward the stuffed bookshelves my whole life i thought it was something apart science everything else is lies but not that so beautiful numbers always true if you understand them they explain the world i thought that he looked back at jake i dont know he said exhaling it a gasp even the numbers they ruined now they dont explain anything he reached over and picked up the folder you said you were his friend what will you do with this youre his father what would you do professor brandt brought it closer to his chest so that involuntarily jake started to reach out his hand a few pieces of paper the only proof bernie would ever have dont be alarmed professor brandt said its just thati want you to take it if i see him again i dont want to say i gave it up you took it jake gripped the file and pulled it firmly out of the old mans hands does it really make any difference i dont know but i can say it i didnt give them away him and his friends i can say that all right jake hesitated its the right thing you know yes the right thing professor brandt said faintly he drew himself up erect then moved away from the light just a voice again and youll tell lena that it wasnt me he paused if she stops coming you see theres no one he didnt have to tell her anything she was asleep on the bed clothed the boy next to her he closed the door and sank down on the lumpy couch to read through the file again even more dismayed than before time enough now to see the picture fill up with its grisly details each one a kind of indictment valuable to bernie but to who else is that what tully intended to sell but why would sikorsky want it the simple answer was that he didnthe wanted the scientists busily making their deals with breimer each page in the file a pointing finger that they thought had gone away valuable to them he lay back with his arm over his eyes thinking about tully a business in persilscheins before kransberg selling releases at bensheim sometimes selling them twice crooks followed a patternwhat worked once worked again and these were better than persilscheim as valuable as a ticket out deplorable things might have happened but there was nothing to involve them but pieces of paper something worth paying for when he awoke it was light and lena was at the table staring straight ahead the closed file in front of her did you read it he said sitting up yes she pushed the file aside you made notes are you going to write about this theyre points to verify at the document center to prove it all fits prove to whom she said vacantly then stood up do you want some coffee he watched her light the gas ring and measure out the coffee going through the ordinary motions of the morning ritual as if nothing had happened did you understand them i can explain no dont explain anything i dont want to know you have to know she turned away to face the stove go wash the coffee will be ready in a minute he got up and went over to the table glancing down at the folder caught off balance by her reaction lena we need to talk about this whats in here yes i know terrible things youre just like the russians look at the film see how terrible you are all you people what you did in the war i dont want to look anymore the wars over this isnt the war read it they starved people to death watched them die thats not the war thats something else stop it she said raising her hands to her ears i dont want to hear it emil didnt do those things yes he did lena he said quietly he did how do you know because of that paper how do you know what they ordered him to do what he had to do look at renate you think its the same a jew in hiding they wouldve murdered i dont know neither do you he had to protect his family tooit could be they took families maybe to protect me and peter you dont really believe that do you read it he flung open the folder read it he wasnt protecting you she looked down you want me to hate him its not enough for you that im with you you want me to hate him too i wont hes my family whats left of it hes all thats left read it jake said evenly this isnt about us no no its about some guy in burgstrasse with blood all over his hands i dont even know who he is anymore not anyone i know then let him tell you let him explain you owe him that owe him as far as im concerned he can rot in burgstrasse theyre welcome to him he looked at her stricken expression and then angry at himself for being angry left the room closing the bathroom door with a thud he splashed water on his face and rinsed his mouth as sour as his mood not about them except for her unexpected defense guilty with an explanation what everyone in berlin said now even her two lines in the cards still here even after the file he came back to find her standing where he had left her staring at the floor im sorry he said she nodded not saying anything then turned poured out the coffee and brought it to the table sit she said itll get cold a hausfrau gesture to signal it was over but when he sat down she stood next to the table her face still troubled we cant leave him there she said softly you think hell be better off in an allied prison thats what this means you know they try people for this he put his hand on the folder i wont leave him there you dont have to do it i will tell your friend shaeffer she said her voice flat he looked up at her i just want to know one thing she met his gaze i chose you she said not that not us just so i know do you believe whats in here what he did yes she said nodding barely audible he flipped open the cover and turned the pages then pointed to one of the tables this is how long it takes dont sixty days more or less he said unable to stop these are the death rates still want to get him out he looked up to find that her eyes had filled turning to him with a kind of mute pleading we cant leave him there with them she said he went back to the page with its spiky typed numbers and pushed it away two lines they avoided each other most of the morning afraid to start in again while she tended to erich and he worked up the rest of his notes about renate for ron the story they all had to have but at least his would be first ready to send at noon rosen turned up and examined the boy its a question of food only he said otherwise hes healthy jake relieved at the interruption gathered up his papers eager to get away but to his surprise lena insisted on coming along leaving erich with one of dannys girls i have to go to the press camp first he said then we can see fleischman no not fleischman she said something else and then didnt say anything more so they drove without talking drained of speech the press camp depleted after potsdam was quiet except for the poker game jake took only a minute to drop off the notes grabbing two beers from the bar on his way out here he said at the jeep handing her one no i dont want it she said not sullen but melancholy like the overcast skies she directed him toward tempelhof and as they got nearer her mood grew even darker nothing in her face but a grim determination whats at the airport no beyond the kirchhof keep going they entered one of the cemeteries that sprawled north of tempelhof where are we going i want to visit stop over there no flowers do you notice no one has flowers now what he saw instead were two gis with a pow work party digging a long row of graves what gives he said to one of the gis expecting an epidemic winter major says theyre going to drop like flies once the cold sets in get it done before the ground freezes jake looked beyond a cluster of tombstones to another set of fresh graves then another the whole cemetery pockmarked with waiting holes peters was a small marker no bigger than a piece of rubble set in a scraggly patch of ground they dont keep it up lena said i used to take care of it and then i stopped coming but you wanted to come today jake said uneasy this is about emil isnt it you think you know everything he did she said looking at the marker before you judge him maybe you should know this too lena why are we doing this he said gently it doesnt change anything i know he had a child she kept looking at the marker quiet then turned to him yours he had yours it was your child mine he said an involuntary word to fill the space taken up now by a kind of dizziness an absurd rush of elated surprise almost goofy caught off guard in some cartoon of waiting rooms and cigars in a graveyard he looked away mine he said guarded again why didnt you tell me why to make you sad if he had livedi dont know but he didnt but howyoure sure a disappointed halfsmile yes i can count you dont have to be a mathematician for that emil didnt know no how could i tell him that it never occurred to him she turned back to the marker to count jake ran his hand through his hair at a loss not sure what to say next their child he thought of her face in the church basement while he read the way it would have been what did he look like you dont believe me you want proof a photograph i didnt mean that he took her arm i want it to be im glad we he stopped aware of the marker and dropped his hand i was just curious did he look like me your eyes he had your eyes and emil never he didnt know your eyes so well she turned no never he looked like me german he was german your child a son he said numbly his mind flooded with it you left i thought for good and here it was inside me this piece of you no one would know just me so you remember at the station when you went away i knew then and you never said what could i say stay no one needed to know not even emil he was happy you know he always wanted a child and it didnt happen and then there it was you dont look at the eyesyou see your own child so he did that he was the father of your child he paid for him he loved him and then when we lost him it broke his heart thats what he was doingwhile he did all those other things the same man do you understand now you want to let him rot there is a debt here you owe him this much for your child lena and me what did i do i lied to him about you i lied to him about peter now you want me to turn my back on him i cant do it you know when peter diedamerican bombsi thought its a punishment for all the lies oh i know dont say it it was crazy i know but not this i have to put it right by telling him now no never it would kill him to know that but to help himits a chance to make it right a debt he took a step back not mine yes yours too thats why i brought you here she pointed to the marker thats you too here in berlin one of us his childyour child you come in your uniformso easy to judge when its not you all these terrible people look what they did walk away lets go to bedeverything will be like before she turned to him nothings like before this is the way it is nowall mixed up nothings like before he looked at her disconcerted maybe one thing you must still love him to do this oh my god love she moved forward and put her hands on his chest almost pounding it stubborn stubborn if i didnt love you do you think i would have kept it it would have been so easy to get rid of it a mistake these things happen i couldnt do it i wanted to keep you i looked at him i could see you so i made emil his father love him i used emil to keep you he said nothing then took her hands off his chest and this would make it right no not right but its something hell go to prison its for certain who decides that its the law american law for germans i am an american she looked up at him then you decide she said moving away to start back you decide he stood for a moment looking from the row of graves down to the marker the part of him that was here now then turned slowly and followed her down the hill contents previous chapter next chapter i i i reparations chapter sixteen the first part of shaeffers plan was to get the location moved theyve got too many men at burgstrasse you mean you cant do it we can do it it might get messy thats all then weve got an incident hell of a lot easier if you get him moved he scratched his bandage through his shirt dressed now an apartment maybe theyd have guards there too but not as many burgstrasses a trap theres only one entrance to think hes been there all along how did you find out by the way you never said a tip dont worry hes there somebody saw him somebody who schaeffer said then looked at jakes face and let it go a tip what did that cost you one small boy enough anyway you wanted to know now all you have to do is get him out well get him but lets do it right i dont like her at burgstrasse thats cutting it close even for us i still dont see why you need her at all you know where he is just go in and get him shaeffer shook his head we need the diversion if we want to do it right thats what she is a diversion you said she agreed to do it i havent youre here arent you come on stop wasting time ive got things to work out but first see if you can get him moved why would sikorsky do that shaeffer shrugged the ladys got delicate feelings she wont want to start her new life in a cellgives a bad taste to it might make her think twice i dont know figure something out youre the one with the smart mouthuse it on them for a change maybe you dont like it since youre making the delivery that still the way you want it i go with her or she doesnt go suit yourself just cover your own ass i cant worry about you toojust brandt understand if anything happens to her i know i know youll hunt me down like a dog shaeffer picked up his hat eager to go nothings going to happen if we do it right now how about it first have your little talk with sikorsky youre in luck too he said glancing at his watch hes in the zone control council meets today so you wont even have to go out to karlshorst you can see him at the banquet theres always a banquet nobodyll even know its a meetingyou just happened to run into him with something to offer how much are you going to ask have you decided how much it plays better if youre selling her just dont go overboardshes not the husband you want this to happen the point is to set it up not make a score jake looked away disgusted fuck you try to get him moved shaeffer said ignoring him but either way give me a day or two i still have to lay my hands on some russian uniforms what for well we cant go in with american uniforms can we might look a little conspicuous in the russian zone cowboy stuff improbable i dont like this any of it lets just get it done okay shaeffer said you can grouse later right now you just sweettalk the russian and get the door open well do the rest he grinned at jake i told you wed make a good team takes all kinds doesnt it guards had been posted at the driveway entrance to the conrol council building but mullers name got him through he swung around to the gravel forecourt facing the park then had to find a place in the crowd of jeeps and official cars the work party had done its jobthe park had been cleaned up everything neat and polished like the whitescarved sentries officers with briefcases rushed through the heavy doors late or just selfimportant a blur of motion jake followed one group into the chandeliered hall without drawing a glance the meeting room offlimits to press would be another matter but mullers name had worked once and might work again so he headed down the corridor to his office his secretary nails still bright red was just on her way to lunch he wont be out for hours the russians dont start till late then they go on all afternoon want to leave a name i remember youthe reporter right how did you get in here could you take a message in not if i want to keep my job no press on meeting days hed kill me not him one of the russians sikorsky hes i know who he is you want to see him why not ask the russians id like to see him today he said smiling you know what theyre like if you could take in a note its official business whose official business she said dryly one note she sighed and handed him a piece of paper make it quick on my lunch hour yet as if she were on her way to schraffts i appreciate it he said writing jeanie right corporal she said but smiled back pleased by the way you ever find that dispatcher she put her hand on her hip is that a line or is it supposed to mean something airport dispatcher in frankfurt muller was going to find him for me ring a bell he looked up at her face still puzzled then saw it clear oh the transfer right she said we just got the paperwork was i supposed to let you know he was transferred what name who remembers you know how much comes through here she said cocking her head toward the filing cabinets just another one going home i only noticed because of oakland oakland where he was from me too i thought well at least one of us is going home who is he friend of a friend i said id look him up and then i forgot his name well hes on his way now so whats the diff wait a minute maybe its still in pending she opened a file drawer a quick riffle through no its filed she said closing it another dead end oh well does it matter not anymore a transport ship somewhere in the atlantic ill ask mullermaybe he remembers him half the time he doesnt know what comes in its just paper to him the army and they said it would be a great way to meet people did you jake said smiling hundreds you writing a book there or what it is my lunch hour she led him down the corridor to the old court chamber breezing past the guards by holding up the note through the open door jake could see the four meeting tables pushed together to form a square smoke rising from the ashtrays like steam escaping from vents muller was sitting next to general clay sharpfeatured and grim whose face had the tight forbearance of someone listening to a sermon the russian speaking seemed to be hectoring everyone even those at his own table who sat stonily heads down as if they too were waiting for the translation jake watched jeanie walk over to the russian side of the room surprising muller then followed the pantomime of gestures as she leaned over to hand sikorsky the notea quick glance up a finger pointing to the corridor a nod a careful sliding back of his chair as the russian delegate droned on mr geismar he said in the hall his eyebrows raised intrigued im sorry to interrupt no matter coal deliveries he nodded his head toward the closed door then looked at jake expectantly you wanted something a meeting a meeting this is not perhaps the best time you pick we need to talk i have something for you and what is that emil brandts wife sikorsky said nothing his hard eyes moving over jakes face you surprise me he said finally i dont see why you made a deal for emil now you can make one for her youre mistaken he said evenly emil brandt is in the west is he try burgstrasse hed probably appreciate hearing from you especially if you told him his wife was coming to visit that ought to cheer him up sikorsky turned away marking time by lighting a cigarette you know it sometimes happens that people come to us for political reasons the soviet future they see things as we do that would not i take it be the case with her thats up to her maybe you can talk her into ittell her how much everybody likes it on the collective farm maybe emil can hes her husband and who exactly are you im an old friend of the family think of it as a kind of coal delivery from such an unexpected source may i ask what prompts you to make this offer not i think allied cooperation not quite i said a deal ah dont worry im not as expensive as tully youre talking in riddles mr geismar no im trying to solve one ill deliver the wife you deliver some information not so expensive just some information information sikorsky repeated noncommittal little things that have been on my mind why you met tully at the airport where you took him what you were doing in the potsdam market a few questions like that a press interview no private just me and you a good friend of mine got killed that day in potsdam nice girl no harm to anybody i want to know why its worth it to me sometimesits regrettablethere are accidents sometimes tully wasnt i want to know who killed him thats my price and for that you would deliver frau brandt for this family reunion i said id deliver her i didnt say you could keep her there are conditions more negotiations sikorsky said glancing behind him at the door in my experience these are never satisfactory we dont get what we want you dont get what you want a tiresome process youll get her what makes you think im interested in frau brandt youve been looking for her you had a man watching emils father in case she showed up with you he said pointedly and if i know emil hes been mooning over her hard to debrief a man who wants to see his wife awkward you think thats the case he did the same thing to us when we had him wont go anywhere without her otherwise youd have shipped him east weeks ago if we had him are you interested or not behind them the door opened a summoning burst of russian sikorsky turned and nodded to an aide the british are responding now its grain our grain everybody it seems wants something even you jake said sikorsky looked at him then dropped his cigarette on the marble floor and ground it out with his boot an unnervingly crude gesture a peasant under the shellac of manners come to the adlon around eight well talk privately he said pointing to jeanies pen still in jakes hand without notes perhaps something can be arranged i thought youd say that yes then let me surprise you a riddle for you this time i cant meet your price i want to know who killed lieutenant tully too he smiled at jakes expression as if he had just won the round so at eight jake backtracked down the hall nervously turning jeanies pen over in his hand none of it would work not shaeffer with his borrowed soviet cap not even this meeting another negotiation in which the pieces never moved i cant meet your price then why had he agreed a sly slavic smile squashing a cigarette as easily as a bug the office door was closed but not locked the desk just as jeanie had left it tidied up for lunch he put the pen back in its holder then looked over at the files where did she eat lunch a mess somewhere in the basement he pulled open the drawer where the pending folder had been to find a thick wad of carbons the rest a row of alphabetical tabs frankfurt to oakland even without the name to help it must be here somewhere and then what a message through channels a cable to hal reidy to track him down weeks either way whoever he was sailed nameless on the atlantic another t uncrossed jake slid the drawer shut he put his hand on the next cabinet where jeanie had filed the police report weeks ago and curious flicked the drawer open to see if it was still there tully had a thin folder to himself the cid report all of it with ballistics an official condolence letter to the mother a shipping receipt for the coffin and special effects nothing else as if he really had been swallowed up in the havel out of sight he looked at the report again but it was the same one hed seen service record previous assignments promotions why is sikorsky still interested in you he wondered flipping the pages and getting the usual blank reply he opened the drawer below rummaging now something crossreferenced perhaps like the files at the document center kommandatura minutes food supply estimates all the real business of the occupation drawers of it he worked his way back up to the transfer file and opened it again automatically reaching for the ts idly thumbing through and then stopping surprised when the name leaped out at him maybe another patrick tully luckier but the serial number was the same he took the sheet out traveling orders bremen to boston a july sail date home to natick at the end of that week a new wrinkle but what kind why come to berlin not to fly on to bremen with no luggage the obvious answer was payday to collect the traveling money for the trip home then why go to the document center jake stared at the flimsy there hadnt been any orders in his effects was it possible that tully hadnt known still up to business as usual while his ticket home floated through the paper channels that crisscrossed germany find what youre looking for he turned to see jeanie standing in the door with a sandwich and a coke youve got a nerve sorry its just that i did remember his name after you left so i thought id get the address i didnt think youd mind next time you want something ask now how about getting out of here before i find out what youre really up to he shrugged a schoolboy with his hand in the principals file well i said i was sorry he said putting the paper back and closing the drawer its not exactly a state secret i mean it blow he finds you in here hell have both our heads youre nice but youre not that nice jake held up his hands in defeat okay okay he went to the door then stopped his fingers on the knob can you tell me something though such as how long does it usually take for orders to come through copies i mean why she said suspicious then put the coke on the desk and leaned against the edge look things get here when they get here depends where they started your friend was in frankfurt any time frankfurts a mess munich comes right away but frankfurt who knows and if they were canceled same answer what is this anyway im not sure he said then smiled just wondering thanks for the help youve been a peach maybe we can have that drink sometime ill hold my breath she said he left the office and started down the sweep of opera house stairs any time from frankfurt but the dispatchers orders were already herewhy not tullys cancellation which must have been earlier unless no one had bothered letting death cancel itself out a noshow on the manifest one less paper to send outside he took in the line of jeeps stretched across the forecourt like one of the old taxi ranks at zoo station or the kaiserhof now they parked here or at headquarters in dahlem motor pool branches waiting for different fares if you wanted a ride this would be the place to come unless you already had a russian driver he got back to savignyplatz to find erich playing with some of the girls from down the hall their new pet more attention jake thought than hed probably had in his life rosen was there with his medical bag drinking tea the whole room oddly domestic lena followed him into the bedroom what happened nothing yet sikorsky wants to have dinner at the adlon well the adlon she said ironically patting her hair like old times not for you dinner for two youre going alone what about shaeffer first i have to set things up and then i go lets see what he has to say first he took lizs gun from the bureau and opened the chamber checking it you mean he wont do it well at the moment he says emils in the west the west he says jake said catching her anxious expression in the mirror dont worry hell do it he just wants to do a little fencing he doesnt believe you she said still agitated he turned to her he believes me its his game thats all so we play by his rules he took her shoulder now stop i said id get emil out and i will this is the way we do it hes the kind of guy who likes a little dinner first to break the ice she turned away its true thats all dinner thats all they why are you taking the gun seen the adlon lately she looked at him blankly lots of rats contents previous chapter next chapter chapter seventeen it went wrong from the start the russians for no apparent reason had set up a checkpoint at the brandenburg gate and by the time jake had shown his id and was waved through he was late he lost more time trying to find his way through the deserted shell of the adlon rescued finally by a man in a formal cutaway who appeared out of the dark like a ghost from the old days a desk clerk without a desk given the damage it seemed a miracle that anyone still lived here at all the lobby and main block facing the linden were smashed but a rough path had been cleared through the rubble to a wing in the back the clerk led him with a flashlight past small heaps of brick stepping over them as if they were just something the hall maid hadnt got around to yet then up a flight of service stairs to a dim corridor at the end as surreal as the rest of it was a brightly lit dining room buzzing with soviet uniforms and waiters in white jackets carrying serving dishes the open windows looked down on the gaping hole where goebbels garden had been and sikorsky sat near one of them blowing smoke out into the night air jake had barely started toward him when a hand caught his sleeve whatever are you doing here jake jumped more nervous than hed realized brian he said numbly the florid face somehow surreal too out of place he was sitting at a table for four with two russian soldiers and a pale civilian not the food i hope although dieter here swears by the kohlrabi have a drink cant im meeting someone interview you couldnt do better than this lot took the reichstag this chap here actually planted the flag he did well he says he did which comes to the same thing he glanced across the room not sikorsky is it mind your own business jake said you wont get anything there blood out of a stone youll be at the camp later ought to be quite a blowout why havent you heard the rising suns about to set theyre just waiting for the cable be all over then but the shouting wont it six bloody years yeah all over cheers brian said lifting his eyes toward sikorsky as he raised his glass watch your back killed his own men that one did says who everybody ask him he drained the glass actually better not just watch the back jake clamped him on the shoulder and moved away sikorsky was standing now waiting for him he didnt offer to shake hands just nodded as jake took off his hat and placed it on the table facing his brim to brim as if even the hats expected a standoff a colleague sikorsky said sitting down yes he drinks too much he just pretends to its an old newspapermans trick the british sikorsky said flicking an ash russians drink for real he poured a glass from the vodka bottle and pushed it toward jake his own eyes clear and sober well mr geismar you have your meeting but you dont speak he took a puff from his brown cigarette holding jakes eyes something is wrong ive never looked at a man who wanted to kill me before its a strange feeling you werent in the war then ive looked at hundreds of course they also looked at me including russians jake said poking for a reaction i heard you killed your own men not russians saboteurs he said easily unaffected deserters you mean there were no deserters at stalingrad only saboteurs it was not an option is this what you want to discuss the war you know nothing about it we held the line guns in front guns at your back a powerful inducement to fight it was necessary to win and we did win some of you did let me tell you a story since you are interested we had to supply the line from across the volga and the germans had the shore covered from the cliffs we unload the boats they shoot at us but we had to unload so we used boys not soldiers we used the children and they shot them jake looked away whats your point that you cannot possibly know what it was like you cannot know what we had to do we had to make ourselves steel a few saboteurs that was nothing nothing i wonder if they thought so youre being sentimental we didnt have that luxury ah he said to the waiter handing him some coupons two there is no menu im afraid you like cabbage soup its one of my favorites sikorsky raised his eyebrows then waved the waiter away its as gunther says fond of jokes a cynic like all sentimentalists youve discussed me with him of course such a curious mix persistent what did you want that i still dont know did you pay him too to discuss you a thin smile dont concern yourself he is not corrupt a thief but not corrupt another sentimentalist maybe we dont want to be steel then you will not win sikorsky said simply youll break jake sat back staring at the hard soldiers face the shine of sweat literally metallic in the bright light tell me something he said almost to himself what happens when its over the old question turned around the japanese are going to surrender what happens to it all then all the steel sikorsky looked at him intrigued does it feel over to you before he could say anything the waiter came with the food his frayed white sleeve too long for him almost dipping into the soup sikorsky began to eat noisily not bothering to put out his cigarette so shall we begin he said dropping a chunk of bread into the soup you want to make conditions you say but you really have no intention of bringing frau brandt to us so what are you playing at what makes you say that jake said thrown offbalance shes the woman i met in the linden not just a friend i think he shook his head no no intention youre wrong jake said trying to keep his voice firm please but its of no importance im not interested in whether herr brandt has his wife pleasant for him perhaps of no importance to me you see you have brought the wrong thing to the table next time try coal something thats wanted you cant negotiate with this then why havent you moved him i have moved him the minute you told me where he was if you knew perhaps others know too a precaution of course perhaps not you work on your own gunther says he admires that in you a man like himself maybe but hes a fool he looked up from the soup we are not fools so many make that mistake the germans until we destroyed them he took the soaked piece of bread into his mouth and sucked it but you kept him in berlin jake said not letting it go yes too long that was your lieutenant tully keep him i may need his help he said a mistake help in doing what get the others sikorsky said simply emil would never you think not dont be too sure what a man will do but as it happens i agree with you not like tully now there was a man who would do anything like use lena to make emil help i thought this toothat it was his plan so as you say i looked for herthe bargaining chip but now i see it was a mistake tully didnt know know what about you what use is a wife with another man no use the unfaithful frau brandt you see mr geismar you have come on a fools errand you offer heryou pretend to offer herbut i want his colleagues not his wife shes of no use to me anymore she never was it seems thank you for clarifying this matter its time brandt left berlin theres no reason to keep him here now not at burgstrasse you knew that how he was seen jake said by the americans well as i thoughtbetter to move him and he has work to do a mistake this waiting eat your soup its getting cold i dont want it you dont mind then sikorsky reached over to switch the plates to waste food help yourself jake said his mind still wandering trying to sort things out the bargaining chip but tully hadnt looked for her hed gone to the document center had sikorsky known still giving away nothing eating soup behind them brians table had got louder glasses clinking in a toast a spurt of laughter reaching him like an echo as he stared at the soup plate youve brought the wrong thing to the table why did you ask me here then it was you who asked me sikorsky said blandly tipping his plate to spoon the soup and you thought it would be amusing to tell me to go fly a kite amusing no im not so fond of jokes as you an idea of mine a different negotiation something we both want shall i surprise you try me im going to take you to emil brandt jake looked down quickly not trusting his own reaction a white tablecloth stained sikorskys blunt fingers resting against the spoon really and why would you want to do that it would be useful he iswhat did you call it mooning its true he speaks of her when is she coming he said raising his voice in a falsetto it would be better for his work not to have these false hopes now would he believe me but you her sweetheart he said twisting his mouth over the word you can say goodbye for her and he can leave in peace a small service he wiped the corner of his mouth then crumpled the napkin on the table youre a real prick arent you mr geismar sikorsky said his eyes almost twinkling im not the one sleeping with his wife and when does all this happen jake said pretending to be calm now he leaves tomorrow its better if the americans know burgstrasse they will excite themselves you can put their minds at rest too hes not coming back theyll protest yes they like that but hell be gone another who has chosen the soviet future shall we go he reached for his hat youre going too fast sikorsky smiled the element of surprise very effective i mean were not finished i still dont have what i want sikorsky looked at him blankly information that was the deal mr geismar he said sighing at such a moment he dropped the hat and took out another brown cigarette instead checking his watch five minutes your friend at the market ive told you an unfortunate you were there to point me out why because you were a nuisance he said quickly bored waving some smoke away youre still a nuisance to whom not to you sikorsky looked at him not answering then turned to the open window what else you said you wanted to know who killed tully why isnt that obvious to you my partner in crime as you would say now well have to arrange another source of supply an inconvenient death he turned back what else you met him at tempelhof where did you take him this matters to you its my story i want to know the details where sikorsky shrugged to get a jeep he wanted a jeep at the control council jake said taking a shot yes kleist park there are jeeps there and after after its your idea that we should make a tour of berlin be seen together you were seen at tempelhof by whom he said suddenly alert by the woman you killed at potsdam ah he said frowning not quite knowing what to make of this then brushed it away with some ash on the table well shes dead but you were seen so why meet him in the first place you can guess that i think to give him money sikorsky nodded of course with him it was always money such a love of money an american failing thats easy for you to say when you print it with our plates paid for with blood you envy us that bookkeeping we paid for every mark all right so you paid him off for brandt as a matter of fact no its important to you these details he was paid for brandt when they arrived at the border cash on delivery tully drove him to the russian zone not a weekend in frankfurt after all sikorsky leaned back almost smug a veteran telling war stories it was safer to fly brandt out would have been riskyeasier to trace he had to disappear no trail so tully drove him not such a great distance even so you know he demanded gasoline for the return trip always a little something extra he was that kind of man another detail for you he went back on russian gas so why pay him at tempelhof for future deliveries in advance you trusted him sikorsky smiled you didnt know him give him a little hed be back for more you could trust him to do that a safe investment which you lost regrettably but its not important as you say we can print more now youre satisfied come you can see the end of the story just one more thing why do you care who killed him thats why you asked me here isnt it to see what i could tell you and you have youve told me what i want to know you dont know but why should it matter at all youve got brandt you didnt care about the money revenge you didnt give a damn about tully about him no about his death yes a man drives off and is killed a victim of bad company in this case i must say nothing could be more likelya man like him not a surprising end but the money is still there not so likely unless instead its something else the americans if they know about our arrangement in that case some action would need to be taken beforewell before anything else happened so what does our mr geismar want i wonder is he working for them then i watch your face as you move your pieces up your questions and i know its only you when you play chess with a russian keep something in reserve mr geismar a piece in the back row now enough foolishness he reached again for his hat jake gripped the edge of the cloth as if the table itself like everything else was slipping away do something sit down jake said sikorsky glanced up sharply bristling not used to taking orders then slowly moved his hand back thats better i dont play chess and youre not as good at reading faces as you think you are what makes you think id go anywhere with you a man who tried to kill me is that all if i wanted to kill you i could do it here i still could i doubt it not with witnesses he jerked his head toward brians table an accident in the market thats more your line too bad you didnt do it yourself ill bet youre a good shot excellent sikorsky said exhaling smoke but a lousy judge of character lets watch your face now and see what comes up tully wasnt going to deliver anything he was playing you for a sap he was going home at the end of the weekdont bother its true ive seen his orders he was just collecting a little something extra before he ran out on you sikorsky stared at him stonily his face showing no reaction at all mm i thought so want more he also had an appointment with a public safety officer that interest you it should he liked to collect twice maybe you werent the highest bidder for what sikorsky said quietly what he was going to use to get to the others at kransberg a little goingoutofbusiness sale and you can take my word for it it wasnt emil or his wife why should i take your word for anything because i know where he went that day and you dont you just told me so yourself where well if i told you then both of us would know what would be the sense in that this way i can buy a little insurancesomething to keep your finger off the trigger im too valuable to shoot sikorsky stubbed out his cigarette rubbing it back and forth what do you want he said finally jake shook his head your information isnt good enough you see you brought the wrong thing to the table i dont want to see emil you can tell him goodbye yourself you dont want to see him he said skeptically not especially but his wife does all i wanted was to make an arrangement as a favor to her no skin off your nose as far as i could see but no you just want to prove what a tough guy you are steel so nobody gets what he wants he paused then looked up she wants to see him thats still the deal if i were you i wouldnt be in such a hurry to move himif you want us to have another little talk there was a roar behind them as brian in his cups now laughed at one of his own jokes an old newspapermans trick sikorsky said sarcastically this too i think suit yourself id give it some thought you know suspicions a funny thingit eats everything up even steel can rust a russian failing now it was his turn to reach for his hat anyway thanks for the soup when you change your mind let me know he stood up so that sikorsky was forced to rise as well eyes still locked on his it seems weve wasted our time mr geismar not exactly there was only one thing i wanted to know and now i do one thing yet so many questions a newspapermans trick get people talking and theyll usually tell you what youre looking for is that so sikorsky said dryly and what have you learned jake leaned forward resting his hands on the table that its still going on it didnt end with tullyyou just want us to think so thats why you want me to see emilso i can tell everybody i saw him go and i know who his delivery boy was case closed but it isnt you just told me so future deliveries emil had to disappear no trace why tully gets killed game over no an inconvenience just a hitch in the operation was he going home not the end of the world either why because he wasnt working alone jake leaned back its like stalingrad isnt it youre still protecting your supply line tully wasnt your partner he was just one of those kids the germans could pick off expendable as long as the boats kept running you dont care who killed him just whether we know how it all worked and now heres geismar sticking his nose in he makes the connection to tully half the story so lets let him think hes got it all lets even give him a goodbye interview i told you you were a lousy judge of character do you think im going to stop when this started i thought i had a bad apple in the black market then it kept getting bigger and bigger not just tully not just brandt not even just you now its a whole rotten barrel with your supplier still in place selling us out thats the story i want sikorsky stood still expressionless if you live to write it well thats up to you isnt it jake said nodding toward sikorskys holster if youre sure im the only one who knows are you they stood facing each other for another second not moving jake put on his hat checkmate sikorsky stared at him then slowly raised his hand palm out in a stop sign then resigned he turned it down toward the table gesturing to jake to take his seat you are attracting attention sikorsky sat down but even after jake followed he said nothing looking away toward the room as if he were sifting through his options jake waited him out how would he start but sikorsky stayed silent apparently at a loss his gaze stuck over jakes shoulder then unexpectedly he raised his eyebrows and smiled oddly no more than a tremor of his closed mouth youre a poor chess player mr geismar he said still looking past jake am i very even a poor player knows not to move up the queen now the smile broadened almost a smirk so that jake turned to follow it feeling some new disturbance in the room she was standing near brians table letting him take her hand hair pinned up the palm of sequins glittering on the front of her dress the whole room quiet looking at her in the startled second that followed jake saw everything in a rush a jerky loop of filmbrian kissing her hand offering a drink the russians getting up lena shaking her head politely then finally her face coming toward him bold and determined flushed with its own daring the same face that had jumped off the sailboat into the havel he felt himself rise the room skidding around him but in the panic of everything going wrong what struck him and wouldnt let go was the sequins that she had dressed for emil frau brandt sikorsky said moving a chair an opportune visit youve come to see your husband yes good hell be pleased mr geismar here has refused our invitation but you i think may feel differently refused she said to jake the general isnt interested in a meeting theyre taking emil east tomorrow jake said evenly east but then she halted stopped by his glance yes sikorsky said so you see opportune of course you would be welcome too an honored guest of the state you mean hes leaving she turned to jake glaring did you know this a little surprise from the general we were just discussing a different arrangement a later departure date oh she said looking down finally aware a later date unnecessary now sikorsky said i thought he wouldnt believe you she said weakly still looking down at the table you were correct my apologies sikorsky said to jake he poured some vodka and moved the glass to lena a drink she shook her head biting her lower lip leaving so i wont see him no no dear lady you can see him now thats what im telling you he turned to jake enjoying himself that is what you wanted isnt it he said smoothly lena answered for him yes i want to see him you can arrange that sikorsky nodded come with me nobodys going anywhere jake said moving his hand to cover hers you think im going to let her walk out of here with you sikorsky rolled his eyes your friend is suspicious like a russian he said playing calm yourself we dont go far upstairs then ill bring frau brandt back to you and we can finish our talk an interesting conversation he said to lena mr geismar still has things to tell me he looked at jake youll be the guarantee for her return upstairs jake said you mean hes here i thought it better to keep him close for his safety and you see how convenient had it all figured out didnt you well i did not expect frau brandt sometimes then figure again she doesnt go not like this sikorsky sighed a pity but its of no importance lena looked at jake then slipped her hand out from under his yes ill do it no you wont its my choice she said to him as you say frau brandt sikorsky said your choice have a drink mr geismar we wont be long jake looked from one to the other cornered sikorsky moved his chair back if she goes i go with her you dont think your presence would be intrusive sikorsky said amused i wont be watching them just you try one move sikorsky waved his hand brushing this away all right jake said then sit here nice and quiet while i tell brian where were going if were not back down in fifteen minutes hell what bring in reinforcements but you came alone you sure jake said standing oh yes sikorsky said easily my men had instructions to inform me if you were followed at the checkpoint jake stopped for a minute taking this in all figured out and what else sikorsky nodded toward the other table where brian was laughing a poor choice of hero good enough to pull an alarm i dont intend to disappear without a trace and you dont want to make that kind of noise not you as you wish and give him your gun he smiled or did you intend to use it upstairs he wagged his forefinger a little trust mr geismar please he pointed to the gun holding his gaze until jake took it out and put it on the table lena sat up rigid as if it were something alive waiting to strike there all along under the words jake watched her as he moved to the other table to speak to brian her shoulders were straight and tense and he saw that she was finally frightened but as he came back leaving an openmouthed brian she got up without a word when sikorsky led them out of the room even the waiters stopped to watch caught by the flash of sequins the walk down the hall felt like a forced march quiet and plodding when they started up the stairs lena grabbed his arm as if she were about to trip i didnt know she said almost whispering im sorry i didnt know ive ruined everything no ill think of something he said in english he still wants to talk to me just see emil and get out dont wait but what about theres enough light sikorsky said from above ill think of something he said hushing her but what the checkpoint arranged emil ready to go all the pieces moved into place but sikorsky wanted to talk not sure what jake knew ready for a bargaining chip if jake could think of one something that might threaten the supply line where tully had gone in his jeep that day maybe anything to play it out a little further until lena was safely away just one more move except sikorsky always seemed one ahead there was no mistaking where they were goinga door with two guards in front carrying machine guns menacing in an ordinary hotel corridor the guards came to attention as sikorsky approached looking straight ahead as he swept past ignoring them and reached for the handle wait a minute lena said hesitating flustered its justso silly i dont know what to say frau brandt sikorsky said with almost comic exasperation as if she were rummaging through her purse lena took a breath yes all right sikorsky opened the door letting her go first emil was reading at a table near the window jacketless looking exactly the same the only person jake had seen in germany who seemed not to have lost weight the same dark hair and wire glasses the same pale skin and drooping shoulders all the same when he turned and started to get up too astonished to smile his face turned soft he gripped the back of the chair lena for an instant jake could see him take in the good dress the pile of blond hair like the ghost of some old adlon evening his eyes moist not yet ready to believe his happiness visitors herr brandt sikorsky said but emil seemed not to have heard him moving toward her still dazzled they found you i thought then he was there his face against her hair his hand scarcely touching the back of her neck as if a stronger physical contact would make her disappear how you look he said his voice low and familiar jake felt a tiny nick like a paper cut lena moved back his arm still around her and reached up to brush a lock of hair away from his forehead youre well he nodded and now youre here she dropped her hand to his shoulder its just for a little while i cant stay she saw his confused face and took another step back out of the embrace then turned to sikorsky oh i dont know what to say what have you told him emil finally looked at the others stopping dumbfounded when he saw jake a different kind of ghost hello emil jake said jacob he said uncertain almost sputtering jake stepped closer so that they were literally head to head the same height and now he saw that emil had changed after all the eyes no longer just shortsighted and vague but hollow the life behind them scraped away i dont understand emil said mr geismar has brought frau brandt to visit sikorsky said he was concerned that she be returned safely returned she has decided to remain in germany a patriot he said dryly remain but shes my wife emil turned back to lena what does it mean you will have things to say to each other sikorsky said glancing at his watch so little time sit he indicated a frayed couch mr geismar come with me these are private matters you agree its safethe same room he nodded to an open connecting door hes staying with you jake said a suite convenient for guests for the first time jake looked around the small sitting room shabby from the war a crack running up the wall the couch covered with emils rumpled sheet guards outside i dont understand emil said again theyre sending you east lena said it was a chance to see you before it was too late therehow else to say it east she nodded and its because of me i know it you were safe there and nowall this she said her voice catching oh why did you leave why did you believe that man emil looked at her shaken i wanted to believe him yes for me like before that last week to come to berlini thought you were dead my fault all these things for me she stopped lowering her head emil i cant youre my wife he said numbly no she put her hand gently on his arm no we have to make an end an end come sikorsky said to jake suddenly embarrassed we have other matters later sikorsky narrowed his eyes then shrugged as you wish in fact its better you can stay until hes away no one to pull the alarm you can have the couch you dont mind he says its not bad then we can talk as long as you like you said he was leaving tomorrow i lied tonight one step ahead talk about what emil said distracted why is he here why are you here mr geismar sikorsky said playfully would you like to explain yes why do you come with her emil said but jake didnt hear him his mind fixed instead on the hard eyes above sikorskys smile as long as you like all night waiting to hear something jake didnt know locked up here until he did worse than corneredcaught but she leaves jake said looking directly at sikorsky of course that was the agreement but why believe this either he saw lena being bundled onto a train with emil while he sat helpless in his adlon cell making up stories i lied theyd never let her go now sikorsky put his finger on jakes chest almost poking it a little trust mr geismar well give her to your friend then well have a brandy it loosens the tongue you can tell me all about lieutenant tully tully you know tully emil said before he could answer there was an abrupt knock on the door so unexpected that he jumped two russians chests half covered with medals started talking to sikorsky even before they were in the room for a second jake thought theyd come for emil but their attention was elsewhere some crisis that involved quick spurts of russian back and forth a blur of hands until sikorsky annoyed waved them to the bedroom door he glanced at his watch again excuse me im sorry to miss your explanation he said to jake an interesting moment frau brandt there isnt much time i suggest you save the details for later he looked at jake send your husband a letter perhaps mr geismar will help you with it he raised his head and barked out something in russian to the other room evidently answering a question only he had understood of course its better like this the personal touch but hurry please ill only be a momenta small office matter not so dramatic as yours he turned to go why should he help you with a letter emil said lena sikorsky smiled at jake a good starting point he said then crossed over to the bedroom with another burst of russian leaving the door open so that the sound of him was still in the room jake looked away from the door his eyes stopping at the crack in the wall another collapsing house suddenly back there again the creak of joists whistling inside his head no newsreel cameras waiting outside this time machine guns but the same calm panic get her out before it comes down dont think do it why do you bring her emil said what do you have to do with all this stop it lena said he came to help you oh god and now look jake what are we going to do theyre going to take him there isnt time he could hear the sound of russian through the open door low like the rumbling of the settling wall in gelferstrasse hed just walked out the door a hero people saw what they wanted to see ill only be a moment time for what emil said you come here together and stop it stop it lena said tugging at his sleeve you dont understand it was for you he did stop surprised by the force of her hand so that in the sudden quiet the sound of russian in the next room seemed louder jake glanced again at the crack one more move the element of surprise no keep talking jake said quickly just say anything it doesnt matter what as long as they think were talking he took off his hat and put it on emils head lowering the brim testing it what are you doing are you crazy maybe keep talking lena say something they need to know youre here he started tearing off his tie come on he said to emil strip hurry oh jake hes crazy emil said do you want to get out of here or not get out its not possible take off the goddamn shirt what have you got to lose theyre giving you a oneway ticket to nordhausen except this time youre one of the guys in the tunnel emil looked at him amazed no they promised the soviets dont be an ass lena help and say something she looked at him for an instant too frightened to move then jake nudged her toward emil and she started unbuttoning his shirt pale white skin do what he says please she said then raising her public voice you know emil its so difficult all this the words dribbled out a kind of nervous gibberish jake dropped the holster belt on the couch and unzipped his pants were the same size just keep the brim down on the hat they dont know me all theyll see is the uniform lena was keeping up a patter but flagging jake stepped out of the trousers this would be the moment caught literally with his pants down quick for christs sake you know about nordhausen emil said i was there he flung the pants at him i saw your work emil said nothing staring jake i cant do it lena said struggling with the buckle wordlessly almost in a trance emil unhitched it and dropped his pants right now its your turn jake said to emil put these on and say something loud but not too loud just a little spat lena come here he nodded at emil to start talking and took her by the shoulders now listen to me jake ssh you walk out of here with the uniform he jerked his head toward emil putting on jakes pants like nothing happened the guards dont care about us just him were the visitors dont say anything just go casual see then you go downstairs to brian and get out fast tell him its an emergency now understand but keep him with you if brian doesnt have a car take the jeep its on the linden keys in the pants there got that then go like hell theyll follow dont go through the brandenburg theyve got a checkpoint okay but fast pull brian away if you have to go to the flat and stay there and keep him out of sight he pointed his thumb to emil dressed now ready he said to him straightening the army tie see a real american what about you lena said lets get him out first i told you i would didnt i now get going jake she said reaching for him later come on say something he said to emil and keep the hat down and if they stop us emil said they stop you youll get us all killed no im saving your life jake looked up at him now were quits quits emil said thats right for everything he reached up and took off emils glasses i cant see emil said feebly then take her arm move he reached for the door handle if you do this theyll kill you lena said quietly a pleading no they wont im famous he said trying for a smile but meeting her eyes instead now quick he turned the handle careful not to make noise dont say goodbye just go he stood behind the door opening it for them waving them out with a frantic shooing motion a second of hesitation more dangerous even than going then she looked at him once more biting her lip and slipped her arm under emils and led him out jake closed the door and started talking so that his voice would reach the other room reassuring everyone even the guards with the sound of conversation use your smart mouth but how long would the russians keep talking in the hall by now approaching the stairs just a few minutes a little luck until sikorsky came out and reached for his gun because of course lena was righttheyd kill him no more moves left he started buttoning emils shirt trying to think and talk at the same time a holster belt on the couch why hadnt he told them to pick up the gun downstairs or would brian be sober enough to grab it on his way out making his excuses at the table following them across the field of rubble to the street not running stumbling in the dark theyd need time he looked around the room nothing not even a closet a wilhelmine armoire the bathroom was next door off the bedroom nothing but a door to the machine guns and a window to goebbels garden a soft landing but not from two stories up no three a hopeless drop in prison movies they tied sheets together a white braid like rapunzels hair fairy tales he glanced again at the couchone sheet nothing to anchor it but the radiator under the windowsill visible to the russians through the open door even the simplest knot would take too long theyd shoot before he made the first hitch he reached for the belt to emils pants wondering why he was bothering to dress at all there had to be something some way to talk himself past the guards they all wanted watches like the russian behind the alex but he was emil now not a gi with something to trade he looked toward the window again an old radiator that probably hadnt felt heat in a year even with the control handle all the way open oldfashioned shaped to match the door handle from the next room there was a sudden burst of laughter theyd be breaking up soon how long had it been enough time for brian to get them to the linden he talked again to the empty room the scene sikorsky had been sorry to miss he started threading the belt through the pants loops then stopped looking up again at the window why not at least it was something to minimize the drop he picked up the holster belt thicker not the same size still he pushed the end into emils buckle squeezing it to fit forcing the metal prong through the thick leather then pulling it tight if it held the double length would give himwhat six feet do you have any better ideas he said aloud as if emil were still there arguing with him and the holster buckle was an open square big enough to slip over the radiator handle if he was lucky im saving your life more laughter he moved silently toward the doorway sweating he wiped his palm dry wrapped the end of the belt around it gripping it and held out the buckle fixing his eye on the radiator if it took more than a second hed be dead a short intake of breath for good luck then he darted forward slipped the buckle on the handle and scrambled over the sill a small clink of metal as it hooked on evidently unheard over the russian talk then a strained grunt as he dropped catching the belt with his other hand holding on trying not to fall his feet dangling in open air he held tight for an instant not trusting the belt yet then felt himself slipping a raw burning as the leather slid through his hand until it reached the other buckle something to grip both hands now his entire weight hanging by a single brass prong his arms beginning to cramp he looked below rubble not a flower bed hed need all of the belt every foot a hedge against a broken ankle the windows in the back were holes in a smooth facade no lintels nothing to break his fall but a pipe that branched off from the corner and snaked across the wall europe where they put the pipes outside he tried to guess the distance maybe just close enough if he let the belt out something to hold his feet until his arms came back then a close slide down grabbing the pipe in time a drop in stages a cat burglar could do it he moved his hands carefully off the buckle just an inch to the thinner leather of emils belt one over the other his hands stinging from the leather burn as if he were gripping nettles still no sound from above just his own ragged panting and the scrape of his shoes against the plaster almost at the pipe and then it gave either the radiator handle or the other buckle impossible to tell which broke off and he plunged with the belt his feet hitting the pipe and bouncing off his hands reaching out for anything on the wall until they met the pipe and clutched stopping his body with a wrench of his shoulders he held on his body jerking trying to stop his legs from flailing and then he was going lower again the pipe bending weakened too light for his weight a groan at the joint near the corner and then a crack like a shot as it snapped and a loud crash as he went down with it metal clanging against the rubble and his own cry as his body smashed against the ground for a moment he seemed to black out an absolute stillness between breaths then another piece of pipe clattered down and he heard shouts from the window the air filled with noisy alarm as if dogs had started barking move he raised his head wet at the back a flash of nausea and rolled slightly on his shoulder wincing from a sharp pain his feet however seemed all rightjust a dull ache in one of the ankles throbbing with the shock of the fall but not broken a white shirt anyone could pick out in the darkness he rolled toward the wall and pulled himself up bracing against it so that if he fainted hed be falling backward not into firing range louder shouts now probably the guards he sidled toward the recess of a doorway still in shadow then jumped startled at the sound of the blasts a machine gun firing at random down into the yard the first thing hed learned about combathow the sound exploded in your ears loud enough to reach inside you right into the blood he pressed into the doorway away from the bullets was it open but the hotel was a trap the last place hed be safe and what if they werent out yet head away from the linden a few more seconds of diversion he looked around the yard trying to fix its layout an unbroken wall to the corner then another seamless no a gap where it had been damaged by shelling which might not lead anywhere a rat hole but the yard itself was impossibleone streak of his white shirt and the bullets would have him and now there was more light slim shafts from flashlights darting in confusion then raking steadily across the rubble strong enough to poke into corners picking up piles of debris and the dull gleam of the pipe coming toward him in a minute hed be in the beam trapped like one of the boys huddling against the volga cliffs easy target practice he bent down picked up a piece of brick and hurled it right toward the broken pipe a desperate ring toss it hit a sharp clang with the flashlight beams jerking back another burst of shots without even testing his ankle he bolted left toward the gap hearing the crunch of broken plaster under his feet more shouts in russian just a few more steps endless then the light was back shining against the wall and the shelling hole drawing fire again he crouched down in a feint making the light follow him then leaped away from it and dived into the gap rolling downward on his bad shoulder and covering his head as the bullets ripped into the plaster at the opening a furious ricochet whistling just a foot or so too high his whole body shaking now finally in the war he rolled again away from the opening on a floor covered with glass and scattered papers office litter bullets still tore into the room one of them hitting metal with an echoing zing he took his hand away from the back of his head sticky with blood opened when hed hit the ground in the fall and thought of lizs throat gushing just one bullet all it would take and then suddenly the bullets stopped replaced by more shouting he kept rolling until he reached a hulk of metal a filing cabinet and crawled behind it raising his head to look out there were heads at all the windows now looking at the yard yelling to each other but none at sikorskys the machine guns redeployed no doubt racing down the stairs already after him he felt his way through the dark room to another heading toward what he thought must be wilhelmstrasse a diagonal from the adlon wing keep going away from the linden the next room was lighter open to the sky and he saw that he had left the standing part of the building behind now there was just a small hill of rubble then an open patch to the ruined shell of the front he started running toward the street theyd come through the courtyard behind hed have a few seconds to get out melt into the ruins while they searched the back of the adlon but when he came to an opening ready to spring he could hear the boots clomping in the street front and behind he headed right snaking his way around another mound of bricks still parallel to the street theyd go first to the room with the filing cabinet hoping to find him dead not down wilhelmstrasse he took in the street again through the building shell just keep going another room big with twisted girders sticking up like teepee frames behind him he could hear the boots entering the building all of them one more room quietly he stopped not just rubble a small mountain even the shell collapsed in a dead end in the maze hed have to go back but the boots were there again crunching fanning out through the building he looked up toward the dark sky the only way out was over he started up the pile terrified that a slip would dislodge the bricks send them tumbling down like alarms if he could make the top he could get to the next building breathing space while they searched this one he reached up shoulder aching scrambling on all fours bricks moved settling and falling away as he found one foothold after another but no louder than small clinks not as loud as the russians still yelling from room to room but what if the mound dropped sheer on the other side propped up by a standing wall it didnt when he reached the top lying down he saw that it became one of those aprons of rubble that spilled into the street without a connection to the next building he also saw ducking his head lights sweep into the street an open soviet military car sikorsky jumping out gun in hand then pointing the car down the street away from the linden sikorsky stood for a minute looking everywhere but up and it occurred to jake that he could just lie here perched on his mountain the one place theyd never look until when the morning sun caught his white shirt and they surrounded him with guns another car came down the street idled while sikorsky gave a direction and moved on to behrenstrasse the next cross street down blocking that route now the only way out was the unbroken western side of wilhelmstrasse if he could get there before the headlights lit up the street he watched sikorsky take one of the soldiers and head into the building now while the car was still turning into behrenstrasse he inched down the rubble on his back as if he were sliding down a sand dune but the bricks rolled with him a small avalanche not sand in a few seconds theyd hear the clattering over their engine he crouched then took a breath and started running down the slope pitched forward by gravity flying so that he thought hed reach the pavement face first he staggered from the jolt of hitting flat ground then hurled himself down the street how long before they turned his shoes smacking the pavement now in shadow and racing south putting space between him and the wrecked ministry getting away with it until the air exploded again with a spray of bullets the behrenstrasse car catching his shirt in its lights he ducked but kept running looking frantically for another open space in the wall of rubble shouts behind him more bootsprobably sikorsky and his men responding to the gunfire back in the street one long dark stretch the other soviet car visible now at the end standing in the middle of the voss strasse intersection by the chancellery head right somewhere behind the buildings the wasteland near hitlers bunker but the rubble ran in an unbroken line here shouts in the dark there would be guards at the bunker even at night watching for looters who would they think he was running away from guns the street would end any second now with the roadblock and someone had started firing again maybe at random maybe at the pale glow of his shirt he swerved right off the pavement into a dark space in the rubble a culdesac like a moon crater one of its rims backing onto the chancellery itself he thought of liz snapping pictures the long gallery and then the smashed office opening out to the back no one would be collecting souvenirs now he clambered up another apron of rubble to the groundfloor window and vaulted through finally out of the street he stayed down for a minute his eyes adjusting to the dark and started across the room hitting his shin against an overturned chair then retreated back to the wall feeling his way toward the next window more light here just faint enough to see that the long gallery was still a mess a minefield of broken furniture and fallen chandeliers he moved farther along the wall avoiding the booby traps of debris in the center shouts outside again they would have reached the roadblock would be doubling back now to pick their way through the ruins a rat hunt get to the end of the room somehow toward the bunker maybe the guards hadnt been alerted yet the element of surprise he had reached another chair stuffing spilling out of the ripped upholstery when the tall doors banged open flung back in a hurry he dived behind the chair holding his breath as if even a slight rasp would give him away sikorsky with a few men one of them a mongol guard from outside machine guns and flashlights waving around the still hall sikorsky motioned with his hands for them to spread out for another second no one moved letting the noisy echo of their entrance die down then sikorsky took a step toward the wall with the chair and jake froze the back of his neck tingling not fear a trickle of blood running down soaking into the shirt how much had he lost geismar sikorsky shouted into the air another echo looking now toward the end of the gallery where the office and garden windows were you cannot leave here not through the garden anyway and not back into the street either no more shooting you have my word all the while motioning to the others to begin their sweep guns ready in stalingrad theyd fought building by building a war of snipers we have brandt he said cocking his head to hear a reply jake let out a breath half expecting it to echo but did they no theyd raced around the adlon too fast not stopping for anything a poor chess player sikorsky nodded and his men began to move with their flashlights only one of them left stationed by the door but armed jake followed the lights theyd sweep to the end then back until they were sure no way to get to the garden he raised his head a little glancing out the window distract the mongol make a break for it across voss strasse but the open car was there at the corner ready to fire maybe a second mongol still posted on the steps back the way he had come to the moon crater every step echoing in the giant room no weapon except a splintered armrest endgame the russians were nearing the end of the hall shining lights into the office where gis had chipped off pieces of hitlers desk two of them dispatched to check the room then back returning now toward jakes end how many four plus sikorsky he heard the crunch of glass a chandelier globe caught underfoot minutes then they stopped heads swiveling alert to a sound had jake moved paralyzed behind his chair no a different sound not in the room getting loudera pop a grind of motors raucous whoops jake strained a little closer to the window looking out rumbling down wilhelmstrasse almost in the headlights its over he heard in english its over football game yelling then he could see the jeep soldiers standing with beer bottles fingers raised in churchill vs in the light now americans like some phantom rescue party out of gunthers westerns if he could get through the window hed be almost there the russians at the roadblock too stunned to react looked around in bewilderment not knowing what to do then before jake could move the gis still whooping started firing into the air victory fireworks its over but all the russians heard was gunfire startled they started firing back a machine gun strafing the jeep one gi flung back then whirling falling forward over the windshield what the fuck are you doing a gi screamed the reply lost under another barrage of shots then the gis were crouching firing too into the roadblock and jake saw horrified that it was the potsdam market again a confusion of screams and bullets real combat men actually going down in the crossfire inside the chancellery sikorskys men raced toward the doors stumbling over pieces of debris shouting to each other gunfire must mean that jake was out there they ran out onto the steps saw the american jeep at the roadblock and started firing the russians in the street caught by surprise shots from the side automatically swerved and fired back open stairs nowhere to hide the mongol was hit first falling headlong the others ducking sikorsky yelled out something in russian then clutched his stomach jake watched amazed as he sank to his knees bullets still raking the columns behind him fuck eds hit somebody yelled another round into the blockade from the jeep then a hoarse scream in russian from the steps and all at once it stopped the soldiers in the roadblock looking dazed at the chancellery sikorsky still kneeling there his uniform finally visible to them as he rolled over are you fucking crazy the gi yelled bent over his friend you shot him the russians crouching for cover held their guns out waiting to see what would happen not ready to believe they werent under attack you shoot one yelled in broken english you idiot were not shooting youre shooting its over the soldier took out a handkerchief and waved it then stepped tentatively out of the jeep what the hells the matter with you a russian stood up beside the car and took a step toward him both holding their guns then no one said anything a stillness you could touch the others beginning to move from their places in slow motion staring at the bodies in the street appalled the russian looked toward the steps terrified as if he expected to be punished still not sure what had happened the mongol not dead called out something and the russian just kept looking stupefied not even moving when jake limped out of the building went over to sikorsky and picked up the revolver near his hand who the fuck are you the gi called spotting him a man in civilian clothes jake looked down at sikorsky his eyes were glazed but he was still alive breathing hard struggling for air his front coated with blood jake knelt down next to him holding the revolver the other russians still didnt move confused as if jake were another inexplicable phantom sikorsky twisted his mouth in a sneer you jake shook his head your own men it was your own men sikorsky looked toward the street shaeffer no nobody the wars over thats all the wars over sikorsky grunted jake looked at the stomach wound welling blood not long tell me who he was working with the other american sikorsky said nothing jake moved the revolver in front of his face the russian in the street stirred but made no move still waiting what would they do if he fired start killing each other again who jake said tell me it cant matter now sikorsky opened his mouth and spit at him but weakly without force so that the strand of saliva fell back on his own lips jake put the gun closer to his chin who sikorsky glared at him still sneering then looked directly into the gun finish it he said closing his eyes the only one who could tell him slipping away the last thing that would go wrong jake looked at the closed eyes for another second then took the gun away from sikorskys face drained finish it yourself it took my friend about a minute to die the one you killed i hope it takes you two one to think about her i hope you see her face sikorsky opened his eyes wide as if in fact he were looking at something thats right like that scared jake stood up now take another for the kids in the boat see them he stared for another second sikorskys eyes locked on his even wider steel he said then walked down the stairs not turning even when he heard the strangled gasp behind him he handed the gun to the stunned russian will somebody tell me what the fuck is going on here the gi said speak german jake said to the russian get your men out of here why did they shoot the japs surrendered the russian looked at him dumbfounded these men are wounded jake said suddenly dizzy so are yours we have to get them out move the car but what do i say to explain jake looked down at a russian in the street spattered with blood as stupid and pointless as it always was i dont know he said then turned to the gi feeling the back of his head he brought his hand back down bloody im hurt i need a ride jesus the gi turned to the russian move you fuck the russians looked at them both uncertain then waved his hand at the driver to start the car in the party jeep the men moved to make a place one of them still holding a beer bottle so the wars over jake said to the gi it was contents previous chapter next chapter chapter eighteen he awoke to find lenas face floating over his what time is it a faint smile after noon she reached up and felt his forehead a good sleep erich go get dr rosen tell him hes awake there was a scampering in the corner then a blur as the boy darted out of the room how did you do it she said can you talk how a bumpy ride in the jeep getting off in a kudamm swarming with headlights and blaring horns packs of rowdy gis with girls dancing out of the clubs into the street then a blank wheres emil jake said here its all right no dont get up rosen says she smoothed his forehead again can i get you something he shook his head you got out rosen came through the door with erich by his side and sat down on the bed taking a pinpoint light out of his bag and shining it into each of jakes eyes how do you feel peachy he reached behind checking the bandage on the back of jakes head the stitches are good but you should see an american doctor an injury to the head theres always a risk sit up any dizziness he felt below the bandage freeing his other hand by passing the light to erich who put it carefully into the bag my new assistant rosen said fondly an excellent medical man jake bent forward as rosen prodded with his fingers a little swelling not bad still the americans have an x ray for the shoulder too jake glanced down and saw an ugly splotch of bruise and moved the shoulder testing not dislocated you got this how rosen said i fell rosen looked at him dubious a long fall about two stories he squinted at the bright afternoon light how long have i been out did you give me something no the body is a good doctor sometimes when its too much it shuts down to rest erich would you check for fever the boy reached up and rested his dry palm on jakes forehead looking at him solemnly normal he said finally his voice as small as his hand you see an excellent medical man yes and now sleepy lena said her hands on his shoulders he stayed up all night watching you to make sure you mean you did jake said imagining him slumped next to her in the easy chair both he likes you she said pointedly thank you jake said to him the boy nodded gravely pleased so youll live rosen said gathering his bag a day in bed please in case you too lena said moving the boy time to rest come i have coffee for you she said to rosen busy organizing them so that they followed without protest and you she said to jake ill be right back but it was emil who brought the coffee closing the door behind him back in his own clothes again a frayed shirt and thin cardigan he handed jake the mug stiffly averting his eyes his movements shy and prickly at the same time shes putting the boy to sleep he said its a jewish child its a child jake said over the mug emil raised his head bristling a little then took off his glasses and wiped them you look different four years people change jake said raising his hand to touch his receding hair then wincing in surprise broken emil said looking at the bruised shoulder no its a terrible color it hurts and you call yourself a scientist jake said lightly yes it hurts emil nodded so i should thank you i didnt do it for you they would have taken her too and thats why you changed the clothes he said skeptically so thank you he looked down still wiping its awkward to thank a man who he stopped putting away the handkerchief how things turn out you find your wife then shes not your wife i have you to thank for this too listen emil dont explain lena has told me this is what happens now in germany i think you hear it many times a woman alone the husband dead maybe an old friend food theres no one to blame for this just to live was this what shed told him or simply what he wanted to believe shes not here for the rations jake said emil looked at him steadily then turned away moving over to sit on the arm of the chair still toying with the glasses and now what are you going to do about you i dont know yet youre not sending me back to kransberg not until i know who took you out in the first place they might try again so im a prisoner here it could be worse you could be in moscow with you with lena i cant stay here theyd grab you the minute you hit the streets not if im with the americans you dont trust your own people not with you you trusted them look where it got you yes i trusted them how could i know he wassympathetic he was going to take me to her to berlin where you could pick up some files while you were at it von braun send you this time too emil looked at him uncertain then shook his head he thought they were destroyed but you didnt i thought so but my fatheri couldnt be sure not with him and of course i was right he gave them to you no he never gave me anything i took them he protected you right to the end god knows why emil looked at the floor embarrassed well no difference it is to him emil took this in for a moment then let it go anyway you have them but tully didnt now why is that you tell him about the files and then you dont tell him where they are the first hint of a smile oddly superior i didnt have to he thought he knew he said i know where they are all the files where the americans have them he was going to help if you can imagine such a thing he said only an american could get them so i let him think that he was going to get them for me he said shaking his head out of the kindness of his heart collecting twice of course for money i said yes i knew they werent therei would never have to pay and if he could take me out so i was the clever one then he delivered me to the russians quite a pair why the hell did you tell him in the first place i never had a head for drink it wasa despair how can i explain it all those weeks waiting why didnt they send us to america then we heard about the trials how the americans were looking for nazis everywhere and i thought well never get out they wont send us and maybe i said something like that that the americans would call us nazis us because in the war we had to do things and how would it look now there were files everything we did what files ss i said they kept everything i dont know i was a little drunk maybe to say that much and he said it was only the jews who were doing that hunting nazisthe americans wanted us to continue our work he understood how important that was his voice firmer now sure of something at last and its right you know to stop now for this jake put down the mug and reached for a cigarette and the next thing you knew you were off to berlin tell me how that worked its another debriefing emil said annoyed youve got the time have a seat dont leave anything out emil sank back onto the armrest rubbing his temples as if he were trying to arrange his memory but the story he had to tell was the one jake already knew without surprises no other americans the secret of tullys partner still safe with sikorsky only a few new details of the border crossing the guards apparently had been courteous even then i didnt know emil said not until berlin then i knew it was finished for me but not for tully jake said thinking aloud now he had some other fish to fry thanks to your little talk lots of possibilities there did the others at kransberg know about this by the way my group of course not they wouldnt he stopped nervous what be as understanding as tully was theyd have a mess on their hands wouldnt they explaining things i didnt know he would have this idea i thought the files were destroyed i would never betray them never he said louder aroused you understand we are a team its how we work von braun did everything to keep us together everything you cant know what it was like once they even arrested hima man like that but together all through the war when you share thatno one else knows what it was like what we had to do what you had to do christ emil i read the file yes what we had to do what do you think im ss too me i dont know people change emil stood up i dont have to answer to you you of all people youll have to answer to someone jake said calmly you might as well start with me so its a trial now ha in this whorehouse the girls werent at nordhausen you were nordhausen you read something in a file i was there in the camps i saw your workers my workers you want us to answer for that that was ss not us we had nothing to do with that except to let it happen and what should we do file a complaint you dont know what it was like then tell me tell you what what is it you want to know what jake looked at him suddenly at a loss the same glasses and soft eyes now wide and defiant besieged what finally i guess what happened to you he said quietly i used to know you emils face trembled as if hed been stung yes we used to know each other it seems both wrong lenas friend he held jakes eyes for a second then retreated to the chair subdued what happened you ask that you were here you know what it was like in germany do you think i wanted that no no but then what turn my back like my father until it was over when was that maybe never my life was then not when it was over all my training you dont wait until the politics are convenient we were just at the beginning how could we wait so you worked for them no we survived them their stupid interference the demands always crazy reports all of it they took away dornberger our leader and we survived that too so the work would survive even after the war do you understand what it means to leave the earth to make something new but difficult expensive how else could we do it they gave us the money not enough but enough to keep going to survive them by building their weapons yes weapons it was the war by then do you think im ashamed of that he looked down its my homeland what i am lena too he said glancing up the same blood you do things in wartime he trailed off i saw it emil jake said that wasnt war not in nordhausen that was something else you saw it they said it was the only way there was a schedule they needed the workers and killed them to meet your schedule ours no their schedule impossible crazy like everything else was it crazy to mistreat the workers yes everything was crazy when i saw it i couldnt believe it what they were doing in germany but by then we were living in a madhouse you become crazy yourself living like that how can it be one sane person in the asylum no all crazy all normal they ask for estimates crazy estimates but you are crazy if you refuse and they do terrible things to you your family so you become crazy too we knew it was hopeless all of us in the program even their numbers even numbers they made crazy you dont believe me listen to this a little mathematical exercise he said getting up to pace the boy who could do numbers in his head the original plan you know was for nine hundred rockets a month thirty tons of explosives per day for england this was hitler wanted two thousand rockets per month an impossible target we could never come close but that was the target so we needed more workers more workers for this crazy number never close and if we had done it that would mean sixtysix tons per day sixtysix in the allies were dropping three thousand tons a day on germany sixtysix against three thousand that is the mathematics they were working with and to do this forty thousand prisoners finally more and more for this number you want me to explain what happened they were crazy they made us crazy i dont know what else to tell you how can i answer this he stopped pacing turning his hands up in question i wish somebody could everybody in germany has an explanation and no answer to what eleven hundred calories a day another number emil looked away and you think i did that no you just did the numbers emil was still for a moment then came over to the bedside table and picked up the cup youve finished your coffee he stood near the bed staring down at the cup so now im to blame that makes it easy for you to take my wife im not blaming you for anything jake said looking up into his glasses you do it emil nodded to himself our new judges you blame us then you go home so we can accuse each other thats what you want so it s never over except for you you go to the states with the rest of your group and go on with your fine work thats the idea isnt it you and von braun and the rest of them no questions there all forgotten no files emil peered over his glasses youre so sure the americans want these files some of them do and the others at kransberg you would do this to them too its not enough to accuse me this isnt just about you no i think so yes for lena youre wrong about that too you think it would make her happy to send me to jail jake said nothing emil raised his head letting out a breath then do it i cant stay here theyre looking for me she told me this so send me what difference where im a prisoner dont be too anxious to go youre a liability now undelivered goods hell have to do something who tullys partner i told you there was no one else yes there was jake looked up a new idea you talk to anyone else at kransberg americans no just tully emil said absently not interested and shaeffer the debriefing jake said explaining ever meet his friend breimer i dont know the name they were all the same to us big man government not a soldier that one yes he was there to meet the group he was interested in the program ill bet he talk to you no only von braun the americans they like a von he said shrugging a little jake sat back for a moment thinking but how could it be another column that wouldnt add up emil took his silence for an answer and moved toward the door carrying the mug youll at least send word to kransberg my colleagues will worry theyll keep i want you missing a little while longer a little bait bait thats right like lena was for you now you can be the bait well see who bites emil turned at the door blinking behind his glasses its no good talking the way you are now what is it some idea of justice for whom i wonder not for lena you think i ask for myselffor her too think what it means for her i see for her yes for her you think she wants this trouble for me he opened his hand taking in not just the room but the files the whole clouded future no she thinks she owes you something maybe its you who owes something jake looked up at him maybe he said but she doesnt emil shook his head how things turn out to think i left kransberg for her and now thisall our work so you can prove something to her wave these files in my face you see what kind of man he is leave him she has left you jake said for you emil said shaking his head at the implausibility of it drawing his round shoulders back upright the way they must have looked in uniform but how different you are not the same man i thought you would understand how it was hereleave me my work that much no you want that too your pound of flesh make all of us nazis she wont thank you for this does she even know how different you are jake stared at him for a minute the same man on the station platform no longer blurry as if the train had slowed so he could really see but youre not he said suddenly weary the dull ache in his shoulder spreading to his voice i just didnt know you your father did some missing piece he called it my father you never had anything in your head but numbers not her she was your excuse even tully bought it maybe you believe it yourself the way you think nordhausen just happened all by itself but that doesnt make it true owes you something you didnt come to berlin for heryou came to get the files again no just like the first time she thinks you risked your life to get her it wasnt for her von braun sent you it was his car his assignment to keep the work going no embarrassing pieces of paper you never even tried to get her just save your own sorry skin you werent there emil said angrily get through that hell how could i do that i had the other men to think of there was only one bridge left and you drove right out with them i dont blame you but you dont blame yourself either why not you were in charge it was your party how long did it take you to get the files that was your priority passengers well if there was time and then there wasnt she was at the hospital emil said raising his voice safe she was raped she almost died she tell you that no he said looking down but you got what you really came for you left her and saved the team and now you want to do it again even make her help this time because she thinks she owes you something shes lucky she got the phone call its a lie emil said is it then why didnt you tell von braun you were leaving kransberg with tully you couldnt could you not the real reason he thought youd already taken care of the files but you had to be sure thats why you came its always been about the files not her emil kept staring at the floor youd do anything to turn her against me he said his tone aggrieved closed off he looked up youve told her this you tell her jake said steadily i wasnt there remember you were tell her how it was he watched emil stand there shaking his head numbly in the sudden stillness and sank back against the pillow then maybe shell figure it out for herself brian turned up after dinner bringing a newspaper and a bottle of naafi scotch well safe and sound that looks nasty he said pointing to the shoulder you ought to see to that he opened the bottle and poured two drinks quite a hideyhole i must say i saw a lovely thing in the hall nothing under the wrapper by the looks of it i dont suppose they give out samples cheers he tossed back the shot howd you find it its british owned really thats the stuff anybody see you come here well whats to that at my age im expected to pay for it he glanced over no no one jeeps in the courtyard behind by the way i thought you might like it off the street tempting thanks i take it thats the husband he said nodding toward the living room the one moping on the couch what are the sleeping arrangements or am i being prurient thanks for that too i owe you dont worry ill collect your stunt my exclusive fair jake smiled you made the papers brian said handing it to him at least i assume its you no names not much sense either jake opened it up peace headlined in bold across the top with the picture of marines raising the flag on i wo jima at the bottom right in smaller type wwm begins who fired first an account of the chancellery shootout as confusing as the crossfire with the implication that everyone had been drunk you cant imagine the hullabaloo well maybe you can russians have been stamping their feet cross as anything formal notes want a special council session the lot say they wont march in the victory paradetheres a loss want to tell me what really happened believe it or not this is what happened except the russians werent drunk that would be a first and im not in it jake said finishing the piece strictly speaking boyo you werent you were with me is that what you told them had to no end of questions otherwise youre the most popular man in berlin these days absolutely belle of the balleverybody wants to dance with you if they knew where you were damned if i do came down to the dining room with a lady offered me a lifti might have been a little the worse for weardropped me on the kudamm for a nightcap and thats the last i saw you as for this he said pointing to the paper what i hear is there was a civilian in the middle of it nobody knows who german would be my guess of course the russians arent saying but theyre not supposed to be missing anybody in the first place but i spoke english americans think everyone does you tell them who you were no and i spoke german to the russians sikorsky wouldnt have had time to you see believe me nobodys thinking about anything except covering their behinds damned silly when you think of it going to the bunker for a drink wanted to dance on hitlers grave i suppose very unwise all things considered the point is you were seen leaving the adlon with me witnesses and if i dont know you who would that is the way you wanted it isnt it jake smiled at him you dont miss a trick not when the storys mine exclusive remember it doesnt do to share with your gang so fairs fair whats it all about its yours i promise just wait a little not even a taste what in gods name were you and the general wagging about the late general i should say theres a service tomorrow by the wayall the allies that awful band of theirs no doubt i suppose you wont be sending a wreath thats right jake said not really listening you dont know no i dont know he said imitating jakes voice until you tell me no i mean nobody knows what he said to me nobody knows it could have been anything but what did he say let me think for a minute its important i need to work this out you dont mind then brian said pouring another drink always so gripping to watch someone think anything i mean suppose he had told me told you what jake was quiet for a minute sipping his scotch hey brian he said finally still brooding i want you to do something for me what have a drink at the press camp my treat and talk loose have a few you saw me and ive got hold of a story and wouldnt cut you in on it so youre annoyed so i would be and the point is i want everybody to know that ive got something its like the village post office thereit wont take long to get around wait even better got some paper brian took out a notebook and handed it to him then watched as he wrote send this to colliers for meheres the cable address brian took it and read aloud save space next issue big story scandal and when you dont send one they wont like that well i might so will you but chances are this wont go out anyway they censor the cables young ronll take one look and start playing chicken little hell be all over the place with it all over me you mean ask him what the fuss is all abouthell go shy on you then ask him who tully was someone you mentioned in passing when i saw you thats right i called it my tully story and this is going to get you what exactly the man who killed him the other american the bird in the bush youre sure there is one somebody tried to have me killed in potsdam it wasnt tullyhe was already dead yes im sure steady you dont want any more excitement not like this brian said indicating jakes shoulder twice lucky third time third time he comes to me hell have to ever hear of a squeeze play and this will squeeze him out he said holding the paper part of the way the way it works is to get the russians to do the rest they think emils loose he is still loose what if they had the chance to get him back sikorskys dead tullys dead who else do they send to get him especially if he can get you as well i dont like that and how do you intend to manage this may i ask just go have the drink okay were almost there with loose talk which hell hear hes heard everything else one of ours then i dont know the only one i know it isnt is you very trusting of you no it was an american bullet you buy british jake said pointing to the bottle brian folded the paper and pocketed it speaking of which youll want this back he brought a gun out of the pocket if youre determined to keep asking for trouble lizs gun jake said taking it something of a rush at the adlon but i managed to pick it up just in case he killed her you know sikorsky so thats it brian said he got up to go its a fools game getting even it never turns out the way you expect its not about that then its a lot to do for a story how about getting away with murder is that enough dear boy people get away with murder all the time youve only to look around you especially here years of it then lets stop it now i do feel old nothing like the young for putting things right well ill leave you to it and this lovely scotch second thought perhaps i wont he said picking up the bottle never know how many rounds ill have to buy before the old tongue loosens up properly on my expenses too thanks brian well africa togetherit has to count for something no point in telling you to be careful i suppose you never were still russians i should have thought youd have your hands full sorting out your menage he nodded to the next room itll sort itself out the young brian said sighing not in my experience it took jake ten minutes to dress his stiff arms fumbling with the buttons even tying his shoes a small agony youre going out lena said looking up from the table where she and erich were leafing through a magazine rescued from one of the girls life pictures from another world emil sat on the couch his face vacant lost in himself i wont be long jake said starting toward her to kiss her goodbye then stopping even the most ordinary gesture somehow awkward now instead he rubbed erichs head rosen said to rest lena said im all right jake said feeling emil watching him so that like an intruder he wanted to hurry out away from them dont wait up he said to erich but taking them all in only erich moved giving him a little wave the street was a relief the comforting anonymity of the dark a soldier in a jeep he drove out toward kreuzberg not even noticing the ruins even berlin could become normal a question of what you were used to he found gunther playing solitaire a halffull bottle on the table beside him methodically laying out rows of cards like his columns of obvious points a surprise visit gunther said not sounding surprised at all barely looking up from the cards i thought id bring you up to date jake said sitting down gunther grunted continuing to lay out cards as jake told him about the adlon not even pausing when bullets hit the chancellery steps so once again youre lucky he said when jake finished and we still dont know thats why ive come i have an assignment for you leave me alone he said turning over a card then he looked up what i want you to go to a funeral tomorrow sikorskys a friend naturally youd want to go dont be ridiculous and pay your respects to his successor i assume his number twothey havent had time to bring anyone in yet maybe his boss either way whoevers sikorsky now its good business for one thing he glanced at the stacks of black market boxes and the other new business with me gunther said raising an eyebrow you have to think of it from his point of viewwhat he knows or what hes been told they must have grilled the russians at the adlon what he knows is that sikorsky saw us therelena and meand let us pay a visit he knows brandt escaped and sikorsky was killed chasing him he knows the americans dont have himtullys partner would have told him so where is he the logical place gunther made a questioning sound still playing where hes always wanted to bewith his wife who came with me and im a friend of yours and youyou kept tabs on me for sikorsky jake said slapping the words down in order jack ten nine his source gunther stopped i told him nothing nothing important so he said the point is they know he got it from you they know you know me they might even think you know where i am which means an interesting situation i agree gunther said turning a card slowly but i dont know where you are i have never wanted to know that if you remember to be in this position if they believe that maybe they dont think youre so highminded maybe they just think youre a rat gunther glanced up then went back to his cards are you trying to provoke me dont bother im trying to show you how hell see things when you talk to him tomorrow and what do you want me to say i want you to betray me gunther put down the cards reached for his glass and sat back looking at jake over the rim go on its time to move up in the world cigarettes watches a little bar gossiptheres no real money in that but even a smalltime crook gets a chance once in a while something big to sell sometimes it falls right into your lap i take it herr brandt is that opportunity jake nodded i came to you to get some travel permits to get the happy couple out of town and i would have these theyre on the market youre in the market theyll think you could but now youve got a situation you want to keep your options open your friend sikorsky is gonewhy not make some new friends and a bundle on the side hard to resist very so you arrange to meet us with the permits if someone else shows up instead where gunther said oddly precise i dont know yet jake said brushing it aside but in the american zone thats important they need to send an american if theyre russians ill smell a setup right away it has to be an american so i wont suspect until its too late and theyll send him your american hes the obvious person he knows who i am and hell want to come ive put the word out that im on to something he cant take that chance hell come and then he will have you ill have him all you have to do is lead him to me be your greifer gunther said his voice low it can work gunther moved his eyes back to the cards and began to play again a pity you werent on the force before the war sometimes the bold move it can work jake said again gunther nodded except for one thing i have no quarrel with the russians as you say i want to keep my options open if you succeed where am i with no options the russians will know i betrayed them get someone else there isnt anyone else theyll believe you its your case too no yours it was interesting to help you a way to pass the time now its something else i dont make myself conspicuous not now jake looked at him thats right you never did thats right gunther said refusing to be drawn jake reached over and placed his hand on the cards stopping the play move your hand jake held it there for another minute staring at him leave me alone how long do you intend to stay dead years thats a lot of time to pass with your head down youre still a cop were talking about murder no survival like this you tried that once a good german cop so you kept your head down and people died now you want to stick it down a bottle for what a chance to snitch for the russians youd be working for the same people you think itll be any different he pushed his chair away frustrated and walked over to the wall map berlin as it used to be gunther sat stonily for a second then laid down another card almost a reflex and the americans are so much better maybe not by much jake said his eyes moving left toward dahlem but thats whos here thats the choice he turned from the map you have a choice to work for the americans no to be a cop again a real one neither of them said anything for a minute so when the door rattled with a sharp knock it seemed even louder in the thick silence jake looked up alarmed expecting russians but it was bernie pushing through the door with folders under his arm just as he had that first night at gelferstrasse running into a plate now it was the sight of jake that stopped him in middash where have you been people are looking for you you know i heard well its good youre here saves a trip he said not explaining and moving toward the table wie gehts gunther he looked down at the cards seven on the eight things a little blurry he picked up the bottle gave it a quick glancing measurement and put it aside clear enough i brought the bensheim copies you asked for ill need them back though were not supposed to according to herr geismar unnecessary now whats bensheim jake said where tully was before kransberg bernie said to cross the t s gunther said opening one of the folders then looking at jake not bold methodical so often theres a pattern i thought to whom was he selling these persilscheins which germans perhaps someone i would recognize an idea only so thats what they look like jake said coming over and picking one up the usual buffcolored paper and ragged type wedged into boxes ink scrawled across the bottom the name on top was bernhardt no one he knew a different page layout yet still familiar like all the occupation forms he scanned down the sheet then handed it back innocuous paper but worth a reputation to bernhardt but as i say no longer necessary gunther said whys that bernie said gunthers retiring from the case jake said he wants to do his drinking elsewhere still you dont mind if i look since you went to the trouble gunther said taking the folders be my guest bernie said pouring himself a drink did i walk into the middle of something no were done jake said im off dont go i have some news he tossed back the drink and swallowed it with a small shudder a gesture so uncharacteristic that it drew jakes attention i thought you didnt drink now i see why bernie said still grimacing he put down the glass renates dead the russians no she hanged herself no one spoke the room still as death when jake said involuntarily a sound to fill the space they found her this morning i never expected jake turned away from them to the map his eyes smarting as if they had caught a cinder no he said not an answer just another sound nobody thought shed bernie stopped then looked over at jake she say anything to you when you talked to her jake shook his head if she did i didnt hear it his eyes moved over the mapthe alex and its impossible trial prenzlauer where shed hidden the child anhalter station cadging a cigarette on the platform you could trace a life on a map like streets the old columbia office delivering items with her sharp eye so now its an end gunther said his voice neutral emotionless it didnt start this way jake said you didnt know her how she was sopretty he said inadequately meaning alive he turned to them she was pretty everybody dies gunther said flatly i dont know why i should mind bernie said everything she did and a jew still he paused i didnt come here for this to see another one die she was part of that gunther said still flat so were a lot of people jake said they just kept their heads down maybe they couldnt help it either the way it was well maybe shes found her peace bernie said a hell of a way to do it though is there another gunther said i guess that depends on what you can live with bernie said picking up his hat gunther glanced up at this then looked away anyway i thought youd want to know you coming he said to jake i still have things to do two days with these okay gunther he touched the folders i have to send them back you all right gunther didnt answer reaching instead for a folder and opening it avoiding them by reading the page jake stood waiting but gunthers only response was to turn the page like a policeman going through mug shots they were at the door before gunther raised his head herr geismar he said getting up slowly and walking over to the map his back to them he stood for a second studying it pick the place let me know before the funeral lena was in the big chair legs tucked beneath her wreathed in smoke rising from the ashtray perched on the wide arm the room shadowy with a faint glow from the scarfdraped lamp she looked as if shed been sitting for hours coiled into herself too fixed now to move even when he walked over and touched her hair wheres emil bed she said not so loud youll wake erich she nodded at the couch where the boy lay curled up under a sheet brians sleeping arrangements answered in shifts what about you you want me to share the bed she said unexpectedly short lighting a new cigarette from the stub of the other maybe i should go to hannelore to live this way she looked up he says you wont let him leave he wants to go to kransberg he will i just need him for one more day he brought one of the table chairs over and sat next to her so they could talk in murmurs one more day then itll be over she tapped the cigarette in the tray moving the ash around he thinks you took advantage of me well i did he said trying to break her mood but he forgives me she said he wants to forgive me what did you tell him it doesnt matter he doesnt listen i was weak but he forgives methats how it is for him so you see im forgiven all that time before the war when i thought and in the end so easy does he know that before the war no if he thought that peter you didnt tell him did you you must leave him that no i didnt tell him we must leave him that she said brooding again what a mess weve made for ourselves and now he forgives me let him its easier for him this way nobodys fault no yours its you he doesnt forgive he thinks you want to ruin him thats the word he uses and poison me against him anything crazy he can think of so thats the thanks you get for saving him she leaned her head back against the chair and closed her eyes blowing smoke up into the air he wants me to go to america with him they can take the wives its a chance for meto leave all this if they go we can start over thats his idea start over so thats what you saved him for maybe youre sorry now no it was in my cards remember she smiled her eyes still closed the rescuer and now here we are all your strays what are you going to do with us put you to bed for a start youre talking in your sleep come on well move erich he wont mind no leave him im too tired to sleep she turned and looked at the boy i sent one of the girls to see fleischman he asks can we keep him a little longer the camps are so crowded you dont mind hes no trouble and you know emil doesnt like to talk in front of him so its good that way it gives me some peace what about texas they want babies only before they become too german maybe she said more dispirited than angry she rubbed out the cigarette all your strays you take us in then youre responsible you know he thinks youre going to take him to his mother what do i say to that after prison maybe not even then jake said quietly she killed herself last night oh a wounded sound like a faint yelp oh she did that she glanced again at the couch then down into her lap her eyes filling jake reached for her but she waved him away covering her eyes with her hand so stupid i didnt even know her someone from the office dont look i dont know whats wrong with me youre tired thats all but to do that oh how much longer like this boiling water just to drink the children living like animals now another one dead and this is the peace it was better during the war no it wasnt jake said softly pulling out a handkerchief and handing it to her no she said blowing her nose im just feeling sorry for myself boiling water my god what does that matter another sniffle then she wiped her face the shaking subsiding she leaned back drawing a breath you know after the russians there were manylike her i never cried then you saw the bodies in the street who knew how they died my friend annelise i found her poison like eva braun her mouth was burned from it and what had she done hide until some russian got her maybe more than one there was blood there she pointed to her lap you didnt cry then there were so many so why now maybe i thought it was over that time she gave her face another wipe then handed back the handkerchief what are you going to tell him nothing his mother died in the war thats all in the war she said vaguely looking at the sleeping boy how can you leave a child alone she didnt she left him to me lena turned to him you cant send him to the dps i know he said touching her hand ill think of something just give me a little time while you arrange things she said leaning back again all our lives emils too emil can arrange his own life im not worried about emil no i am she said slowly hes still something to me i dont know what not my husband but something maybe its because i dont love him isnt that strange to worry about someone you dont love anymore he even looks different it happens that way i think people look different when they dont love each other anymore is that what he said no i told you he forgives me its easy isnt it when you dont love somebody she said her voice drifting back in an earlier thought maybe he never did only the work even when he talks about you its that not me i thought hed be jealous i was ready for that but no its how he cant go back if you use those files the others wont work with him not after that those stupid files if only his father she stopped looking away and drawing herself up you know what he talks to me about space im trying to feed a child on food you steal for us and he talks to me about rocket ships his father was righthe lives in his head not here i dont know maybe after peter died there wasnt anything else for him she turned to him but to take that away nowi dont want to do that what do you want what do i want she said to herself i want it to be over for all of us let him go to america they want him there he says they dont know what theyre getting yet she lowered her head then dont tell them leave him that too jake sat back disturbed did he ask you to say this no he doesnt ask for himself its the othersits like a family for him ill bet she took out another cigarette shaking her head you dont listen either both my men they already know maybe hes right a little that its personal with you is that what you think i dont knowno but you know what will happen they think everybody was a nazi maybe hell talk them out of it hes already convinced himself but not you no not me hes not a criminal she said flatly isnt he and who decides the ones who win listen to me lena jake said covering the matches with his hand so that she was forced to look at him nobody expected this they dont even know where to begin theyre just soldiers its got mixed up with the war but it wasnt the war it was a crime not the war a crime it didnt just happen i know what happened ive heard it over and over you want him to answer for that what if nobody answers for it so emil answers hes the guilty one he was part of it all of them werehis family how guilty does that make them i dont know all i know is we cant ignore itwe cant be guilty of that too numbers thats all he did you didnt see the camp i know what you saw and what i didnt see at first i didnt even notice you dont take things in its so i didnt notice what there were no children none the children couldnt work so they were the first to go they were killed right away that one he pointed to erich that child they would have killed him thats what the numbers were erich she looked at the couch then put down the cigarette without lighting it folding her arms across her chest drawing in again lena he started all right she said moving her legs out from underneath and getting up finished with it she went over to the couch and bent down rearranging the sheet on the boy a gentle tuckingin motion then stood watching him sleep im like all the others now arent i she said finally keeping her voice low frau dzuris nobody suffered but her im no different i sit here feeling sorry for my own troubles she turned to him when they made us see the films you know what i did i turned my head jake looked up his own first reaction a bony hand pulling him back to make him see and after people were quiet and then it began how could the russians make us look at that theyre no better think of the bombing how we suffered anything to put it out of their minds i was no different i didnt want to look either and then its on your couch jake said nothing watching her move toward the easy chair running her hand along the back you expect too much from us she said to live with this all murderers i never said no just some of us which ones you want me to look at my husband was it you frau dzuris son my brother maybe were you one of them how can i ask maybe he was so im like the others i know and i dont know except this once you do she looked down hes still something to me jake stood and went over to the table rifled through his papers and pulled out a file read it again he said holding it out to her then tell me how much im going for a walk dont leave her eyes moved down to the folder see how he comes between us then dont put him there you expect too much she said again we owe him something and paid it off at the adlon we owe him something he said nodding his head at the couch she sank onto the broad arm of the chair yes and how do you pay what are you going to arrange for him imagine his life in germany renates child no one will know someone will you cant save him from that she had slumped forward staring at her bare feet you want to keep him he said she shook her head a german mother and one day he looks at mewere you one of them no he should have a jewish home she paid for that then well find one just like that you think there are so many left ill talk to bernie maybe he knows someone an answer for everything she said breathing out in a halfsigh she got up and began to pace caged arms folded across her chest everythings so easy for you youre not not tonight what is it lena he said watching her back as she crossed the room as if he could follow her mood slippery as mercury i dont know she took another step then stopped facing the bedroom door and im the one who wanted him here anything but the russians thats all i could think and now hes herenow what im angry at him then angry at you i listen to you and i think hes rightand i dont want you to be right maybe its personal with me too so its a fine mess she paused i dont want you to be right about him i cant make the files go away jake said quietly i know she said rubbing her sleeve i know but dont let it be you let someone else she bit her lower lip is that what you want she looked up at the ceiling head back reading the plaster for an answer me what do i want i was thinking before how it would be if none of it had ever happened she lowered her head looking past him her voice slowly drifting again what i want shall i tell you i want to stay in berlin its my home even like this work with fleischman maybehe needs me someone to help then after ill come home and cook did you know i could my mother said its something a man will always appreciate she raised her eyes to his taking him in now so well eat dinner and be together and once in a while well go out get dressed up and go out together and well be at a party itll be nice and ill turn around and youll be looking at me the way you did at the press club and nobody will know just me thats all millions of people live like that a normal life can you arrange that he reached out his hand but she ignored it still wrapped up in herself not in berlin i think not even an american can arrange that now contents previous chapter next chapter chapter nineteen it was gunther who chose the place not the station its too exposed and theres herr brandt to consider emil im not taking emil you must its brandt he wants he wont show himself for you he got up with his coffee cold sober and walked to the map imagine what hes thinking he cant lose him again if youre alone what has he accomplished even if he kills you still no brandt no he wants a simple pickup you dont suspect anything so he surprises you and he takes brandt away or both of you you for later but the meeting must happen somewhere he cant risk drawing attention if he kills you there hell lose everything you need that protection i can take care of myself jake said touching the gun on his hip gunther turned the beginning of a smile on his face so its true americans say such things i thought only in karl may he glanced at the bookshelf but in real life foolish i think in real life you get protection where i still have to do it alone theres no one i can trust do you trust me he caught jakes eye and almost embarrassed turned back to the map then you wont be alone youre going to cover me i thought you someone has to in a police operation always use a partner two set the trap one the cheese the other the spring snap he clicked his fingers he thinks he surprises you but i surprise him otherwise he paused thinking but we need protection theres nowhere in berlin with that much protection except tomorrow gunther said what occurred to me was to use the american army what you know they parade tomorrow all the allies so we meet here he said putting his finger on unter den linden in the russian zone herr geismar even the russians wont shoot you in front of the american army he shrugged very well he moved his finger left past the brandenburg gate the reviewing stand will be here inside the british zone just it doesnt matter as long as the army is there so opposite the reviewing stand stay in the crowd if im that protected why would i go away with him well he might have a gun in your back discreet but persuasive thats what i would do come quietly he said in a policemans voice they usually do if thats the way the russians play it they will im going to suggest it to them he turned from the map the problem is we dont know i would feel better if we knew who to expect now we wait until the last minutehis surprise you can set the trap but a surprise is never safe logic is safe i know follow the points find anything in the persilscheins jake said glancing at the table no nothing gunther said glumly but there must be some point were missing there is always a logic to a crime if we had the time to look for it im out of leads my last one died with sikorsky gunther shook his head no something else there must be i was thinking you know about potsdam that day in the market we know that was him yes but why then it must be a point the when something happened to make him strike then why not before if we knew that you dont give up do you jake said impatient thats the way you solve a case logic not like this traps guns he waved his hand toward the bookshelf wild west in berlin you know we can still what wait for him to pick me off while you work it out its too late for that now we have to finish it before he tries again thats the logic of war herr geismar not a police case gunther moved away from the map well i didnt start it christ all i wanted was a story still its as you say gunther said picking up his funeral tie from the table once you begin nothing matters but the finish he began threading it under his shirt collar not bothering with a mirror lets hope you wink ive got a good deputy and the us army behind me well win and after gunther grunted yes after he looked down at the tie straightening the ends then you have the peace the afternoon at the flat was claustrophobic and dinner worse lena had found some cabbage to go with the bration corned beef and it sat on the plate sodden while they picked around it only erich ate with any enthusiasm his sharp renate eyes moving from one sullen face to another but even he was quiet used perhaps to wordless meals emil had brightened earlier at the news that hed be turned over tomorrow then lapsed into an aggrieved sulk spending most of the day lying on the couch with his arm over his eyes like a prisoner with no yard privileges the ersatz coffee was weak and bitter merely an excuse to linger at the table not worth drinking they were all relieved when rosen turned up grateful for any sound louder than a tense clinking spoon look what dorothee found for you he said to erich handing him a halfeaten bar of chocolate and smiling as the boy tore off the foil not all at once youre good to him lena said is she better her mouth is still swollen he said a slap two nights before from a drunken soldier too swollen for chocolate anyway can i see her erich said its all right rosen said to lena and then when she nodded well but remember you must pretend she looks the same thank her for the chocolate and just say tm sorry you have a toothache i know dont notice the bruise thats right rosen said softly dont notice the bruise can i do anything lena said shes all right just swollen my assistant will fix her up he said handing erich the bag we wont be long and thats the life you give her emil said to jake when theyd gone whores and jews be quiet lena said youve no right to say such things no right youre my wife rosen he said dismissively how they stick together stop it such talk he doesnt know about the boy they always know each other lena glanced at him dismayed then stood up and began to clear our last evening she said stacking the plates and how pleasant you make it i wanted to have a nice dinner with my wife and her lover very nice she held a plate for a second stung then dropped it on the stack youre right she said its no place for a child here ill take him to hannelores tonight you cant get back before the curfew jake said ill stay there its no place for me either you can listen to this nonsense im tired youre leaving emil said caught offguard why not with you like this ill say goodbye here im sorry for you so hurt and angrytheres no need to end this way we should be happy for each other youll go to the americans thats the life you want and ill youll stay with the whores yes i stay with the whores she said youve got a nerve jake said its all right lena said shaking her head he doesnt mean it i know him she moved toward him dont i she lifted her hand to place it on his head then looked at him and dropped it so angry look at your glasses smeared again she took them off and wiped them on her skirt familiar there now you can see i see very well how it is what youve done he said to jake yes what hes done she said her voice resigned almost wistful saved your life now hes giving you a chance for a new one do you see that she lifted her hand again this time resting it on his shoulder dont be like this you remember in the warhow many times we wondered if we would survive thats all that mattered then and we have so maybe we survived for thisa new life for both not all of us survived she moved her hand away no not all its convenient for you maybe that peters gone in your new life only her eyes reacted a quick wince jake glared at him listen you bastard lena waved her hand stopping him weve said enough she looked down at emil my god to say that to me emil said nothing staring at the table lena went over to the bureau opened a drawer and pulled out a snapshot i have something for you she said carrying it over i found it with my things emil held the picture in front of him blinking his shoulders sinking as he studied it everything softening even his eyes look at you he said quietly and you lena said over his shoulder so intimate that for a second jake felt he was no longer in the room would you like it emil looked up at her then pushed the photograph away and stood holding her eyes for another minute before he turned and without a word crossed the floor and closed the bedroom door behind him jake picked up the picture a young couple arms around each other on a ski slope goggles pushed up over their knit caps smiles as broad and white as the snow behind them so young they must be someone else when was this he said when we were happy she took the picture from him and glanced at it again so thats your murderer she put it down ill get erich you can do the dishes dont look for me i will see you gunther had said and in fact when jake and emil arrived at the parade he was nowhere in sight hidden somewhere in the crowd of uniforms that bunched around the brandenburg gate and then straggled out through the wasteland of the tiergarten on the charlottenburger chausee the allies had won even the weatherthe humid overcast sky had turned bright and cloudless for the parade with a breeze strong enough to flap the marching rows of flags posters of stalin churchill and truman hung from the arch and through the columns jake could see the troops and armored vehicles beginning to flow toward them down the linden thousands of them with more crammed along the pavement to cheer there were only a handful of civiliansgrimfaced curiosity seekers small bands of apathetic dps with nowhere else to go and the usual packs of children for whom any event was a distraction the rest of berlin had stayed home along the gray avenue of charred tree stumps and ruins the allies were celebrating themselves when jake got to the reviewing stand the first bands had already passed an overture of blaring horns he thought of the other parades here five years ago the trees of the linden shaking from the heavy thud of boots back from poland this was looser and more colorful the french almost playful in their red pompoms the british marching so casually they seemed already demobilized shuffling home the spit and polish had been left to the nd airborne wearing shiny helmets and white gloves under shoulder straps but with the music and scattered applause the effect was more theatrical than military show soldiers even the reviewing stand with bunting and microphones for speeches later rose up from the street like a stage filled with generals in uniforms so elaborate they looked like bassos ready to burst into song zhukov was the gaudiest both sides of his chest lined with medals that ran all the way to his hips next to him pattons plain battle jacket and few ribbons had a kind of defiant simplicity but the drama was in the positioning zhukov front and center would take a step forward only to find patton moving up with him so that by the time he reached the railing finally upstaged they had become a bobbing vaudeville turn of generals the press responded snapping pictures from their own viewing stand and jake saw that even general clay usually somber was trying to suppress a smile almost winking at muller who answered with a tolerant roll of his eyes silverhaired judge hardy still suffering fools for a second jake wished he were just covering it all for colliers the noisy air the absurd jockeying the backdrop curtain of the burnedout reichstag in the distance an interview with patton maybe who would remember him and was always good copy instead anxious he was searching the crowd for a face what he thought as more troops marched by was that he had never seen so many guns in his life and that gunther had been wrong he didnt feel protected at all any one of them milling around waiting to make a move were going to watch the parade emil said puzzled were meeting somebody jake said glancing at his watch it wont be long who the man who got you out of kransberg tully you said he was dead his partner so its another trick no americans i told you i need you as bait then well go see your pals and the files its a package deal they get you both you wont do that you re sure you cant think what it will mean for lena a trial wonderful how youre always thinking of her listen youre getting out with your life thats more than you can say for the workers at camp dora emils eyes narrowed behind his glasses then go to hell he said turning to go jake grabbed his arm try it and ill shoot you in the foot id enjoy it but you wouldnt they looked at each other for a moment stalemated then jake dropped his hand now watch the parade jake scanned the crowd not a single familiar face but why would it be someone he knew on the stand zhukov had leaned farther against the railing ready to take the salute from his lancer unit more stage uniforms a pounding thud of jackboots swords actually drawn and raised flashing in the light but no longer comic goebbels old warning the scourge from the east a small huddle of dps turned and started away from the crowd looking back at the swords and jake saw in the cowed hunch of their shoulders that it was really a russian show all of it the rest of the allies harmless extras the message wasnt victory but the crushing boots no one can stop us it was a parade out of the next war smiles faded on the stand what happens when its over hed wondered another it was then watching the russians that he felt the poke in the small of his back quite a show he whirled around hand on his holster steady brian said surprised by the abrupt movement hello again he said to emil no uniform this time eh what are you doing here jake said brian but hed already had emil once what do you mean everybodys here nothing like a parade just look at old zhukov bloody gilbert and sullivan coming to the press stand not now brian scram but brians eyes were fixed over jakes shoulder at the lancers be in hamburg before christmas by the looks of them i mean it ill see you later he glanced to either side of him expecting gunther to arrive everything happening too soon you might let me wait out the swords you dont want to get in the way of that he turned peering at jake what is it what are you doing now nothing just scram jake said still looking nervously to the side brian stared at him then emil threes a crowd right im off save you a place yeah save me a place if young ron lets the rope down ive known headwaiters with better manners christ here come the pipers he looked again at jake watch yourself he pushed his way through to the front hesitating as the last of the russians passed then sprinted across the sudden gap to the viewing stands jake lost him as he picked his way through the crowd to the back stairs of the press stand then saw him reappear on top talking to ron why not ron whod left the dinner table at gelferstrasse that night to play poker but could have gone to the grunewald who now had the perfect vantage point to spot jake in the crowd waiting for the right moment a nod of the head to close the trap but neither he nor brian was looking in jakes direction busy with themselves jake checked his watch where was gunther only a few minutes to the agreed timehe had to be in place somewhere nearby then why hadnt he come forward when brian approached them what if it had been him smoothly leading them away without even a snap of the spring he almost jumped when the bagpipes started wailing cutting right to the nerves on the stand the british now stepped forward rearranging the line so that the visiting dignitaries with the generals came into view breimer just behind clay in a doublebreasted suit who stayed and stayed with unfinished business in berlin jake imagined how it might happenthe sighting from the stand the quick excuse to the others the unsuspected walk across to emil a waiting car jake looked behind no car and breimer would never risk anything himself he was where he belonged on a speakers platform out of combat even ron was more likely he glanced back at the press stand huddled now with a cameraman lining up shots of the parade no one in fact was looking toward jake but someone must be unexpectedly the pipers stopped for a demonstration a blast of jangling air forcing the unit behind them to mark time jake moved his head slowly from left to right as if he were looking through binoculars tracking across a field what combat always came down to a hunt for prey every sense on edge watching for a sudden movement but everything here seemed to be in motion people came and went along the parade line the generals shuffled in the stand even the stationary pipers were working their bags heads bobbed in the crowd straining to see or falling back for a smoke a field full of deer moving at will none of them stopping long enough to stay in a rifle sight he turned in a complete circle away from the parade taking in the tiergarten already past time and still no gunther i can take care of myself but could he as he turned back to the parade sweeping the stands again for a face it occurred to him that he had got it backwardhe was one of the deer alert but not knowing what to look for the hunter lying still would be watching him he was following the pipers as they started up again when he caught it a flicker near the corner of his eye the only thing in the swirl before him that was not moving absolutely still a row of pipers passed if it turned away hed be wrong but another row of heads went by and the dark glasses were still fixed on him maybe just watching the parade then shaeffer raised his hand as if he were going to salute and took off the glasses folding them with one hand and slipping them into his pocket without even blinking his eyes steady on jake hard as steel not even a nod just the eyes only the mouth moved more a grim tic than a smile snap shaeffer another row and now they were locked on each other that split second in a hunt when no one else was in the field not surprised to see him knowing hed be there waiting for the crosshairs to clear jake held his breath caught by the eyes we wont know who gunther had said but now he did there was no mistaking the look not surprised the man whod come for him the bagpipes were almost gone and shaeffer took a step forward but the waiting unit behind moved up into place blocking him with a new row of heads how long before he could cross near the brandenburg gate there was a clunking roar like thunder and involuntarily jake darted his eyes toward the line of march soviet tanks heavy and massive crunching the already torn pavement and coming fast refusing to be idled shaeffer hadnt even bothered to look his eyes still frozen where they had been on jake sikorskys face in lizs picture ignoring the crowd at tempelhof shaeffer follow the points who had the right gun whod debriefed at kransbergthe perfect opportunity the perfect cover above suspicion for netting the zeiss engineersworthless while he was cherrypicking the rocket team instead who could have tipped off sikorsky before the adlon meeting who looked for the files and finally all that really mattered who was here knowing jake would be here and who was now waiting to cross the street jake looked quickly behind no gunther just an exposed swatch of park two to spring a trap but why bother at all all hed wanted was to know the point now was to get emil away before shaeffer could get to him the jeep was farther down the chausee close but too far to reach if someone chased them another look to the side the only place gunther could be no civilians only uniforms i want you to betray me hed said and maybe gunther had keeping his options open after all or had shaeffer got to him already keeping him somewhere making sure jake took emils arm and saw shaeffer lift his head and step forward again ready to spring what is it emil said annoyed if they moved hed bolt across right through the marchers jake scanned the crowd again all oblivious except shaeffer no protection at all wait for the tanks even shaeffer wouldnt make a dash through rolling tanks hold his eye make him think theyd wait stuck listen to me jake said in a monotone barely moving his lips not wanting shaeffer to read any expression in his face we need to get over to the press stand after the tanks when i say go just follow me fast whats wrong never mind just do it another trick emil said not mine the russians theyve sent someone for you emil looked at him skittish for me just do what i say get ready a clanking of heavy metal as the tanks ground into place before the stand zhukov raised his arm puffed up and solemn below him shaeffer stood rigid eyes still looking across as if he could see through the steel plates as well as the gaps in between when half the unit had passed the tanks slowed to a halt motors still throbbing as they began revolving their gun turrets in a display salute for an instant as the row of guns turned in place shaeffer disappeared behind the long barrels now jake started moving left toward the front of the unit but the guns kept swinging around and shaeffer spotted them through the suddenly empty space his head jerked up alarmed and he left the curb darting across between two rows of tanks how long would it take seconds jake glanced behind still no gunther no one in fact an exposed back the gun turrets had almost finished circling the tanks ready to start up again an impenetrable moving wall soon with shaeffer on their side of the parade jake grabbed emils arm and dragged him in front of the nearest row of tanks his protest drowned out by the deafening motors run could anyone in the high turrets see them ignore the command to start moving a crunch as the gears shifted jake yanked at emils arm sprinting as the creaking tread belts began to roll forward jog to the left ahead of the row one slip to fall underneath they were almost at the last tank when he saw it was coming too fast to outrun he stopped short steadying himself as emil bumped into his suddenly still body and stood wedged sideways between two tanks waiting for the column to pass just enough space after this one if he timed it right he stared at the treads almost counting them then lurched forward the moment the tank passed go he shouted tugging at emils sleeve and pulling him toward the amazed spectator line barely missing the next set of treads but there finally across wheres the fire a soldier said to him but he kept going pushing through bodies until they were surrounded just part of the crowd they were behind the press stand before he stopped taking in a gulp of air are you crazy emil said panting his face white go up there and stay with brianthe man from the adlon he knows you try to keep out of sight and dont go anywhere with anyone got it where are you going to make a diversion its still not safe emil said worried wasnt it who would snatch them in front of the press corps safer in the end than the army itself but who knew what shaeffer would do his last chance hes still out there he may not be alone a man who could get russian uniforms for a raiding party jake turned youre leaving me here emil said glancing around for an opening ready to bolt dont even think about it believe it or not im the best chance youve got so were stuck with each other now go on up ill be back and if youre not then all your problems will be over wont they yes emil said looking at him they will but youll be on a train to moscow plenty of time to think things over then right now just do what i say if you want to get out of here come on now emil hesitated for an instant then placed his hand on the wooden rail of the stairs and began to climb jake squeezed his way back to the front of the spectators get shaeffers attention before he looked toward the stand but the eyes were already there frantically searching through the crowd on jakes side then stopping a surprised glowering when they caught his face another russian unit was passing in tight formation head away from the stand jake started to move left just behind the front row still visible but surrounding himself with other heads so that emils might be one of them across the street shaeffer followed his tall frame stretching up over the crowd to keep jake in sight jake pushed toward the thicker crowds at the gate brushing past clumps of indifferent gis away from the stand he glanced over the columns of marchers still there head turned toward jake as he moved the same determined eyes exasperated waiting for a break in the line he must have seen by now that only jakes head was moving down the street emil left somewhere behind why keep coming not a diversion anymore a running to ground first jake then go back for emil who would believe him relieved to see the friendly debriefer and close his own trap up ahead jake could see the big three draped on the brandenburg after that the street widened out into pariserplatz a bulge of crowd where it would be easier to get lost more russian troops rifles shouldered the tall blond head keeping up with jake across the rows of gray tunics beyond them past the gate a halt in the march a gap big enough to use shaeffer would cross there jake went faster trying to put more distance between them he edged past the gate into the crowded square a band was playing the stars and stripes forever he glanced behind shaeffer just as hed thought was running across the open space before the band could fill it on his side now jake looked up the linden the sidewalks lined with russians hed have to melt into the crowd backtrack toward the reichstag but the crowd was denser here a cover but also an obstacle slowing him down behind over the marching band he heard shaeffer shout his name lose him now he pitched forward as if he were wading through mud his body ahead of his feet the russians were less goodnatured than the gis grumbling as he passed through them and he knew stuck in a wall of bodies that he wasnt going to make it did it matter shaeffer wouldnt shoot in this crowd but he wouldnt have to the russian zone where people disappeared a formal inquiry a shrug of shoulders over toasts why had he left the stand shaeffer couldnt risk exposure in the west but here jake could be swallowed up without anyone ever knowing even if he made a scene hed lose russian mps a quick call to sikorskys successor and only shaeffer would go back nothing would have happened missing like tully amerikanski the russian said as jake bumped into him sorry excuse me but the russian was looking ahead not at him where some american troops were following the band he stepped back to let jake pass apparently thinking he was trying to join his unit dont forget whose uniform youve got on he looked at the parade not the showy nd ordinary uniforms like his own gunthers protection he ducked his head crouching down out of shaeffers line of sight and wormed his way through to the curb keeping low as he darted into the march a few russians on the edge laughedhungover a familiar scrambling sure to catch hell later he sidestepped ahead of the moving ranks and near the middle of the row nudged a soldier aside to make a place joining the line who the fuck are you ive got an mp after me the soldier grinned get in step then jake skipped a fumbling dance move until his left foot matched the others then straightened his shoulders and began swinging his arms in time invisible now just by being the same dont look back they were passing the point where shaeffer would be head swiveling furious plowing through the russians looking everywhere but at the parade itself what did you do the soldier mumbled it was a mistake yeah he waited to hear his name shouted again but there was only sousa tinkling bells and drums as they tramped through the gate into the west he smiled to himself marching in his own victory parade not the japanese a private war left behind now in the east they were approaching the stand moving faster than anyone could through the crowd even if shaeffer had given up and started heading back it would be minutes before hed reach the press stand long enough to hustle emil into the jeep and get away he looked to the side a quick check patton saluting enough time but still only minutes at least now he knew except what had happened to gunther it was easier getting out of the parade than getting in after the reviewing stand there was a brief halt and while they marched in place jake skipped over to the side and back through the curbside crowd to the press stand only minutes what if emil had bolted after all but there they were not even up in the stand huddled by the stairs having a smoke there what did i tell you he always does come back brian said catch your breath youre down here did he try to run naw good as gold but you know ron curiosity killed the cat so i thought thanks brian jake said in a rush i owe you another one he looked back over his shoulder no one yet brian watching him motioned his head away from the stand better go if youre going safe home jake nodded if im notjust in casego see bernie teitel tell him who youve been babysitting and hell send up a flare he took emils arm and began to lead him away try newspaper work next time brian said easier all around only the way you do it jake said touching his shoulder then moving off they crossed with a few gis whod had enough and were taking advantage of another break in the line to drift away through the park whos teitel emil said an american one of your new friends jake said still slightly out of breath just a little farther to the jeep a friend like you a jailer my god all this for lena shes free to do as she likes so were you keep walking no not free he stopped making jake turn to survive you go along to survive you think its different for you what would you do to survive right now im getting us out of here come on you can make your excuses in the jeep the wars over emil said almost shrill a pleading jake looked at him not all of it behind emil something moved on the landscape a blur faster than the marchers and the idling crowd coming closer through the park not on a road where it should be out of place bumping over the tornup ground christ jake said coming toward them what is it a black horch the car at potsdam no two the second obscured in the dust churned up by the first get to the jeep now run he pushed emil who staggered then caught his arm both of them dashing for the jeep of course he wouldnt have come alone the jeep wasnt far parked behind the crowd with a few others but the horch was close enough to hear now the noise of the motor like a hand on his back he pulled out his gun as he ran to do what but if it came to it a shot in the air would draw attention give them at least the protection of the crowd they were almost at the jeep when the horch pulled ahead blocking them with a squeal of brakes a russian in uniform jumped out and stood by the door with the motor still running herr brandt he said to emil get out of the way or ill shoot jake said pointing the gun upward the russian glanced at him almost a smirk then nodded at the other car pulling up behind two men civilian clothes by that time you will be dead put the gun down sure of himself not even waiting for jake to lower his hand herr brandt come with us please he opened the back door hes not going anywhere not with travel permits no the russian said blandly no need you see a different arrangement please he nodded to emil youre in the british zone now jake said make a protest the russian said he looked at the other car shall i ask my men to assist emil turned to jake now see what youve made for us the russian blinked confused by this dissension in the ranks then opened his hand toward the back seat please i said id shoot and i will jake said the russian waited but the only movement was the opening of the passenger door gunther got out and walked toward them gun drawn get in the car herr brandt for a moment as jake stared at the man with the pointed gun his lungs seemed to deflate his whole body going limp with disappointment i want you to betray me emil shuffled reluctantly to the car the russian closed the rear door snap a good german cop jake said quietly looking at gunther now you gunther said to jake waving his gun toward the car in the front the russian looked up surprised no brandt only leave him get in gunther said jake crossed over to the passenger side and stood by the open door there was a highpitched whistle he looked over the roof of the car down the road shaeffer had stopped running two fingers in his mouth then lunged forward again a soldier detached himself from the crowd running behind him the rest of the trap closing up the rear what are you doing the russian said to gunther i will drive what do you mean he said alarmed now gunther swung his gun toward the russian over with the others fascist swine the russian shouted he jerked his gun out his hand stopping midway as gunthers bullet hit him an explosion so sudden it seemed for a second he hadnt fired at all there was a rush of movement around them like the startled flight of birds in a field spectators nearby ducked without looking a reflex on the reviewing stand a delayed reaction aides shoving the generals down yells the men in the other car jumped out and raced over to the fallen russian dazed jake saw shaeffer stop just a beat then start running in a crouch everything at once so that gunther was already in the car before jake realized it had started moving he leaped in holding on to the open door as he pulled his other leg inside they spun left back onto the broken ground of the park bouncing violently heading west toward the victory column racing ahead of the parade at their side gunther swerved away from a shallow bomb crater and hit a deep rut instead jolting the car smashing jakes sore shoulder against the door are you crazy emil shouted from the back his hand on the top of his head where it had bumped the roof stay down gunther said calmly twisting the wheel to avoid a stump jake looked back through the dust the other horch had started after them jouncing over the same rough ground farther behind a jeep presumably shaeffer was tearing away from the crowd that had formed around the dead russian through the open window bizarrely came trumpets and the steady thump of drums the world of five minutes ago i tried to delay them gunther said the wrong time i thought you would be gone know something was wrong why you you were expecting me i would lead you to the car for the permits but he saw brandt running so an impulsive people he said tersely holding the wheel as they bounced over another hole in the pitted field you were pretty impulsive yourself why you and not the american he couldnt come jake glanced back gaining a little he did though in fact hes coming now gunther grunted trying to work this out a test maybe then can they trust a german they got their answer jake looked over at him but i should have i should have known gunther shrugged focused on driving who knows anyone in berlin he jerked the wheel skirting a hohenzollern statue that had somehow survived only the face chipped away by blast are they still there he said not trusting himself to look away to the rearview mirror jake turned yes we need a road we cant go faster like this the traffic circle at the grosser stern was now in sight a bottleneck jammed with marchers if we can cut acrosshold on another swerve to the left jolting the car away from the parade deeper into the battered park in the back emil groaned jake knew that gunther was taking them south toward the american zone but all the landmarks he had known were gone the stretch ahead of them desolate broken by stumps and twisted scraps of lampposts rons lunar landscape the ground was even rougher not as cleared as the border of the chausee the earth thrown up here and there in mounds not far gunther said rising out of his seat over a bump even the solid horch springs pounded flat and for a moment looking behind at the dust the cars coming after them jake realized an unexpected thought that gunther finally had his wild west stagecoach bucking across the badlands at a gallop and then eerily the other horch entered the karl may dream too firing at them from behind a firecracker sound of shots then a shattering pop at the back window my god theyre shooting at us emil yelled his voice jagged with fear stop its madness what are you doing theyll kill us keep flat gunther said hunching a little farther over the wheel jake crouched and peered back over the edge of the seat both vehicles firing now an aimless volley of stray shots come on gunther jake said a jockey to a horse its there its there a clear space of asphalt in the distance he steered right as if he were heading back to the grosser stern then sharply left dodging a fallen limb not yet scavenged for firewood confusing the two cars behind more shots one grazing the back fender please stop emil said almost hysterical on the back floor youll kill us but they were there crashing over a mound of broken pavement piled up at the edge of hofjagerallee and landing with a loud thunk on the cleared avenue improbably there was traffictwo convoy trucks grinding toward them on their way to the traffic circle gunther shot out in front of them and wrenched the wheel left tires squealing so close there was an angry blast of horn christ gunther jake said breathless police driving he said the car still shuddering from the skid lets not have a police death no thats a bullet jake looked back the others werent as lucky stuck at the side of the road until the trucks lumbered past gunther opened up the engine speeding toward the bridge into liitzowplatz if they could make it to the bridge theyd be back in town a maze of streets and pedestrians where at least the shooting would stop but why had the russians fired in the first place risking emil a desperate logic better dead than with the americans which meant they thought they might lose after all but not yet the horch behind them had picked up speed too on the smooth road now the route was straightget past the diplomatic quarter at the bottom of the park then over the landwehrkanal gunther honked the horn a group of civilians was trudging down the side of the road with a handcart they scattered in both directions away from the car but still on the road so that gunther had to slow down pumping the brake and the horn at the same time it was the chance the russians were looking for racing to close the gap between the cars another shot the civilians darting in terror still coming jake swiveled to his open window and fired at the horch behind aiming low a warning shot two to make them slow down not even a pause and then as gunther slammed the horn again the russians car began to smokeno steam a teakettle steam that poured out of the grille then blew back over the hood a lucky shot ripping into the radiator or just the old motor finally giving up what did it matter the car kept hurtling toward them driving into its own cloud then began to slow not the brake a running down go jake said the road finally clear of civilians behind them the horch had stopped one of the men jumped out and rested his arm on the door to take aim a target gallery shot gunther pressed the accelerator the car jumped forward again this time jake didnt even hear the bullet the splintering pop through the window lost under the noise of the engine and the shouts behind a small thud into flesh like a grunt not even loud enough to notice until the spurt of blood splashed onto the dashboard gunther fell forward still clutching the wheel gunther i can drive he said a hoarse gargle more blood leaping out spattering the wheel my god pullover not far his voice fainter the car began to veer left jake grabbed the wheel steadying it looking around only the jeep was chasing them now the horch stranded behind it they were still moving fast gunthers foot on the pedal heavy as dead weight jake threw himself closer putting both hands on the wheel trying to kick gunthers foot off the pedal the brake he shouted gunther had slumped forward again a bulky unmovable wall jake held on to the wheel his hands now slippery with blood move your leg but gunther seemed not to have heard him his eyes fixed on the blood still spilling out onto the wheel he gave a faint nod as if he were making sense of it then a small twitch of his mouth the way he used to smile a police death he mumbled almost inaudible his mouth seeping blood then slumped even farther gone his body falling on the wheel pressing against the horn so that they were racing toward the bridge with the horn blaring driven by a dead man jake tried to shove him aside one hand still on the wheel but only managed to push his upper body against the window hed have to dive underneath to move gunthers feet get to the brake but that would mean letting go emil lean over take the wheel maniacs emil said his voice shrill stop the car i cant grab the wheel emil started up from the floor then heard another shot and fell back again jake looked through the shattered window shaeffer blowing his horn now signaling them to stop grab the fucking wheel jake yelled another truck appeared in the oncoming lane now there wasnt even the option of spinning in circles hands slipping around the bloody wheel trying to keep a grip the bridge ahead then people get the brake with one hand he pushed hard against gunthers leg a cement weight but moving sliding back from the gas pedal wedged now at the bottom a little more and the car would slow only a matter of seconds before something gave it was the tire a stopping shot from shaeffer more effective than a horn blast the horch careened wildly as if jakes hands had left the wheel heading straight for the truck jake wrenched the wheel back hard swerving right missing the truck heading off the road in the other direction but after that lost all control plunging past some piles of rubble bouncing furiously the wheel meaningless he shoved at gunthers leg again dislodging it from the pedal but the car was moving on its own now a last surge of momentum that carried it away from the bridge over the embankment only choking to a stop in midair nothing beneath them a giddy suspension not even a full second at the top of a roller coaster an impossible floating through nothing then the car pitched down jake crouched lower bracing himself against gunther so that he didnt see the water as they plunged into the canal just felt the shock of the crash throwing him forward against the dash with a crunch a sick snapping sound at his shoulder his head bumping hard against the wheel a sharp pain that blotted out everything but the last instinct to take a deep gulp of air as the water rushed in to flood around him he opened his eyes murky almost viscous water too cloudy to see far not a canal anymore a sewer absurdly he thought of infection but there wasnt time to think about anything he lifted himself shoulder throbbing in a spasm and reached over the seat with his good hand grabbing emils shirt and pulling at it emil was moving not dead squirming up off the floor jake yanked the shirt lifting him over the seat and pushing him toward the window buoyant floating weight just a matter of steering him out but the front was crowded gunther taking up precious space jake leaned back twisting emils body so that he could shove it head first watching emils feet flailing as he kicked his way out hurry the canal wasnt deep enough time to get to the surface if his air held he began to follow through the window bumping his head again on the frame pulling himself with one arm the other useless halfway out emils shoe caught his shoulder kicking the pain so startling he thought he might black out and sink the way rescuers were accidentally taken down by the thrashing of the people they were trying to save his legs were now through the frame he began to stroke up to the surface but the shoe struck him again a strong kick catching him now at the side of the head a solid running pain to his shoulder dont gasp for christs sake emil move away then another kick downward not flailing this time deliberate intended to connect another one more and he might be knocked out bubbles rising to the surface not a weapon in sight no more air he swam sideways with his good arm only one effort left and pushed up gentle emil what would you do to survive as he broke the surface he barely got a gulp of air before the hand caught his throat and started to push his head back under a squeal of tires and shouts from the bank the hand came away jake pulled his head up sputtering emil emil had turned to look at the bank once a solid wall now bombed in places to slopes of rubble shaeffer and his man were picking their way down their attention on the awkward footing away from the water a minute maybe emil looked back at jake still gasping his shoulder now an agony its over jake said no barely a whisper his eyes on jake not like shaeffers a hunters but something more desperate what would you do emil reached for him and caught his throat again and as jakes head went under he saw with a sinking feeling worse than drowning that he was losing the wrong warnot shaeffers the one he hadnt even known he was fighting a kick to the stomach now forcing out air as the hand gripped his hair holding him under losing another kick hed die the kick marks no more suspicious than crash bruises emil getting away with it again he yanked his head down pulling emil with him scratching at his fingers no good punching through water hed have to claw the fingers off another kick below his stomach but the hand was letting go afraid perhaps of being dragged under with his victim do what he expects die jake sank lower emil couldnt see through the thick water would he follow let him think it had worked he felt a final kick the shoulder again and for a moment he was no longer pretending sinking deeper without the strength to pull himself back up the dizziness before a blackout his feet hit the roof of the car below he could see gunthers head lolling out of the car window floating like kelp the way hed look bastards he dropped bending his knees no breath left at all then pushed away with a last heave away from emil toward the bank here he is shaeffer shouted as his head bobbed up he sucked in air choking spitting the water that came with it the other soldier had waded in to get emil who gazed at jake in shock then dropped his head looking down at his hand where the scratches were welling with blood you all right shaeffer was saying why the hell didnt you stop jake kept gasping drifting toward the bank nowhere else to go now then he felt shaeffers hand on his collar dragging him onto the bank struggling then gripping his belt and yanking like tully being fished out of the jungfernsee he fell back against the broken concrete looking up at shaeffer a splash the sound of water dripping as emil came out a few yards away he closed his eyes fighting a wave of nausea from the pain then opened them again to shaeffer you going to finish me off here shaeffer looked at him confused dont be an asshole here let me give you a hand he said reaching for him but he grabbed the wrong arm as shaeffer pulled him up jakes shoulder went hot with pain and he couldnt stop the scream the last thing he heard before everything finally almost a relief did go black contents previous chapter next chapter chapter twenty they set his shoulder at the officers infirmary near onkel toms hutte or at least he was told they did a day later when he lay with a morphine hangover under the pink chenille spread at gelferstrasse people had drifted in and out ron to check the old woman from downstairs playing nurse none of them quite real just figures in a haze like his arm white with gauze and adhesive hanging in a sling not his at all someone elses who were they all when the old woman came back recognizable now the billets owner he realized embarrassed that he didnt even know her name then the stranger with her an american uniform gave him a shot and they disappeared too what he saw instead was gunthers face floating in the water no more points and later awake the face still in his mind he knew the haze was not just the drugs but a deeper exhaustion a giving up because he had done everything wrong he was sitting by the window looking down on the garden where the old woman had snipped parsley when lena finally came eve been so worried they wouldnt let me go to the hospital military only what if he had died you look nice he said as she kissed his forehead hair pinned up the dress he had bought in the market well for gelferstrasse she said a look between them blushing a little pleased that hed noticed and look heres erich they say its not so bad the shoulder only and ribs do the drugs make you sleepy my god this room she went over to the bed busy and straightened the spread there she said and for an instant he saw her as a younger version of the old woman a berliner going on see what erich brought it was his idea the boy handed over half a hershey bar eyes on the sling jake took the bar the haze lifting a little unexpectedly touched so much he said ill save it for later okay erich nodded can i feel he said pointing to the arm sure he ran his hand over the tape working out the mechanics of the sling interested you have a light touch jake said youll make a good doctor the boy shook his head alles ist kaput someday jake said still hazy then looked at lena again trying to focus clear his head what in fact were they doing here was shaeffer keeping him here had they told lena he turned to her get it over with they got emil yes he came to the flat with the american such a scene you cant imagine to the flat jake said why nothing clear he was looking for something erich said the files even now did he find it no lena said looking away he was angry the boy said well now hes happy lena said to him quickly so never mind hes going away so hes lucky too she looked at jake he said you saved his life no thats not what happened yes the american said so too oh youre always so modest its like the newsreel that didnt happen either ouf she said brushing this away well now its over do you want something can you eat busy again picking up a shirt from the floor i didnt save him he tried to kill me lena stopped still half bent over the shirt in hand such talk its the drugs no thats what happened he said trying to keep his voice level and clear he tried to kill me she turned slowly why the files i guess maybe because he thought he could no one would know its not true she said quietly no ask him how he got the scratches on his hand for a moment silence broken finally by someone clearing his throat well suppose we put all that behind us now shall we shaeffer came through the door ron trailing behind him lena turned to him so its true anybody in a car crash gets a few scratches you know look at you he said to jake you saw it jake said confusing situation like that a lot of splashing thats what i saw so it is true lena said sinking onto the bed sometimes the truths a little overrated shaeffer said doesnt always fit where have you got him jake said dont worry hes safe no thanks to you hell of a place to pick to go swimming god knows whats in there doc says wed better get some sulfa drugs into him before we take him to kransberg might spread youre taking him to kransberg whered you think i was taking himto the russians said genially without guile his smile pushing the rest of jakes haze away not shaeffer after all someone else tell me the truth lena said did emil do that shaeffer hesitated he might have got a little agitated is all now lets forget about all that well get geismar fixed up here and everybodyll be just fine yes fine lena said distracted we have a few things to go over ron said lena looked at the boy whod been following their conversation like a tennis match erich do you know whats downstairs a gramophone american records you go listen and ill be down soon take him down and get him set up shaeffer said to ron giving orders now your kid he said to lena lena shook her head staring at the floor all right shaeffer said turning to jake back to business why the hell did you keep running away from me i thought you were someone else jake said still trying to work it out he knew id be there he looked up but you knew id be there too how did you boys over in intelligence got a tip from whom i dont know really shaeffer said suddenly earnest you know how those things work you get a tip you dont have time to chase around to see where it comes fromyou find out if its true you ran out on us once why the fuck wouldnt i believe it he glanced over at lena i thought you were doing the lady another favor no i was doing you a favor yeah and look what happened whod you think i was the man who shot tully tully i told you once i dont give a shit about tully he looked over who was it i dont know now im not going to well who cares you should the man who shot him got brandt out of kransberg well im putting him back thats all that matters now the rest thats all forgotten another american smile last weeks game youve still got some bodies to account for you going to forget about them too i didnt shoot them just the tire yeah well the tire i figure i owe you for that one not that i fucking owe you anything but it fits ron says we can play it this way what are you talking about youve got people shot in public witnesses how do you play that well thats a question of what was seen isnt it a german guns down a russian officer hightails it away gets followed gets killed kind of thing happens in berlin in front of the whole press corps shaeffer smiled but the only one they recognize in the whole mess is you isnt that right ron afraid so ron said coming back in hard to keep track of whats what when things arehectic so so they know you were there you were seen so we had to explain you explain me how damned fool thing going after him like that shaeffer said but thats the kind of damned fool thing you do got a reputation for it and the pressyou cant blame themthey always like it when the heros one of their own fuck you thats not the way im going to write it ron looked at him thats the way its gone out from everybody while youve been on the critical list hanging by a thread as they say they did too i said i owed you for the tire so now youre a fucking hero not that you deserve it but it fits maybe the russians wont agree they were there too only the one whos dead you shoot the guys in the horch what horch shaeffer said looking up next question who shot gunther then he didnt die in a car crash theres a bullet in him so who put it there you did shaeffer said calmly ron leaped in before jake could say anything see kalachthats the russian he shotsaw him aim for the stands lucky kalach got to him before he could take out zhukovthats who we think he was after of course not so lucky for kalach but hell it might have been patton on victory day that kind of thing brings them out makes a statement apparently there were personal problemsa drunk never really got over the war cop who went badyou know when they do that theres nothing worse do anything not that i blame him for having a grudge against the russians you cant do that to him jake said quietly he was a good man hes dead shaeffer said it fits not for me and it wont fit for the russians yes it will a russian saved zhukov hell get the thanks of a grateful nation and you get ours allied cooperation and how do you explain emil we dont emil wasnt there hes been in kransberg we cant say we lost him the russians cant say they ever had him there was no incident thats the way this one works shaeffer stopped meeting jakes eyes nobody wants an incident i wont let you do this not to gunther what are you beefing about youre sitting pretty youll get a fat contract we get brandt back and the russians cant do a damn thing thats what i call a happy ending see i always said wed make a good team its not true jake said stubbornly it is though ron said i mean youve got a whole press corps thats just filed the story so it must be not after i file mine i hate to say it but people are going to be awfully annoyed if you do that they make you a hero and you throw egg on their faces no you dont want to do that in fact you cant because youd spike it is that the way we do our reporting now like dr goebbels dont get carried away we make certain accommodations thats all ron said indicating shaeffer for the good of the mg so will you real sweethearts arent you jake said his voice low scraping bottom you want to cry over some dead kraut do it on your own time shaeffer said impatient now weve had enough trouble as it is getting our man back we understand each other jake looked out the window again after all did it matter gunther was gone and so was the lead to the other man the case as hopeless now as the scraggly garden below go away he said which means yes i suppose well fine shaeffer picked up his hat i gather the ladys staying with you yes lena said then i guess you got what you wanted too that the reason for the little water fight so he still didnt know but did that matter either emil would search again and find the overlooked file solve that problem too his happy ending innocent the way shaeffer would want it anyway why dont you ask him jake said never mind shaeffer said glancing at lena cant say i blame him an easy compliment he turned to go oh one more thing brandt says you have some papers that belong to him lena looked up did he say what they were notes of his something he needs for von braun seems to think theyre pretty important kind of tore the place apart didnt he he said to lena im sorry about that more lies she said shaking her head maam and youre taking him to america were going to try do you know what kind of a man he is she said looking directly at him so that he shifted on his feet uncomfortable all i know is uncle sam wants him to build some rockets thats all i care about he lies to you and you lie for him you told me he saved jakes life my god and i believed you and now you believe him notes what a pair you are im only doing my job lena nodded her head smiling faintly yes thats what emil said too what a pair you are shaeffer held up his hand flustered now dont get me involved in domestic arguments what happens between a man and his wife he dropped it and turned to jake anyway whatever they are do you have them no he doesnt lena said shaeffer peered at her unsure where to take this then back at jake do you but jake was looking at lena everything clear now not even a wisp of haze i dont know what emils talking about shaeffer stood for a second fingering his hat then let it go well no matter theyre bound to turn up somewhere hell i thought he could do everything in his head afterward the room was quiet enough to hear his footsteps on the stairs did you destroy them jake said finally no i have them why didnt you i dont know i thought i would and then they came to the flat he was like a crazy man where are they where are they youre on his side the way he looked at me then and i thought yes his side she stopped looking at him where were they in my bag she walked over to the bed and pulled the papers out of her bag of course he never thought to look there my things everywhere else i stood there watching himlike a crazy manand i knew he never came to berlin for me did he maybe both no only these here she carried them over to his chair you know and you dont knowthats how everything was just now when you told me what happened there was a click in my head do you know why i wasnt surprised it was like beforeyou know and you dont know i dont want to live like that anymore here but jake didnt move just looked at the buff sheets held out between them what do you want me to do with them give them to the americans not that one she said gesturing toward the door hes the same another emil any lie then she pulled the papers back to her so that for a second jake thought she couldnt go through with it after all no ill take them tell me where theres a name bernie teitel i cant ask you to do that oh its not for you she said for me maybe for germany does that sound crazy to start somewhere so theres still something left not just emils anyway look at you where can you go like that as it happens he lives downstairs yes so its not so far for you it is he reached up for the papers hes still something to you she shook her head no she said slowly just a boy in a picture they looked at each other for a minute then jake leaned forward ignoring the papers and covering her hand instead she smiled and turned his hand over tracing the palm with her finger such a line in a man you make a nice couple shaeffer standing in the doorway with erich i brought the kid back he crossed over to them erich in tow arent you the sly one he said to lena holding out his hand ill take them they dont belong to you or emil lena said no the united states government he wiggled the fingers of his open hand in a giveme gesture thanks for saving me another looksee i figured he took the end of the papers thats an order he stared at her until she released them what do you think youre doing jake said what do you think youre doing this is government property youre going to get yourself in trouble if youre not careful they go to teitel ill save you the trip he started riffling through glancing at the pages not rocket notes i take it want to tell me reports from nordhausen jake said facts and figures from the camps slave labor details what the scientists knew lots of interesting stuff keep lookingyoull find a lot of your friends there is that a fact and you think this might make things a little embarrassing for them it might make them war criminals shaeffer looked up from the files you know your trouble is youre in the wrong war youre still fighting the last one they were involved jake said insistent geismar how many times do i have to tell you i dont care you should care lena said they killed people thats good coming from a german who do you think killed them or do you just want your husband to take the rap convenient you cant talk to her that way jake said starting to get up wincing as shaeffer pushed him back watch your shoulder well now weve got a situation what a pain in the ass you are ill be a bigger pain in the ass if teitel doesnt get those files not even rons going to spike this story which one is that try a congressman bringing nazis into the states he wouldnt like that or a tech team playing hideandseek with the russians lots of ways to go if i want to or we could do it the right way you helping the military government do what it says its trying to do bring these fucks to trial a trial story this time youre the hero let me explain something to you shaeffer said plain and simple look at this country these scientists are the only reparations were likely to get and were going to get them we need them to fight the russians yes to fight the russians you ought to figure out whose side youre on and it doesnt matter about the camps i dont care if they banged mrs roosevelt we need them got it if teitel doesnt get those files ill do the story dont think i won t i think you wont shaeffer turned the papers sideways and before jake could move tore them across dont jake said starting to rise the sound of tearing jolting across him like the pain shooting through his shoulder another tear jake only half out of his seat then falling back watching helplessly as the paper became pieces you bastard a final rip shaeffer took a step toward the window and flung them out large bits of paper suspended then caught by the wind flying over the gardennot small about the same size jake saw staring hypnotically as the bills that had danced and blown over the cecilienhof lawn like i said shaeffer said turning back youre in the wrong war that ones over jake watched him go brushing past lena and wideeyed erich who had already known everything was kaput i feel ive let you down too jake said to bernie you more than anybody i guess they had come to gunthers to pick up the persilscheins and found the room ransacked stacks pulled apart torn boxes littering the floor join the crowd everybody lets me down bernie said a light growl not really angry christ look at this word gets around fast ever notice how the liquors the first thing to go then the coffee he picked up the folders from the floor and stacked them dont beat yourself up too much okay at least i know what to look for thats more than i had before theres lots of evidence floating around germanysome of it could still land on my desk youll never get them jake said gloomy then well get someone else bernie said going through a bureau drawer not exactly a shortage but doesnt it bother you bother me he turned to jake shoulders sagging let me tell you something i came over here i thought i was really going to do something justice and where did i end up at the back of the line everybodys got a hand out we cant do it all feed the peopletheyre starving get krupp up and running again get the mines open the jews well that was terrible sure but what are we supposed to do this winter if we dont get some coal out of the russians freeze everybodys got a priority except the jews arent on anybodys list well deal with that later if anybody has the time so i lose a few scientists im still trying to get the camp guards small fry not to the people they killed he paused look i dont like it either but thats the way it is you think youre going to set the world on fire and you come hereall you do is pick through the damage without a priority so you do what you can yeah i know one at a time an eye for an eye bernie looked up thats a little old testament for me there isnt any punishment you know how do you punish this then why bother so we know every trial this is what happened now we know then another trial im a da thats all i bring things to trial jake looked down fingering the persilscheins on the table i still wish i had the files they werent guardsthey should have known setter geismar bernie said softly everybody should have known better would it help if i wrote something got you some press bernie smiled and went back to the drawer save your ink go home look at you all banged up havent you had enough id like to know what who the other man is that youre still on that whats the point well for one thing he could still be working for the russians jake dropped the folder on the table anyway id like to know for gunther finish the case for him i doubt he cares anymore or do you have ways of getting messages up there jake walked over to the map left in place by the scavengers the brandenburg the wide chausee where the reviewing stand had been why would someone working for the russians tip off the americans where emil was going to be why would he do that you got me now see gunther would have figured it out thats the kind of thing he was good atthings that didnt add up not anymore bernie said hey look at this he had pulled an old square box from the back of the drawer velvet or felt like a jewel case opened now to a medal jake thought of the hundreds lying on the chancellery floor not put away like this treasured iron cross first class bernie said nineteen seventeen a veteran he never said jake looked at the medal then handed it back he was a good german i wish i knew what that meant it used to mean this jake said almost done yeah grab the files you think theres anything in the bedroom not many effects are there just the books he took a karl may from the shelf a souvenir then moved to the table and picked up one of the folders and flipped it open a herr krieger said to have been in a concentration camp now category iv no evidence of nazi activity release advised he glanced idly down the page then stopped staring at it of course no not of course impossible my god he said what bernie said coming in from the bedroom you know how you said evidence lands on your desk some just landed on mine i think jake scooped up the files i need the jeep the jeep i have to check something another file it wont take long you cant drive like that one hand ive done it before bumping through the tiergarten come on quick he said his hand out for the keys its getting dark bernie said but tossed them over what am i supposed to do here read that he nodded at the karl may he tells a hell of a story he headed west to potsdamerstrasse then south toward kleist park in the dusk only the bulky council headquarters had shape lit up by a few offices working late the car park nearly deserted up the opera house staircase down the hall the translucent door to mullers office dark but not locked only the germans huddled behind locks now he flicked on the light jeanies usual neat desk every pencil put away he went over to the filing cabinet and flipped the tabs until he found the right folder then carried it back to the desk with the persilscheins it was only after hed looked through it then at the persilscheins once more that he sat down sinking back against the chair thinking follow the points but he saw even before he reached the bottom of the column that gunther had found it without even knowing sitting there all along and now what could he prove it he could already see with the inevitable sinking feeling that ron would take care of this too another story to protect the guilty in the interests of the military government maybe a little quiet justice later when no one was looking and why should anyone look emil back safe the russians foiledeveryone satisfied except tully who hadnt mattered in the first place the wrong war again jake would win and get nothing not even reparations he sat up staring at tullys transfer sheet the block capitals in fuzzy carbon not this time not an eye for an eye but something a different reparation one for the innocent he leaned over opened the desk drawers to his side and rummaged through stacks of government forms printed second sheets gummed for carbons arranged in marked piles he mentally tipped his hat to jeanie everything in its place he pulled one out then looked for another a different pile and swung around to the typewriter removing the cover with his good hand and rolling in the first form aligning it so that the letters would fill the box without hitting the line official when he started to type a onefinger peck the sound of the keys filled the room and drifted out to the lonely corridor a guard came by suspicious but only nodded when he saw jakes uniform working late you ought to give it a rest with the sling and all almost done but in fact it seemed to take hours one keystroke at a time his shoulder hurting then he realized hed need a supporting document and had to search the desk again he found it in the bottom drawer next to a stash of nail polish from the states so jeanie had a friend he rolled the new form into place and started typing still careful nothing messy he was almost finished when a shadow from the doorway fell over the page what are you doing muller said the guard said filling out some forms for you jeanie can do that he said wary not these have a seat im almost done have a seat he said drawing his shoulders back in surprise old army there jake said rolling the form out all ready all you have to do is sign what the hell are you doing you know how to do that thats what you do lots of signatures like these he pushed over the bensheim releases from gunthers muller picked them up a quick glance where did you get these i looked i like to know things then you know these are forged are they maybe this isnt he held up the other folder what isnt muller said not even bothering to look tullys transfer home you transferred him tully was attached to frankfurt there was never any reason for a copy of his orders to end up here except a copy would go to the authorizing officer regulations so one did maybe you didnt even know it was herejeanie just filed it away with everything else that came in shes an efficient girl never occurred to her to he dropped the folder of course it never occurred to me either why thered be a copy here but then a lot of things didnt occur to me why youd hold out on me with the cid report why youd lead me on that wild goose chase with the black market i thought i was dragging it out of youthat must have been fun to watch me asking all the wrong questions lets not embarrass the mg he paused looking up at the lean judge hardy face older than he remembered you know the funny thing i still dont want it to be you maybe its the hair you dont fit the part you were one of the good guys i thought at least there had to be one dont want what to be me you killed him you cant be serious and it almost worked too if hed just stayed down there in the havel justdisappeared the way emil did but he didnt you enjoy this making up stories mm this is a good one let me try it on you have a seat but muller remained standing shoulders erect his tall frame looming over the desk waiting like a weapon held in reserve lets start with the transfer thats what should have tipped me if id been paying attention gunther would have seen itthats the kind of thing he noticed transfer a man you didnt know except you did your old partner jake nodded at the persilscheins just why you wanted to get him home im not sure but i can guess of course he wasnt the most reliable guy to do business with in the first place but my guess is that you got nervous everything worked the way it was supposed to brandts trail was cold before they even knew there was one but then shaeffer started sniffing around hes a guy who likes to make noise set off some bells and whistlesi think thats the expression he used which means he went to mg which means they started going off here with a congressman behind him nothing to connect you yet but now it wasnt going to go away either and theres tullytalk about a weak link who knew what hed say how long before shaeffer found out youd done business before another nod at the bensheim file you with me so far so the easiest thing was to send him homeall you had to do was sign a form thats what everybody wants isnt it except this time it didnt take tully didnt want to go homehe had plans here you call him to berlin in a hurry not even time to pack get him on the first plane you might have waited by the way did you know he was coming anyway a tuesday appointment but no matter the point was to get it done fast heres your hat whats your hurry sikorsky meets him at the airport and drops him at the control council muller raised his head to speak dont bother jake said he told me so himself so tully comes to pick up a jeep but nobody just waltzes in and takes a jeep its not a taxi stand out there motor pool assigns them to you for instance i could check how many you had signed out that day but why bother now one of yours where you were i dont knowprobably at a meeting defending the free and the brave which is why you couldnt meet him in the first place the plane was late which must have cut into your schedule anyway busy which was too bad because tully got busy too down at the document center so that when you met him there later he had a new racket going not to mention a new payment from sikorsky which he didnt i guessmention that is he watched mullers face no he wouldnt but all the more reason now to hang aroundmore money where that came from you tell me how it played from there did he tell you where to stick your transfer or did he threaten to expose you if you didnt play ball in for a penny in for a pound plenty of money to be made on those ss files shaeffer you could take care of him youd taken care of bensheim hadnt you and if you couldntwell youd have to or hed take you down with him anyway he sure as hell wasnt going to natick mass when there was a fortune to be made here of course its possible you got rid of him to keep the files all to yourself but he didnt have the files yet the doc center had come up dry so far so i think its just that he boxed you in so tight you didnt think you had much choice the transfer would have been so easy but you still had to get rid of him somehow is that more the way it was muller said nothing his face blank so you did a little ride out to the lake to talk things overyou dont want to be seen together and tullys stubborn hes got a belt full of money and god knows what dancing in his head and he tells you the way its going to be not just brandt more and you know its not going to work brandt was one thinghe even helped but now youve got shaeffer around do the smart thingtake the money and run before its too late the last thing tully wants to hear maybe the last thing he did hear ill give you this muchi dont think you planned it too sloppy for one thingyou didnt even take his tags after you shot him just threw him in no weights maybe you thought the boots would do it probably you werent thinking at all just panicked that kind of crime anyway its done and hes gone and thenheres the best part even i couldnt make it upyou went home and had dinner with me and i liked you i thought you were what we were here for to make the peace christ muller everything okay here the guard surprising them from the door muller swiveled moving his hand to his hip then stopped were almost done jake said steadily staring at mullers hand getting late the guard said muller blinked yes fine he said his mg voice dropping his hand he turned back and waited his eyes locked on jake until the steps in the hall grew faint jumpy jake said he nodded at mullers hip watch yourself with that muller leaned forward placing his hands on the desk you take some chances what that youll plug me i doubt it he waved his hand anyway not here think of the mess what would jeanie say besides you already tried that once he looked at him until muller took his hands away from the desk as if hed literally been pushed back by jakes stare i dont know what youre talking about in potsdam thats when everything started falling apart now you had real blood on your hands not just a smalltime chiseler liz howd that make you feel when you heard heard what you killed her too same as if you pulled the trigger you cant prove this muller said almost a whisper want to bet what do you think ive been doing all this time you know i might not even have tried if it had just been tully i guess you could say he got what was coming to him but liz didnt gunther was right about that too the when why try to kill me then another thing that didnt occur to me until now when i started putting things together why do it at all tullys dead and sos shaeffers trail no way to connect you even after he washes upquick report bodys shipped out before anybody can take a good look not that anybody wanted toall they were looking at was the money what other explanation could there be its sure as hell the only one you wanted me to have talk about a lucky break for you money you didnt even know he had what did you think when it turned up by the way id be curious to know muller said nothing just a little gift from the gods i guess so youre safe shaeffers stuck and im off looking at watches in the black market and then something happens i start asking questions about brandt at kransbergfor personal reasons but you dont know that you think i must know something made the connection no one else did and if im asking maybe somebody else is going to put two and two together too but you cant get me out of berlin that would just make things worseid make a stink and people would wonder and then at tommys goingaway party what do i do i ask you to check the dispatcher at frankfurt the one you calledor did you get jeanie to do it no youd do it yourselfto get tully on the plane personal authorization not on the manifest which hed remember not just close anymore a real connection so you panic again you transfer his ass out of there like that but even thats not safe enough you get somebody to get rid of me in potsdam the next day but that didnt occur to me either not then i was just lying there with an innocent womans blood all over me muller lowered his head that wasnt supposed to happen jake sat still finally there the confession so easily said that girl that wasnt supposed to happen muller said again i never meant her to no just me christ muller it wasnt me sikorsky i told him id transfer mahoney that would do it i never told him to kill you never believe me jake looked up at him i do believe you but liz is still dead now muller did sit down his body sagging slowly into the chair head still low so that only his silver hair caught the light of the desk lamp none of this was supposed to happen you start something people get in the way i suppose shaeffer would have been a bonus i didnt even know he was there i didnt know it was all sikorsky he was worse than tully once they start his voice trailed off yeah its hard to get away i know jake paused toying with the folder tell me something though whyd you tip shaeffer that id be at the parade with brandt it had to be youill bet you know just how to get something to intelligence like it came out of the air but why do it gunther sets it up with kalach who tells you but you cant go the one person who couldnt youre brass general clays man you had to be at the parade another thing that didnt occur to me so our mistake but kalach s going to make the snatch anyway you could have watched the whole thing without anyones being the wiser right up there with patton why tip shaeffer to put an end to it if shaeffer got him back hed stop i wanted it to stop and if he didnt get him it didnt really matter who got him did it maybe kalach would after all and take shaeffer out doing it and it would stop that way while you were watching no i wanted shaeffer to have him i thought it would work sikorsky would have been suspicious if something went wrong but the new man would have taken the blame himself and youd be home free muller looked over i wanted out of all of it im not a traitor when this started i didnt know what brandt meant to us you mean how much shaeffer would want him back just another one of these jake said picking up the bensheim file for ten thousand dollars i didnt know lets do us both a favor and skip the explanations everybody in berlin wants to give me an explanation and it never changes anything he dropped the folder but just give me one the one thing i still cant figure whyd you do it the money muller said nothing then looked away oddly embarrassed it was just sitting there so easy he turned back to jake everybody else was getting theirs ive been in the service twentythree years and whats it going to get me a lousy pension and heres a little snot like tully with plenty of change in his pockets why not he pointed to the persilscheins the first few at bensheim i didnt even know what i was signing just more paper there was always somethinghe knew how to slip them through then i finally realized what he was doing and could have courtmartialed him but you didnt he make you a deal muller nodded id already signed why not a few more he said his voice vague talking to himself nobody cared about the germans whether they got out or not he said if it went wrong later i could say hed forged them meanwhile the money was thereall you had to do was pick it up who would know he could be persuasive when he wanted to beyou didnt know that about him maybe he had a willing audience jake said then things got tricky at bensheim so you got him out of thereanother one of your quick transfersand the next thing you know he turns up with another idea still persuasive not just a little persilschein this time real money real money muller said quietly not some lousy pension you know what thats like waiting for a check every month you spend your whole life just to get the rank and these new guys come in spare me jake said thats right muller said his mouth twisted you dont need an explanation you already know everything you want to know jake nodded thats right everything you couldnt leave it alone could you muller said now what are you going to do call the mps you dont really think i can let you do that do you not now ordinarily no but dont get triggerhappy yet jake said glancing toward mullers hip again im a friend to the army remember muller looked up meaning meaning nobodys going to call anybody then what what are you going to do im going to let you get away with murder neither of them said anything for a moment staring then jake sat back that seems to be the general policy around here if its useful to us so now youre going to be useful to me what do you want muller said still staring not quite sure how to take this jake tossed one of the forms over to him your signature first this one muller picked it up and looked it over a bureaucrats reflex read before you sign tullys inadvertent lesson whos rosen a doctor youre giving him a visa for the states a german i cant do that yes you can in the national interest like the other scientists this ones even cleanno nazi affiliations at all he was in a camp you fill in the classification code he handed over a pen sign it muller took the pen i dont understand he said but when jake didnt answer he leaned forward and scribbled in one of the boxes then signed the bottom now this one erich geismar he s my son since when since you signed this us citizen rosens taking him home a child hell need proof of citizenship he has it jake said tossing him the last form right here sign that too the law says youre the law you asked for proof and i gave it to you it says so right here now sign off on it and its official sign it muller began writing what about the mother a clerks question in a consulate shes dead german but hes american mg just said so when muller was finished jake took the forms back and tore off the bottom carbons thank you you just did something decent for a change your copies where muller nodded to a box on jeanies desk careful you dont lose them youll need the particulars in case anybody wants to verify them with you and you will verify them personally if theres any problem at all understood muller nodded jake stood up folding the papers into his breast pocket fine then that does it always useful to have a friend in the mg thats all you mean am i going to put the bite on you for something else no im not tully he patted his pocket youre giving them a life that seems a fair trade to me i dont particularly care what you do with yours but you know well thats just it you were right about one thing you see i cant prove it cant prove it muller said faintly oh dont get excited jake said catching mullers expression dont get any ideas either i cant prove it but i can come close cid must still have the bullet they took out of tully they could make a match but maybe not guns have a way of disappearing and i suppose i could track down the dispatcher you sent home but you know something i dont care anymore i have all the reparations i want and youwell i guess youll have some worried nights and thats fine with me too so lets just leave it there but if anything goes wrong with these he said touching his pocket again your luck runs out understand i cant prove it in court but i can come close enough for the army id do it too lots of mud the kind of thing they dont like at all maybe a dishonorable the pension for sure so just play ball and everybody walks away and thats all well one more thing now that you mention it you cant transfer yourself home but make the request to clay health reasons you cant stay here the russians dont know you tipped shaeffer they think youre still in business and they can be persuasive too thats the last thing the mg needsa worm in the barrel theyve got their hands full just trying to figure out what theyre doing here maybe theyll even bring in somebody who can do the place some good i doubt it but maybe he stopped looking down at the silver hair i thought that was you but i guess something got in your way how do i know youll well strictly speaking you dont like i said some worried nights but dont have them here not in berlin then i might just change my mind jake picked up the bensheim folders and stacked them ill keep these he went around the desk starting for the door go home you need a job go see american dye i hear theyre hiring ill bet theyd go for somebody just like you with your experience just stay out of berlin anyway you dont want to run into me againthatd just make you nervous and you know what i dont want to run into you either youre staying here why not lots of stories in berlin muller shook his head your press pass expires he said dully an official jake smiled surprised ill bet you know the exact hour too all right one more thing then have jeanie do up a residence permit tomorrow indefinite stay special from the mg sign that and were done are we muller said looking up i am you have some nights to get through but you will people do its something you learn hereafter a while nobody remembers anything he walked to the door geismar muller said stopping him he rose from the chair his face even older slack it was just the money im a soldier im not a honest to god i never meant this to happen any of it jake turned that should make them easier then the nights he looked over at him its not much though is it contents previous chapter next chapter chapter twentyone at this hour tempelhof was almost deserted later when the afternoon flights came in the high marble hall would fill up with uniforms just as it had that first day but now there were only a few gis sitting on duffel bags waiting the doors were still closed to the stairs that led down to the runways now remember what i told you lena was saying crouched down in front of erich fussing brushing his hair back stay close to dr rosen when you change for bremen so many people hold his hand yes you remember erich nodded can i sit by the window he said already on his way yes the window you can wave ill be right there she pointed to the observation deck but ill see you you wont be afraid will you hes excited rosen said to jake smiling a first airplane and a ship well mine too this kindnessi can never repay you just be a good father to him hes never had one his motheri dont know what he remembers a few visits what happened to her she died in the camps you knew her a long time ago he touched rosens arm raise him as a jew well how else rosen said mildly thats what you want yes she died for that tell him if he asks that he should be proud of her he paused for a moment at the alex again watching the shuffling walk back to the cell now youve got franks number at colliers yes yes i told him to meet the boat but just in case thats where to reach him hell have money for you hell fix you up with anything you need till you get on your feet in new york its like a dream it wont seem like a dream after youve been there a while do you want to go to the bathroom lena said to erich on the plane i dont know theres still time come to the womens erich said oh so big all of a sudden come she led him away i wonder does he know what you do for him rosen said how lucky he is jake glanced at him what passed for luck in berlin but rosen was looking over his shoulder who is the old man he knows you professor brandt was coming toward them in his old dark suit the high weimar collar as stiff as his walk good morning he said so youve come to see emil off too someone else jake said i didnt know he was on the plane i thought perhaps its the last time professor brandt said hesitantly explaining himself he looked at jake so you were a friend to him after all no he didnt need me he arranged things himself ah professor brandt said mystified but reluctant to pursue it he checked his pocket watch theyll be late no there they are coming through the waiting hall like the front wedge of a military unit heels loud against the floor emil and shaeffer breimer with them trailed by gis carrying bags an airport gi as if alerted by the heels appeared from the side and opened the door standing at the head of the stairs with a clipboard when they reached the gate they stopped short surprised to find visitors what the hell are you doing here shaeffer said to jake jake said nothing watching emil walk up to his father well papa emil said disconcerted a young voice come to see the boys off huh breimer said nice of you geismar professor brandt stood still for a moment looking at emil then extended his hand so its goodbye he said his voice shaky behind the formal gesture well not for good emil said pleasantly caught by the hand but trying to sidestep any sentiment ill come back sometime you know its my home after all no professor brandt said faintly touching his arm you have done enough for germany go he dropped the hand looking at him maybe things will be different for you now in america different emil said flushing aware that the others were looking but their eyes were on professor brandt whose shoulders had started to shake a raw uncontrolled blubbering catching everyone offguard an emotion no one expected before emil could react the old man reached out and clutched him wrapping his arms around him holding on a death grip jake wanted to look away but instead kept staring at them dismayed maybe the only story that really mattered the endless ties of lifes cats cradle tangled like yarn well papa emil said leaning back you made me so happy professor brandt said when you were a boy so happy still shaking his face wet so that now the others did turn away awkward as if he had somehow become incontinent papa emil said still helpless in the grasp then professor brandt pulled away collecting himself patting emils upper arm well but here are your friends too he turned to jake forgive me an old mans foolishness he stepped aside ceding place not bothering to wipe his face emil looked at jake oddly relieved grateful for any interruption but now uncertain what to do he started to offer his hand so he said all ends for the best does it jake said ignoring the hand he nodded at jakes sling the shoulder its all right jake said nothing its a misunderstanding about that shaeffer told me no misunderstanding jake opened his mouth to speak again then glanced at professor brandt and instead just turned away we certainly dont want that breimer said genial not after what you two have been through no we certainly dont want that shaeffer said pointedly to jake a signal to take emils hand but the moment had passed because now emil had turned too toward the edge of the gate area where lena was coming around the corner with erich she was bent over talking to him when she glanced up and saw the waiting party she stopped slowly raising her head another second and then she began walking again shoulders back determined the way shed come into the adlon dining room not in her good dress this time a cheap print with tiny flowers but beautiful catching the light just by walking in it whats she doing here shaeffer said as she approached that the wife breimer said well why the hell not say goodbye to her husband within earshot now standing in front of emil no youre mistaken she said to breimer but looking at emil my husband died in the war she moved past him leaving a silence jake looked at emil the same flustered expression hed given professor brandt a confused despair as if he had finally glimpsed the missing piece then seen it float away before he could tell what it was in the war breimer said lena took jakes arm theyre boarding come erich rosen put a hand on the boys shoulder and they moved toward the stairs behind the gis with duffel bags now remember to hold hands yes lena turned to rosen you have the lunch rosen held up the bag with a tolerant smile lena knelt in front of erich like the mother hen thats what he hug a hug from my chick always so good ill write to you shall i do that in english dr rosen can read then you you can practice hows that for a plan jake too come she said to jake standing up say goodbye jake hunched down one arm on erichs shoulder be good and listen to dr rosen okay youll have lots of good times and ill come visit someday youre not my father the boy said curious no your fathers dead you know that now dr rosen is going to take care of you you gave me your name oh that well everybody gets a new name in america thats how they do it there so i gave you mine is that all right erich nodded and ill come to see you i promise okay the boy said then reached up and put one arm around jakes neck a quick hug but careful of the sling so that the thin arm was almost weightless light as a loose strand of yarn geismar he said thats english its not german well it used to be before now its american like me thats right like you come on youd better hurry if you want a window he said shooing him to rosen dont forget to wave lena said as they started down the stairs ill be watching she turned acknowledging professor brandt for the first time by touching his sleeve so its good you came we can see over there she said turning from the group toward the big window you watch i said goodbye now to you too it seems he said glancing toward emil he raised his hand stopping her before she could say anything then leaned over and kissed her lightly on the forehead he looked at her for a second then nodded a mute goodbye and started back toward the amber hall shaeffer had checked their names on the list and was now waiting for emil who still stood motionless his eyes on lena come on emil he said impatient then turned to breimer ill see you in frankfurt thanks for everything died in the war emil called to lena thats how we leave each other she turned back looking at him angrily no im leaving you with peter now go with peter what does that mean what do you mean by that frustrated his voice louder jake looked over at lena her face still hard and for an instant he thought she might do it as easily as gunthers waitress asking for a check then she glanced at professor brandt and lowered her head nothing like the rest of it it means nothing go away she walked over to the window not looking back come on emil shaeffer said leading him down the stairs well thats a hell of a thing breimer said to jake you ought to talk to her acting like that who the hell does she think one more word and ill flatten you i wont even wait for the next election to vote you out breimer looked at him startled now dont get all hot no disrespect meant i suppose under the circumstances still thats no way to act after everything hes been through hell after everything youve been through joe told me what you did for us i know you like to think youre a wiseassyou are too he said glancing up youre a hard man to like you know that but then we get down to the short hairs and you came through i take my hat off to you for that one he stopped the words sounding hollow even to him anyway we got him thats the main thing but these people he looked toward lena ill never understand them if i live to be a hundred you do everything for them what are we doing for them jake said quietly id like to know why were helping them thats what breimer said easily got to now who else is going to do it the russians look at this place you can see what theyve been through jake looked down at the runway a faint clunk of propellers emil and shaeffer hurrying past the ground crew to the plane across the field the light had come up pale and dusty hanging over the miles of broken houses do you have any idea what happened here he said half to himself i mean any idea i suppose youre going to tell me well i know all about that so let me tell you something i like to look ahead whats past is past all these people want to do is forget you cant blame them for that so thats what were going to do jake said suddenly tired his shoulder starting to ache again help them forget you want to put it that way yes i guess we are the good germans anyway like brandt jake said watching him board the plane certainly like brandt who else one of the good ones jake said moving away from the window and glancing over toward lena standing with her hand half raised ready to wave he turned to breimer is that what you think breimer looked at him eyes steady he has to be doesnt he he said smoothly hes one of ours
