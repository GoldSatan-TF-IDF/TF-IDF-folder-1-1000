lois mcmaster bujold komarr barrayar chapter one the last gleaming sliver of komarrs truesun melted out of sight beyond the low hills on the western horizon lagging behind it in the vault of the heavens the reflected fire of the solar mirror sprang out in brilliant contrast to the darkening purpletinged blue when ekaterin had first viewed the hexagonal solettaarray from downside on komarrs surface shed immediately imagined it as a grand winterfair ornament hung in the sky like a snowflake made of stars benign and consoling she leaned now on her balcony overlooking serifosa domes central city park and gravely studied the lopsided spray of light through the glassy arc overhead it sparkled deceptively in contrast to the toodark sky three of the six disks of the starflake shone not at all and the central seventh was occluded and dull ancient earthmen she had read had taken alterations in the clockwork procession of their heavenscomets novae shooting starsfor disturbing omens premonitions of disasters natural or political the very word disaster embedded the astrological source of the concept the collision two weeks ago of an outofcontrol innersystem ore freighter with the insolation mirror that supplemented komarrs solar energy was surely most literally a disaster instantly so for the halfdozen komarran members of the solettas stationkeeping crew who had been killed but it seemed to be playing out in slow motion thereafter it had so far barely affected the sealed arcologies that housed the planets population below her in the park a crew of workers was arranging supplemental lighting on high girders similar stopgap measures in the citys foodproducing greenhouses must be nearly complete to spare them and this equipment to such an ornamental task no she reminded herself no vegetation in the dome was merely ornamental each added its bit to the biological reservoir that ultimately supported life here the gardens in the domes would live cared for by their human symbiotes outside the arcologies in the fragile plantations that labored to biotransform a world it was another question altogether she knew the math discussed nightly at her dinner table for two weeks of the percentage loss of insolation at the equator days gone wintercloudyexcept that they were planetwide and going on and on until when when would repairs be complete when would they start for that matter as sabotage if it had been sabotage the destruction was inexplicable as halfsabotage doubly inexplicable will they try again if it was a they at all ghastly malice and not mere ghastly accident she sighed and turned away from the view and switched on the spotlights shed put up to supplement her own tiny balcony garden some of the barrayaran plants shed started were particularly touchy about their illumination she checked the light with a meter and shifted two boxes of deerslayer vine closer to the source and set the timers she moved about checking soil temperature and moisture with sensitive and practiced fingers watering sparingly where needed briefly she considered moving her old bonsaid skellytum indoors to provide it with more controlled conditions but it was all indoors here on komarr really she hadnt felt wind in her hair for nearly a year she felt an odd twinge of identification with the transplanted ecology outside slowly starving for light and heat suffocating in a toxic atmosphere stupid stop it were lucky to be here ekaterin her husbands inquiring bellow echoed muffled inside the residence tower she poked her head through the door to the kitchen im on the balcony well come down here she set her gardening tools in the box seat closed the lid sealed the transparent doors behind her and hurried across the room into the hall and down the circular staircase tien was standing impatiently beside the double doors from their apartment to the buildings corridor a comm link in his hand your uncle just called hes landed at the shuttleport ill get him ill get nikolai and go with you dont bother im just going to meet him at the west station locks he said to tell you hes bringing a guest another auditor some sort of assistant to him it sounded like but he said not to worry theyll both take pot luck he seemed to imagine wed feed them in the kitchen or something eh two imperial auditors why ever did you have to invite him anyway she stared at him in dismay how can my uncle vorthys come to komarr and not see us besides you cant say your department isnt affected by what hes investigating naturally he wants to see it i thought you liked him he slapped his hand arrhythmically on his thigh back when he was just the old weird professor sure eccentric uncle vorthys the vor tech this imperial appointment of his took the whole family by surprise i cant imagine what favors he called in to get it is that your only idea of how men advance but she did not speak the weary thought aloud of all political appointments surely imperial auditor is the least likely to be gained that way she murmured naive kat he smiled shortly and hugged her around the shoulders no one gets something for nothing in vorbarr sultana except perhaps your uncles assistant whom i gather is closely related to the vorkosigan he apparently got his appointment for breathing incredibly young for the job if hes the one i heard about who was sworn in at winterfair a lightweight i presume although all your uncle vorthys said was that he was sensitive about his height and not to mention it at least some part of this mess promises to be a show he tucked his comm link away in his tunic pocket his hand was shaking slightly ekaterin grasped his wrist and turned it over the tremula increased she raised her eyes dark with worry in silent question to his no dammit he jerked his arm away its not starting im just a little tense and tired and hungry so see if you cant pull together a decent meal by the time were back your uncle may have prole tastes but i cant imagine theyre shared by a vorbarr sultana lordling he thrust his hands into his trouser pockets and looked away from her unhappy frown youre older now than your brother was then variable onset remember well go soon i promise tien i wish youd give up this galactic treatment plan they have medical facilities here on komarr that are almost as good as as beta colony or anywhere i thought when you won this post here that you would forget the secrecy just go openly for help or go discreetly if you insist but dont wait any longer theyre not discreet enough my career is finally on course finally paying off i have no desire to be publicly branded a mutant now if i dont care what does it matter what anyone else thinks she hesitated is that why you dont want to see uncle vorthys tien hes the least likely of my relatives or yours for that matter to care if your disease is genetic or not he will care about you and about nikolai i have it under control he insisted dont you dare betray me to your uncle this close to the real payoff i have it under control youll see just dont take your brothers way out promise me the lightflyer accident that hadnt been quite an accident that had ushered in these years of chronic subclinical nightmare waiting and watching i have no intention of doing anything like that its all planned ill finish out this years appointment then well take a long overdue galactic vacation you and me and nikolai and it will all be fixed and no one will ever know if you dont lose your head and panic at the last minute he grasped her hand and grimaced an unfelt smile and strode out the doors wait and ill fix it trust me thats what you said the last time and the time before that and the time before that who is betrayed tien youre running out of time cant you see it she turned for her kitchen mentally revising her planned family dinner to include a vor lord from the imperial capital white wine her limited experience of the breed suggested that if you could get them sufficiently sloshed it wouldnt matter what you fed them she put another of her precious importedfromhome bottles in to chill no make that two more bottles she added another place to the table on the balcony off the kitchen that they routinely used for a dining room sorry now shed not engaged a servitor for the evening but human servants on komarr were so expensive and shed wanted this bubble of domestic privacy with uncle vorthys even the staid official newsvid reps were badgering everyone involved in the investigation the arrival of not one but two imperial auditors onsite in komarr orbit had not calmed the fever of speculation but only redirected it when shed first spoken with him shortly after his arrival onsite on a distancedelayed channel that defeated any attempt at long conversation normallypatient uncle vorthyss description of the public briefings into which hed been roped had been notably irritated hed hinted he would be glad to escape them since his years of teaching must have inured him to stupid questions ekaterin wondered if the true source of his irritation was that he couldnt answer them but mostly she had to admit she just wanted to recapture the flavor of a happier past greedily for herself shed lived with aunt and uncle vorthys for two years after her mother had died attending the imperial university under their casual supervision life with the professor and the professora had somehow been less constrained and constraining than in her fathers conservative vor household in the south continent frontier town of her birth perhaps because theyd treated her as the adult she aspired to be rather than the child she had been shed felt a bit guiltily closer to them than to her real parent for a while any future had seemed possible then shed chosen etienne vorsoisson or he had chosen her you were pleased enough at the time shed said yes to the marriage arrangements her fathers baba had offered with all good will you didnt know tien didnt know vorzohns dystrophy nobodys fault nineyearold nikolai bounded into the kitchen im hungry mama can i have a piece of that cake she intercepted fastmoving fingers attempting to sample frosting you can have a glass of fruit juice aw but he accepted the proffered substitute cannily offered in one of the good wineglasses lined up waiting he gulped it down bobbing about as he drank excited or was he picking up parental nerves stop projecting she told herself the boy had spent the last two hours in his room tinkering intently with his models he was due to shake out the knots do you remember uncle vorthys she asked him its been three years since we visited him sure he finished swallowing his snack he took me to his laboratory i thought it would be beakers and bubbly things but it was all big machines and concrete smelled funny kind of dusty and sharp from the welders and the ozone thats right she said impressed with his recall she rescued the glass hold out your hand i want to see how much you have left to grow puppies with big paws are supposed to grow up to be big dogs you know he held up his hand to hers and they met palm to palm his fingers were within two centimeters of being as long as her own oh my he flashed her a selfconscious satisfied grin and stared briefly down at his feet wriggling them in speculation his right big toe poked through a new hole in his new sock his childlight hair was darkening it might yet become as brown as hers he was chesthigh to her though she could have sworn he had been only hiphigh about fifteen minutes ago his eyes were brown like his das his grubby handwhere did he find so much dirt in this dome was as steady as his eyes were clear and guileless no tremula the early symptoms of vorzohns dystrophy were deceptive mimicking half a dozen other diseases and could strike any time from puberty to middle age but not today not nikolai not yet sounds from the apartments entryway and lowpitched masculine voices drew them out of her kitchen nikolai shot ahead of her when she arrived behind him he was already being half picked up by the stout whitehaired man who seemed to fill the space oof he stopped short of swinging nikolai around youve grown nikki uncle vorthys hadnt changed despite his aweinspiring new title same grand nose and big ears same rumpled oversized tunic and trousers that always looked sleptin same deep laugh he deposited his greatnephew on the flagstones spared a hug for his niece which was firmly returned and bent and felt in his valise something here for you nikki i do believe nikolai bounced around him ekaterin retreated temporarily to wait her turn tien was shouldering through the door with baggage only then did she notice the man standing apart smiling distantly watching this homey scene she swallowed startlement he was barely taller than nineyearold nikolai but unmistakably not a child he had a large head set on a short neck and a faintly hunched stance the rest of him looked lean but solid he wore tunic and trousers in a subtle gray the tunic open on a fine white shirt and polished halfboots his clothing was entirely without the pseudomilitary ornamentation usually affected by the high vor but the perfection of the fit it had to be handtailored to fit that odd body hinted a price ekaterin didnt dare to estimate she was uncertain of his age not much older than herself perhaps there was no gray in the dark hair but laughlines around his eyes and painlines around his mouth scored his winterpale skin he moved stiffly setting down his valise wheeling to watch nikolai monopolize his greatuncle but did not otherwise appear very crippled he was not a figure who blended in but his air was notably unobtrusive socially uncomfortable ekaterin was recalled abruptly to her duties as a daughter of the vor she advanced to him welcome to my household ack tien hadnt mentioned his name my lord auditor he held out his hand and captured hers in a perfectly ordinary businesslike grasp miles vorkosigan his hand was dry and warm smaller than her own but bluntly masculine clean nails and you madame oh ekaterin vorsoisson he released her hand without kissing it to her relief she stared briefly at the top of his head level with her collarbone realized he would be speaking to her cleavage and stepped back a little he looked up at her still smiling slightly nikolai was already dragging uncle vorthyss larger bag toward the guest room proudly showing off his strength tien properly followed his senior guest ekaterin made a rapid recalculation she couldnt possibly put this vorkosigan fellow up in nikolais room the childs bed would be such an embarrassingly good fit invite an imperial auditor to sleep on her living room couch hardly she gestured him to follow her down the opposite hallway into her plantingroomcumoffice one whole side was given over to a workbench and shelving crammed with supplies cascading lighting arrays climbing the corners nourished tender new plantings in a riotous variety of earth greens and barrayaran redbrowns a large open area on the floor fronted a fine wide window we havent much space she apologized im afraid even barrayaran administrators here must accept whats assigned to them ill order in a gravbed for you im sure theyll have it delivered before dinners over but at least the rooms private my uncle snores so magnificently the baths just down the hall to the right its fine he assured her he stepped to the window and stared out over the domed park the lights in the encircling buildings gleamed warmly in the luminous twilight of the halfeclipsed mirror i know its not what youre used to one corner of his mouth twitched up i once slept for six weeks on bare dirt with ten thousand extremely grubby marilacans many of whom snored i assure you its just fine she smiled in return not at all certain what to make of this joke if it was a joke she left him to arrange his things as he saw fit and scurried to call the rental company and finish setting up dinner they all rendezvoused despite her best intentions for a more formal service in her kitchen where the little auditor foiled her expectations again by only allowing her to pour him half a glass of wine i started today with seven hours in a pressure suit id be asleep with my face in my plate before dessert his gray eyes glinted she herded them all out to the table on the balcony and presented the mildly spicy stew based oh vatprotein that shed correctly guessed her uncle would like by the time she handed round the bread and wine shed at last caught up enough to finally have a word with her uncle herself whats happening now with your investigation how long can you stay not much more than what youve heard on the news im afraid he replied we can only take this downside break while the probablecause crews finish collecting the pieces were still missing some fairly important ones the freighters tow was fully loaded and had a tremendous mass when the engines blew bits of all sizes vectored off in every possible direction and speed we desperately want any parts of its control systems we can find they should have most of it retrieved in three more days if were lucky so was it deliberate sabotage tien asked uncle vorthys shrugged with the pilot dead its going to be very hard to prove it might have been a suicide mission the crews have found no sign yet of military or chemical explosives explosives would have been redundant murmured vorkosigan the spinning freighter hit the mirror array at the worst possible angle edgeon uncle vorthys continued half the damage was done by parts of the mirror itself with that much momentum imparted to it by the assorted collisions it just ripped itself apart if all that result was planned it had to have been a truly amazing calculation vorkosigan said dryly its the one thing which inclines me to the belief it might have been a true accident ekaterin watched her husband watching the little auditor covertly and read the silent disturbed judgment mutant in his eyes what was tien going to make of the man who openly bore without apparent apology or even selfconsciousness such stigmata of abnormality tien turned to vorkosigan his gaze curious i can see why emperor gregor dispatched the professor the empires foremost authority on failure analysis and all that whats um your part in this lord auditor vorkosigan vorkosigans smile twisted i have some experience with space installations he leaned back and jerked up his chin and smoothed the odd flash of irony from his face in fact as far as the probablecause investigation goes im merely along for the ride this is the first really interesting problem to come along since i took oath as an auditor three months ago i wanted to watch how it was done with his komarran marriage coming up gregor is vitally interested in any possible political repercussions from this accident now would be a very awkward time for a serious downturn in barrayarkomarr relations but whether accident or sabotage the damage to the mirror impinges quite directly on the terraforming project i understand your serifosa sector is fairly representative indeed ill take you both on a tour tomorrow tien promised im having a full technical report prepared for you by my komarran assistants with all the numbers but the most important number is still pure speculation how fast is the mirror going to be repaired vorkosigan grimaced and held out a small hand palmup how fast depends in part on how much money the imperium is willing to spend and thats where things become very political indeed with parts of barrayar itself still undergoing active terraforming and with the planet of sergyar drawing off immigrants from both the worlds damned near as fast as they can board ship some members of the government are wondering openly why we are spending so much imperial treasure dinking with such a marginal world as komarr ekaterin could not tell from his measured tone whether he agreed with those members or not startled she said the terraforming of komarr was going on for three centuries before we conquered it we can hardly stop now so are we throwing good money after bad vorkosigan shrugged declining to answer his own question theres a second layer of thinking a purely military one restricting the population to the domes makes komarr more militarily vulnerable why give the citizenry of a conquered world extra territory in which to fall back and regroup this line of thought makes the interesting assumption that three hundred or so years from now when the terraforming is at last complete the populations of komarr and barrayar will still not have assimilated each other if they did then they would be our domes and we certainly wouldnt want them to be vulnerable eh he paused for a bite of bread and stew washed down by wine then went on since assimilation is gregors avowed policy and hes putting his imperial person where his policy is the question of motivation for sabotage becomes er complex could the saboteurs have been isolationist barrayarans komarran extremists either hoping to publicly throw the blame on the other how emotionally attached is the average komarraninthedome to a goal whom none now living will ever survive to see realized or would they rather save the money today sabotage versus accident makes no engineering difference but does make a profound political one he and uncle vorthys exchanged a wry look so i watch and listen and wait vorkosigan concluded he turned to tien and how do you like komarr administrator vorsoisson tien grinned and shrugged its all right except for the komarrans ive found them a damned touchy bunch vorkosigans brows twitched up have they no sense of humor ekaterin glanced up warily wincing at that dry edge in his drawling voice but apparently it slipped past tien who only snorted theyre divided about equally between the greedy and the surly cheating barrayarans is considered a patriotic duty vorkosigan raised his empty wineglass to ekaterin and you madame vorsoisson she refilled it to the top before he could stop her cautious of her reply if her uncle was the technical expert in this auditorial duo did that leave vorkosigan as the political one who was really the senior member of the team had tien caught any of the subtle flashing implications in the little lords speech it hasnt been easy to make komarran friends nikolai goes to a barrayaran school and i have no work as such a vor lady hardly needs to work tien smiled nor a vor lord added vorkosigan almost under his breath yet here we are that depends on your ability to choose the right parents said tien a touch sourly he glanced across at vorkosigan relieve my curiosity are you related to the former lord regent my father vorkosigan replied with quelling brevity he did not smile then you are the lord vorkosigan the counts heir that follows yes vorkosigan was getting unnervingly dry now ekaterin blurted your upbringing must have been terribly difficult he managed vorkosigan murmured i meant for you ah his brief smile returned and flicked out again the conversation was going dreadfully awry ekaterin could feel it she hardly dared open her mouth on an attempt to redirect it tien stepped in or stepped in it was your father the great admiral reconciled that you couldnt have a military career my grandfather the great general was more set on it i was a tenyears man myself the usual in administration very dull trust me you didnt miss much tien waved a kindly dismissive hand but not every vor has to be a soldier these days eh professor vorthys youre living proof i believe captain vorkosigan served um thirteen years was it miles in imperial security galactic operations did you find it dull vorkosigans smile upon the professor grew genuine for an instant of time not nearly dull enough he jerked up his chin evidently a habitual nervous tic for the first time ekaterin noticed the fine white scars on either side of his short neck ekaterin fled to the kitchen to serve the dessert and give the blighted conversation time to recover when she came out again things had eased or at least nikolai had stopped being so supernaturally good ie quiet and had struck up a negotiation with his greatuncle for afterdinner attention in the form of a round of his current favorite game this carried them through till the rental company arrived at the front door with the gravbed and the great engineer went off with the whole male mob to oversee its installation ekaterin turned gratefully to the soothing routine of cleaning up tien returned to report success and the vor lord suitably settled tien were you watching that fellow closely asked ekaterin a mutie a mutie vor yet he carried on as if nothing were the least out of the ordinary if he can she trailed off hopefully leaving the surely you can for tien to conclude tien frowned dont start that again its obvious he doesnt think the rules apply to him hes aral vorkosigans son for gods sake practically the emperors foster brother no wonder he got this cushy imperial appointment i dont think so tien were you listening to him at all all those undercurrents i think i think hes the emperors hatchet man sent to judge the whole terraforming project powerful maybe dangerous tien shook his head his father was powerful and dangerous hes just privileged damned high vor twit dont worry about him your uncle will take him away soon enough im not worried about him tiens face darkened im getting so tired of this you argue with everything i say you practically insult my intelligence in front of your sonoble relative i didnt did i she began a confused mental review of her evenings remarks what in the world had she said to set him on edge like this just because youre the great auditors niece doesnt make you anybody girl this is disloyalty thats what it is nono im sorry but he was already stalking out there would be a cold silence between them tonight she almost ran after him to beg his forgiveness he was under a lot of pressure at work it was very illtimed of her to push for a resolution to his medical dilemma now but she was abruptly too weary to try anymore she finished putting away the last of the food and took the leftover half bottle of wine and a glass out onto the balcony she turned off the cheery colored plant lights and just sat in the dim reflected illumination from the sealed komarran city the crippled starflake of the insolation mirror had almost reached the western horizon following the truesun into night as the planet turned a white shape moved silently in the kitchen briefly startling her but it was only the mutie lord who had shed his elegant gray tunic and apparently his boots he stuck his head through the unsealed doors hello hello lord vorkosigan im just out here watching the mirror set would you um care for some more wine here ill get you a glass no dont get up madame vorsoisson ill fetch it his pale smile winked out of the shadows at her a few muted clinks came from within then he trod silently onto the balcony she poured good hostess generously into the glass he set beside her own then he took it up again and went to the railing to study what could be seen of the sky past the girders of the dome its the best aspect of this location she said this bit of western view the mirrorarray was magnified by the atmosphere close to the horizon but its normal evening coloreffects in the wispy clouds were dimmed by its damage mirrorsets usually much prettier than this she sipped her wine cool and sweet on her tongue and felt herself finally starting to become a little furry in the brain furry was good soothing i can see that it must be he agreed still staring out he drank deeply had he switched then from resisting sleep through alcohol to pursuing it this horizon is so crowded and cluttered compared to home im afraid i find these sealed arcologies a touch claustrophobic and where is home for you he turned to watch her south continent vandeville so you grew up around terraforming the komarrans would say that wasnt terraforming that was just soil conditioning he chuckled along with her at her deadpan rendition of komarran technosnobbery she continued theyre right of course it wasnt as though we had to start by spending half a millennium altering an entire planets atmosphere the only thing that made it hard for us back in the time of isolation was trying to do it with practically no technology still i loved the open spaces at home i miss that wide sky horizon to horizon thats true in any city domed or not so youre a country girl in part though i liked vorbarr sultana when i was at university it had other kinds of horizons did you study botany i noticed the library rack on the wall of your plant room impressive no its just a hobby oh i could have mistaken it for a passion or a profession no i didnt know what i wanted then do you know now she laughed a little uneasily when she didnt answer he merely smiled and strolled along the balcony examining her plantings he stopped before the skellytum squatting in its pot like some bright red alien buddha tendrils raised in a pose of placid supplication i have to ask he said plaintively what is this thing its a bonsaid skellytum really thats a i didnt know you could do that to a skellytum theyre usually five meters tall and a really ugly brown i had a great aunt on my fathers side who loved gardening i used to help her when i was a girl she was very much a crusty old frontier woman very vorshed come to the south continent right after the cetagandan war survived a succession of husbands survived well everything i inherited the skellytum from her its the only plant i brought to komarr from barrayar its over seventy years old good god its the complete tree fully functional and ha short she was afraid for a moment that shed inadvertently offended him but apparently not he finished his inspection and returned to the railing and his wine he stared out again at the western horizon and the sinking mirror his brows lowering he had a presence which by ignoring his elusive physical peculiarities himself defied the observer to dare comment but the little lord had had all his life to adjust to his condition not like the hideous surprise tien had found among his late brothers papers and subsequently confirmed for himself and nikolai through carefully secret testing you can get tested anonymously she had argued but i cant get treated anonymously he had countered since coming to komarr shed been so close to defying custom law and her lordandhusbands orders and unilaterally taking his son and heir for treatment would the komarran doctors know a vor mother was not her sons legal guardian maybe she could pretend the genetic defect had come from her not from tien but the geneticists if they were any good would surely figure out the truth after a while she said elliptically a vor mans first loyalty is supposed to be to his emperor but a vor womans first loyalty is supposed to be to her husband historically and legally thats so his voice was amused or bemused as he turned again to watch her this was not always to her disadvantage when he was executed for treason she was presumed to be only following orders and got off actually i wonder if the underlying practical reason was that an underpopulated world just couldnt spare her labor havent you ever found that oddly asymmetrical but simpler for her most women usually only had one husband at a time but the vor were all too frequently presented with a choice of emperors and where was your loyalty then bad guesses could be lethal though when my grandfather general piotrand his armyabandoned mad emperor yuri for emperor ezar it was lethal for yuri good for barrayar though she sipped again from where she sat he was silhouetted against the darkening dome shadowed enigmatic indeed is your passion politics then god no i dont think so history only in passing he hesitated it used to be the military used to be used to be he repeated firmly and now it was his turn to not answer he stared down at his glass tilting it to make the last of the wine swirl about he finally said in barrayaran political theory it all connects the ordinary subjects are loyal to their counts the counts are loyal to the emperor and the emperor presumably is loyal to the whole imperium the body of the empire in the form of all its er bodies here i find it grows a trifle abstract for my taste how can he be answerable to all yet not answerable to each and so we arrive back at square one he drained his glass how do we be true to one another i dont know anymore silence fell as they both watched the last glint of mirror slip behind the hills a pale glow in the sky still haloed its passing for a minute or two longer well im afraid im getting rather drunk he did not seem that drunk to her but he rolled his glass between his hands and pushed off from the balcony rail against which hed been leaning goodnight madame vorsoisson goodnight lord vorkosigan sleep well he carried his glass in with him and vanished into the darkened apartment chapter two miles floundered from a dream of his hostesss hair which if not exactly erotic was embarrassingly sensual unbound from the severe style shed favored yesterday it had revealed itself a rich dark brown with amber highlights a mass of silk flowing coolly through his stubby handshe presumed they were his hands it had been his dream after all i woke up too soon rats at least the vision had not been tinged with any of the gory grotesqueries of his occasional nightmares from which he came awake cold and damp with heart racing he was warm and comfortable in the silly elaborate gravbed she had insisted on producing for him it wasnt madame vorsoissons fault that she happened to belong to a certain physical type that set off old resonances in miless memory some men harbored obsessions about much stranger things his own fixation he had long ago ruefully recognized was on long cool brunettes with expressions of quiet reserve and warm alto voices true on a world where people altered their faces and bodies almost as casually as they altered their wardrobes there was nothing in the least unusual about her beauty till one remembered she wasnt from here and realized her ivoryskinned features were almost certainly untouched by modification had she recognized his idiotbabble last night on her balcony as suppressed sexual panic had that odd remark about a vor womans duties been an oblique warning to him to back off but he hadnt been on he didnt think was he that transparent miles had realized within five minutes of his arrival that he should probably not have let the genial and expansive vorthys bully him into accompanying him downside but the man seemed constitutionally incapable of not sharing a treat that the pleasures of this family reunion might not be equally enjoyed by an awkward outsideror the family into which hed been thrusthad clearly never occurred to the professor miles sighed envy of his host administrator vorsoisson seemed to have achieved a perfect little vor clan of course hed had the wit to start a decade ago the arrival of galactic sexselection technologies had resulted in a shortage of female births on barrayar this dearth of women had reached its lowest ebb in miless generation though parents seemed to be coming back to their senses now still every vor woman miles knew close to his own age was already married and had been for years was he going to have to wait another twenty years for his own bride if necessary no lusting after married women boy youre an imperial auditor now the nine imperial auditors were expected to be models of rectitude and respectability he could not recall ever hearing of any kind of sex scandal touching one of emperor gregors handpicked agentobservers of course not all the rest of the auditors are eighty years old and have been married for fifty of em he snorted besides she probably thought he was a mutant though thankfully shed been too polite to say so to his face so find out if she has a sister eh he wallowed out of the gravbeds indolenceinducing clutches and sat up forcing his mind to switch gears at a conservative guess a couple hundred thousand words of new data on the soletta accident and its consequences would be incoming this shift he would he decided start with a cold shower no comfortable shipknits today after selecting among the three new formal civilian suits hed packed along from barrayarin shades of gray gray and graymiles combed his damp hair neatly and sauntered out to madame vorsoissons kitchen from which voices and the perfume of coffee wafted there he found nikolai munching barrayaranstyle groats and milk administrator vorsoisson fully dressed and apparently on the verge of leaving and professor vorthys still in pajamas sorting through a new array of data disks and frowning a glass of pink fruit juice sat untasted at his elbow he looked up and said ah good morning miles glad youre up seconded by vorsoissons polite good morning lord vorkosigan i trust you slept well fine thanks whats up professor your comm link arrived from impsecs local office vorthys pointed to the device beside his plate i notice they didnt send me one miles grimaced your father was not so famous in the komarran conquest true agreed vorthys the old gentleman fell in that odd generation between the wars too young to fight the cetagandans too old to aggress on the poor komarrans this lack of military opportunity was a source of great personal regret to him we children were given to understand miles strapped the comm link onto his left wrist it represented a compromise between himself and impsec serifosa which would otherwise be responsible for his health here impsec had wanted to err on the side of caution and surround him with an inconvenient mob of bodyguards miles had ventured to test his imperial auditors authority by ordering them to stay out of his hair to his delight it had worked but the link gave him a straight line to impsec and tracked his locationhe tried not to feel like an experimental animal released into the wild and what are those he nodded to the data disks vorthys spread the disks like a bad hand of cards the morning courier also brought us recordings of last nights haul of new bits and something especially for you since you kindly volunteered to take over the review of the medical end of things a new preliminary autopsy they finally found the pilot miles relieved him of the disks vorthys grimaced parts of her madame vorsoisson entered from the balcony in time to hear this oh dear she was dressed as yesterday in komarranstyle street wear in dull earthy tones loose trousers blouse and long vest muffling whatever figure she possessed she would have been brilliant in red or breathtaking in pale blue with those blue eyes her hair this morning was soberly tied back again rather to miless relief it would have been unnerving to think he was developing some form of precognition as a result of his late injuries along with his damned seizures miles nodded good morning to her and carefully returned his attention to vorthys i must have been sleeping well i didnt hear the courier come in youve reviewed them already just a glance what parts of the pilot did they find asked nikolai interested never you mind young man said his greatuncle firmly thank you murmured madame vorsoisson to him that makes the last body though good said miles its so distressing for the relatives when they lose one altogether when i was he cut off the rest when i was a covert ops fleet commander wed move the heavens to try and get the bodies of our casualties back to their people that chapter of his life was closed now madame vorsoisson splendid woman handed him black coffee she then inquired what her guests would like for breakfast miles maneuvered vorthys into answering first and volunteered for groats along with him as she bustled around serving and mopping up after nikolai administrator vorsoisson said my departments presentation will be ready for you this afternoon auditor vorthys this morning ekaterin wondered if you would like to see nikolais school and after the presentation perhaps there will be time for a flyover of some of our projects sounds like a fine itinerary professor vorthys smiled at nikolai in all the hustle of their hurried departure from barrayar heor perhaps the professorahad not forgotten a gift for his greatnephew i should have brought something for the kid miles decided belatedly surest way to please a mother ah miles miles tapped the stack of data disks beside his bowl i suspect ill have enough to occupy myself here this morning madame vorsoisson i noticed a comconsole in your workroom may i use it certainly lord vorkosigan with a polite murmur about getting things in order for them at his department vorsoisson took his leave and the breakfast party broke up shortly thereafter each to their assorted destinations miles new disks in hand returned to madame vorsoissons workroomguest room he paused before seating himself at her comconsole to stare out the sealed window at the park and the transparent dome arcing over it to let in the free solar energy komarrs wan sun was not directly visible risen to the east behind this apartment block but the line of its morning light crept across the far edge of the park the damaged insolation mirror following it had not yet risen over the horizon to double the shadows it cast so does this mean seven thousand years bad luck he sighed darkened the windows polarizationscarcely necessaryseated himself at the comconsole and began feeding it data disks a couple of dozen goodsized new pieces of wreckage had been retrieved overnight he ran the vids of them turning in space as the salvage ships approached theory was if you could find every fragment take precise recordings of all their spins and trajectories and then run them backward you could end up with a computergenerated picture of the very moment of the disaster and so diagnose its cause real life never worked out quite that neatly alas but every little bit helped impsec komarr was still canvassing the orbital transfer stations for any casual vidcarrying tourists who might have been panning that section of space at the time of the whateverandcollision futilely by now miles feared usually such people came forward immediately excited and wanting to be helpful vorthys and the probablecause crew were now of the opinion that the ore tow had already been in more than one piece at the moment it had struck the mirror a speculation which had not yet been released to the general public so had the evidencedestroying explosion of the engines been cause or consequence of that catastrophe and at what point had those tortured fragments of metal and plastic acquired some of their more interesting distortions miles reran for the twentieth time that week the computers track of the freighters course prior to the collision and contemplated its anomalies the ship had carried only its pilot on a routineindeed dead boringslow run in from the asteroid mining belt to an orbital refinery the engines had not been supposed to be thrusting at the time of the accident acceleration had been completed and deceleration was not yet due to begin the tow ship had been running about five hours ahead of schedule but only because it had departed early not because it had boosted hotter than usual it had been coasting offcourse by about six percent within normal parameters and not yet ready for course correction though the pilot might have been amusing herself trying to achieve more precision with some unscheduled microboosting even with the minor course correction due the tow ships route had been several hundred comfortable kilometers from the soletta array in fact farther away than if it had been precisely on course what the course variation had done was take the freighters track almost directly across one of komarrs unused wormhole jump points komarr local space was unusually rich in active jump points a fact of strategic and historic consequence one of the jumps was barrayars only gateway to the wormhole nexus it was for control of the jump points not for possession of the chilly planet that barrayars invasion fleet had poured through here thirtyfive years ago as long as the imperiums military held that high ground its interest in komarrs downside population and their problems was at best mild this jump point however supported neither traffic nor trade nor strategic threat explorations through it had deadended either in deep interstellar space or close to stars that did not support either habitable planets or economically recoverable system resources nobody jumped out through there nobody should have jumped in through there the immediate vision of some unmotivated piratevillain popping out of the wormhole potting the innocent ore freighterby some weapon that left no traces mind youand popping back in again was currently unsupported by any evidence whatsoever though the area had been scoured for it it was the news medias current favorite scenario but none of the fivespace trails generated by ships taking wormhole jumps had been detected either the fivespace anomaly of the jump point was not even observable by ordinary means from threespace it should not just sitting there have affected the freighter in any way even if the ship had passed directly across its central vortex the freighter was a dedicated innersystem ship and lacked necklin rods and jump capacity still the jump point was there nothing else was miles rubbed his neck and turned to the new autopsy report gruesome as always the pilot had been a komarran woman in her midfifties call it barrayaran sexism but female corpses always bothered miles more death was such a malicious destroyer of dignity had he looked that disordered and exposed when hed gone down to the snipers fire the pilots body showed the usual progression smashed decompressed irradiated and frozen all quite typical of deepspace impact accidents one arm torn off somewhere in the initial crunch rather than later judging from the closeup vids of the freezingeffects of liquids lost at the stump it had been a quick death anyway miles knew better than to add almost painless no traces of illicit drugs or alcohol had been found in her frozen tissues the komarran medical examiner along with his six final reports included a message wanting to know if he had miless permission to release the bodies of the six members of the mirrors stationkeeping crew back to their waiting families good god hadnt that been done yet as an imperial auditor he wasnt supposed to be running this investigation just observing and reporting on it he did not desire his mere presence to freeze anyones initiative he fired off the permission immediately right from madame vorsoissons comconsole he started working his way through the six reports they were more detailed than the prelims hed already seen but contained no surprises by this time he wanted a surprise something anything beyond spaceship blows up for no reason kills seven not to mention the astronomical property damage bill with three reports assimilated and his bland breakfast becoming a regret in his stomach he backed out for a short period of mental recovery idly while waiting for the queasiness to pass he sorted through madame vorsoissons data files the one titled virtual gardens sounded pleasant perhaps she wouldnt mind if he took a virtual stroll through them the water garden enticed him he called it up on the holovid plate before him it was as he had guessed a landscape design program one could view it from any distance or angle from a miniaturelooking total overview to a blownup detailed inspection of a particular planting one could program a stroll through its paths at any given eye level he chose his own at ahemmumblesomething under five feet the individual plants grew according to realistic programs taking into account light water gravitation trace nutrients and even attacks by programmed pests this garden was about a third filled with tentative arrangements of grasses violets sedges water lilies and horsetails it was currently suffering an outbreak of algae the colors and shapes stopped abruptly at the unfinished edges as if an invasion from some alien gray geometric universe were gobbling it all up his curiosity piqued in best approved impsec style he dropped to the programs underlayer and checked for activity levels the busiest recently he discovered was one labeled the barrayaran garden he popped back up to the display level selected his own eyeheight again and entered it it was not a garden of pretty earthplants set on some suitably famous site on barrayar it was a garden made up entirely and exclusively of native species something he would not have guessed possible let alone lovely hed always considered their uniform redbrown hues and stubby forms boring at best the only barrayaran vegetation he could identify and name offhand was that to which he was violently allergic but madame vorsoisson had somehow used shape and texture to create a sepiatoned serenity rocks and running water framed the various plantsthere was a low carmine mass of loveliesitching forming a border for a billowing blond stand of razorgrass which he had once been assured botanically was not a grass nobody argued about the razor part hed noticed judging from the common names the lost barrayaran colonists had not loved their new xenobotany damnweed henbloat goatbane its beautiful how did she make it beautiful hed never seen anything like it maybe that kind of artists eye was something you just had to be born with like perfect pitch which he also lacked in the imperial capital of vorbarr sultana there was a small and dull green park at the end of the block beside vorkosigan house on a site where another old mansion had been torn down the little park had been leveled with more of an eye to security concerns for the neighboring lord regent than any aesthetic plan would it not be splendid to replace it with a larger version of this glorious subtlety and give the citydwellers a taste of their own planetary heritage even if it wouldhe checked take fifteen years to grow to this mature climax the virtual garden program was supposed to help prevent timeconsuming and costly design mistakes but when all the garden you could have was what you could pack in your luggage he supposed it could be a hobby in its own right it was certainly neater tidier and easier than the real thing so why did he guess she found it approximately as satisfying as looking at a holovid of dinner instead of eating it or maybe shes just homesick regretfully he closed down the display in pure trained habit he next called up her financial program for a little quick analysis it turned out to be her household account she ran her home on a quite tight budget given what administrator vorsoissons salary ought to be miles thought her biweekly allowance was rather stingy she didnt spend nearly as much on her botanical hobbies as the results suggested she must other hobbies other vices the money trail was always the most revealing of peoples true pursuits impsec hired the imperiums best accountants to find ingenious ways to hide their own activities for that very reason she spent damn little on clothes except for nikolais hed heard parents of his acquaintance complain about the cost of dressing their children but surely this was extraordinary wait that wasnt a clothing expenditure funds squeezed here here and there were all being funneled into a dedicated little private account labeled nikolais medical why as dependents of a barrayaran bureaucrat on komarr werent the vorsoissons medical expenses covered by the imperium he called up the account a years worth of savings from her household budget did not make a very impressive pile but the pattern of contributions was steady to the point of being compulsive puzzled he backed out again and called up the whole program list clues one file down at the end of the list had no name he called it up immediately it turned out to be the only thing on her comconsole which required a password for entry interesting her comconsole program was the simplest and cheapest commercial type impsec cadets dissected files like this as a class warmup exercise a touch of homesickness of his own twinged through him he dropped to the underlayer and had its password choked out in about five minutes vorzohns dystrophy well that wasnt a mnemonic he would have guessed offhand his reflexes overtook his growing unease he had the file open simultaneously with belated second thoughts youre not in impsec anymore you know should you be doing this the file proved to contain a medical courses worth of articles culled from every imaginable barrayaran and galactic source on the topic of one of barrayars rarer and more obscure homegrown genetic disorders vorzohns dystrophy had arisen during the time of isolation principally as its name suggested among the vor caste but had not been medically identified as a mutation until the return of galactic medicine for one thing it lacked the sort of exterior markers that would have caused well him for example to have had his throat cut at birth it was an adultonset disease beginning with a bewildering variety of physical debilitations and ending with mental collapse and death in the harsher world of barrayars past carriers frequently met their deaths from other causes after bearing or engendering children but before the syndrome manifested itself enough madness ran in enough families including some of my dear vorrutyer ancestorsfrom other causes that late onset was frequently identified as something else anyway thoroughly nasty but its treatable now isnt it yes albeit expensively that went with the rare part no economies of scale miles scanned rapidly down the articles symptoms were manageable with a variety of costly biochemical concoctions to flush out and replace the distorted molecules retrogenetic true cures were available at a higher price well almost true cures any progeny would still have to be screened for it preferably at the time of fertilization and before being popped into the uterine replicator for gestation hadnt young nikolai been gestated in a uterine replicator good god vorsoisson surely hadnt insisted his wifeand childgo through the dangers of oldfashioned bodygestation had he only a few of the most conservative old vor families still held out for the old ways a custom upon which miless own mother had vented the most violently acerbic criticism hed ever heard from her lips and she should know so what the hell is going on here he sat back mouth tight if as the files suggested nikolai was known or suspected to carry vorzohns dystrophy one or both of his parents must also how long had they known he suddenly realized what he should have noticed before in the initial illusion of smug marital bliss which vorsoisson managed to project that was always the hardest part seeing the absent pieces about three more children were missing that was what some little sisters for nikolai please folks but no so theyve known at least since shortly after their son was born what a personal nightmare but is he the carrier or is she he hoped it wasnt madame vorsoisson horrible to think of that serene beauty crumbling under the onslaught of such internal disruption i dont want to know all this his idle curiosity was justly punished this idiot snooping was surely not proper behavior for an imperial auditor however much it had been inculcated in an impsec covert ops agent former agent where was all that shiny new auditors probity now he might as well have been sniffing in her underwear drawer i cant leave you alone for a damn minute can i boy hed chafed for years under military regulations till hed come to a job with no written regs at all his sense of having died and gone to heaven had lasted about five minutes an imperial auditor was the emperors voice his eyes and ears and sometimes hands a lovely job description till you stopped to wonder just what the hell that poetic metaphor was supposed to mean so was it a useful test to ask himself can i imagine gregor doing this or that thing gregors apparent imperial sternness hid an almost painful personal shyness the mind boggled all right should the question instead be could i imagine gregor in his office as emperor doing this just what acts wrong for a private individual were yet lawful for an imperial auditor carrying out his duties lots according to the precedents hed been reading so was the real rule ad lib till you make a mistake and then well destroy you miles wasnt sure he liked that one at all and even in his impsec days slicing through someones private files had been a treatment reserved for enemies or at least suspects well and prospective recruits and neutrals in whose territory you expected to be operating and and he snorted selfderision gregor at least had better manners than impsec thoroughly embarrassed he closed the files erased all tracks of his entry and called up the next autopsy report he studied what telltales he could glean from the bodily fragmentation death had a temperature and it was damned cold he paused to turn up the workrooms thermostat a few degrees before continuing chapter three ekaterin hadnt realized how much a visit from an imperial auditor would fluster the staff of nikolais school but the professor a longtime educator himself quickly made them understand this wasnt an official inspection and produced all the right phrases to put them at their ease still she and uncle vorthys didnt linger as long as tien had suggested to her to burn a bit more time she took him on a short tour of serifosa domes best spots the prettiest gardens the highest observation platforms looking out across the sere komarran landscape beyond the sealed urban sprawl serifosa was the capital of this planetary sectorshe still had to make an effort not to think of it as a barrayaranstyle district barrayaran district boundaries were more organic higglypiggly territories following rivers mountain ranges and ragged lines where counts armies had lost historic battles komarran sectors were neat geometric slices equitably dividing the globe though the socalled domes really thousands of interconnected structures of all shapes had lost their early geometries centuries ago as they were built outward in random and unmatching spurts of architectural improvement somewhat belatedly she realized she ought to be dragging the engineer emeritus through the deepest utility tunnels and the power and atmosphere cycling plants but by then it was time for lunch her guided tour fetched up near her favorite restaurant pseudooutdoors with tables spilling out into a landscaped park under the glassedin sky the damaged solettaarray was now visible creeping along the ecliptic veiled today by thin high clouds as if ashamedly hiding its deformations the enormous power of the emperors voice conferred upon an auditor hadnt changed her uncle much ekaterin was pleased to note he still retained his enthusiasm for splendid desserts and under her guidance constructed his menu choices from the sweets course backwards she couldnt quite say hadnt changed him at all he seemed to have acquired more social caution pausing for more than just technical calculations before he spoke but it wasnt as if he could entirely ignore other peoples new and exaggerated reactions to him they put in their orders and she followed her uncles gaze upward as he briefly studied the soletta from this angle she said theres not really a danger of the imperium abandoning the soletta project is there well have to at least repair it i mean it looks so unbalanced like that in fact it is unbalanced at present solar wind theyll have to do something about that shortly he replied i should certainly not like to see it abandoned it was the greatest engineering achievement of the komarrans colonial ancestors apart from the domes themselves people at their best if it was sabotage well that was certainly people at their worst vandalism just senseless vandalism an artist describing the defacement of some great historic painting could hardly have been more vehement ekaterin said ive heard older komarrans talk about how they felt when admiral vorkosigans invasion forces took over the mirror practically the first thing i cant think that it had much tactical value at the high speed at which the space battles went but it certainly had a huge psychological impact it was almost as if we had captured their sun itself i think returning it to komarran civilian control in the last few years was a very good political move i hope this doesnt mess that up its hard to say that new caution again there was talk of opening its observation platform to tourism again though now i imagine theyre relieved they hadnt yet they still have plenty of vip tours i took one myself when i was here several years ago teaching a short course at solstice university fortunately there were no visitors aboard on the day of the collision but it should be open to the public to be seen and to educate do it up right with maybe a museum onsite explaining how it was first built its a great work odd to think that its principal practical use is to make swamps swamps make breathable air eventually she smiled in her uncles mind the pure engineering aesthetic clearly overshadowed the messy biological end view next youll be defending the rats there really are rats here i understand oh yes the dome tunnels have rats and hamsters and gerbils all the children capture them for pets which is likely where they came from in the first place come to think of it i do think the blackandwhite rats are cute the animalcontrol exterminators have to work in dead secret from their younger relatives and we have roaches of course who doesnt andover in equinoxwild cockatoos a couple of pairs of them escaped or were let loose several decades ago they now have these big rainbowcolored birds all over the place and people will feed them the sanitation crews wanted to get rid of them but the dome shareholders voted them down the waitress delivered their salads and iced tea and there was a short break in the conversation while her uncle appreciated the fresh spinach mangoes and onions and candied pecans shed guessed the candied pecans would please him the marketgarden hydroponics production in serifosa was among komarrs best she used the break to redirect the conversation toward her greatest current curiosity your colleague lord vorkosigan did he really have a thirteenyear career in imperial security or were you just irritated by tien three years in the imperial military academy a decade in impsec to be precise how did he ever get in past the physicals nepotism i believe of a sort to give him credit it seems to have been an advantage he used sparingly thereafter i had the fascinating experience of reading his entire classified military record when gregor asked me and my fellow auditors to review vorkosigans candidacy before he made the appointment she subsided in slight disappointment classified in that case i suppose you cant tell me anything about it well he grinned around a mouthful of salad there was the dagoola iv episode you must have heard of it that giant breakout from the cetagandan prisonerofwar camp that the marilacans made a few years ago she recalled it only dimly shed been headsdown in motherhood about that time and scarcely paid attention to news especially any so remote as galactic news but she nodded encouragement for him to go on its all old history now i understand from vorkosigan that the marilacans are engaged in producing a holovid drama on the subject the greatest escape or something like that theyre calling it they tried to hire himor actually his cover identityto be a technical consultant on the script an opportunity he has regretfully declined but for impsec to retain security classification upon a series of events that the marilacans are simultaneously dramatizing planetwide strikes me as a bit rigid even for impsec in any case vorkosigan was the barrayaran agent behind that breakout i didnt even know we had an agent behind that he was our man onsite so that odd joke about snoring marilacans hadnt been quite if he was so good why did he quit hm her uncle applied himself to mopping up the last of his salad dressing with his multigrain roll before replying i can only give you an edited version of that he didnt quit voluntarily he was very badly injuredto the point of requiring cryofreezinga couple of years ago both the original injury and the cryofreeze did him a lot of damage some of it permanent he was forced to take a medical discharge which hehmdid not handle well its not my place to discuss those details if he was injured badly enough to need cryofreeze he was dead she said startled technically i suppose so alive and dead are not such neat categories as they used to be in the time of isolation so her uncle was in possession of just the sort of medical information about vorkosigans mutations she most wanted to know if he had paid any attention to it military physicals were thorough so rather than let all that training and experience go to waste uncle vorthys went on gregor found a job for vorkosigan on the civilian side most auditorial duties are not too physically onerous though i confess its been useful to have someone younger and thinner than myself to send outstation for those long inspections in a pressure suit im afraid ive abused his endurance a bit but hes proved very observant so he really is your assistant by no means what fool said that all auditors are coequal seniority is only good for getting one stuck with certain administrative chores on the rare occasions when we act as a group vorkosigan being a wellbroughtup young man is polite to my white hairs but hes an independent auditor in his own right and goes just where he pleases at present it pleases him to study my methods i shall certainly take the opportunity to study his our imperial charge doesnt come with a manual you see it was once proposed the auditors create one for themselves but theywisely i thinkconcluded it would do more harm than good instead we just have our archives of imperial reports precedents without rules lately several of us more recent appointees have been trying to read a few old reports each week and then meet for dinner to discuss the cases and analyze how they were handled fascinating and delicious vorkosigan has the most extraordinary cook but this is his first assignment isnt it and he was designated just like that on the emperors whim he had a temporary appointment as a ninth auditor first a very difficult assignment inside impsec itself not my kind of thing at all she was not totally oblivious to the news oh dear did he have anything to do with why impsec changed chiefs twice last winter i so much prefer engineering investigations her uncle observed mildly their vatchicken salad sandwiches arrived while ekaterin absorbed this deflection what kind of reassurance was she seeking after all vorkosigan disturbed her she had to admit with his cool smile and warm eyes and she couldnt say why he did tend to the sardonic surely she was not subconsciously prejudiced against mutants when nikolai himself in the time of isolation if such a one as vorkosigan had been born to me it would have been my maternal duty to the genome to cut his infant throat nikki happily would have escaped my cleansing for a while the time of isolation is over forever thank god i gather you like vorkosigan she began once again to angle for the kind of information she sought so does your aunt the professora and i had him to dinner a few times last winter which is where vorkosigan came up with the notion of the discussion meetings come to think of it i know hes rather quiet at firstcautious i thinkbut he can be very witty once you get him going does he amuse you amusing had certainly not been her first impression he swallowed another bite of sandwich and glanced up again at the white irregular blur in the clouds now marking the position of the soletta i taught engineering for thirty years it had its drudgeries but each year i had the pleasure of finding in my classes a few of the best and brightest who made it all worthwhile he sipped spiced tea and spoke more slowly but much less oftenevery five or ten years at mosta true genius would turn up among my students and the pleasure became a privilege to be treasured for life you think hes a genius she said raising her eyebrows the high vor twit i dont know him quite well enough yet but i suspect so a part of the time can you be a genius part of the time all the geniuses i ever met were so just part of the time to qualify you only have to be great once you know once when it matters ah dessert my this is splendid he applied himself happily to a large chocolate confection with whipped cream and more pecans she wanted personal data but she kept getting career synopses she would have to take a more embarrassingly direct path while arranging her first spoonful of her spiced apple tart and ice cream she finally worked up her nerve to ask is he married no that surprises me or did it hes high vor heavens the highesthell be a district count someday wont he hes wealthy or so i would assume he has an important position she trailed off what did she want to say whats wrong with him that he hasnt acquired his own lady by now what kind of genetic damage made him like that and was it from his mother or his father is he impotent is he sterile what does he really look like under those expensive clothes is he hiding more serious deformities is he homosexual would it be safe to leave nikolai alone with him she couldnt say any of that and her oblique hints werent eliciting anything even close to the answers she sought drat it she wouldnt have had this kind of trouble getting the pertinent information if shed been talking to the professora hes been out of the empire most of the past decade he said as if that explained something does he have siblings normal brothers or sisters no thats a bad sign oh i take that back uncle vorthys added not in the usual sense i should say he has a clone doesnt look like him though thatif hes ai dont understand youll have to get vorkosigan to explain it to you if youre curious its complicated even by his standards i havent met the fellow myself yet around a mouthful of chocolate and cream he added speaking of siblings were you planning any more for nikolai your family is going to be very stretched out if you wait much longer she smiled in panic dare she tell him tiens accusation of betrayal seared her memory but she was so tired exhausted sick to death of the stupid secrecy if only her aunt were here she was dully conscious of her contraceptive implant the one bit of galactic technoculture tien had embraced without question it gave her a galactics sterility without a galactics freedom modern women gladly traded the deadly lottery of fertility for the certainties of health and result that came with the use of the uterine replicator but tiens obsession with concealment had barred her from that reward too even if he was somatically cured his germcells would not be and any progeny would still have to be genetically screened did he mean to cut off all future children when shed tried to discuss the issue hed put her off with an airy first things first when shed persisted hed become angry accusing her of nagging and selfishness that was always effective at shutting her up she skittered sideways to her uncles question weve moved around so much i kept waiting for things to get settled with tiens career he does seem to have been rather ah restless he raised his eyebrows at her inviting what i wont pretend that hasnt been difficult that was true enough thirteen different jobs in a decade was this normal for a rising bureaucrat tien said it was a necessity no bosses ever promoted from within or raised a former subordinate above them you had to go around to move up weve moved eight times ive abandoned six gardens so far the last two relocations i just didnt plant anything except in pots and then i had to leave most of the pots when we came here maybe tien would stay with this komarran post how could he ever garner the rewards of promotion and seniority the status he hungered for if he never stuck with one thing long enough to earn any his first few postings shed had to agree with him had been mediocre shed had no problem understanding why he wanted to move on quickly a young couples early life was supposed to be unsettled as they stretched into their new lives as adults well as shed stretched into hers shed been only twenty after all tien had been thirty when theyd married hed started every new job with a burst of enthusiasm working hard or at least very long hours surely no one could work harder then the enthusiasm dwindled and the complaints began of too much work too little reward offered too slowly lazy coworkers smarmy bosses at least so he said that had become her secret danger signal when tien began offering sly sexual slander of his superiors it meant the job was about to end again a new one would be found though it seemed to take longer and longer to find a new one these days and his enthusiasm would flame up again and the cycle would begin anew but her hypersensitized ear had picked up no bad signs so far in this job and theyd been here nearly a year already maybe tien had finally found his what had vorkosigan called it his passion this was the best posting hed ever achieved perhaps things were finally starting to break into good fortune for a change if she just stuck it out long enough it would get better virtue would be rewarded and with this vorzohns dystrophy thing hanging over them tien had good reason for impatience his time was not unlimited and yours is she blinked that thought away your aunt was not sure if things were working out happily for you do you dislike komarr oh i like komarr just fine she said quickly i admit ive been a little homesick but thats not the same thing as not liking being here she did think you would seize the opportunity to place nikki in a komarran school for the as she would say cultural experience not that his school we saw this morning isnt very nice of course which i shall report back for her reassurance i promise i was tempted but being a barrayaran an offworlder in a komarran classroom might have been difficult for nikki you know how kids can gang up on anyone whos different at that age tien thought this private school would be much better a lot of the high vor families in the sector send their children there he thought nikki could make good connections i did not have the impression that nikki was socially ambitious his dryness was mitigated by a slight twinkle how was she to respond to that defend a choice she did not herself agree with admit she thought tien wrong if she once began complaining about tien she wasnt sure she could stop before her most fearful worries began to pour out and people complaining about their spouses always looked and sounded so ugly well connections for me at least not that she had been able to muster the energy to pursue them as assiduously as tien thought she ought ah its good youre making friends yes well yes she scraped at the last of the apple syrup on her plate when she looked up she noticed a goodlooking young komarran man who had stopped by the outer gate to the restaurants patio and was staring at her after a moment he entered and approached their table madame vorsoisson he said uncertainly yes she said warily oh good i thought i recognized you my name is andro farr we met at the winterfair reception for the serifosa terraforming employees a few months ago do you remember dimly oh yes you were somebodys guest yes marie trogir shes an engineering tech in the waste heat management department or she was do you know her i mean has she ever talked with you no not really ekaterin had met the young komarran woman perhaps three times at carefully choreographed project events she had usually been too conscious of herself as a representative of tien of the need to cordially meet and greet everyone to get into any very intimate conversations had she intended to talk to me the young man slumped in disappointment i dont know i thought you might have been friends or at least acquaintances ive talked to all her friends i can find urn oh ekaterin was not at all sure she wished to encourage this conversation farr seemed to sense her wariness he flushed slightly excuse me i seem to have found myself in a rather painful domestic situation and i dont know why it took me by surprise but but you see about six weeks ago marie told me she was going out of town on a field project for her department and would be back in about five weeks but she wasnt sure exactly she didnt give me any comconsole codes to reach her she said shed probably not be able to call and not to worry do you um live with her yes anyway time went by and time went by and i didnt hear i finally called her department head administrator soudha he was vague in fact i think he gave me a runaround so i went down there in person and asked around when i finally pinned him he said farr swallowed shed resigned abruptly six weeks ago and left so had her engineering boss radovas the one shed said she was going on the field project with soudha seemed to think theyd left together it makes no sense the idea of running away from a relationship and leaving no forwarding address made perfect sense to ekaterin but it was hardly her place to say so who knew what profound dissatisfactions farr had failed to detect in his lady im sorry i know nothing about this tien never mentioned it im sorry to bother you madame he hesitated balanced upon turning away have you talked to madame radovas ekaterin asked tentatively i tried she refused to talk with me that too was understandable if her middleaged husband had run off with a younger and prettier woman have you filed a missing person report with dome security uncle vorthys inquired ekaterin realized she hadnt introduced him and on reflection decided to leave it that way i wasnt sure i think im about to mm said ekaterin did she really want to encourage the fellow to persecute this girl she had apparently got away clean had she chosen this cruel method of ending their relationship because she was a twit or because he was a monster there was no way to tell from the outside you could never tell what secret burdens anyone carried concealed by their bright smiles she left all her things she left her cats i dont know what to do with them he said rather piteously ekaterin had heard of desperate women leaving everything up to and including their children but uncle vorthys put in that does seem odd id go to security if i were you if only to put your mind at ease you can always apologize later if necessary i i think i might good day madame vorsoisson sir he ran his hands through his hair and let himself back out the little fake wroughtiron gate to the park perhaps we ought to be getting back ekaterin suggested as the young man turned out of sight should we take lord vorkosigan some lunch theyll make up a carryout im not sure he notices missing meals when hes wound up in a problem but it does seem only fair do you know what he likes anything i would imagine does he have any food allergies not as far as i know she made a hasty selection of a suitably balanced and nutritious meal hoping that the prettilyarranged vegetables wouldnt end up in the waste disposer with males you never knew when the order was delivered they took their leave and ekaterin led the way to the nearest bubblecar station to get back to her own dome section she still had no clear idea how vorkosigan had so successfully handled his mutantstatus on their mutagenscarred homeworld except perhaps by pursuing most of his career off it was that likely to be any help to nikolai chapter four etienne vorsoissons bureaucratic domain occupied two floors partway up a sealed tower otherwise devoted to local serifosa dome government offices the tower on the edge of the domesprawl was not housed inside any other atmospherecontaining structure miles eyed the glassroofed atrium with disfavor as they ascended a curving escalator within it he swore his ear detected a faint far off whistle of air escaping some lessthantight seal so what happens if somebody lobs a rock through a window he murmured to the professor a step behind him not much vorthys murmured back it would vent a pretty noticeable draft but the pressure differential just isnt that great true serifosa dome was not really like a space installation despite occasional misleading similarities of architecture they made the air in here from the air out there for the most part vent shafts spotted all over the dome complex sucked in komarrs free volatiles filtered out the excess carbon dioxide and some trace nasties passed the nitrogen through unaltered and concentrated the oxygen to a humanlybearable mix the percentage of oxygen in komarrs raw atmosphere was still too low to support a large mammal without the technological aid of a breath mask but the absolute amount remained a vast reservoir compared to the volume of even the most extensive dome complexes as long as their power system keeps running they stepped from the escalator and followed vorsoisson into a corridor branching off the central atrium the sight of a case of emergency breath masks affixed to a wall next to a fire extinguisher reassured miles slightly in passing that the komarrans here were not completely oblivious to their routine hazards though the case looked suspiciously dusty had it ever been used since it had been installed however many years ago or checked if this were a military inspection miles could amuse himself by stopping the party right now and tearing the case apart to determine if the masks power and reservoir levels still fell within spec as an imperial auditor he could also do so of course or take any other action which struck his fancy when a younger man his besetting sin had been his impulsiveness in the dark doubts of night miles sometimes wondered if emperor gregor had quite thought through his most recent auditorial appointment power was supposed to corrupt but this felt more like being a kid turned loose in a candy store control yourself boy the mask case fell behind without incident vorsoisson as tour guide continued to point out the offices of his various subordinate departments without however inviting his visitors inside not that there was that much to see in these administrative headquarters the real interest and the real work lay outside the domes altogether in experimental stations and plots and pockets of biota all over serifosa sector all miles would find in these bland rooms were comconsoles and komarrans of course lots of komarrans this way my lords vorsoisson shepherded them into a comfortably spacious room featuring a large round holovid projection table the place looked and smelled like every other conference chamber miles had ever been in for military and security briefings and debriefings during his truncated career more of the same i predict my greatest challenge this afternoon will be to stay awake a half a dozen men and women sat waiting nervously fingering recording pads and vid disks and a couple more scurried in behind the two auditors with murmured apologies vorsoisson indicated seats set aside for the visitors at his right and left hand with a brief general smile of greeting miles settled in lord auditor vorthys lord vorkosigan may i present the department heads of the serifosa branch of the komarr terraforming project vorsoisson went round the table naming each attendee and their department which under the three basic branches of accounting operations and research included such evocative titles as carbon drawdown hydrology greenhouse gases tests plots waste heat management and microbial reclassification nativeborn komarrans every one vorsoisson was the only barrayaran expatriate among them vorsoisson remained standing and turned to one of the newcomers my lords may i also present ser venier my administrative assistant vennie has organized a general presentation for you after which my staff will be happy to answer any further questions vorsoisson sat down venier nodded to each auditor and murmured something inaudible he was a slight man shorter than vorsoisson with intent brown eyes and an unfortunate weak chin which together with his nervous air lent him the look of a slightly manic rabbit he took the holovid control podium and rubbed his hands together and stacked and restacked his pile of data disks before selecting one then putting it back down he cleared his throat and found his voice my lords it was suggested i start with a historical overview he nodded to each of them again his glance lingering for a moment on miles he inserted a disk in his machine and started an attractive ie artistically enhanced view of komarr spinning over the vid plate the early explorers of the wormhole nexus found komarr a likely candidate for possible terraforming our almost pointninestandard gravity and abundant native supply of gaseous nitrogen the inert buffer gas of choice and of sufficient waterice made it an immensely easier problem to tackle than such classic cold dry planets as say mars they had indeed been early explorers miles reflected to arrive and settle before more salubrious worlds were found to render such ambitious projects economically uninteresting at least if you didnt already live there but then there were the wormholes on the debit side venier continued the concentration of atmospheric co was high enough to be toxic to humans yet insolation was so inadequate that no greenhouse effect runaway or otherwise captured the heat needed to maintain liquid water komarr was therefore a lifeless world cold and dark the earliest calculations suggested more water would be needed and a few socalled lowimpact cometary crashes were arranged hence we can thank our ancestors for our southern crater lakes a colorful though outofscale sprinkle of lights dusted the lower hemisphere of the planetimage resolving into a string of blue blobs but the growing demand topside for cometary water and volatiles for the orbital and wormhole stations soon put a stop to that and the early downside settlers fears of poorly controlled trajectories of course demonstrated fears as miles recalled his komarran history he stole a glance at vorthys the professor appeared perfectly content with veniers class lecture in fact venier went on later explorations showed the waterice tied up in the polar caps to be thicker than at first suspected if not so abundant as on earth and so the drive for heat and light began miles sympathized with the early komarrans he loathed arctic cold and dark with a concentrated passion our ancestors built the first insolation mirror succeeded a generation later by another design a holovid model again out of scale appeared to the side and melted into a second one a century later this was in turn succeeded by the design we see today the sevendisk hexagon appeared and danced attendance on the komarr globe insolation at the equator was boosted enough to allow liquid water and the beginnings of a biota to draw down the carbon and release muchneeded o over the following decades a fullspectrum mixture of artificial greenhouse gases was manufactured and released into the upper atmosphere to help trap the new energy venier moved his hand four of the seven disks winked out then came the accident all the komarrans around the table stared glumly at the crippled array there was mention of a cooling projection with figures vorthys prodded gently yes my lord auditor venier slid a disk across the polished surface toward the professor administrator vorsoisson said you were an engineer so i left in all the calculations the waste heat management fellow soudha also an engineer winced and bit his thumb at this innocent ignorance of vorthyss stature in his field vorthys merely said thank you i appreciate that so wheres my copy miles did not ask aloud and can you please summarize your conclusions for us nonengineers ser venier certainly lord auditor vorkosigan serious damage to our biota in the northernmost and southernmost latitudes not just in serifosa sector but planetwide will begin after one season for every year after that we lose more ground by the end of five years the destructive cooling curve rises rapidly towards catastrophe it took twenty years to build the original soletta array i pray that it will not take that many to repair it on the vid model white polar caps crept like pale tumors over the globe vorthys glanced at soudha and so other sources of heat suddenly take on new importance at least for a stopgap soudha a big squarehanded man in his late forties sat back and smiled a bit grimly he too cleared his throat before beginning it was hoped early on in the terraforming that the waste heat from our growing arcologies would contribute significantly to planetary warming over time this proved optimistic a planet with an activating hydrology is a huge thermal buffering system what with the heat of liquefaction load locked up in all that ice at presentbefore the accidentit was felt the best use of waste heat was in the creation of microclimates around the domes to be reservoirs for the next wave of higher biota it sounds like insanity to an engineer to say we need to waste more energy in heat loss agreed vorthys but i suppose here its true whats the feasibility of dedicating some number of fusion reactors to pure heat production boiling the seas cup by cup soudha grimaced possible sure and id love to see some more done with that technique for smallarea development in serifosa sector economicalno per degree of planetary warming its even more costly than repairingor enlargingthe soletta array something for which weve been petitioning the imperium for years without success and if youve built a reactor you might as well use it to run a dome while youre at it the heat will arrive outside eventually just the same he slid data disks across to both vorthys and miles this time heres our current departmental status report he glanced across at one of his colleagues were all anxious to move on to higher plant forms in our lifetimes but at present the greatest if not success at least activity remains on the microbial level philip the man who had been introduced as the head of microbial reclassification smiled not entirely gratefully at soudha and turned to the auditors well yes bacteria are booming both our deliberate inoculations and wild genera over the years every earth type has been imported or at any rate has arrived and escaped unfortunately microbial life has a tendency to adapt to its environment more swiftly than the environment has adapted to us my department has its hands full keeping up with the mutations more light and heat are needed as always and bluntly my lords more funding although our microflora grow fast they also die fast rereleasing their carbon compounds we need to advance to higher organisms to sequester the excess carbon for the millennial timeframes required perhaps you could address this liz he nodded toward a pleasantly plump middleaged lady who had been named head of carbon drawdown she smiled happily by which miles deduced her departments responsibilities were going well this year yes my lords weve a number of higher forms of vegetation coming along both in major test plots and undergoing genetic development or improvement by far our greatest success is with the cold and carbondioxidehardy peat bogs they do require liquid water and as always would do better at higher temperatures ideally they should be sited in subduction zones for really longterm carbon sequestration but serifosa sector lacks these so weve chosen lowlying areas which will as water is released from the poles eventually be covered with lakes and small seas locking the captured carbon down under a sedimentary cap properly set up the process will run entirely automatically without further human intervention if we could just get the funding to double or triple the area of our plantations in the next few years well here are my projections vorthys collected another data disk weve started several test plots of larger plants to follow atop the bogs these larger organisms are of course infinitely more controllable than the rapidly mutating microflora they are ready to scale up to wider plantations right now but they are even more severely threatened by the reduction in heat and light from the soletta we really must have a reliable estimate of how long it will take to effect repairs in space before we dare continue our planting plans she gazed longingly at vorthys but he merely said thank you madame we plan a flyover of the peat plantations later this afternoon vorsoisson told her she settled back temporarily content and so it continued around the table more than miles had ever wanted to know about komarran terraforming interspersed with oblique and not so oblique pleas for increased imperial funding and heat and light power corrupts but we want energy only accounting and waste heat management had managed to arrive at the meeting with duplicate copies of their pertinent reports for miles he stifled an impulse to point this out to somebody did he really want another several hundred thousand words of bedtime reading his newer scars were starting to twinge by the time everyone had had their say without even yesterdays excuse of the physical stresses of buzzing around wreckage in a pressure suit he rose from his chair much more stiffly than he had intended vorthys made a gesture of a helping hand to his elbow but at miless frown and tiny head shake suppressed it he didnt really need a drink he just wanted one ah administrator soudha vorthys said as the waste heat department head stepped past them toward the door a word please soudha stopped and smiled faintly my lord auditor was there some special reason you could not help that young fellow farr find his missing lady soudha hesitated i beg your pardon the fellow who was looking for your former employee marie trogir i believe he said her name was was there some reason you could not help him oh him her well uh that was a difficult thing there soudha looked around but the room had emptied except for vorsoisson and venier waiting to convey their highranking guests on the next leg of their tour i recommended he file a missing person complaint with dome security they may be making inquiries of you i dont think ill be able to help them any more than i could help farr im afraid i really dont know where she is she left you see very suddenly only a days notice it put a hole in my staffing at what has proved to be a difficult time i wasnt too pleased so farr said i just thought it was odd about the cats one of my daughters keeps cats dreadful little parasites but shes very fond of them cats said soudha looking increasingly mystified trogir apparently left her cats in the keeping of farr soudha blinked but said ive always considered it out of line to intrude on my subordinates personal lives men or pets it was trogirs business not mine as long as theyre kept off project time i was there anything else not really said vorthys then if you will excuse me my lord auditor soudha smiled again and ducked away what was that all about miles asked vorthys as they turned down the corridor in the opposite direction vorsoisson answered a minor office scandal unfortunately one of soudhas techsfemaleran off with one of his engineers male completely blindsided him apparently hes fairly embarrassed about it however did you run across it young farr accosted ekaterin in a restaurant said vorthys he really has been a pest vorsoisson sighed i dont blame soudha for avoiding him i always thought komarrans were more casual about such things said miles in the galactic style and all that not as casual as the betans but still it sounds like a barrayaran backcountry elopement without surely the need to avoid backcountry social pressures such as homicidal relatives out to defend the clan honor vorsoisson shrugged the cultural contamination between the worlds cant run one way all the time i suppose the little party continued to the underground garage where the aircar vorsoisson had requisitioned was not in evidence wait here venier swearing under his breath vorsoisson went off to see what had happened to it vorthys accompanied him the opportunity to interview a komarran in apparentlycasual mode was not to be missed what kind of komarran was venier miles turned to him only to find him speaking first is this your first visit to komarr lord vorkosigan by no means ive passed through the topside stations many times i havent got downside too often i admit this is the first time ive been to serifosa have you ever visited solstice the planetary capital of course venier stared at the middle distance past the concrete pillars and dim lighting and smiled faintly have you ever visited the massacre shrine there a cheeky damned komarran thats what kind the solstice massacre was infamous as the ugliest incident of the barrayaran conquest the two hundred komarran counselors the thenruling senate had surrendered on termsand subsequently been gunned down in a gymnasium by barrayaran security forces the political consequences had run a short range from dire to disastrous miless smile became a little fixed of course how could i not all barrayarans should make that pilgrimage in my opinion i went with a close friend to help him burn a death offering for his aunt a relative of a martyr is a friend of yours veniers eyes widened in a moment of genuine surprise in what otherwise felt to miles to be a highly choreographed conversation how long had venier been rehearsing his lines in his head itching for a chance to try them out yes miles let his gaze become more directly challenging venier apparently felt the weight of it because he shifted uneasily and said as you are your fathers son im just a little surprised is all by what that i have any komarran friends especially as i am my fathers son you should not be veniers brows tweaked up well there is a theory that the massacre was ordered by emperor ezar without the knowledge of admiral vorkosigan ezar was certainly ruthless enough ruthless enough yes stupid enough never it was the barrayaran expeditions chief political officers own bright idea for which my father made him pay with his life not that that did much good for anyone after the fact leaving aside every moral consideration the massacre was a supremely stupid act my father has been accused of many things but stupidity has never i believe been one of them his voice was growing dangerously clipped well never know the whole truth i suppose said venier was that supposed to be a concession you can be told the whole truth all day long but if you wont believe it then no i dont suppose you ever will know it he bared his teeth in a nonsmile no keep control why let this komarran git see hes scored you off the doors of a nearby elevator opened and venier abruptly dropped from miless attention as madame vorsoisson and nikolai exited she was wearing the same dull dun outfit shed sported that morning and carried a large pile of heavy jackets over her arm she waved her hand around the jackets and stepped swiftly over to them am i very late she asked a bit breathlessly good afternoon venier suppressing the first idiocy that came to his lips which was any time is a good one for you milady miles managed a well good afternoon madame vorsoisson nikolai i wasnt expecting you are you to accompany us i hope your husband has just gone off to fetch an aircar yes uncle vorthys suggested it would be educational for nikolai and i havent had much chance to see outside the domes myself i jumped at the invitation she smiled and pushed back a strand of dark hair escaping its confinement and almost dropped her bundle i wasnt sure if we were to land anywhere and get outside on foot but i brought jackets for everyone just in case a large twocompartment sealed aircar hissed around the corner and sighed to the pavement beside them the front canopy opened and vorsoisson clambered out and greeted his wife and son the professor watched from the front seat with some amusement as the question of how to distribute six passengers among the two compartments was taken over by nikolai who wanted to sit both by his greatuncle and by his da perhaps venier could fly us today madame vorsoisson suggested diffidently vorsoisson gave her an oddly black look im perfectly capable her lips moved but she uttered no audible protest take your pick my lord auditor miles thought to himself would you rather be chauffeured by a man just possibly suffering the first symptoms of vorzohns dystrophy or by a komarran ah patriot with a car full of tempting barrayaran vor targets i have no preference he murmured truthfully i brought coats madame vorsoisson handed them out she and her husband and nikolai had their own a spare of her husbands did not quite meet around the professors middle the heavily padded jacket she handed miles had been hers he could tell immediately by the scent of her lingering in the lining he concealed a deep inhalation as he shrugged it on thank you that will do very well vorsoisson dove into the rear compartment and came up with a double handful of breath masks which he distributed both he and venier had their own with their names engraved on the cheekpieces the others were all labeled visitor one large two medium one small madame vorsoisson hung hers over her arm and bent to adjust nikolais and check its power and oxygen levels i already checked it vorsoisson told her his voice hinted a suppressed snarl you dont have to do it again oh sorry she said but miles running through his own check in drilled habit noticed she finished inspecting it before turning to adjust her own mask vorsoisson noticed too and frowned after a few more moments of betanstyle debate the group sorted themselves out with vorsoisson his son and the professor in the front compartment and miles madame vorsoisson and venier in the rear miles was uncertain whether to be glad or sorry with his lot in seatmates he felt he could have engaged either of them in fascinating if quite different conversations if the other had not been present they all pulled heir masks down around their necks out of the way but instantly ready to hand they departed the garages vehiclelock without further delay and the car rose in the air venier returned to his initial stiffly professional lecture mode pointing out bits of project scenery you could begin to see the terraforming from this modest altitude in the faint smattering of earthgreen in the damp low places and a fuzziness of lichen and algae on the rocks madame vorsoisson her face plastered to the canopy asked enough intelligent questions of venier that miles did not have to strain his tired brain for any for which he was very grateful im surprised madame vorsoisson with your interest in botany that you havent leaned on your husband for a job in his department said miles after a while oh she said as if this was a new idea to her oh i couldnt do that why not wouldnt it be nepotism or some kind of conflict of interest not if you did your job well which im sure you would after all the whole barrayaran vor system runs on nepotism its not a vice for us its a lifestyle venier suppressed an unexpected noise possibly a snort and glanced at miles with increased interest why should you be exempt miles continued its only a hobby i dont have nearly enough technical training id need much more chemistry to start you could start in a technical assistant positiontake evening classes to fill in your gaps bootstrap yourself up to something interesting in no time they have to hire someone belatedly it occurred to miles that if she not vorsoisson was the carrier of the vorzohns dystrophy there might be quelling reasons why she had not plunged into such a time and energyabsorbing challenge he sensed an elusive energy in her as if it were tied in knots locked down circling back to exhaust itself destroying itself had fear of her coming illness done that to her dammit which of them was it he was supposed to be such a hotshot investigator now he ought to be able to figure this one out well he could do so easily all he had to do was cheat and call impsec komarr and request a complete background medical check on his hosts just wave his magical auditorwand and invade all the privacy he wanted to no all this had nothing to do with the accident to the soletta array as this mornings embarrassment with her comconsole had demonstrated he needed to start keeping his personal and professional curiosity just as strictly separated as his personal and imperial funds neither a peculator nor a voyeur be he ought to get a plaque engraved with that motto and hang it on his wall for a reminder at least money didnt tempt him he could smell her faint perfume organic and floral against the plastic and metal and recycled air to miless surprise venier said you really should consider it madame vorsoisson her expression which during the flight had gradually become animated grew reserved again i well see maybe next year after if tien decides to stay vorsoissons voice over the intercom from the front compartment interrupted to point out the upcoming peat bog lining a long narrow valley below it was a more impressive sight than miles had expected for one thing it was a true and bright earthgreen for another it ran on for kilometers this strain produces six times the oxygen of its earth ancestor venier noted with pride so if you were trapped outside without a breath mask could you crawl around in it and survive till you were rescued miles asked practically mm if you could hold your breath for about a hundred more years miles began to suspect venier of concealing a sense of humor beneath that twitchy exterior in any case the aircar spiraled down toward a rocky outcrop and miless attention was taken up by their landing site hed had unpleasant and deep so to speak personal experience with the treachery of arctic bogs but vorsoisson managed to put the car down with a reassuring crunchy jar on solid rock and they all adjusted their breath masks the canopy rose to admit a blast of chill unbreathable outside air and they exited for a clamber over the rocks and down to personally examine the squishy green plants they were squishy green plants all right there were lots of them stretching to the horizon lots squishy green with an effort miles stopped his backbrain from composing a lengthy report to the emperor in this style and tried instead to appreciate veniers highly technical disquisition on potential deepfreeze damage to the somethingchemical cycle after a little more time spent regarding the viewit didnt change and nikki though he sprang around like a flea with his mother laboring after him didnt quite manage to fall into the bogthey all reboarded the aircar after a flyover of a neighboring green valley and a pass across another dull brown unaltered one for comparison and contrast they turned for the serifosa dome a largish installation featuring its own fusion reactor and a riot of assorted greens spilling away from it caught miless attention on the leftward horizon whats that he asked denier its waste heats main experiment station venier replied miles touched the intercom any chance of dropping in for a visit down there he called the forward compartment vorsoissons voice hesitated im not sure we could get back to the dome before dark i dont like to take the chance miles hadnt thought night flight was that hazardous but perhaps vorsoisson knew his own limitations and he did have his wife and child aboard not to mention all that imperial load in the somewhat unprepossessing persons of miles and the professor still surprise inspections were always the most fun if you wanted to turn up the good stuff he toyed with the idea of insisting auditorially it would certainly be interesting murmured venier i havent been out there in person in years perhaps another day suggested vorsoisson miles let it go he and vorthys were playing visiting firemen here not inspectors general the real crisis was topside perhaps if theres time another ten minutes of flight brought serifosa dome up over the horizon it was vast and spectacular in the gathering dusk with its glittering strings of lights looping bubblecar tubes warm glow of domes sparkling towers we humans dont do too badly miles thought if you catch us at the right angle the aircar slid back through the vehicle lock and settled again to the garage pavement venier went off with the aircar and vorsoisson collected the spare breath masks madame vorsoissons face was bright and glowing exhilarated by her field trip dont forget to put your mask back on the recharger she chirped to her husband as she handed him hers vorsoissons face darkened dont nag me he breathed through set teeth she recoiled slightly her expression closing as abruptly as a shutter miles stared off through the pillars politely pretending not to have heard or noticed this interplay he was hardly an expert on marital miscommunication but even he could see how that one had gone awry her perhaps unfortunatelychosen expression of love and interest had been received by the obviously tense and tired vorsoisson as a slur on his competence madame vorsoisson deserved a better hearing but miles had no advice to offer he had never even come near to capturing a wife to miscommunicate with not for lack of trying well well said uncle vorthys also heartily pretending not to have noticed the byplay everyone will feel better with a little supper aboard eh ekaterin let me treat you all to dinner do you have another favorite place as splendid as the one where we ate lunch the moment of tension was extinguished in another betan debate over the dinner destination this time nikki was successfully overruled by the adults miles wasnt hungry and the temptation to relieve vorthys of the days collection of data disks and escape back to some comconsole was strong but perhaps with another drink or three he could endure one more family dinner with the vorsoisson clan the last miles promised himself a trifle drunker than he had intended to be miles undressed for another night in the rented gravbed he piled the new stack of data disks on the comconsole to wait for morning coffee and better mental coherence the last thing he did was rummage in his case and fish out his controlledseizure stimulator he sat crosslegged on the bed and regarded it glumly the barrayaran doctors had found no cure for the postcryonic seizure disorder that had finally ended his military career the best they had been able to offer was this a triggering device to bleed off his convulsions in smaller increments in controlled private times and places instead of grandly randomly and spectacularly in moments of public stress checking his neurotransmitter levels was now a nightly hygienic routine just like brushing his teeth the doctors had suggested he felt his right temple for the implant and positioned the readcontact his only sensation was a faint spot of warmth the levels were not yet in the danger zone a few more days before he had to put in the mouthguard and do it again having left his armsman pym who usually played valet and general servant back on barrayar he would have to find another spotter the doctors had insisted he have a spotter when he did this ugly little thing he would much prefer to be helpless and outofconsciousnessand twitching like a fish he supposed though of course he was the one person who never got to watchin complete privacy maybe he would ask the professor if you had a wife she could be your spotter gee what a treat for her he grimaced and put the device carefully away in its case and crawled into bed perhaps in his dreams the space wreckage would reassemble itself just like in a vid reconstruction and reveal the secrets of its fate better to have visions of the wreckage than the bodies chapter five ekaterin studied tien warily as they undressed for bed the frowning tension in his face and body made her think she had better offer sex very soon strain in him frightened her as always it was past time to defuse him the longer she waited the harder it would be to approach him and the tenser he would become ending in some angry explosion of muffled cutting words sex she imagined wistfully should be romantic abandoned selfforgetful not the most tightly selfdisciplined action in her world tien demanded response of her and worked hard to obtain it she thought not like men shed heard about who took their own pleasure then rolled over and went to sleep she sometimes wished he would he became upsetwith himself with herif she failed to participate fully unable to act a lie with her body shed learned to erase herself from herself and so unblock whatever strange neural channel it was that permitted flesh to flood mind the inward erotic fantasies required to absorb her selfconsciousness had become stronger and uglier over time was that a mere unavoidable sideeffect of learning more about the ugliness of human possibility or a permanent corruption of the spirit i hate this tien hung up his shirt and twitched a smile at her his eyes remained strained though as they had been all evening id like you to do me a favor tomorrow anything to delay the moment certainly what take the brace of auditors out and show em a good time im about saturated with them this downside holiday of theirs has been incredibly disruptive to my department weve lost a week altogether i bet pulling together that show for them yesterday maybe they can go poke at something else till they go back topside take them where show them what anything i already took uncle vorthys around did you show him the sector university district maybe hed like that your uncle is interested in lots of things and i dont think the vor dwarf cares what hes offered as long as it includes enough wine i havent the first clue what lord vorkosigan likes to do ask him suggest something take him i dont know take him shopping shopping she said doubtfully or whatever he trod over to her still smiling tightly his hand slipped behind her back to hold her and he offered a tentative kiss she returned it trying not to let her dutifulness show she could feel the heat of his body of his hands and how thinly stretched his affability was ah yes the work of the evening defusing the unexploded tien always a tricky business she began to pay attention to the practiced rituals key words gestures that led into the practiced intimacies undressed and in bed she closed her eyes as he caressed her partly to concentrate on the touch partly to block out his gaze which was beginning to be excited and pleased wasnt there some bizarre mythical bird or other back on earth who fancied that if it couldnt see you you couldnt see it and so buried its head in the sand odd image while still attached to its neck she wondered she opened her eyes as tien reached across her and lowered the lamplight to a softer glow his avid look made her feel not beautiful and loved but ugly and ashamed how could you be violated by mere eyes how could you be lovers with someone and yet feel every moment alone with them intruded upon your privacy your dignity dont look tien absurd there really was something wrong with her he lowered himself beside her she parted her lips yielding quickly to his questing mouth she hadnt always been this selfconscious and cautious back in the beginning it had been different or had it been she alone whod changed it became her turn to sit up and return caresses that was easy enough he buried his face in his pillow and did not talk for a while as her hands moved up and down his body tracing muscle and tendon secretly seeking symptoms the tremula seemed reduced tonight perhaps last evenings shakes really had been a false alarm merely the hunger and nerves he had claimed she knew when the shift had occurred in her of course back about four five jobs ago now when tien had decided for reasons she still didnt understand that she was betraying himwith whom she had never understood either since the two names hed finally mentioned as his suspects were so patently absurd shed had no idea such a sexual mistrust had taken over his mind until shed caught him following her watching her turning up at odd times and bizarre places when he was supposed to be at workand had that perhaps had something to do with why that job had ended so badly shed finally had the accusation out of him shed been horrified deeply wounded and subtly frightened was it stalking when it was your own husband she had not had the courage to ask who to ask her one source of security was the knowledge that shed never so much as been alone in any private place with another man her vorclass training had done her that much good at least then he had accused her of sleeping with her women friends that had broken something in her at last some will to desire his good opinion how could you argue sense into someone who believed something not because it was true but because he was an idiot no amount of panicky protestation or indignant denial or futile attempt to prove a negative was likely to help because the problem was not in the accused but in the accuser she began then to believe he was living in a different universe one with a different set of physical laws perhaps and an alternate history and very different people from the ones shed met of the same name smarmy dopplegangers all still the accusation alone had been enough to chill her friendships stealing their innocent savor and replacing it with an unwelcome new level of awareness with the next move time and distance attenuated her contacts and on the move after that shed stopped trying to make new friends to this day she didnt know if hed taken her disgusted refusal to defend herself for a covert admission of guilt weirdly after the blowup the subject had been dropped cold he didnt bring it up again and she didnt deign to did he think her innocent or himself insufferably noble for forgiving her for nonexistent crimes why is he so impossible she didnt want the insight but it came nonetheless because he fears losing you and so in panic blundered about destroying her love creating a selffulfilling prophecy it seemed so its not as though you can pretend his fears have no foundation love was long gone in her she got by on a starvation diet of loyalty these days i am vor i swore to hold him in sickness he is sick i will not break my oath just because things have gotten difficult thats the whole point of an oath after all some things once broken cannot ever be repaired oaths trust she could not tell to what extent his illness was at the root of his erratic behavior when they returned from the galactic treatment he might be much better emotionally as well or at least she would at last be able to tell how much was vorzohns dystrophy and how much was just tien they switched positions his skilled hands began working down her back probing for her relaxation and response an even more unhappy thought occurred to her then had tien been consciously or unconsciously putting off his treatment because he realized on some obscure level that his illness his vulnerability was one of the few ties that still bound her to him is this delay my fault her head ached tien still valiantly rubbing her back made a murmur of protest she was failing to relax this wouldnt do resolutely she turned her thoughts to a practiced erotic fantasy unbeautiful but one which usually worked was it some weird inverted form of frigidity this thing bordering on selfhypnosis she seemed to have to do in order to achieve sexual release despite tiens toonear presence how could you tell the difference between not liking sex and not liking the only person youd ever done sex with yet she was almost desperate for touch mere affection untainted by the indignities of the erotic tien was very good about that massaging her for quite unconscionable lengths of time though he sometimes sighed in a boredom for which she could hardly blame him the touch the makeitbetter the sheer catlike comfort eased her body and then her heart despite it all she could absorb hours of thisshe slitted one eye open to check the clock better not get greedy so mindwrenching for tien to demand a sexual show of her on the one hand and accuse her of infidelity on the other did he want her to melt or want her to freeze anything you pick is wrong no this wasnt helping she was taking much too long to cultivate her arousal back to work she tried again to start her fantasy he might have rights upon her body but her mind was hers alone the one part of her into which he could not pry it went according to plan and practice after that mission accomplished all around tien kissed her when theyd finished there all better he murmured were doing better these days arent we she murmured back the usual assurances a light standard script she would have preferred an honest silence she pretended to doze in postcoital lassitude till his snores assured her he was asleep then she went to the bathroom to cry stupid irrational weeping she muffled it in a towel lest he or nikki or her guests hear and investigate i hate him i hate myself i hate him for making me hate myself most of all she despised in herself that crippling desire for physical affection regenerating like a weed in her heart no matter how many times she tried to root it out that neediness that dependence that loveoftouch must be broken first it had betrayed her worse than all the other things if she could kill her need for love then all the other coils which bound her desire for honor attachment to duty above all every form of fear could be brought into line austerely mystical she supposed if i can kill all these things in me i can be free of him ill be a walking dead woman but i will be free she finished the weep and washed her face and took three painkillers she could sleep now she thought but when she slipped back into the bedroom she found tien lying awake his eyes a faint gleam in the shadows he turned up the lamp at the whisper of her bare feet on the carpet she tried to remember if insomnia was listed among the early symptoms of his disease he raised the covers for her to slip beneath what were you doing in there all that time going for seconds without me she wasnt sure if he was waiting for a laugh if that was supposed to be a joke or her indignant denial evading the problem instead she said oh tien i almost forgot your bank called this afternoon very strange something about requiring my countersignature and palmprint to release your pension account i told them i didnt think that could be right but that i would check with you and get back to them he froze in the act of reaching for her they had no business calling you about that if this was something you wanted me to do you might have mentioned it earlier they said theyd delay releasing it till i got back to them delayed no you idiot bitch his right hand clenched in a gesture of frustration the hateful and hated epithet made her sick to her stomach all that effort to pacify him tonight and here he was right back on the edge did i make a mistake she asked anxiously tien whats wrong whats going on she prayed he wasnt about to put his fist through the wall again the noisewould her uncle hear or that vorkosigan fellow and how could she explain no no sorry he rubbed his forehead instead and she let out a covert sigh of relief i forgot about it being under komarran rules on barrayar i never had any trouble signing out my pension accumulation when i left any job any job that offered a pension anyway here on komarr i think they want a joint signature from the designated survivor its all right call them back first thing in the morning though and clear it youre not leaving your job are you her chest tightened in panic dear no not another move so soon no no hell no relax he smiled with one side of his mouth oh good she hesitated tien do you have any accumulation from your old jobs back on barrayar no i always signed it out at the end why let them have the use of the money when we could use it ourselves it served to tide us over more than once you know he smiled bitterly under the circumstances you have to admit the idea of saving for my old age is not very compelling and you wanted that vacation to south continent didnt you i thought you said that was a termination bonus so it was in a sense so if anything horrible happened to tien she and nikolai would have nothing if he doesnt get treatment soon something horrible is going to happen to him yes but the realization struck her could it be are you getting it out forwere going for the galactic treatment yes you and me and nikolai oh tien good finally of course i should have realized so thats what he needed the money for yes at last she rolled over and hugged him but would it be enough if it was less than a years worth will it be enough i dont know im checking i saved a little out of my household allowance i could put that in she offered if it will get us underway sooner he licked his lips and was silent for a moment im not sure i dont like to let you this is exactly what i saved it for i mean i know i didnt earn it in the first place but i managed itit can be my contribution how much do you have almost four thousand imperial marks she smiled proud of her frugality oh he looked as though he were making an inner calculation yes that would help significantly he dropped a kiss on her forehead and she relaxed further she said i never thought about raiding your pension for the medical quest i didnt realize we could how soon can we get away thats the next thing ill have to find out i would have checked it out this week but i was interrupted by my department suffering a severe outbreak of imperial auditors she smiled in brief appreciation of his wit hed used to make her laugh more if he had grown more sour with age it was understandable but the blackness of his humor had gradually come to weary her more than amuse her cynicism did not seem nearly so impressively daring to her now as it had when she was twenty perhaps this decision had lightened his heart too do you really think hell do what he says this time or will you be a fool again no if suspicion was the deadliest possible insult then trust was always right even if it was mistaken provisionally relieved by his new promise she snuggled into the crook of his body and for once his heavy arm flung across her seemed more comfort than trap maybe this time they would finally be able to put their lives on a rational basis shopping lord vorkosigan echoed over the breakfast table the next morning he had been the last of the household to arise uncle vorthys was already busy on the comconsole in tiens study tien had left for work and nikki was off to school vorkosigans mouth stayed straight but the laugh lines at the corners of his eyes crinkled thats an offer seldom made to the son of my mother im afraid i dont needno wait i do need something at that a wedding present who do you know whos getting married ekaterin asked relieved her suggestion had taken root primarily because she didnt have a second one to offer she prepared to be helpful gregor and laisa it took her a moment to realize he meant the emperor and his new komarran fiancee the surprising betrothal had been announced at winterfair the wedding was to be at midsummer oh uh im not sure you can find anything in the serifosa dome that would be appropriatemaybe in solstice they would have the kind of shops oh dear i have to come up with something im supposed to be gregors second and witness on their wedding circle maybe i could find something that would remind laisa of home though possibly thats not a good ideaim not sure i dont want to chance making her homesick on her honeymoon what do you think we could look i suppose there were exclusive shops shed never dared enter in certain parts of the dome this could be an excuse to venture inside duv and delia too come to think of it yes ive gotten way behind on my social duties who delia koudelkas a childhood friend of mine shes marrying commodore duv galeni who is the new chief of komarran affairs for imperial security you may not have heard of him yet but you will hes komarranborn of barrayaran parents no of komarran resistance fighters we seduced him to the service of the imperium weve agreed it was the shiny boots that turned the trick he was so utterly deadpan he had to be joking hadnt he she smiled uncertainly uncle vorthys lumbered into her kitchen then murmuring more coffee certainly she poured for him how is it going variously variously he sipped and gave her a thankyou smile i take it the morning courier has been here said vorkosigan how was last nights haul anything for me no happily if by that you mean more body parts they brought back quite a bit of equipment of various sorts does it make any difference in your pet scenarios so far no but i keep hoping it will i dislike the way the vector analysis is shaping up vorkosigans eyes became notably more intent oh why mm take point a as all things a moment before the accidentintact ship on course soletta passively sitting in its orbital slot take point b to be some time after the accident parts of all masses scattering off in all directions at all speeds by good old classical physics b must equal a plus x x being whatever forcesor masseswere added during the accident we know a pretty much and the more of b we collect the more we narrow down the possibilities for x were still missing some control systems but the topside boys have by now retrieved most of the initial mass of the system of shipplusmirror by the partial accounting done so far x is very large and has a very strange shape depending on when and how the engines blew the explosion could have added a pretty damned big kick said vorkosigan its not the magnitudes of the missing forces that are so puzzling its their direction fragments of anything given a kick in free fall generally travel in a straight line taking into account local gravities of course and the ore ship pieces didnt vorkosigans brows rose so what do you have in mind for an outside force uncle vorthys pursed his lips im going to have to contemplate this for a while play around with the numbers and the visual projections my brain is getting too old i think whats the the shape of the force then that makes it so strange asked ekaterin following all this with deep interest uncle vorthys set his cup down and placed his hands side by side half open its a typical mass in space creates a gravitational well a funnel if you will this looks more like a trough running from the ore ship to the mirror asked ekaterin trying to picture this no said uncle vorthys running from that nearby wormhole jump point to the mirror or vice versa and the ore ship ah fell in said vorkosigan he looked momentarily as baffled as ekaterin felt uncle vorthys did not look much better i should not like to say so in public thats certain vorkosigan asked a gravitational force or maybe a gravitic imploder lance eh said uncle vorthys neutrally its certainly not like the force map of any imploder lance ive ever seen ah well he picked up his coffee and prepared to depart for his comconsole again we were just planning an outing said ekaterin would you like to see some more of serifosa pick up a present for the professora i would but i think its my turn to stay in and read this morning said her uncle you two go and have a good time though if you do see anything you think would please your aunt id be extremely grateful if youd purchase it and ill reimburse you all right go out with vorkosigan alone shed assumed she would have her uncle along as chaperone still if they stayed in public places it should be enough to assuage any incipient suspicion on tiens part not that tien seemed to see vorkosigan as any sort of threat oddly you didnt need to see any more of tiens department did you oh dear she hadnt phrased that wellwhat if he said yes i havent even reviewed their first stack of reports yet her uncle sighed perhaps youd care to take those on miles yeah ill have a go at them his eyes flicked up to ekaterins anxious face later when we get back ekaterin led lord vorkosigan across the domed park that fronted her apartment building heading for the nearest bubblecar station his legs might be short but his steps were quick and she found she did not have to moderate her pace if anything she needed to lengthen her stride that stiffness which she had seen impede his motion seemed to be something that came and went over the course of the day his gaze too was quick as he looked all around at one point he even turned and walked backward a moment studying something that had caught his eye is there anyplace in particular you would like to go she asked him i dont know a great deal about serifosa i throw myself on your mercy madame as my native guide the last time i went shopping in any major way it was for military ordnance she laughed thats very different its not as different as you might think for the really highticket items they send sales engineers halfway across the galaxy to wait upon you its exactly the way my aunt vorpatril shops for clothesin her case come to think of it also highticket items the couturiers send their minions to her ive become fond of minions in my old age his old age was no more than thirty she decided a newminted thirty much like her own still worn uncomfortably and is that the way your mother the countess shops too how had his mother dealt with the fact of his mutations rather well judging from the results mother just buys whatever aunt vorpatril tells her to ive always had the impression shed be happier in her old betan astronomical survey fatigues the famous countess cordelia vorkosigan was a galactic expatriate of the most galactic possible sort a betan from beta colony progressive hightech glittering beta colony or corrupt dangerous sinister beta colony take your pick of political views no wonder lord vorkosigan seemed tinged with a faint galactic air he literally was half galactic have you ever been to beta colony is it as sophisticated as they say yes and no they arrived at the bubblecar platform and she led them to the fourth car in line partly because it was empty and partly to give herself an extra few seconds to select their destination quite automatically lord vorkosigan hit the switch to close and seal the bubble canopy as soon as theyd settled into the front seat he was either accustomed to his privacy or just hadnt yet encountered the share the ride campaign now going on in serifosa dome in any case she was glad not to be bottled up with any komarran strangers this trip komarr had been a galactic trade crossroads for centuries and the bazaar of the barrayaran empire for decades even a relative backwater like serifosa offered an abundance of wares at least equal to vorbarr sultana she pursed her lips then slotted in her credit chit and punched up the shuttleport locks district as their destination on the bubblecars control panel after a moment they bumped into the tube and began to accelerate the acceleration was slow not a good sign i believe ive seen your mother a few times on the holovid she offered after a moment sitting next to your father on reviewing platforms and the like mostly some years ago when he was still regent does it seem strange does it give you a very different view of your parents to see them on vid no he said it gives me a very different view of holovids the bubblecar swung into a walled darkness lit by sidestrips flickering past the eye then broke abruptly into sunlight arching toward the next airsealed complex halfway up the arc they slowed still further ahead of them in the tube ekaterin could see other bubblecars bunching to a crawl like pearls on a string oh dear i was afraid of that looks like were caught in a blockage vorkosigan craned his neck an accident no the systems just overloaded at certain times of day on certain routes you can get held up from twenty to forty minutes theyre having a local political argument over the bubblecar system funding right now one group wants to shorten the safety margins between cars and increase speeds another one wants to build more routes another one wants to ration access his eyes lit with amusement ah yes i understand and how many years has this argument been ongoing without issue at least five im told isnt local democracy wonderful he murmured and to think the komarrans imagined we were doing them a favor to leave their downside affairs under their traditional sector control i hope you dont mind heights she said uncertainly as the bubblecar moaned almost to a halt at the top of the arc through the faint distortions of the canopy and tube half of serifosa domes chaotic patchwork of structures seemed spread out to their view two cars ahead of them a couple seized this opportunity to indulge in some heavy necking ekaterin studiously ignored them or small enclosed spaces he smiled a little grimly as long as the small enclosed space is above freezing i can manage was that a reference to his cryodeath she hardly dared ask she tried to think of a way to work the conversation back to his mother and thence to how shed dealt with his mutations astronomical survey i thought your mother served in the betan expeditionary force in the escobar war before the war she had an elevenyear career in their survey administration or she didnt go out on the blind wormhole jumps did she i mean all spacers are a little strange but wormhole wildcatters are supposed to be the craziest of the crazy thats quite true he glanced out as with a slight jerk the bubblecar began to move once more descending toward the next city section ive met some of em i confess i never thought of the government survey as in the same league with the entrepreneurs the independents make blind jumps into possible death hoping for a staggering fortune the survey makes blind jumps into possible death for a salary benefits and a pension hm he sat back looking suddenly bemused she made ship captain before the war maybe she had more practice for barrayar than id realized i wonder if she got tired of playing wall too ill have to ask her playing wall sorry a personal metaphor when youve taken chances a few too many times you can get into an odd frame of mind adrenaline is a hard habit to kick id always assumed that my um former taste for that kind of rush came from the barrayaran side of my genetics but neardeath experiences tend to cause you to reevaluate your priorities running that much risk that long youd end up either damn sure who you were and what you wanted or youd be i dont know anesthetized and your mother well shes certainly not anesthetized she grew more daring still and you hm he smiled a small elusive smile you know most people when they get a chance to corner me try to pump me about my father oh she flushed with embarrassment and sat back im sorry i was rude not at all indeed he did not look or sound annoyed his posture open and inviting as he leaned back and watched her not at all thus encouraged she decided to be daring again when would she ever repeat such a chance after all perhaps what happened to you was a different kind of wall for her yes it makes sense that you would see it from her point of view i guess what exactly did happen to me he finished he did not grow stiff as he had in that prickly moment over dinner the other night but instead regarded her thoughtfully with a kind of attentive seriousness that was almost more alarming what do you know not a great deal id heard that the lord regents son had been born crippled in the pretenders war the lord regent was noted for keeping his private life very private actually shed heard his heir was a mutie and kept out of sight thats all he looked almost offendedthat he wasnt more famous or infamous my life didnt much intersect that social set she hastened to explain or any other my father was just a minor provincial bureaucrat many of barrayars rural vor are a lot more rural than they are vor im afraid his smile grew quite you should have met my grandfather or perhaps not well hm theres not a great deal to tell at this late date an assassin aiming for my father managed to graze both my parents with an obsolete military poison gas called soltoxin during the pretendership just prior actually my mother was five months pregnant with me hence this mess a wave of his hand down his body and that nervous jerk of his head both summed himself and defied the viewer the damage was actually teratogenic not genetic he shot her an odd sidelong look it used to be very important to me for people to know that used to be and not now ingenuous of himhed managed to tell her quickly enough she was almost disappointed was it true that only his body and not his chromosomes had been damaged now i think maybe its all right if they think im a mutie if i can make it really not matter maybe it will matter less for the next mutie who comes after me a form of service that costs me no additional effort it cost him something evidently she thought of nikolai heading into his teens soon and what a hard time of life that was even for normal children were you made to feel it growing up i was of course somewhat protected by fathers rank and position she noted that somewhat somewhat was not the same as completely sometimes somewhat was the same as not at all i moved a few mountains to force myself into the imperial military service after um a few false starts i finally found a place for myself in imperial security among the irregulars the rest of the irregulars impsec was more interested in results than appearances and i found i could deliver results except a slight miscalculationall the achievements upon which id hoped to be rejudged disappeared into impsecs classified files so i fell out at the end of a thirteenyear career a medically discharged captain whom nobody knew almost as anonymous as when i started he actually sighed imperial auditors arent anonymous no just discreet he brightened so theres some hope yet why did he make her want to laugh she swallowed the impulse do you wish to be famous his eyes narrowed in a moment of introspection i would have said so once now i think i just wanted to be someone in my own right make no mistake i like being my fathers son he is a great man in every sense and its been a privilege to know him but there is nevertheless a secret fantasy of mine where just once in some history somewhere aral vorkosigan gets introduced as being principally important because he was miles naismith vorkosigans father she did laugh then though she muffled it almost immediately with a hand over her mouth but he did not seem to take offense for his eyes merely crinkled at her it is pretty amusing he said ruefully no no not that she hastily denied it just seems like some kind of hubris i guess oh its all kinds of hubris except that he did not look in the least daunted by the prospect merely calculating his thoughtful look fell on her then he cleared his throat and began when i was working on your comconsole yesterday morning the deceleration of the bubblecar interrupted him the little man craned his neck as they slid to a halt in the station damn he murmured is something wrong she asked concerned no no he hit the pad to raise the canopy so lets see this docks and locks district lord vorkosigan seemed to enjoy their stroll through the organized chaos of the shuttleport locks district though the route he chose was decidedly nonstandard he zigzagged by preference down to what ekaterin thought of as the underside of the area where people and machines loaded and unloaded cargo and where the less welloff sorts of spacers had their hostels and bars there were plenty of oddlooking people in the district in all colors and sizes wearing strange clothes snatches of conversations in utterly strange languages teased her ear in passing the looks they gave the two barrayarans were noted but ignored by vorkosigan ekaterin decided that his lack of offense wasnt because the galactics stared lessor moreat him it was that they stared equally at everybody she also discovered that he was attracted by the dreadful among the galactic wares cramming the narrow shops into which they ducked he actually appeared to seriously consider for several minutes what was claimed to be a genuine twentiethcentury reproduction lamp of jacksonian manufacture consisting of a sealed glass vessel containing two immiscible liquids which slowly rose and fell in the convection currents it looks just like red blood corpuscles floating in plasma vorkosigan opined staring in fascination at the underlit blobs but as a wedding present she choked half amused half appalled what kind of message would people take it for it would make gregor laugh he replied not a gift he gets much but youre right the wedding present proper needs to be er proper public and political not personal with a regretful sigh he returned the lamp to its shelf after another moment he changed his mind again bought it and had it shipped ill get him another present for the wedding this can be for his birthday after that he let ekaterin lead him into the more sophisticated end of the district with shops displaying wellspreadout and welllit jewelry and artwork and antiques interspersed with discreet couturiers of the sort she thought who might send minions to his aunt he seemed to find it much less interesting than the galactic rummage sale a few streets and levels away the animation fading from his face until his eye was caught by an unusual display in a jewelers kiosk tiny model planets the size of the end of her thumb turned in a gravbubble against a black background several of the little spheres were displayed under various levels of magnification where they proved to be perfectlymapped replicas of the worlds they represented right down to the onemeter scale not just rivers and mountains and seas but cities and roads and dams were represented in realistic colors furthermore the terminator moved across their miniature landscapes in realtime for the planetary cycle in question cities lit the night side like living jewels they could be hung in pairs as earrings or displayed in pendants or bracelets most of the planets in the wormhole nexus were available including beta colony and an earth that included as an option its famous moon circling a handspan away though how this pairing was to be hung on someones body was not entirely clear the prices at which vorkosigan did not even glance were alarming thats rather fine he murmured approvingly staring in fascination at the little barrayar i wonder how they do that i know where i could have one reverseengineered they seem more like toys than jewels but i have to admit theyre striking oh yes a typical tech toyhighend this year everywhere next year nowhere after that till the antiquarians revival still it would be fun to make up an imperial set barrayar komarr and sergyar i dont know any women with three ears two earrings and a pendant perhaps though then youd have the sociopolitical problem of how to rank the worlds you could put all three on a necklace true or i think my mother would definitely like a sergyar or beta colony no might make her homesick sergyar yes very apropos and theres winterfair and birthdays coming uplets see theres mother laisa delia aunt alys delias sisters droumaybe i ought to order a dozen sets and have a couple to spare uh said ekaterin contemplating this burst of efficiency do all these women know each other were any of them his lovers surely he wouldnt mention such in the same breath with his mother and aunt or might he be a suitor but to all of them oh sure do you really think you ought to get them all the same present no he asked doubtfully but they all know me in the end he restrained himself purchasing only two earring sets one each of barrayars and komarrs and swapping them out for the brides of the two mixed marriages he added a sergyar on a fine chain for his mother at the last moment he bolted back for another barrayar for which woman on his lengthy list he did not say the packets of tiny planets were made up and giftwrapped feeling a little overwhelmed by the komarran bazaar ekaterin led him off for a look at one of her favorite parks it bounded the end of the locks district and featured one of the largest and most naturally landscaped lakes in serifosa ekaterin mentally planned a stop for coffee and pastry after they circumnavigated the lake along its walking trails they paused at a railing above a modest bluff where a view across the lake framed some of the higher towers of serifosa the crippled soletta array was in full view overhead now through the parks transparent dome creating dim sparkles on the lakes wavelets cheerful voices echoed distantly across the water from families playing on an artificiallynatural swimming beach its very pretty said ekaterin but the maintenance cost is terrific urban forestry is a fulltime specialty here everythings consciously created the woods the rocks the weeds everything worldinabox murmured vorkosigan gazing out over the reflecting sheet some assembly required some serifosans think of their park system as a promise for the future ecology in the bank she went on but others i suspect dont know the difference between their little parks and real forests i sometimes wonder if by the time the atmosphere is breathable the komarrans greatgrandchildren will all be such agoraphobes they wont even venture out in it a lot of betans tend to think like that when i was last there his sentence was shattered by a sudden crackling boom ekaterin started till she identified the noise as a load dropped from a magcrane working on some construction or reconstruction back over their shoulders beyond the trees but vorkosigan jumped and spun like a cat the package in his right hand went flying his left made to push her behind him and he drew a stunner she hadnt even known he was carrying half out of his trouser pocket before he too identified the source of the bang he inhaled deeply flushed and cleared his throat sorry he said to her wideeyed look i overreacted a trifle there though they both surreptitiously examined the dome overhead it remained placidly intact stunners a pretty useless weapon anyway against things that go bump like that he shoved it back deep into his pocket you dropped your planets she said looking around for the white packet it was nowhere in sight he leaned out over the railing damn she followed his gaze the packet had bounced off the boardwalk and fetched up a meter down the bluff caught on a bit of hanging foliage a thorny bittersweet plant dangling over the water i think maybe i can reach it he swung over the railing past the sign admonishing caution stay on the trail and flung himself flat on the ground over the edge before she could squeak but your good suit vorkosigan was not she suspected a man who routinely did his own laundry but his blunt fingers swung short of the prize they sought she had a hideous vision of an imperial auditor under her guesthold landing headdown in the pond could she be accused of treason the bluff was barely four meters high how deep was the water here my arms are longer she offered climbing after him temporarily thwarted he scrambled back to a sitting position we can fetch a stick or better yet a minion with a stick he glanced dubiously at his wrist comm i think she said demurely calling impsec for this might be overkill she lay prone and reached as he had its all right i think i can her fingers too swung short of the packet but only just she inched forward feeling the precarious pull of the undercut slope she stretched the rootcompacted soil of the edge sagged under her weight and she began to slide precipitously forward she yelped pushing backward fragmented her support totally one wildly backgrappling arm was caught suddenly in a viselike grip but the rest of her body turned as the soil gave way beneath her and she found herself dangling absurdly feetdown over the pond her other arm swinging around was caught too and she looked up into vorkosigans face above her he was lying prone on the slope one hand locked around each of her wrists his teeth were clenched and grinning his gray eyes alight let go you idiot she cried the look on his face was weirdly wildly exultant never he gasped again his halfboots were locked around nothing she realized as he began to slide inexorably over the edge after her but his deathgrip never slackened the exalted look on his face melted to sudden horrified realization the laws of physics took precedence over heroic intent for the next couple of seconds dirt pebbles vegetation and two barrayaran bodies all hit the chilly water more or less simultaneously the water it turned out was a bit over a meter deep the bottom was soft with muck she wallowed upright onto her feet one shoe gone who knew where sputtering and dragging her hair from her eyes and looking around frantically for vorkosigan lord vorkosigan the water came to her waist it ought not to be over his headno halfbooted feet were sticking up like waving stumps anywherecould he swim he popped up beside her and blew muddy water out of his mouth and dashed it from his eyes to clear his vision his beautiful suit was sodden and a waterplant dangled over one ear he clawed it away and located her his hand going toward her and then stopping oh said ekaterin faintly drat there was a meditative pause before lord vorkosigan spoke madame vorsoisson he said mildly at last has it ever occurred to you that you may be just a touch oversocialized she couldnt stop herself she laughed out loud she clapped her hand over her mouth and waited fearfully for some masculine explosion of wrath none came he merely grinned back at her he looked around till he spotted his packet now dangling mockingly overhead ha now gravitys on our side at least he waded underneath the remains of the overhang disappeared into the water again and came up holding a couple of rocks he shied them at the thorn plant till he dislodged his package and caught it onehanded as it fell before it could hit the water he grinned again and splashed back to her and offered her his other arm for all the world as though they were about to enter some ambassadorial reception madame will you wade with me his humor was irresistible she found herself laying her hand upon his sleeve my pleasure my lord she abandoned her surreptitious toeprodding for her lost shoe they sloshed off toward the nearest low place on shore with the most serenely cockeyed dignity ekaterin had ever experienced packet in his teeth he scrambled ahead of her grabbed a narrow outleaning tree trunk for support and handed her up through the mud with the air of an armsmandriver helping his lady from the rear compartment of her groundcar to ekaterins intense relief no one across the lake appeared to have noticed their show could vorkosigans imperial authority save them from arrest for swimming in a noswimming zone you arent upset about the accident she inquired timorously as they regained the path still hardly able to believe her good fortune in his admittedly odd reaction a passing jogger stared at them turning and bouncing backward a moment but vorkosigan waved him genially onward he tucked his packet under his arm madame vorsoisson trust me on this one needle grenades are accidents that was just an amusing inconvenience but then his smile slipped his face stiffened and his breath drew in sharply he added in a rush i should mention ive lately become subject to occasional seizures i pass out and have convulsions they last about five minutes and then go away and i wake up no harm done if one should occur dont panic are you about to have one now she asked panicked i feel a little strange all of a sudden he admitted there was a bench nearby along the trail here sit down she led him to it he sat abruptly and hunched over with his face in his hands he was beginning to shiver with the wet cold as was she but his shudders were long and deep traveling the length of his short body was a seizure starting now she regarded him with terror after a couple of minutes his ragged breathing steadied he rubbed his face hard and looked up he was extremely pale almost grayfaced his pastedon smile as he turned toward her was so plainly false that she almost would rather hed have frowned im sorry i havent done anything like that in quite a while at least not in a waking state sorry was that a seizure no no false alarm entirely actually it was a um combat flashback actually unusually vivid sorry i dont usually i havent done i dont usually do things like this really his speech was scrambled and hesitant entirely unlike himself and failed signally to reassure her should i go for help she was sure she needed to get him somewhere warmer as soon as possible he looked like a man in shock ha no worlds too late no really ill be all right in a couple of minutes i just need to think about this for a minute he looked sideways at her i was just stunned by an insight for which i thank you she clenched her hands in her lap either stop talking gibberish or stop talking at all she said sharply his chin jerked up and his smile grew a shade more genuine yes you deserve an explanation if you want it i warn you its a bit ugly she was so rattled and exasperated by now shed have cheerfully choked explanations out of his cryptic little throat she took refuge in the mockery of formality which had extracted them so nobly from the pond if you please my lord ah yes well dagoola iv i dont know if youve heard much about it some it was an evacuation under fire it was an unholy mess shuttles lifting with people crammed aboard the details dont matter now except for one there was this woman sergeant beatrice taller than you we had trouble with our shuttles hatch ramp it wouldnt retract we couldnt dog the hatch and lift above the atmosphere till wed jettisoned it we were airborne i dont know how high there was thick cloud cover we got the damaged ramp loosened but she fell after it i grabbed for her touched her hand even but i missed did was she killed oh yes his smile now was utterly peculiar it was a long way down by then but you see something i didnt see until about five minutes ago ive spent five six years walking around with this picture in my head not all the time you understand just when i chanced to be reminded if only id been a little quicker grabbed a little harder hadnt lost my grip i might have pulled her in instant replay on an endless repeat in all those years i never once pictured what would really have happened if id made my grab good she was almost twice my weight shed have pulled you out said ekaterin for all the simplicity of his words the images they evoked were intense and immediate she rubbed at the deep red marks aching now on her wrists because you would not have let go he looked for the first time at the marks oh im sorry its all right selfconscious she stopped massaging them this didnt help because he took her hand and rubbed gently at the blotches as if he might erase them i think there must be something askew with my body image he said do you think youre six feet tall inside your head apparently my dreamself thinks so does thatrealizing the truthmake it any better no i dont think so just different stranger both their hands were freezing cold she sprang to her feet eluding his arresting touch we have to go get dry and warm or well both be in a state catch your death was her greataunts old phrase for it and a singularly inept phrase it would be to use just now she dropped her useless remaining shoe in the first trash bin they passed on their way to the bubblecar stop near the public beach ekaterin darted into a kiosk and bought a stack of colorful towels in the bubblecar she turned the heat up to its stingy maximum here she said shoving towels at lord vorkosigan as the car accelerated get out of that sopping tunic at least and dry off a bit right tunic silk shirt and thermal undershirt hit the floor with a wet splat and he rubbed his hair and torso vigorously his skin had a blotched purpleblue tinge pink and white scars sprang out in high contrast to their darkened background there were scars on scars on scars mostly very fine and surgically straight in crisscrossing layers running back through time growing fainter and paler on his arms on his hands and fingers on his neck and running up under his hair circling his ribcage and paralleling his spine and most pinkly and recently an unusually ragged and tangled mess centered on his chest she stared in covert astonishment his glance caught hers by way of apology she said you werent joking about needle grenades were you his hand touched his chest no but most of this is old surgery from the brittle bones the soltoxin gifted me with ive had practically every bone in my body replaced with synthetics at one time or another very piecemeal though i suppose it would not have been medically practical to just whip me off my skeleton shake me out like a suit of clothes and pop me back on over another one oh my ironically enough all this show represents the successful repairs the injury that really took me out of the service you cant even see he touched his forehead and wrapped a couple of the towels around himself like a shawl the towels had giant yellow daisies on them his shivering was diminishing now his skin growing less purple though still blotchy i didnt mean to alarm you back there she thought it through you should have told me sooner yes what if one of his seizures had taken him by surprise sometime along their route this morning what in the world would she have done she frowned at him he shifted uncomfortably youre quite right of course um quite right some secrets are unfair to keep from people on your team he looked away from her looked back smiled tensely and said i started to tell you earlier but i rather lost my nerve when i was working on your comconsole yesterday morning i accidentally ran across your file on vorzohns dystrophy her breath seemed to freeze in her suddenlyparalyzed chest didnt ihow could you accidentally had she somehow left it open last time not possible i could show you how he offered impsec basic training is pretty basic i think you could pick up that trick in about ten minutes the words blurted out before she could stop and think you opened it deliberately well yes his smile now was false and embarrassed i was curious i was taking a break from looking at vids of autopsies your um gardens are lovely too by the way she stared at him in disbelief a mixture of emotions churned in her chest violation outrage fear and relief you had no right no i had no right he agreed watching her obviously tooopen expression she tried to school her face to blankness i apologize i can only plead that impsec training inculcates some pretty bad habits he took a deep breath what can i do for you madame vorsoisson anything you need to ask or ask about i am at your service the little man halfbowed an absurdly archaic gesture sitting wrapped in his towels like some wizened old count from the time of isolation in his robes of office theres nothing you can do for me ekaterin said woodenly she became aware that her legs and arms were tightly crossed and she was starting to hunch over she straightened with a conscious effort dear god how would tien react to her spilling however inadvertently his deadlywell he acted as though it were deadlysecret now of all times when he seemed on the verge of overcoming his denial or whatever it was and taking effective action at last i beg your pardon madame vorsoisson but im afraid im still uncertain exactly what your situation is its obviously very private if even your uncle doesnt knot and id give odds he doesnt dont tell him not without your permission i assure you madame but if you are ill or expect to become ill there is a great deal that can be done for you he hesitated the contents of that file tell me you already know this is anyone helping you help what a concept she felt as though she might melt through the floor of the bubble car at the mere thought she retreated from the terrible temptation im not ill we dont require assistance she raised her chin defiantly and added with all the frost she could muster it was very wrong of you to read my private files lord vorkosigan yes he agreed simply a wrong i do not care to compound by either concealing my breach of trust or failing to offer what help i can command just how much help imperial auditor vorkosigan might command was not to be thought about too painful belatedly she realized that declaring herself unaffected was tantamount to naming tien afflicted she was rescued from her confusion by the bubblecar sliding to a stop at her home station this is very much not your business i beg you will think of your uncle as a resource then im certain he would wish it she shook her head and hit the canopy release sharply they walked in stiff and chilled silence back to her apartment building in awkward contrast ekaterin felt to their earlier odd ease vorkosigan didnt look happy either uncle vorthys met them at the apartment door still in shirtsleeves and with a data disk in his hand ah vorkosigan back earlier than i expected good i almost rang your comm link he paused staring at their damp and bizarre bedragglement but then shrugged and went on we had a visit from a second courier something for you a second courier must be something hot is it a break in the case vorkosigan shrugged an arm free of his towelshawl and took the proffered disk im not at all sure they found another body the missing were all accounted for a body part surely a womans arm perhaps uncle vorthys shook his head a body almost intact male theyre working on the identification now they were all accounted for he grimaced now it seems we have a spare chapter six miles boiled himself in the shower for a long time trying to regain control of his shocky body and scattered wits hed realized quickly earlier that all madame vorsoissons anxious questions about his mother camouflaged oblique concerns about her son nikolai and hed answered her as openly and carefully as he could hed been rewarded through the extremely pleasant mornings expedition by seeing her gradually relax and grow nearly open herself when shed laughed her light blue eyes had sparkled the animated intelligence had illuminated her face and spilled over to loosen and soften her body from its original tight defensive density her sense of humor creeping slowly out from hiding had even survived his dropping them into that idiot pond her brief appalled look when hed halfstripped in the bubblecar had almost thrown him back into earlier modes of painful somatic selfconsciousness but not quite it seemed he had grown comfortable at last in his own illused body and the realization had given him a lunatic courage to try to clear things with her so when all expression in her face shut down as hed confessed his snooping that had hurt hed handled a bad situation as well as he could hadnt he yes no he wished now hed kept his mouth shut no his false stance with madame vorsoisson had been unbearable unbearable isnt that a little strong uncomfortable he revised this hastily downward awkward anyway but confession was supposed to be followed by absolution if only the damned bubblecar had been delayed again if only hed had ten more minutes with her he might have made it come out right he shouldnt have tried to piss it off with that stupid joke i could show you how her icy armored we dont require assistance felt like missing a catch he would be forced onward she would spin down into the fog and never be seen again youre overdramatizing boy madame vorsoisson wasnt in a combat zone was she yes she is she was just falling toward death in exquisitely slow motion he wanted a drink desperately preferably several instead he dried himself off dressed in another of his auditorsuits and went to see the professor miles leaned on the professors comconsole in the guest room which doubled as tien vorsoissons home office and studied the ravaged face of the dead man in the vid he hoped for some revelation of expression surprise or rage or fear that would give a clue as to how the fellow had died besides suddenly but the face was merely dead its frozen distortions entirely physiological and familiar first of all are they sure hes really ours miles asked pulling up a chair for himself and settling in on the vid the anonymous medtechs examination recording played on at low volume her voiceover comments delivered in that flat clinical tone universally used at moments like this he didnt drift in from somewhere else i suppose no unfortunately vorthys said his speed and trajectory put him accurately at the site of our accident at the time of the smashup and his initial estimated time of death also matches miles had wished for a break in the case some new lead that would take him in a more speedily fruitful direction he hadnt realized his desires were so magically powerful be careful what you wish for can they tell if he came from the ship or the station not from the trajectory alone mm i suppose not he shouldnt have been aboard either one well we wait for the id then news of this find has not yet been publicly released i trust no nor leaked yet either amazingly unless the explanation for his being there turns out to be rocksolid i dont think secondhand reports are going to be enough on this one he had read god knew enough reports in the last two weeks to saturate him for a year bodies are your department the professor ceded this one to him with a wave of his hand and a good will clearly laced with relief above the vidplate the preliminary examination wound to its conclusion no one reached for the replay button well strictly speaking political consequences were miless department he really ought to visit solstice soon though in the planetary capital a visiting auditor was more likely to get handled hed wanted this open provincial angle of view first free of vip choreographing engineering equipment vorthys added is mine theyve also just retrieved some of the ships control systems i was waiting for im think im going to have to go back topside soon tonight miles could move out and into a hotel under the cover of that avuncular withdrawal that would be a relief if i went up now id get there just in time for bed ill wait till morning theyve also found some odd things not accounted for in inventory odd things new or old there had been tons of poorly inventoried junk equipment on the station a centurys accumulation of obsolete and wornout technology that had been cheaper to store than haul away if the probablecause techs had the unenviable task of sorting it now it must mean the highestpriority retrieval tasks were almost done new thats whats odd and their trajectories were associated with this new body i hardly ever saw a ship where somebody didnt have an unauthorized still or something operating in a closet somewhere nor a station either but our komarran boys are sharp enough to recognize a still maybe ill go up with you tomorrow miles said thoughtfully i would like that gathering up the remains of his nerve miles went to seek out madame vorsoisson this would be he guessed his last chance to ever have a conversation alone with her his footsteps echoed hollowly through the empty rooms and his tentative speaking of her name went unanswered she had left the apartment perhaps to pick up nikolai from school or something missed again damn miles took the examination recording off to the comconsole in her workroom for a more careful second runthrough and stacked up the terraforming reports from yesterday next in line with a selfconscious twinge he keyed on the machine his guilty conscience irrationally expected she might pop in at any moment to check up on him but no more likely she would avoid him altogether he vented a depressed sigh and started the vid he found little to add to the professors synopsis the mysterious eighth victim was middleaged of average height and build for a komarran if he was a komarran it was not possible at this point to tell if he had been handsome or ugly in life most of his clothing had been ripped or burned off in the disaster including any handy pockets containing traceable credit chits etcetera the shreds that were left appeared to be anonymous shipknits common wear for spacers who might have to slide into a pressure suit at a moments notice what was delaying the mans identification miles deliberately held in check the dozen theories his mind wanted to generate he longed to gallop up immediately to the orbital station where the body had been taken but his arrival in person topside to breathe over the actual investigators shoulders would only distract them and slow things down once you had delegated the best people to do a job for you you had to trust both them and your judgment what he could do without admitting impediment was go bother another useless highlevel supervisor like himself he punched up the private code for the chief of imperial securitykomarr at his office in solstice which the man had properly sent him upon the imperial auditors first arrival in komarr local space general rathjens appeared at once he looked middleaged alert and busy all appropriate qualities for his rank and post interestingly he took advantage of the latter and wore civilian komarranstyle street wear rather than imperial undress greens suggesting he was either subtly politicallyminded or preferred his comfort miles guessed the former rathjens was the impsecs top man on komarr reporting directly to duv galeni at impsec hq in vorbarr sultana yes my lord auditor what can i do for you im interested in the new corpse they found this morning topside in association apparently with our soletta disaster youve heard of it only just i havent had a chance to view the preliminary report yet i just did its not very informative tell me whats your standard operating procedure for identifying this poor fellow how soon do you expect to have anything substantive the identification of a victim of an ordinary accident topside or downside would normally be left to the local civil security since this one came within our orbit as possible sabotage were running our own search in parallel with the komarran authorities do you cooperate with each other oh yes that is they cooperate with us i understand said miles blandly how long is id likely to take if the man was komarran or if he was a galactic who came through customs at one of the jump point stations we should have something within hours if he was barrayaran it may take a little longer if he was somehow unregistered well that becomes another problem i take it he hasnt been matched with any missing person report that would have sped things up no so hes been gone for almost three weeks but nobodys missed him hm general rathjens glanced aside at some readout on his own comconsole desk do you know you are calling from an unsecured comconsole lord vorkosigan yes that was why all his and the professors reports and digests from topside were being handcarried to them from the local serifosa impsec office they hadnt expected to be here long enough to bother having impsec install their own secured machine should have im only seeking background information just now when you do find out who this fellow is how are the relatives notified normally local dome security sends an officer in person if at all possible in a case like this with potential impsec connections we send an agent of our own with them to make an initial evaluation and recommend further investigation hm notify me first please i may want to ride along and observe it could come at an odd hour thats fine he wanted to feed his backbrain on something besides secondhand data he wanted action for his restless body he wanted out of this apartment hed thought it had been uncomfortable that first night because the vorsoissons were strangers but that was as nothing to how awkward it had become now hed begun to know them very well my lord thank you general thats all for now miles cut the com with a sigh he turned again to the stack of terraforming reports starting with waste heat managements excessively complete report on dome energy flows it was only in his imagination that the gaze from a pair of outraged light blue eyes burned into the back of his head he had left the workroom door open with the thought hopethat if madame vorsoisson just happened to be passing by and just happened to want to renew their truncated conversation she might realize she had his invitation to do so the awareness that this left him sitting alone with his back to the door came to miles simultaneously with the sense that he was no longer alone at a surreptitious sniff from the vicinity of the doorway he fixed his most inviting smile on his face and turned his chair around it was nikki hovering in the frame and staring at him in uncertain calculation he returned miless misdirected smile shyly hello the boy ventured hello nikki home from school yep do you like it naw ah how was today boring what are you studying thats so dull nothin what a joy such monosyllabic exchanges must be to his parents paying for that exclusive private school miless smile twisted reassured perhaps by the glint of humor in his eye the boy ventured within he looked miles up and down more openly than he had done heretofore miles bore being looked at yes you can get used to me kiddo were you really a spy nikki asked suddenly miles leaned back brows rising now wherever did you get that idea uncle vorthys said you were in impsec galactic operations nikki reminded him ah yes that first night at the dinner table i was a courier officer do you know what that is not zactly i thought a courier was a jumpship the ship is named after the job a courier is a kind of glorified delivery man i carried messages back and forth for the imperium nikkis brow wrinkled dubiously was it dangerous it wasnt supposed to be i generally got places only to have to turn around immediately and go back i spent a lot of time en route reading composing reports and ah studying impsec would send these training programs along that you were supposed to complete in your spare time and turn back in to your superiors when you got home oh said nikki sounding a little dismayed possibly at the thought that even grownups werent spared from homework he regarded miles more sympathetically then a spark rose in his eye but you got to go on jumpships didnt you imperial fast couriers and things oh yes we went on a jumpship to come here it was a vorsmythe dolphinclass with quadruplevortex outboard control nacelles and dual normspace thrusters and a crew of twelve it carried a hundred and twenty passengers it was full up too nikkis face grew reflective kind of a barge compared to imperial fast couriers but mama got the jump pilot to let me come up and see his control room he let me sit in his station chair and put on his headset the spark had become a flame in the memory of this glorious moment miles could recognize imprinting when he saw it you admire jumpships i take it i want to be a jump pilot when i grow up didnt you ever or or wouldnt they let you a certain wariness returned to nikkis face had he been cautioned by the adults not to mention miless mutoid appearance yes let us all pretend to ignore the obvious that ought to clarify the kids worldview no i wanted to be a strategist like my da and my granda i couldnt have passed the physical for jump pilot anyway my da was a soldier it sounded boring he stayed on one base for practically the whole time i want to be an imperial pilot in the fastest ships and go places very far away from here yes miles understood that one all right it occurred to him suddenly that even if nothing else was done between now and then a military physical would reveal nikkis vorzohns dystrophy and even if it was successfully treated the defect would disqualify him for military pilots training imperial pilot miles let his brows rise in apparent surprise well i suppose but if you really want to go places the militarys not your best route why not except for a very few courier or diplomatic missions the military jump pilots just go from barrayar to komarr to sergyar and back same old routes round and round and you have to wait forever for your turn on the roster my pilot acquaintances tell me now if you really want experience going out with the komarran trade fleets would take you much farther afieldall the way to earth and beyond and they go out for much longer and there are many more berths to be had there are more kinds of ships pilots get a lot more time in the hotseat and when you get to the interesting places youre a lot freer to look around oh nikki digested this thoughtfully wait here he commanded abruptly and darted out he was back in moments cradling a box jammed with model jumpships this is the dolphin we went on he held one up for miless inspection he rummaged for another did you ride on fast couriers like this one the falcon yes a time or two a model caught miless eye automatically he slid down onto the floor beside nikki who was arranging his collection for fleet inspection good god is that an rg freighter its an antique nikki held it out miles took it his eye lighting i owned one of the very last of these when i was seventeen now that was a barge a a model like this asked nikki uncertainly no a jumpship you owned a real jumpship yourself he inhaled alarmingly mm me and a bunch of creditors miles smiled in reminiscence did you get to pilot it in normal space i mean not in jump space no i wasnt even up to piloting shuttles then i learned how to do that later at the academy what happened to the rg do you still have it oh no or well im not just sure it met with an accident in tau verde local space ramming um colliding with another ship twisted hell out of its necklin field generator rods it was never going to jump again after that so i leased it as a localspace freighter and we left it there if arde hes a jump pilot friend of mineever finds a set of replacement rods i told him he can have the old rg you had a jumpship and you gave it away nikkis eyes widened in astonishment do you have any more not at present oh look a generalclass cruiser miles reached for it my father commanded one of those once i believe do you have any betan survey ships heads bent together they laid out the little fleet on the floor nikki miles was pleased to find was wellup on all the techspecs of every ship he owned he expanded wonderfully his voice formerly shy around milestheweirdadultstranger growing louder and faster in his unselfconscious enthusiasm as he detailed his machinery miless stock rose as he was able to claim personal acquaintance with nearly a dozen of the originals for the models and add a few interesting nonclassified jumpship anecdotes to nikkis already impressive fund of knowledge but said nikki after a slight pause for breath how do you get to be a pilot if youre not in the military you go through a training school and an apprenticeship i know of at least four schools right here on komarr and a couple more at home on barrayar sergyar doesnt have one yet how do you get in apply and give them money nikki looked daunted a lot of money mm no more than any other college or trade school the biggest cost is getting your neurological interface surgically installed it pays to get the best on that one miles added encouragingly you can do anything but you have to make your chances happen there are some scholarships and indenturecontracts that can grease your way in if you hustle for them you do have to be at least twenty years old though so you have lots of time to plan oh nikki seemed to contemplate this vast span of time equal again to his whole life so far stretching out before him miles could empathize suppose someone told him he had to wait thirty more years for something he passionately desired he tried to think of something he passionately desired that he could have the field was depressingly blank nikki began to replace his models in their padded box as he nestled the falcon into its space his fingers caressed its imperial military decals he asked do you still have your impsec silver eyes no they made me give em back when i was fiwhen i resigned why dyou quit i didnt want to i had health problems so they made you be an auditor instead something like that nikki groped around for some way to continue this polite adult conversation do you like it its a little early to tell it seems to involve a lot of homework he glanced up guiltily at the stack of report disks waiting for him on the comconsole nikki gave him a look of sympathy oh too bad tien vorsoissons voice made them both jump nikki what are you doing in here get up off the floor nikki scrambled to his feet leaving miles sitting crosslegged and abruptly conscious that his recentlychilled body had stiffened up again are you pestering the lord auditor my apologies lord vorkosigan children have no manners vorsoisson entered and loomed over them oh his manners are fine we were having an interesting discussion on the subject of jump ships miles contemplated the problem of standing gracefully in front of a fellow barrayaran without any unfortunate lurch or stumble to give a false impression of disability he stretched sitting by way of preparation vorsoisson grimaced wryly ah yes the most recent obsession dont step barefoot on one of those damn things itll crippitll hurt well every boy goes through that phase i suppose we all outgrow it pick up all that mess nikki nikkis eyes were downcast but narrowed in brief resentment at this miles could see from his angle of view the boy bent to scoop up the last of his miniature fleet some people grow into their dreams instead of out of them miles murmured that depends on whether your dreams are reasonable said vorsoisson his lips twitching in rather bleak amusement ah yes vorsoisson must be fully aware of the secret medical bar between nikki and his ambition no it doesnt miles smiled slightly it depends on how hard you grow it was difficult to tell just how nikki took that in but he heard it his eyes flicked back to miles as he carried his treasure box toward the door vorsoisson frowned suspicious of this contradiction but said only kat sent me to tell everyone supper is ready go wash your hands nikki and tell your uncle vorthys miless last family dinner with the vorsoisson clan was a strained affair madame vorsoisson made herself very busy with serving admittedly excellent food her faintly harried pose as effective as a placard saying leave me alone the conversation was left to the professor who was abstracted and tien who bereft of direction spoke forcefully and without depth of local komarran politics authoritatively explaining the inner workings of the minds of people he had never so far as miles could discern actually met nikolai wary of his father did not pursue the subject of jumpships in front of him miles wondered now how he could have mistaken madame vorsoissons silence for serenity that first night or etienne vorsoissons tension for energy until seeing those brief glimpses of her animation earlier today he had not guessed how much of her personality was missing from view or how much went underground in the presence of her husband now that he knew what clues to look for he could see the faint grayness underlying tiens domepallor and spot his betraying tiny physical twitches masked as a big mans clumsiness with small objects at first miles had feared the illness was hers and hed been nearly ready to challenge tien to a duel for his failure to take immediate and massive measures to solve the problem if madame vorsoisson had been his wife but apparently tien was playing these little delaying headgames with his own condition miles knew none better the bonedeep barrayaran fear of any genetic distortion mortal embarrassment was more than a turn of phrase he didnt exactly go around advertising his own invisible seizuredisorder eitherthough hed been privately relieved to have that secret out with her not that it mattered now that he was leaving denial was tiens choice stupid though it seemed maybe the man was hoping to be hit by a meteor before his disease manifested itself miless stifled impulse toward homicide was renewed with the thought but hes chosen the same for her nikolai halfway through the main courseexquisitely aromatic vatraised fish fillets baked on a bed of garlic potatoesthe door chimed madame vorsoisson hastily rose to answer it feeling obscurely that it was bad security to send her off by herself miles followed nikolai perhaps sensing adventure tried to accompany them but was roped back to face the remains of his dinner by his father madame vorsoisson glanced at miles over her shoulder but said nothing she checked the welcome monitor beside the door its another courier oh its a captain this time usually you get a sergeant madame vorsoisson keyed open the hall door to reveal a young man in barrayaran undress greens with impsecs eyeofhorus pins on his collar do come in madame vorsoisson the man nodded to her trod inside and shifted his gaze to miles lord auditor vorkosigan im captain tuomonen i head up impsecs office here in serifosa tuomonen appeared to be in his late twenties dark haired and brown eyed like most barrayarans and a bit more trim and fit than the average desk soldier though with domepale skin he had a disk case in one hand and a larger case in the other so nodded cordially rather than offering any salutelike gesture yes general rathjens mentioned you were honored to have such a courier tuomonen shrugged impsec serifosa is a very small office my lord general rathjens directed you were to be informed as soon as possible after the new body was identified miless eye took in the secured disk case in the captains hand excellent come sit down he led the captain to the conversation circle a deeplypadded sunken bench which was the centerpiece of the vorsoissons living room like most of the rest of the furnishings it was komarran dome standardissue did madame vorsoisson sometimes feel she was camping in a hotel rather than making a home here madame vorsoisson would you ask your uncle to join us let him finish eating first though i would like to speak with administrator vorsoisson also when hes finished tuomonen called after her she nodded and withdrew eyes dark with interest but posture still selfeffacing selferasing as if she wished she might become invisible to miless eyes what do we have continued miles settling himself i told rathjens i might like to accompany and observe the first impsec contact on this matter he could pack his bag and take it along tonight and not have to come back yes my lord thats why im here your mysterious body turns out to be a local fellow from serifosa he is or was listed as an employee of the terraforming project here miles blinked not an engineer named dr radovas is it tuomonen stared at him startled how did you know wildass guess because he went missing a few weeks ago oh hell ill bet vorsoisson could have identified him at a glance or maybe not he was pretty battered hm radovass boss thought hed eloped with his tech a young lady named marie trogir her body hasnt turned up topside has it no my lord but it sounds as though we ought to start looking for it yes a full impsec search and background check i think dont assume shes deadif shes alive we surely want to question her do you need a special order from me not necessarily but ill bet it would expedite things a faint enthusiastic gleam lit tuomonens eye you have it then thank you my lord i thought youd want this he handed miles the secured case i pulled the complete dossier on radovas before i left the office does impsec keep files on every komarran citizen or was he special no we dont keep universal files but we have a search program that can pull records of good depth from the information net very quickly the first part of this is his public biography school records medical records financial and travel documents all the usual i only had time to glance over it but radovas also does have a small impsec file dating back to his student days during the komarr revolt it was closed at the amnesty is it interesting i would not draw too many inferences from it alone half the population of komarr of that age group was part of some student protest or wouldbe revolutionary group back then including my motherinlaw tuomonen waited stiffly to see what response miles would make to this tidbit ah you married a local girl did you five years ago how long have you been posted to serifosa about six years good for you yes that leaves one more barrayaran woman for the rest of us you get along well with the locals i take it tuomonens stiffness eased mostly except for my motherinlaw but i dont think thats entirely political tuomonen suppressed a small grin but our little daughter has her under complete control now i see miles smiled back at him with a more thoughtful frown he turned the case over dug his auditors seal out of his pocket and keyed it open has your analysis section redflagged anything in this for me i am serifosas analysis section tuomonen admitted ruefully his glance at miles sharpened i understand youre former impsec yourself my lord i think id rather let you read it over first before i comment miless brows twitched up did tuomonen not trust his own judgment had the arrival of two imperial auditors in his sector unnerved him or was he merely seizing the opportunity for some mutual brainstorming and what sort of dossier did you pull off the net on one miles vorkosigan and speedread before you left the office just now i did that day before yesterday actually my lord when i was notified you would be arriving in serifosa and what was your analysis of it about twothirds of your career is locked under a needtoknow seal that requires clearance from impsec hq in vorbarr sultana to access but your publicly recorded awards and decorations appear in a statistically significant pattern following supposedly routine courier missions assigned to you by the galactic affairs office at approximately five times the density of the next most decorated courier in impsec history and your conclusion captain tuomonen tuomonen smiled faintly you were never a bloody courier captain vorkosigan do you know tuomonen i believe i am going to enjoy working with you i hope so sir he glanced up as the professor entered the living room flanked by tien vorsoisson vorthys finished wiping his mouth with his dinner napkin stuffed it absently into his pocket and greeted tuomonen with a handshake then introduced his nephewinlaw as they all sat again miles said tuomonen has brought us the identification of our extra body oh good said vorthys who was the poor fellow miles watched tuomonen watch tien and say strangely enough administrator vorsoisson one of your employees dr barto radovas tiens grayness became a shade paler radovas what the hell was he doing up there the shock and horror on tiens face was genuine miles would have sworn the surprise in his voice unfeigned i was hoping you might have some ideas sir said tuomonen my god well was he aboard the station or the ship we havent determined that yet i really cant tell you that much about the man he was in soudhas department soudha never made any complaints about his work to me he got all his merit raises right to schedule tien shook his head but what the hell was he doinghe glanced worriedly at tuomonen hes not actually my employee you know he resigned several weeks ago five days before his death according to our calculations said tuomonen tiens brows wrinkled well he couldnt have been aboard that ore ship then could he how could he have gotten all the way out to the second asteroid belt and boarded it before he even left komarr he might have joined the ore ship en route said tuomonen oh i suppose thats possible my god hes married was married is his wife still here in town yes said tuomonen ill be meeting shortly with the dome civil security officer whos taking the official notification of death to her shes waited three weeks with no word from him said miles another hour cant matter much at this point i think id like to review your report before we leave captain please do my lord professor will you join me they all ended up trooping into vorsoissons study miles privately felt he could do without tien but tuomonen made no move to exclude him the report was not yet an indepth analysis but rather a wad of raw data bundled logically with hasty preliminary notes and summations supplied by tuomonen a full analysis would doubtless arrive eventually from impseckomarr hq they all pulled up chairs and crowded around the vid display after the initial overview miles let the professor follow the thread of radovass career he lost two years out of the middle of his undergraduate schooling to the revolt vorthys noted solstice university was shut down entirely for a time then but it looks like he made up some points with that twoyear postgraduate stint on escobar miles said anything could have happened to him there opined tien but not much did according to this said vorthys a bit dryly commercial work in their orbital shipyards he didnt even get a good research topic out of it solstice university did not renew his contract not a man with a gift for teaching one feels he was refused a job in the imperial science institute because of his associations in the revolt tuomonen pointed out despite the amnesty all the amnesty promised was that hed never be taken out and shot said miles a shade impatiently but he was not refused it on the basis of inadequate technical competence murmured vorthys here he goes on to a job rather below his educational level in the komarran orbital yards miles checked he had three small children by then he had to go for the money several bland years follow the professor droned on changes companies only once for a respectable increase in salary and position then he is hired bysoudha was fairly new then but hired by soudha for the terraforming project and moves downside permanently no pay raise that time professor miles said plaintively he touched his finger to air on the vid display at this juncture in the late dr radovass career doesnt this downside move strike you as odd for a man trained and experienced in jump technologies he was a fivespacemath man tuomonen smiled tightly by which miles deduced he had put his finger rather literally upon the same point that had bothered the captain vorthys shrugged there could be many compelling reasons he could have felt stale in his old work he could have grown into new interests madame radovas might have refused to live on a space station for one more day i think youll have to ask her but it is unusual said tuomonen tentatively maybe said vorthys maybe not well sighed miles after a long silence lets go do the hard part the radovass apartment proved to be about a third of the way across the city from the vorsoissons but at this hour of the evening there were no delays in the bubblecar system with tuomonen leading miles vorthys and tienwhom miles did not remember inviting but who somehow had attached himself to the expeditionentered the lobby where they found a youngish woman in a serifosa dome security uniform waiting for them none too patiently ah the dome cop is female miles murmured to tuomonen he looked back over their cavalcade good well seem less like an invading army so i hoped my lord after brief introductions all around they took a lift tube to a hallway nearly identical to every other dome residence building miles had so far seen the dome cop who was styled grouppatroller rigby rang the door chime after a pause long enough to start miles wondering is she home the door slid open the woman framed there was slender and neatly dressed appearing to miless barrayaran eye to be in her midforties which probably meant she was in her late fifties she wore the usual komarran trousers and blouse and hunched into a heavy sweater she looked pale and chilled but there was certainly nothing else in her appearance to repel any husband her eyes widened as she took in the uniformed people facing her radiating the message bad news oh she sighed wearily miles who had braced himself for hysterics relaxed a little she was going to be the underreacting type it appeared her response would likely emerge oddly and obliquely and later madame radovas the dome cop said the woman nodded my name is grouppatroller rigby i regret to inform you that your husband dr barto radovas has been found dead may we please come in madame radovass hand went to her lips she said nothing for a moment well she looked away i am not so pleased as i thought id be what happened to him that young womanis she all right may we come in and sit down rigby reiterated im afraid we are going to have to trouble you with some questions well try to answer yours madame radovass eye warily took in tuomonen in his impsec greens yes all right she gave way stepping backward and gestured them all inside her living room featured another standard conversation circle miles seated himself to one side letting tuomonen share lineofsight across from madame radovas with the grouppatroller who introduced the rest of them tien joined them folding himself onto the bench a picture of awkward discomfort professor vorthys shook his head slightly and remained standing his gaze taking in the room what happened to barto was there an accident madame radovass voice was husky barely controlled now that the news was sinking in were not certain said rigby his body was found in space apparently associated with the disaster to the soletta three weeks ago did you know he had gone topside had he said anything before he left that would shed some light on this i she looked away he didnt speak to me before he left i think he was not very brave about this he left me a note on the comconsole until i found it i thought this was an ordinary work trip may we see it tuomonen spoke for the first time i erased it sorry she frowned at him the plan for this leaving do you think it was your husbands or marie trogirs asked rigby you know all about them i see i have no idea i was surprised i dont know her voice grew sharper i wasnt consulted did he often make work trips asked rigby he went out on field tests fairly often sometimes he went to the terraforming conferences in solstice i usually went along on those her voice fluttered raggedly then came back under her control what did he take with him anything unusual asked rigby patiently just what he normally took on a long field trip she hesitated he took all his personal files thats how i first knew for sure that he wasnt coming back did you talk to anyone at his work about this absence tien shook his head but madame radovas replied i spoke to administrator soudha after i found the note trying to figure out what had gone wrong was administrator soudha helpful to you asked tuomonen not very she frowned again he didnt seem to feel it was any of his business what happened after barto resigned im sorry said vorsoisson soudha didnt tell me about that part of it ill reprimand him i didnt know and you didnt ask but much as miles would like to even he found it hard to blame tien for steering clear of what had looked to be an embarrassing domestic situation madame radovass frown at vorsoisson became almost a glower i understand you and your husband moved downside about four years ago said tuomonen it seemed an unusual change of careers from fivespace to what is effectively a form of civil engineering did he have a longtime interest in terraforming she looked momentarily nonplused barto cared about the future of komarr i we were tired of station life we wanted something more settled for the children dr soudha was looking for people for his team with different backgrounds different kinds of problemsolving experience he considered bartos station experience valuable engineering is engineering i suppose professor vorthys had been wandering gently around the room during this one ear cocked toward the conversation examining the travel mementos and portraits of children at various ages that were its principal decorations he stopped before the library case on one wall crammed with disks and began randomly examining their titles madame radovas gave him a brief curious glance due to the unusual situation in which dr radovass body was found the law requires a complete medical examination rigby went on given your personally awkward circumstances when its concluded do you wish to have his body or his ashes returned to you or to some other relative oh yes to me please there should be a proper ceremony for the childrens sake for everyones sake she seemed very close to losing control now tears standing in her eyes can you i dont know do you take care of this the family affairs counselor in our department will be glad to advise and assist you ill give you her number before we leave thank you tuomonen cleared his throat due to the mysterious circumstances of dr radovass death impsec komarr has also been asked to take an interest in the matter i wonder if we might have your permission to examine your comconsole and personal records to see if they suggest anything madame radovas touched her lips barto took all his personal files theres not much left but my own sometimes a technical examination can uncover more she shook her head but said well i suppose so she added more tartly though i didnt think impsec had to bother with my permission tuomonen did not deny this but said i like to salvage what courtesies i can madame from our crude necessities professor vorthys added in a distant tone from the far wall his hands full of disks get the library too with a flash of bewildered anger madame radovas said why do you want to take away my poor husbands library vorthys looked up and gave her a kindly disarming smile a mans library gives information about the shape of his mind the way his clothing gives information about the shape of his body the crossconnections between apparently unrelated subjects may exist only in his thoughts there is a sad disconnectedness that overcomes a library when its owner is gone i think i should have liked to meet your husband when he was alive in this ghostly way perhaps i can a little i dont see why her lips tightened in dismay we can arrange for it to be returned to you in a day or two tuomonen said soothingly is there anything you need out of it right away no but oh i dont know take it take whatever you want i dont care any more her eyes began to spill over at last grouppatroller rigby handed her a tissue from one of her many uniform pockets and frowned at the barrayarans tien shifted uncomfortably tuomonen remained blandly professional taking her outburst for his cue the impsec captain rose and carried his case over to the comconsole in the corner by the dining ell opened it and plugged an impsec standard black box into the side of the machine at vorthyss gesture rigby and miles went to assist him in removing the library case intact from the wall and sealing it for transport tuomonen after sucking dry the comconsole ran a scanner over the library which miles estimated contained close to a thousand disks and generated a vidreceipt for madame radovas she crumpled the plastic flimsy into the pocket of her gray trousers without looking at it and stood with her arms crossed till the invaders assembled to depart at the last moment she bit her lip and blurted administrator vorsoisson there wont be will i get will there be any of the normal survivors benefits coming from bartos death was she in financial need her two youngest children were still in university according to tuomonens files and financially dependent on their parents of course she was but vorsoisson shook his head sadly im afraid not madame radovas the medical examiner seems to be quite clear that his death took place after his resignation if it had been the other way around this would be a much more interesting problem for impsec she gets nothing then asked miles through no fault of her own shes stripped of all normal widows benefits just because of her he deleted a few pejorative adjectives late husbands recklessness vorsoisson shrugged helplessly and turned away wait said miles hed been of damned little use to anyone today so far gregor does not approve of widows being left destitute trust me on this one vorsoisson go ahead and run the benefits through for her anyway i canthowdo you want me to alter the date of his resignation thus creating the curious legal spectacle of a man resigning the day after his own death by what method spirit writing no of course not simply make it by an imperial order there are no places on the forms for an imperial order said vorsoisson taken aback miles digested this tuomonen looking faintly suffused watched with wideeyed fascination even madame radovass eyebrows crimped with bemusement she looked directly at miles as if seeing him for the first time at last miles said gently a design defect you shall have to correct administrator vorsoisson tiens mouth opened on some other protest but then intelligently closed professor vorthys looked relieved madame radovas her hand pressed to her cheek in something like wonder said thank you lord vorkosigan after the usual ifyouthinkofanythingmorecallthisnumber farewells the herd of investigators moved off down the hallway vorthys handed tien the library case to lug back at the buildings entrance lobby the grouppatroller prepared to go her own way what if anything does impsec want us to do now she asked tuomonen dr radovass death seems out of serifosas jurisdiction close relatives are automatically suspects in a mysterious death but shes been here the whole time i dont see any causal chain to that body in space neither do i at present tuomonen admitted for now continue with your normal procedures and send my office copies of all your reports and evidence files i dont suppose youd care to return the favor judging by the twist of her lips rigby thought she knew the answer ill see what i can do if anything pertinent to dome security turns up tuomonen promised guardedly rigbys brows rose at even this limited concession from impsec im going to have to go back topside tomorrow morning said vorthys to tuomonen i am not going to have time to do a thorough examination of this library myself i shall have to trouble impsec for it im afraid tuomonen his eye taking in the thousanddisk case looked momentarily appalled miles added quickly on my authority requisition a highlevel analyst from hq for that job one of the basement boffins with engineering and math certification i thinkright professor yes indeed the best man you can get said vorthys tuomonen looked very relieved what do you want him to look for my lord auditor i dont quite know said the professor thats why i want an impsec analyst eh essentially i want him to generate an independent picture of radovas from this data which we may compare with impressions from other sources later a candid view of the shape of the mind inside this library mused miles i see im sure you do talk to the man miles you know the kinds of things they do and the kinds of things we want certainly professor they turned the library case over to tuomonen and grouppatroller rigby took her leave it was approaching komarran midnight ill take all this lot back to my office then said tuomonen looking at his assorted burdens and call hq with the news how much longer do you expect to be staying in serifosa lord vorkosigan im not sure ill stay on and have a talk with soudha and radovass other colleagues at least before i go up again i ah think ill move my things to a hotel tomorrow after the professor goes up you are welcome to the hospitality of my home lord vorkosigan said tien formally and very unpressingly thank you anyway administrator vorsoisson who knows i may be ready to follow on topside as early as tomorrow night well see what turns up id appreciate it if youd keep my office apprised of your movements said tuomonen it was of course your privilege to order no close security upon your person lord vorkosigan but now that your case seems to have acquired a local connection id strongly request you reconsider that impsec guards are generally charming fellows but i really like not tripping over them every time i turn around miles replied he tapped the impsec issue chronocomm link which looked oversized strapped around his left wrist lets stick with our original compromise for now ill yelp for help if i need you i promise as you wish my lord said tuomonen disapprovingly is there anything else you need not tonight said vorthys yawning i need all this to make sense i need half a dozen eager informers i want to be alone in a locked room with marie trogir and a hypo of fastpenta i wish i might fastpenta that poor bitter widow even rigby would require a court order for such an invasive and offensive step miles could do it on whim and his borrowed imperial voice if he didnt mind being a very obnoxious lord auditor indeed the justification was simply not yet sufficient but soudha had better watch his step tomorrow miles shook his head no get some sleep eventually tuomonen smiled wryly good night my lords administrator they left the widows building in opposite directions chapter seven ekaterin halfdozed curled on the sunken living room couch waiting for the men to return she pushed back her sleeves and studied the deep bruises darkening on her wrists in the pattern of lord vorkosigans grip she was not normally very bodyconscious she thought she watched peoples faces giving a bare glance to anything below the neck beyond the social language of clothing this not aversion screening seemed a mere courtesy and a part of her sexual fidelity as automatic as breathing so it was doubly disturbing to find herself so very aware of the little man and probably very rude as well given the oddness of his body vorkosigans face once shed penetrated his first wary opacity was well charming full of dry wit only waiting to break into open humor it was disorienting to find that face coupled with a body bearing a record of appalling pain was it some kind of perverse voyeurism that her second reaction after shock had been a suppressed desire to persuade him to tell her all the stories about his war wounds not from around here those hieroglyphs carved in his flesh had whispered exotic with promise and i have survived want to know how yes i want to know how she pressed her fingers to the bridge of her nose as if she might press back the incipient headache gathering behind her eyes her body jolted at the faint snick and shirr of the hall door opening but familiar voices tiens and her uncles reassured her it was only the expected return of the informationhunting party she wondered what strange prey they had made a prize of she sat up and pushed down her sleeves it was well after midnight tuomonen was no longer with them she found to her relief as she rounded the corner into the hallway she could lock her household down for the night like a proper chatelaine tien looked tense vorkosigan looked tired and uncle vorthys looked the same as ever vorkosigan was murmuring i trust it goes without saying vorsoisson that tomorrow will be a surprise inspection certainly my lord auditor did you find out anything interesting ekaterin inquired generally resetting the lock behind them mm madame radovas had no suggestions as to how her wandering husband had wandered into our soletta wreck said uncle vorthys id been hoping she might its so sad they had seemed like such a nice couple the few times i met them well you know middleaged men tien shrugged reprovingly clearly excluding himself from the class ah tien why couldnt you be the one to run off with a younger richer woman maybe youd be happier you could scarcely be less happy why does your one virtue have to be fidelity as far as she knew anyway though she had wondered during that thankfullyover weird period when hed been accusing her why an act she found unthinkable had so obsessed him maybe he didnt find it so unthinkable at all she hardly had the energy to care she offered a latenight snack an invitation only uncle vorthys accepted and they all parted company for their respective sleeping quarters by the time her uncle had finished eating and said good night and she tidied up and made her way to her own bedroom checking on nikolai on the way tien was already in bed on his side with his eyes closed not sleeping yet he had a very distinctive nearsnore when he was truly asleep when she slipped in beside him he rolled over and flung his arm over her and snugged her in tight he does love me in some inept way the thought almost made her want to weep yet what other human connections did tien have aside from her and nikolai his distant mother remarried and the ghost of his dead brother tien clutched her at night sometimes like a drowning man clutching his log if there was a hell she hoped tiens brother was in it a vor hell he had done the proper thing oh yes he had cutting out his own mutation and setting an example for tien impossible toso to speaklive up to tien had tried to emulate him twice early on and once later running up to suicide attempts so halfhearted as to barely qualify as gestures the first two times she had been utterly terrified for a period she had believed her loyalty and dependency were the only things holding him to life by the third she was numb much more of this and she wouldnt be human at all she felt barely human now hoping to pretend her way to the real thing she let her breathing slow and feigned sleep after a time tien who was no more asleep than she got up and went to the bathroom but instead of returning to bed he plodded quietly across the bedroom and out toward the kitchen maybe hed changed his mind about that snack would he like it if she heated him some milk with brandy and spices in it it was an old family recipe and remedy her greataunt had brought to south continent comfortdrink for a visiting sick niece though the larger of the generous portions had always somehow seemed to find its way into the old ladys own cup ekaterin smiled in memory and padded after tien not the refrigerator but the kitchen comconsole terminal made the only faint light ahead of her she paused in the doorway puzzled in her parents household the only allowable reason to call anyone at this hour of the night was to announce either a birth or a death a rule shed found she had internalized what the hell was radovass body doing up there tien his back to her spoke hoarsely and lowly to the torso over the vidplate startled ekaterin recognized his subordinate administrator soudha soudha was not as she would have expected in pajamas but still dressed for the day working this late at home well engineers were like that she drew back a little more into the shadows in the hallway you told me hed quit he did said soudha its not our problem what happened to him afterward the hell its not were going to have frigging impsec all over the department tomorrow the real thing not just a vip tour we can run around in circles and feed dinner and wave goodbye to i could see tuomonen getting this shittyeyed look just thinking about it well handle them go back to bed vorsoisson lord auditor vorkosigan told you pointblank he wanted to make a surprise inspection tien he speaks with the emperors voice what are you doing she began to breathe through her mouth soundlessly starting to feel sick to her stomach theyre going to find out all about your sweet little scheme and then well all be in it to our eyebrows said tien no they wont were tight in town just keep them away from the experiment station and well grease them in and out without a squeak the experiment station is a hollow shell you havent got a department except in the files what if they want to interview one of your ghost employees such as yourself soudhas mouth twisted in a thin smile relax i am not going down with you you think you have a choice soudha snorted look itll be all right they can audit all day long and all theyll find is a lot of columns that add perfectly lena foscol in accounting is the most meticulous thief ive ever met were so far ahead of them theyll never catch up soudha theyre going to ask to interview people who dont exist then what gone on vacation out on field work we can stall for how long and then what go to bed vorsoisson and stop twitching goddammit ive had two imperial auditors in my house for the last three days he stopped and took a gulping breath soudha offered him a sympathetic shrug tien went on again in a lowered tone thats another thing i need an advance on my stipend i need another twenty thousand marks and i need it now now oh sure with impsec looking on no doubt vorsoisson you are gibbering dammit i have to have the money or else or else what or else youre going to impsec and turn yourself in look tien soudha ran his hands through his hair in a harried swipe lie low keep your mouth shut be sweet like sugar to the nice impsec lads give them to me and well handle them lets just take this one day at a time all right soudha i know you can produce the twenty thousand there has to be at least fifty thousand marks a month flowing out of your departments budget and into your pockets from the dummy employees alone and god knows how much from the rest of itthough im sure your pet accountant does what if they decide to fastpenta her ekaterin stepped backward her bare feet seeking silence from the floor near the wall dear god what has tien done now it was all too easy to fill in the blanks embezzlement and bribery at the very least and on a grand scale how long has this been going on the muffled voices from the kitchen exchanged a few more curt words and the blue reflection from the holovid winked out leaving the hallway obliquely lit only by the amber lights in the park outside heart pounding ekaterin slipped back down the hall into her bathroom and locked its door she quickly flushed the commode and stood trembling at the sink staring at her dim reflection in the glass the faint nightlight made drowned sparks in her dilated eyes after another minute the bed creaked as tien made his way back into it she waited a long time but when she crept out he was still awake hm he said muzzily as she slid under the covers again not feeling too well she muttered truthfully poor kat something you ate you think not sure she curled up away from him not having to pretend the sick ache in her belly take something eh if youre batting around all night neither of us will get any sleep ill see i must know after a time she added did you get anything arranged about our galactic trip today god no much too busy not too busy to complete the transfer of her funds to his own account shed noticed would you like me to take over making all the arrangements theres no reason you should carry all that burden i have plenty of time ive already researched offworld medical facilities not now kat we can deal with this later next week after your uncle goes she let it drop staring into the darkness whatever it is he needs twenty thousand marks for its not to fulfill his word to me eventually he slept about two hours ekaterin watched the time ooze by black and slow as tar i must know and after you know then what will you deal with it later too she lay waiting for the dawns light the light is broken remember the routine of dealing with nikolais needs steadied her in the morning uncle vorthys left very early to catch his orbital flight will you be coming back down she asked him a little wanly helping him on with his jacket in the vestibule i hope i might but i cant promise this investigation has already gone on longer than i expected and has taken some peculiar turns i really have no idea how long it will take to finish up he hesitated if it drags on beyond the end of the term at the district university perhaps the professora might come out to join me for a time would you like that not trusting herself to speak she nodded good good he seemed about to say more but then just shrugged and smiled and hugged her goodbye she managed to evade almost all contact with tien and vorkosigan by accompanying nikki to school in the bubblecar an escort he scorned and taking the long route home as she had hoped the apartment was empty on her return she washed down more painkillers with more coffee then with reluctant steps entered tiens office and sat before his comconsole i wish id taken lord vorkosigan up on his offer to teach me how to do this her outrage at the mutie lord yesterday in the bubblecar now seemed to her all out of proportion misplaced how much could her intimate knowledge of tien make up for her lack of training in this sort of snooping not enough she suspected but she had to try get started you are deliberately delaying no i am desperately delaying she keyed on the comconsole tiens financial accounts on this his personal machine were not locked under a code seal income matched his salary outgo when all the routine outgo was accounted for the amount left over should have been a modest respectable savings tien did not indulge himself with unshared luxuries but the account was almost empty several thousand marks had disappeared without trace including the transfer she had made to him yesterday morning no waitthat transfer was still on the list hastily entered not erased or hidden yet and it was a transfer not an expenditure to a file that had appeared nowhere else she followed its transfer marker to a hidden account the comconsole produced a palmlock form above the vidplate when she and tien had first set up their accounts on komarr less than a year ago they had taken prudent thought or one or the other parent being temporarily disabled each had emergency access to the others accounts had tien set this up entirely separately or as a daughtercell of his larger financial program letting the machine do the work for him maybe impsec covert ops doesnt have all the advantages she thought grimly and placed her right hand in the light box if only you were willing to betray a trust why the most amazing range of possible actions opened up to you so did the file she took a deep breath and started reading by far the largest portion of what was under the seal turned out to be a huge research clipfile much like her own on the subject of vorzohns dystrophy but tiens new obsession it appeared was komarran trade fleets komarrs economy was founded of course on its wormholes and providing services to the trade ships of other worlds that passed through them but once you had amassed all those profits how to reinvest them there were after all a physically limited number of wormholes in komarr local space so komarr had gone on to develop its own trade fleets going out into the wormhole nexus on long complicated circuits of months or even years and returning sometimes with fabulous profits and sometimes not stories of all the best most legendary returns were highlighted in tiens files the failures admittedly fewer in number were brushed aside tien was nothing if not an optimist always every day was going to bring him his lucky break the shot that would take him directly to the top with no intervening steps as if he really believed that was how it was done some of the fleets were closely held to the famous family corporations komarrs oligarchy such as the toscanes others sold shares on the public market to any komarran who cared to place his bet almost every komarran did at least in a small way shed heard one barrayaran bureaucrat joke that it replaced the need for most other sorts of gambling in the komarran state and when on komarr do as the komarrans do with dread in her heart she switched to the financial portion of the file where in gods name did tien get a hundred thousand marks to buy fleet shares his salary was barely five thousand marks a month and thenhaving done sowhy had he put all hundred thousand on the same fleet she turned her attention to the first question which was at least potentially answerable with reference to facts of record without requiring psychological theory it took her some time to break the credit stream apart into its various sources the partial answer was hed borrowed sixty thousand marks on short term at a disturbingly high interest rate secured with his pension fund and forty thousand marks worth of fleet shares hed bought withwhat with money that came from nowhere apparently from soudha was that what he had meant by a ghost employee ekaterin read on the fleet upon which tien had placed his borrowed bet had departed with much hype and fanfare shares had been trading on the secondary market at rising prices for weeks after it had departed komarr tien had even made a multicolored graph to track his electronic gains then the fleet had encountered disaster an entire ship cargo and crew lost hideously to a wormhole mishap the fleet now unable to complete many of its planned trade chains that had been based in the lost cargo had rerouted and come home early tail between its imaginary legs some fleets returned two for one to their investors though the average was closer to ten percent the golden voyage of marat galen in the previous century was famous for having returned a fabulous fortune of a hundred to one for every share its investors had purchased founding at least two new oligarchic clans in the process tiens fleet however had returned a loss of four for one with his twentyfive thousand marks of residue ekaterins four thousand marks his personal savings and his meager pension fund tien had been placed to pay back only twothirds of his loan now due pressingly overdue apparently judging from the aggressivelyworded dunning notices accumulating in the file when he had cried to soudha that he needed twenty thousand marks now tien had not been exaggerating she could not help calculating how many years it would take to scrimp twenty thousand marks from her household budget what a nightmare it was almost possible to feel sorry for the man except for the little problem of the origin of that magical first forty thousand marks ekaterin sat back and rubbed her numb face she had a horrible feeling she could guess the hidden parts of this whole chain of reasoning this apparently complex and deeply entrenched scam in the terraforming project had not she thought originated with tien all his previous dishonesties had been petty wrong change not returned a little padding here and there on expense reports the usual minor erosion of character almost every adult suffered in weak moments but not grand theft soudha had been here in his job for over five years this was surely a homegrown komarran crime but tien newly made head of the serifosa sector had perhaps stumbled upon it and soudha had bought his silence so had the previous barrayaran administrator whom tien had replaced been on the take as well a question for impsec to be sure but tien was in far over his head and must have realized it hence the gamble with the trade fleet shares if the fleet had returned four for one instead of the other way around tien would have been placed to return his bribe make restitution get out from under had some such panicked thought been in the back of his mind and if he had been lucky instead of unlucky would the impulse have survived to become reality and if tien had pulled a hundred thousand marks out of his hat and told you he won them on trade fleet shares would you have asked the first question about their origin or would you have been overjoyed and thought him a secret genius she sat now bent over aching in every part of her body up her back her neck inside and outside her head in her heart her eyes were dry a vor womans first loyalty was supposed to be to her husband even unto treason even unto death the sixth countess vorvayne had followed her husband right up to the stocks in which he had been hung to die for his part in the saltpetre plot and sat at his feet in a hunger strike and died in fact a day before him of exposure great tragic story that oneone of the best bloody melodramas from the history of the time of isolation theyd made a holovid of it though in the vid version the couple had died at the same moment as if achieving mutual orgasm has a vor woman no honor of her own then before tien entered my life did i not have integrity all the same yes and i laid it on my marriage oath rather like buying all your shares in one fleet if tien had been afflicted with some great misguided political passionthrown in his lot with the wrong side in vordarians pretendership whateverif he had followed his convictions she might well have followed him with all good will but this was not allegiance to some greater truth or even to some grandly tragic mistake it was just stupidity piled on venality it wasnt tragedy it was farce it was tien all over but if there was any honor to be regained by turning her own sick husband over to the authorities she surely did not see it either if i grow much smaller trying to keep my height under his i believe i must soon disappear altogether but if she was not a vor woman what was she to step away from her oathsworn place at tiens side was to step across a precipice into the dark naked of any identity at all it was what did they call it a window of opportunity if she left before the crisis broke before this whole hideous mess came out in some public way she would not be deserting tien in his hour of greatest need would she ask your soldiers heart woman is deserting the night before the battle any better than deserting in the heat yet if she did not go she tacitly acquiesced to this farce only ignorance was innocence was bliss knowledge was anything but power no one else would save her no one else could and even to open her lips and whisper help was to choose tiens destruction she sat still as stone in silence for a very long time chapter eight captain tuomonen arranged to rendezvous with miles and tien in the lobby of the vorsoissons residence building rather than at the terraforming project offices a blandly sociable gesture that did not fool miles for a moment the imperial auditor was to be saddled with an impsec guard whether hed ordered one or not it appeared miles almost looked forward to seeing the test of tuomonens polite ingenuity this security determination was doubtless going to demonstrate at the bubblecar platform across the park miles seized the opportunity to shunt tien into another car and claim a private one for himself and tuomonen the better to decant the nights news from him a few early morning commuters crowded in with the administrator and his car slid away into the tubes but as soon as the next pair of komarrans already hesitant at the sight of the green imperial uniform got close enough to make out the impsec eyes on the captains collar they sheered off hastily from any attempt to join miless little party do you always get a bubblecar to yourself miles inquired of tuomonen as the canopy closed and the car began to move when im in uniform works like a charm tuomonen smiled slightly but if i want to eavesdrop on serifosans i make sure to wear civvies ha so whats the status on radovass library this morning i dispatched one of the compound guards last night to handcarry it to hq in solstice solstice is three time zones ahead of us their analyst should have started on it by now good miless brow wrinkled compound guards um just how big is impsec serifosa captain tuomonen well theres myself my desk sergeant and two corporals we keep the data base coordinate information flow to hq and provide support for any investigators hq sends out on special projects then there is my lieutenant who commands the guards at the sector subconsulate compound he has a unit of ten men to cover security there the imperial counselor was how the barrayaran viceroy of komarr was styled in deference to local custom miless incognito arrival in serifosa had excused him or so hed chosen to pretend from a courtesy call on the counselors serifosa sector regional deputy only ten men for around the clock all week im afraid so tuomonen smiled wryly not much goes on in serifosa my lord it was one of the least active domes in the komarr revolt a tradition of political apathy it has since maintained it was the first sector to have its occupying imperial garrison withdrawn one of my komarran inlaws facetiously blames the lack of urban renewal in the domes central section on the previous generations failure to arrange for it to have been leveled by imperial forces that aging and decrepit area was visible now in the distance as the car reached the top of an arc and bumped into an intersecting tube they rotated and began to descend toward serifosas newer rim stillapathetic or nothow do you stay on top of things i have a budget for paid informers we used to pay them on a pieceworkbasis till i discovered that when they had no real news to sell theyd make some up so i cut their numbers in half and put the best ones on a parttime regular salary instead we meet about once a week and i give them a little security workshop and we have a gossip swap i try to get them to think of themselves as lowlevel civilian analysts rather than merely informers it seems to have significantly helped the reliability of my information flow i see do you have anyone planted in the terraforming project no unfortunately terraforming is not considered securitycritical i do have people at the shuttleport in the locks district in the dome police and a few in the local dome government offices we also cover the power plant atmosphere cycling and water treatment both independently and in cooperation with local authorities they check their job applicants for criminal records and psychological instability we check them for potentially dangerous political associations terraforming has always been just too damn far down the list for my budget to cover i will say its employment background check standards are among the lowest in the civil service hm wouldnt that policy tend to concentrate the disaffected tuomonen shrugged many intelligent komarrans still do not love the imperium they have to do something for a living to qualify for the terraforming project it is perhaps enough that they love komarr they have simply no political motivation for sabotage there barto cared about the future of komarr his widow had said might radovas have been among the disaffected and if he were so what miles frowned in puzzlement as the car pulled into the stop in the station beneath the terraforming project offices as instructed tien vorsoisson was waiting for them on the platform he escorted them as before up through the atrium of his building to the floors of his domain though a few doors were open on early morning activity in various departments as they passed they were the first to arrive in vorsoissons office do you have any preference as to how to divide this up miles asked tuomonen staring around meditatively as vorsoisson brought up the lights i managed to squeeze in a short interview with andro farr this morning said tuomonen he gave me some names of marie trogirs particular acquaintances at work i believe id like to start with them good if you want to start with trogir ill start with radovas and we can meet in the middle i want to begin by interviewing his boss soudha i believe administrator vorsoisson certainly my lord auditor do you wish to use my office no i think i want to see him in his own territory ill take you downstairs then ill be at your disposal in just a moment captain tuomonen tuomonen seated himself at vorsoissons comconsole and eyed it thoughtfully take your time administrator vorsoisson with a worried look over his shoulder led miles down one flight to the department of waste heat management soudha had not yet arrived miles dispatched tien back to tuomonen then circled the engineers office slowly examining its decor and contents it was a rather bare place perhaps the department head had another more occupied work area out at his experiment station the book rack on the wall was sparsely filled mostly with disks on management and technical references there were works on space stations and their construction to be sure close cousins of domes but unlike radovass library no more specialized texts on wormholes or fivespace math than might be residue from soudhas university days a heavy tread announced the rooms owner the curious look on soudhas face to find his office open and lit as he entered gave way to understanding as he saw miles ah good morning lord auditor vorkosigan good morning dr soudha miles replaced the handful of disks in their former slots soudha looked a bit tired perhaps he was not a morning person he gave miles a weary smile of greeting to what do i owe the honor of this visit he muffled a yawn pulled a chair up near his desk and gave miles a gesture of invitation to it can i get you some coffee no thank you miles sat and let soudha settle himself behind his comconsole desk i have some unpleasant news soudhas face composed itself attentively barto radovas is dead he watched for soudhas response soudha blinked his lips parting in dismay thats a shock i thought he was in good health for his age was it his heart oh my poor trogir no ones health stands up to exposure to vacuum without a pressure suit regardless of their age miles decided not to include the details of the corpses massive trauma for now his body was found in space soudha glanced up his brows rising do they think it has some connection to the soletta accident then or why else would miles be taking an interest right perhaps have theywhat about marie trogir soudhas lips thinned thoughtfully you didnt say she shes not been found or not yet the probablecause crews are continuing search sweeps topside and impsec is now looking everywhere else their next task of course is to try to trace the couple from the time and place they were last seen which was several weeks ago and here apparently well be requesting the cooperation of your department of course certainly this is this is really a very horrifying turn of events i mean regardless of ones opinion of the way they chose to pursue their personal choices and what is your opinion dr soudha id really like to get a sense of the man and of trogir do you have any ideas soudha shook his head i confess this turn in their relationship took me by surprise but i dont pry into my employees private lives so youve said but you worked closely with the man for five years what were his outside interests his politics his hobbies his obsessions i soudha shrugged in frustration i can give you his complete work record radovas was a quiet sort of fellow never made trouble did firstrate technical work yes why did you hire him waste heat management does not appear to have been his previous specialty oh he had a great deal of station expertiseas you may know getting rid of excess heat topside is a standard engineering challenge i thought his technical experience might bring some new perspectives to our problems and i was right i was very pleased with his worksection two of the reports i gave you yesterday was mostly his if you would like to examine them to get a real sense of the man power generation and distribution hydraulics in section three was mostly mine the basis of heat exchange through liquid transfer is most promising ive looked over your report thanks soudha looked startled all of it i had really understood dr vorthys would be wanting it im afraid its a bit thick on the technical detail oh sure i speedread all two hundred thousand words before bed last night miles smiled blandly i accept your evaluation of dr radovass technical competence but if he was so good why did he leave was he bored happy frustrated why did this change in his personal circumstances lead to change in his work i dont see a necessary connection for that said soudha im afraid you will have to ask marie trogir i strongly suspect the driving force in this peculiar decision came from her though they both resigned and left together she had far less to lose leaving here in pay and seniority and status tell me more about her well i truly cant barto hired her himself and worked with her on a daily basis she barely came to my attention her technical ability appears to have been adequatealthough come to think of it those evaluations were all supplied by barto i dont know soudha rubbed his forehead this is all pretty upsetting barto dead why the distress in his voice seemed genuine to miless experienced ear but his shock appeared more surprise than the deep grief from loss of a close friend miles would perhaps have to look elsewhere for the insights into radovas he now sought id like to examine dr radovass office and work areas oh im afraid his office was cleared and reassigned have you replaced him not yet im still collecting applications i hope to start interviewing soon radovas must have been friends with somebody i want to speak with his coworkers of course my lord auditor when would you like me to set up appointments i thought id just drop in soudha pursed his lips several of my people are on vacation and several more are out at the experiment station running a small test this morning i dont expect them to be done before dark but i can get you started with the people here and have some more in by the time youre done with the first all right with the air of a man throwing a sacrifice to the volcano god soudha called in two subordinates whom miles interviewed one at a time in the same conference chamber theyd used day before yesterday for the vip briefing arozzi was a younger man scarcely older than miles an engineer who was temporarily scrambling to take over radovass abandoned duties and perhaps he hinted hoping for promotion into the dead mans shoes would my lord auditor like to see some of his work no he had not been close friends with his senior no the office romance had been a surprise to him but then radovas had been a private sort of fellow very discreet trogir had been a bright woman bright and beautiful arozzi had no trouble appreciating what radovas had seen in her what had she seen in radovas he had no idea but then he wasnt a woman radovas dead dear god no he had no idea what the man had been doing topside maybe the couple had been trying to emigrate cappell the departments resident mathematician was hardly more useful he was a bit older than arozzi and a trifle more cynical he took in the news of radovass death with less change of expression than either arozzi or soudha he hadnt been close to radovas or trogir either not on a social basis though he worked often with the engineer yes checking calculations devising projections hed be glad to show my lord auditor a few thousand more pages of his work no what was trogir like wellenough looking he supposed but rather sly look what shed done to poor radovas eh did he think trogir might be dead as well no women were like cats they landed on their feet no hed never actually experimented with testing that old saying on live cats he didnt have any pets himself nor a wife no he didnt want a kitten thank you for the offer my lord auditor miles met again with tuomonen at lunchtime over mediocre cafeteria food in the executive dining room off the buildings atrium the displaced executives were forced to go elsewhere they exchanged reports on their mornings conversations tuomonen hadnt found any breakthroughs either no one expressed a dislike of trogir but she seems damned elusive tuomonen noted the waste heat department has a reputation for keeping itself to itself apparently the one woman in waste heat who was supposed to be her friend didnt have much to say i wonder if i ought to get a female interrogator mm maybe though i thought komarrans were supposed to be more egalitarian about such things maybe a komarran female interrogator miles sighed dyou know that according to the latest statistics half of the barrayaran women who take advanced schooling on komarr dont go home again theres a small group of alarmist bachelors who are trying to get the emperor to deny them exit visas gregor has declined to hear their petition tuomonen smiled slightly well theres more than one solution to that problem yes how have your komarran inlaws taken the announcement of the emperors betrothal to the toscane heiress some of them think its romantic some of them think its sharp business practice on emperor gregors part coming from komarrans thats a warm compliment by the way technically gregor owns the planet sergyar you might point that out to anyone who theorizes hes marrying laisa for her money tuomonen grinned yes but is sergyar a liquid asset only in the sense of imperial funds gurgling down the drain according to my father but thats an entire other set of problems and what do the barrayaran expatriates around here think of the marriage in general its favored tuomonen smiled dryly into his coffee cup five years ago my colleagues thought i was cutting my career throat by my own marriage id never get promoted out of serifosa they said now i am suspected of secret genius and theyve taken to regarding me with wary respect i think its best if i be amused hen you are a wise man captain miles finished off a starchy and gelid square of pastaandsomething and chased it with the last of his cooling coffee so what did trogirs friends think of radovas well hes certainly managed to give a consistent impression of himself nice conscientious guy didnt make waves kept to waste heat his elopement a surprise to most one woman thought it was your math fellow cappell who was sweet on trogir not radovas he sounded more sour than sweet to me frustrated perhaps miless backbrain sketched a nice straightforward scenario of jealous murder involving pushing radovas out an airlock on a trajectory that only just by coincidence matched that of some soletta debris you can wish and anyway it seemed more logical that any homicidal maniac wishing to clear a path to trogirs side ought to have started with andro farr and what the hell did any of this tragic romance have to do with an ore freighter swinging off course and smashing into the soletta array anyway unless the jealous maniac was andro farr the serifosa dome police were supposed to be looking into that possibility tuomonen grunted i will say i got more of a sense of trogirs personality from the few minutes i spent with farr than i have from the rest of this crew all morning i want to talk with him again i think i want to go topside dammit but whatever the end of the story is up there it certainly has to have begun here well onward i guess soudha supplied miles with more human sacrifices in the form of employees called back from the experiment station they all seemed more interested in their work than in office gossip but perhaps miles reflected that was an observereffect by late afternoon miles was reduced to amusing himself wandering around the project offices and terrorizing employees by taking over their comconsoles at random and sampling data and occasionally emitting ambiguous little hm noises as they watched him in fearful fascination this lacked even the challenge of dissecting madame vorsoissons comconsole since the governmentissue machines all opened everything immediately to the overrides in his auditors seal regardless of their security classification he mainly learned that terraforming was an enormous project with a centurieslong scientific and bureaucratic history and that any individual who attempted to sort clues through sheer mass data assimilation had to be frigging insane now delegating that task on the other hand who do i hate enough in impsec he was still pondering this question as he browsed through the files on veniers comconsole in the administrators outer office the nervous venier had fled after about the fourth hm apparently unable to stand the suspense tien vorsoisson who had intelligently left miles pretty much to his own devices all day poked his head around the corner and offered a tentative smile my lord auditor this is the hour at which i normally go home do you wish anything else from me departing employees had been trickling past the open doorway for the past several minutes and office lights had been going out all down the corridor miles sat back and stretched i dont think so administrator i want to look at a few more files and talk to captain tuomonen why dont you go on dont wait your dinner a mental picture of madame vorsoisson moving gracefully about preparing delectable aromatic food for her husbands return flashed unbidden in his brain he suppressed it ill be along later to collect my things or better yet or i may send one of tuomonens corporals for them give your lady wife my best thanks for the hospitality of her household there that finished that he wouldnt even have to say goodbye to her certainly my lord auditor do you ah expect to be here again tomorrow that rather depends on what turns up overnight good evening administrator good evening my lord tien withdrew quietly a few minutes later tuomonen wandered in his hands full of data disks finding anything my lord i got all excited for a moment when i found a personal seal but it turned out to be just veniers file of barrayaran jokes some of them are pretty good do you want a copy is that the one that starts out impsec officer what do you mean he got away didnt i tell you to cover all the exitsimpsec guard i did sir he walked out through one of the entrances yep and the next one goes a cetagandan a komarran and a barrayaran walked into a genetic counselors clinic tuomonen grimaced ive seen that collection my motherinlaw sent it to me ratting on her disaffected komarran comrades was she i dont think that was her intent no i believe it was more of a personal message tuomonen looked around the empty office and sighed so my lord auditor when do we break out the fastpenta ive found nothing here really miles frowned thoughtfully ive found too much of nothing here i may have to sleep on this overnight let my backbrain play with it the library analysis may provide some direction and i certainly want to see waste heats experiment station tomorrow morning before i go back topside ah captain its tempting call out the guards descend in force freeze everything full financial audit fastpenta everyone in sight turn this place upside down and shake it but i need a reason i would need a reason said tuomonen with full documentation and my career on the line if i spent that much of impsecs budget and guessed wrong but you on the other hand speak with the emperors voice you could call it a drill there was no mistaking the envy in his voice i could call it a quadrille miles smiled wryly it may come to that i could call hq have them put a flying squad on alert murmured tuomonen suggestively ill let you know by tomorrow morning miles promised i need to stop by my own office and tend to some routine matters said tuomonen would you care to accompany me my lord auditor so you can guard me at your convenience i still want to potter around here a bit theres something something thats bothering me and i havent figured out what it is yet though i would like a chance to talk to the professor on a secured channel before the evening is out perhaps when youre ready to leave you could call me and i can send one of my men to escort you miles considered refusing this ingenuous offer but on the other hand they could swing by the vorsoissons apartment and collect miless clothes on the return trip tuomonen would have his security and miles would have a minion to carry his luggage a winwin scenario and having the guard in tow would give miles an excuse not to linger all right tuomonen partially satisfied nodded and took himself off miles turned his attention to the next layer of veniers cornconsole who knew maybe there would be another joke list chapter nine ekaterin finished folding the last of lord vorkosigans clothing into his travel bag rather more carefully than their owner was wont to judging from the stirred appearance of the layers beneath she sealed his toiletries case and fitted it in then the odd gelpadded case containing that peculiar medicallooking device she trusted it wasnt some sort of impsec secret weapon vorkosigans war story of his sergeant beatrice burned in ekaterins mind as the marks on her wrists seemed to burn o fortunate man that his missed grasp had passed in a fraction of a second what if he had had years to think about it first hours to calculate the masses and forces and the true arc of descent would it have been cowardice or courage to let go of a comrade he could not possibly have saved to save himself at least hed had a command hed had responsibilities to others too how much would it have cost you captain vorkosigan to have opened your hands and deliberately let go she closed the bag and glanced at her chrono getting nikolai settled at his friends house for overnightthat first before anything elsehad taken longer than shed planned as had getting the rental company to come collect their gravbed lord vorkosigan had talked about removing to a hotel this evening but done nothing toward it when he returned with tien to find no dinner and his bed gone and his bags packed and waiting in the hall surely he would take the hint and decamp at once their goodbye would be formal and permanent and above all brief she was almost out of time and had not even begun on her own things she dragged vorkosigans bag to the vestibule and returned her workroom staring around at the seedlings and cuttings lights and equipment it was impossible to pack all that in bag she could carry another garden was going to be abandoned at least they were getting smaller and smaller shed once wanted to cultivate her marriage like a garden one of the legendary great vor parks that people came from districts away to admire for color and beauty through the changing seasons the sort that took decades to reach full fruition growing richer and more complex each year when all other desires had died shreds of that ambition still lingered to tempt her with if only i try one more time her lips twisted in bleak derision time to admit she had a black thumb for marriage plow it under surface it with concrete and be done she began as a minimum gesture to pull her library off the wall and fit it into a box the urge to cram a few of her things hastily into some shopping bag and flee before tien returned as strong but sooner or later she would have to face him because of nikki there would have to be negotiations formal plans eventually legal petitions the uncertainty of which made her sick to her stomach but she had been years coming to this moment if she could not do this now when her anger was high how could she find the strength to face the rest in colder blood she walked through the apartment staring at the objects of her life they were few enough the major furnishings had all come with the place and would stay with the place her spasmodic efforts at decoration at creating some semblance of a barrayaran home the hours of workit was like deciding what to grab in a fire only slower nothing let it all burn the sole awkward exception was her greataunts bonsaid skellytum it was her one memento of her life before tien and it was in the nature of a sacred trust to the dead keeping something that foolish and ugly alive for seventy and more years well it was a typical vor womans job she smiled bitterly and brought it off the balcony into the kitchen and began to look around for some way to transit it at the sound of the hall door opening she caught her breath and schooled her features to as little expression as possible kat tien ducked into the kitchen and stared around wheres dinner my first question would have been wheres nikolai i wonder how long it will take that thought to come to him where is lord vorkosigan he stayed on at the office hell be along later he said to take his things away oh she realized then that some tiny part of her had been hoping to conduct the impending conversation while vorkosigan was still finishing up in her workroom or something his presence providing some margin of safety of social restraint upon tien maybe it was better this way sit down tien i have to talk with you he raised dubious brows but sat at the head of the table around to her left she would have preferred to have him opposite her i am leaving you tonight what his astonishment appeared genuine why she hesitated reluctant to be drawn into argument i suppose because i have come to the end of myself only now looking back over the long draining years did she become aware of how much of her there had been to use up no wonder it had taken so long all gone now why why now at least he didnt say you must be joking i dont understand kat she could see him begin to grope not toward understanding but away from it as far away as possible is it the vorzohns dystrophy damn i knew dont be stupid tien if that was the issue id have left years ago i took oath to you in sickness and health he frowned and sat back his brows lowering is there someone else theres someone else isnt there im sure you wish there were because then it would be because of them and not because of you her voice was level utterly flat her stomach churned he was obviously shocked and beginning to shake a little this is madness i dont understand i have nothing more to say she began to rise wishing nothing more than to be gone at once away from him you could have done this over the comconsole you know no i took my oath in the flesh i will break it to pieces in the same way he rose with her and his hand closed over hers gripping it stopping her theres more to it you would know more about that than i would tien he hesitated now beginning she thought to be really afraid this might not be any safer for her hes never hit me yet ill give him that much credit part of her almost wished he had then there would have been clarity not this endless muddle what do you mean let go of me no she considered his hand on hers tight but not grinding but still much stronger than her own he was half a head taller and outweighed her by thirty kilos she did not feel as much physical fear as she had thought she would she was too numb perhaps she raised her face to his her voice grew edged let go of me a little to her surprise he did so his hand flexing awkwardly you have to tell me why or ill believe its to go to some lover i no longer care what you believe is he komarran some damned komarran goading her in the usual spot and why not it had worked before to bring her into line it halfworked still she had sworn to herself that she wasnt even going to bring up the subject of tiens actions and inactions complaint was a tacit plea for help for reform for continuation complaint was to attempt to shuffle off the responsibility for action onto another to act was to obliterate the need for complaint she would act or not act she would not whine still in that deadlevel voice she said i found out about your trade shares tien his mouth opened and shut again after a moment he said i can make it up i know what went wrong now i can make the losses up again i dont think so where did you get that forty thousand marks tien her lack of inflection made it not a question i she could watch it in his face as he ratcheted over his choice of lies he settled on a fairly simple one part i saved part i borrowed youre not the only one who can scrimp you know from administrator soudha he flinched at the name but said ingenuously how did you know it doesnt matter tien im not going to turn you in she stared at him in weariness i take no part in you anymore he paced agitated back and forth across the kitchen his face working i did it for you he said at last yes now he will attempt to make me feel guilty all my fault it was as familiar as the steps of some wellpracticed poisonous dance she watched silently all for you you wanted money i worked my tail off but it was never enough for you was it his voice rose as he tried to lash himself into a relieving selfrighteous anger it fell a little flat to her experienced ear you pushed me into taking a chance with your endless nagging and worrying so it didnt work and now you want to punish me is that it youd have been quick enough to make up to me if it had paid off he was very good at this she had to admit his accusations echoing her own dark doubts she listened to his patterned litany with a sort of detached appreciation like a torture victim gone beyond pain unbeknownst admiring the color of her own blood now he will attempt to make me feel sorry for him but im done feeling sorry im done feeling anything money money money is that what this is all about what is it that you want to buy so damned much kat your health as you may recall and nikkis future and mine as he paced sputtering his eye fell on the bright red skellytum sitting in its basin on the kitchen table you dont love me you only love yourself selfish kat you love your damned potted plants more than you love me here ill prove it to you he snatched up the pot and pressed the control for the door to the balcony it opened a little too slowly for his dramatic timing but he strode through nonetheless and whirled to face her which shall it be to go over the railing kat your precious plant or me choose she neither spoke nor moved now he will attempt to terrify me with suicide gestures this made what the fourth time around for that ploy his trump card which had always before ended the game in his favor he brandished the skellytum high me or it he watched her face waiting for her to break an almost clinical curiosity prompted her to say you just to see how he would wriggle out of his challenge but she kept silent still when she did not speak he hesitated in confusion for a moment then launched the ancient absurd thing over the side five floors up she counted the seconds in her head waiting for the crash from below it came as more of a distant sodden thump mixed with the crack of exploding pottery you ass tien you didnt even look to see if there was anyone below with a look of sudden alarm that almost made her want to laugh he peeked fearfully over the side apparently he hadnt managed to kill anyone after all for he inhaled deeply and turned back toward her taking a few steps through the open airseal door into the kitchen but not too near to her react damn you what do i have to do to get through to you dont bother she said levelly i cannot imagine anything you could do that would make me more angry than i am he had come to the end of his menu of tactics and stood a loss his voice grew smaller what do you want i want my honor back but you cannot give it to me his voice grew smaller still his hands opened in pleading im sorry about your aunts skellytum i dont know at are you sorry about grand theft and petty treason bribery and peculation i did it for you kat in eleven years she said slowly you have apparently never figured out who i am i dont understand that how you can live with someone so intimately so long and yet never know them maybe you were living with some kat holovid projection from your own mind i dont know what do you want dammit its not like i can go back i cant confess that would be public dishonor for me you nikki your uncleyou cant want that i want never to have to tell a lie again for as long as i live what you do is your problem she took a deep breath but know this whatever you do or dont do from now on had better be for yourself because it wont touch done once done for all time she was never going through this again i cani can fix it was he referring to her skellytum their marriage his crime wrong anyway in all cases when she still did not respond he blurted desperately nikolai is mine by barrayaran law interesting nikki was the one tactic he had never employed before off limits she knew then how deathly serious he knew her to be good he glanced around and added belatedly here is nikki someplace safer you cant keep him from me i can if youre in prison she didnt bother saying it aloud under the circumstances tien was perhaps unlikely to challenge her possession of nikki before the law but she wanted to keep nikolais concerns as far separated as possible from the ugliest part of this thing she would not start that war but if tien dared to do so she would finish it she watched him more coldly than ever i will fix it i can i have a plan ive been thinking about all day tien with a plan was about as reassuring as a twoyearold with a charged plasma arc no you are not to take responsibility for him anymore thats what this is all about remember let go do whatever you wish tien im going to go finish packing now wait he swung around her it disturbed her to have him between her and the door but she did not let her fear show wait ill make it up youll see ill fix it wait here with an anxious wave of his hands he made for the hall door and was gone she listened to his retreating footsteps only when she heard the faint whisper from the lift tube did she step back onto the balcony and look over far below the shattered remains of her skellytum made an irregular wet blotch on the pavement the broken scarlet tendrils looking like spattered blood a passerby was staring curiously at it after a minute she saw tien emerge from the building and stride across the park toward the bubblecar platform almost breaking into a run from time to time he twice looked back up toward their balcony over his shoulder she stepped back into the shadows he disappeared into the station every muscle of her body seemed to be spasming with tension she felt close to vomiting she returned to herto the kitchen and drank a glass of water which helped settle her breathing and her stomach she went to her work room to fetch a basket and some plastic sheeting and a trowel to go scrape the mess off the walkway five floors down chapter ten miles sat at administrator vorsoissons comconsole desk methodically reading through the files of all the employees of the waste heat department there seemed to be a lot of personnel compared to some of the other departments waste heat was definitely a favored child in the project budget presumably most of them spent the bulk of their time out at the experiment station since waste heats offices here were modest in hindsight always acute miles wished hed begun his survey of radovass life out there today where there might have been some action to observe instead of in this tower of bureaucratic boredom more he wished hed dropped in on the experiment station during their first tour well no he would not have known what to look for then and you know now he shook his head in wry dismay and brought up another file tuomonen had taken a copy of the personnel list and in due time would be interviewing most of these people unless something happened to take the investigation off in another direction such as finding marie trogirthat was the first item now on miless wish list for impsec miles shifted to ease the twinge in his back he could feel his body stiffening from sitting still in a cool room too long didnt these serifosans know they needed to waste more heat quick steps in the hallway paused and turned in at the outer office and miles glanced up tien vorsoisson a little out of breath hung a moment in his office doorway then plunged inside he was carrying two heavy jackets his own and the one of his wifes that miles had used the other day and a breath mask labeled visitor medium he smiled at miles in suppressed agitation my lord auditor so glad to still find you here miles shut down the file and regarded vorsoisson with interest hello administrator what brings you back tonight you my lord i need to talk with you right away i have to to show you something ive discovered miles opened his hand indicating the comconsole but vorsoisson shook his head not here my lord out at the waste heat experiment station ah ha right now yes tonight while everyone is gone vorsoisson laid the spare breath mask on the comconsole rummaged in a cabinet in the far wall and came up with his own personal mask he yanked the straps over his neck and hastily adjusted his chest harness to hold the supplementary oxygen bottle in place ive requisitioned a lightflyer its waiting downstairs all right now what was this going to be all about too much to hope vorsoisson had found marie trogir locked in a closet out there miles checked his own maskpower and oxygen levels indicated it was fully rechargedand slipped it on he took a couple of breaths in passing to test its correct function then slid it down out of the way under his chin and shrugged on the jacket this way vorsoisson led off with long strides which annoyed miles considerably he declined to run to keep up with the man the administrator perforce waited for him at the lift tube bouncing on his heels in impatience this time when they reached the garage sublevel the vehicle was ready it was a lessthanluxurious government issue twopassenger flyer but appeared to be in perfectly good condition miles was less certain of the driver whats this all about vorsoisson vorsoisson put his hand on the canopy and regarded miles with an intensity of expression that was almost alarming what are the rules for declaring oneself an imperial witness well various i suppose depending on the situation miles was not he realized belatedly nearly as well up on the fine points of barrayaran law as an imperial auditor ought to be he needed to do more reading i mean i dont think its exactly something one does for oneself its usually negotiated between a potential witness and whatever prosecuting authority is in charge of the criminal case and rarely since the end of the time of isolation with the importation of fastpenta and other galactic interrogation drugs the authorities no longer had to bargain for truthful testimony normally in this case the authority is you said tien the rules are whatever you say they are arent they because you are an imperial auditor uh maybe vorsoisson nodded in satisfaction raised the canopy and slid into the pilots seat with reluctant fascination miles levered himself in beside him he fastened his safety harness as the flyer lifted and glided toward the garages vehicle lock and why do you ask miles probed delicately vorsoisson had all the air of a man anxious to spill something very interesting indeed not for three worlds did miles wish to frighten him off at this point at the same time miles would have to be extremely cautious about what he promised hes your fellow auditors nephewinlaw youve just stepped onto an ethical tightrope vorsoisson did not answer right away instead powering the lightflyer up into the night sky the lights of serifosa brightened the faint feathery clouds of valuable moisture above which occluded the stars but as they shot away from the dome city the glowing haze thinned and the stars came out in force the landscape away from the dome was very dark devoid of the villages and homesteads that carpeted less climatically hostile worlds only a monorail streaked away to the southwest a faint pale line against the barren ground i believe vorsoisson said at last and swallowed i believe i have finally accumulated enough evidence of an attempted crime against the imperium for a successful prosecution i hope i havent waited too long but i had to be sure sure of what soudha has tried to bribe me im not absolutely certain that he didnt bribe my predecessor too oh why waste heat management the whole department is a scam a hollow shell im not really sure how long theyve been able to keep this bubble going they had me fooled for for months i mean a building full of equipment on a quiet day how was i supposed to know what it did or didnt do or that there werent anything but quiet days how long have you known miles bit off that question was premature just what are they doing theyre bleeding off money from the project for all i know it may have started small or by accidentsome departed employee mistakenly kept on the roster an accumulation of pay that soudha figured out how to pocket ghost employeeshis department is full of fictitious employees all drawing pay and equipment purchases for the ghost employeessoudha suborned some woman in accounting to go along with him they have all the forms right all the numbers match theyve slid it through i dont know how many fiscal inspections because the accountants hq sends out dont know how check the science only the forms who does check the science thats the thing my lord auditor the terraforming project isnt expected to produce quick results not in any immediately measurable way soudha produces technical reports all right plenty of them right to schedule but i think he mostly does them by copying other sectors previousperiod results and fudging indeed the komarran terraforming project was a bureaucratic backwater far down the barrayaran imperiums urgent list not critical a good place to park say incompetent vor second sons out of the way of their families where they could do no harm to anyone because the project was vast and slow and they would cycle out and be gone again before the damage could even be measured speaking of ghost employeeshow does radovass death connect with this alleged scam vorsoisson hesitated im not sure it does except to draw impsec down on it and burst the bubble after all he quit days before he died soudha said he quit soudha according to you is a proven liar and data artist could radovas have say threatened to expose soudha and been murdered to assure his silence but radovas was in on it for years i mean all the technical people had to know they couldnt not know they werent doing the work the reports said mm that may depend on how much of an artistic genius soudha was arranging his reports soudhas own personnel certainly suggested that he was neither stupid nor secondrate might he have cooked those records as well oh god this means im not going to be able to trust any data off any console in the whole damned department and hed wasted hours today decanting comconsoles radovas might have had change of heart i dont know said vorsoisson plaintively his glance flicked aside to miles i want you to remember i found this i turned him in just as soon as i was sure his repeated insistence on that last point hinted broadly to miless ear that his knowledge of this fascinating piece of peculation predated his assurance by a noticeable margin had soudhas bribe been not just offered but accepted till the bubble burst was miles witnessing an outbreak of patriotic duty on vorsoissons part or an unseemly rush to get soudha and company before they got him ill remember miles said neutrally belatedly it occurred to him that going off alone in the night with vorsoisson to some deserted outpost without even pausing to inform tuomonen might not be the brightest thing hed ever done still he doubted vorsoisson would be nearly this forthcoming in the impsec captains presence it might be as well not to be too blunt with vorsoisson about his chances of slithering out of this mess till they were safely back in serifosa preferably in the presence of tuomonen and a couple of nice big impsec goons miless stunner was a reassuring lump in his pocket he would check in with tuomonen via his wrist comm link as soon as he could arrange a quiet moment out of vorsoissons earshot and tell kat vorsoisson added huh what had madame vorsoisson to do with any of this lets see this evidence of yours then talk about it what youll mainly see is an absence of evidence my lord said vorsoisson a great empty facility there vorsoisson banked the lightflyer and they began to descend toward the waste heat experiment station it was well lit with plenty of outdoor floodlamps switched on automatically at dusk miles presumed and in high contrast to the surrounding dark as they drew closer miles saw that its parking lot was not deserted half a dozen lightflyers and aircars clustered in the landing circles windows glowed warmly here and there in the small office building and more lights snaked through the airsealed tubes between sections there were two big lift vans one backing now into an opened loading bay in the large windowless engineering building it looks pretty busy to me said miles for a hollow shell i dont understand said vorsoisson vegetation which actually stood higher than miless ankle struggled successfully against the cold here but it was not quite abundant enough to conceal the lightflyer miles almost told vorsoisson to douse the flyers lights and bring them down out of sight over a small rise despite the hike back it would entail but vorsoisson was already dropping toward an empty landing circle in the parking lot he landed and killed the engine and stared uncertainly toward the facility maybe maybe you had better stay out of sight at first said vorsoisson in worry they shouldnt mind me he was apparently unconscious of the world of selfrevelation in this simple statement they both adjusted their breath masks and vorsoisson popped the canopy the chill night air licked miless exposed skin above his breath mask and prickled in his scalp he dug his hands into his pockets as if to warm them touched his stunner briefly and followed the administrator a little behind him staying out of sight was one thing letting vorsoisson out of his sight was another try looking in the engineering building first miles called his voice muffled by his mask see if we can get a look at whats going on before you make contact with the ener try to speak to anyone vorsoisson veered toward the loading bays vehicle lock miles wondered if there was a chance anyone glancing out in the uncertain lighting might mistake him at first for nikolai the combination of vorsoissons dramatic mystery and his own natural paranoia was making him twitchy indeed despite a better part of his mind that calculated high odds on a harmless scenario involving vorsoisson being wildly mistaken they entered the pedestrian lock into the loading dock and cycled through the pressure differential in his ears was slight miles kept his breath mask up temporarily as they rounded the parked lift van he would call tuomonen as soon as he ditched miles skidded to a halt a moment too late to avoid being spotted in turn by the couple who stood quietly next to a floatpallet loaded with machinery the woman who had the pallets control lead in her hand as she maneuvered the silently hovering load into the van was madame radovas the man was administrator soudha they both looked up in shock at their unexpected visitors miles was torn for a moment between whacking his wristcomms screamer circuit or going for his stunner but at soudhas sudden movement toward his own vest miless combat reflexes took over and his hand dove for his pocket vorsoisson halfturned his mouth round with astonishment and the beginning of some warning cry miles would have thought ive just been led into ambush by that idiot except that vorsoisson was clearly much more surprised than he was soudha managed to get his stunner out and pointed a half second before miles did oh shit i never asked dr chenko what a stunner blast would do to my seizure stimulator the stunner beam took him full in the face his head snapped back in an agony that was mercifully brief he was unconscious before he hit the concrete floor miles woke with a stunner migraine pinwheeling behind his eyes metallic splinters of pure pain seemingly stuck quivering in his brain from his frontal lobes to his spinal column he closed his eyes immediately against the toobright glare of lights he was nauseated to the point of vomiting the realization immediately following that he was still wearing his breath mask caused his spacers training to cut in he swallowed and breathed deeply carefully and the dangerous moment passed he was cold and held upright in an awkward position by restraints pulling on his arms he opened his eyes again and looked around he was outdoors in the chill komarran dark chained to a railing along the walkway on the blank side of what appeared to be the waste heat engineering building colored floodlights positioned in the vegetation two meters below prettily illuminating the building and raised concrete walk were the source of the eyepiercing light beyond them the view was singularly uninformative the ground falling away from the building and then rising beyond it into blank barrenness the railing was a simple one metal posts set into the concrete at meter intervals and a round metal handrail running between them he was slumped to his knees the concrete hard and cold beneath them and his wrists were chainedchained yes chained the links fastened with simple metal locksto two successive posts holding him halfspreadeagled his impsec commlink was still strapped to his left wrist he could not of course reach it with his right hand or he triedhis head he twisted his wrist around to press it against the railing but the screamerbutton was recessed to prevent accidental bumps setting it off miles swore under his breath and his breath mask the mask appeared to be tightly fitted to his face and he could feel the oxygen bottle still firmly strapped to his chest under his jacketwho had fastened his jacket up to his chinbut he would have to be exquisitely careful not to jostle the mask till he had his hands free again to readjust it so had the stunner beam induced a seizure while he was unconscious or was he still working up to one his next was almost due he stopped swearing abruptly and took a couple of deep calming breaths that fooled his body not at all a couple of meters to his right he discovered tien vorsoisson similarly chained between two upright posts his head lolled forward he evidently wasnt awake yet miles tried to convince the knot of stressed terror in his solar plexus that this bit of cosmic justice was at least one bright point in the affair he smiled grimly under his mask all things considered hed rather vorsoisson were free and able to try for help better still leave vorsoisson fastened there free himself to try for help but twisting his hands in their tight chains merely scraped his wrists raw if they wanted to kill you youd be dead now he tried to convince his hyperventilating body unless of course they were sadists out for a slow and studied revenge what did i ever do to these people besides the usual offense of being barrayaran in general and aral vorkosigans son in particular minutes crept by vorsoisson stirred and groaned then fell back into flaccid unconsciousness at least assuring miles he wasnt dead yet at length the sound of footsteps on the concrete made miles turn his head carefully because of the approaching figures breath mask and padded jacket miles was not at first sure if it was a man or a woman but as it neared he recognized the curly grayblond hair and brown eyes of a woman whod been at that first vip orientation meetingit was the accountant the meticulous one whod been sure to have a duplicate copy of her departments records for miles hah foscol read the name on her breath mask she saw his open eyes oh good evening lord auditor vorkosigan she raised her voice to a good loud clarity to be sure her words penetrated the muffling of her mask good evening madame foscol he managed in return matching her tone if only he could get her talking and listening she drew her hand from her pocket and held up something glittering and metallic this is the key to your wrist locks ill set it over here out of the way she placed it carefully on the concrete walkway about halfway between miles and the administrator next to the wall of the building dont let anyone accidentally kick it over the side youd have a heck of a time finding it down there she glanced thoughtfully over the rail at the dark vegetation below implying that someone might be expected a rescue party also implying that foscol soudha and madame radovas madame radovas what is she doing heredid not expect to be around to supply the key in person when that happened she rummaged in her pocket again and came up with a data disk wrapped in protective plastic this my lord auditor is the complete record of administrator vorsoissons acceptance of bribes in the amount of some sixty thousand marks over the last eight months account numbers data trail where his money was embezzled in the first placeeverything you should need for a successful prosecution id been going to mail it to captain tuomonen but this is better her eyes crinkled in a smile at him above her breath mask she bent and taped it securely to the back of vorsoissons jacket with my compliments my lord she stepped back and dusted her hands in the gesture of a dirty job well done what are you doing miles began what are you people doing out here anyway why is madame radovas with come come lord vorkosigan foscol interrupted him briskly you dont imagine that im going to stand around and chat with you do you vorsoisson stirred groaned and belched despite the utter contempt in her eyes lingering on his huddled figure she waited a moment to be sure he wasnt going to vomit into his breath mask vorsoisson stared wearily at her blinking in bewilderment and miles had no doubt pain miles clenched his fists and jerked against his chains foscol glanced at him and added kindly dont hurt yourself trying to get loose someone will be along eventually to collect you i only regret i wont be able to watch she turned on her heel and strode away down the walk and around the corner of the building after another minute the faint sounds of a liftvan taking to the air drifted around the building but they were on the opposite side of the building to the approach from serifosa and the departing van did not cross into miless limited line of sight soudhas a competent engineer i wonder if hes set the reactor here to destroy itself was the next inspired thought to enter miles mind that would erase all the evidence vorsoisson and miles too if he timed it just right soudha might be able to take out the impsec rescue squad as well but it seemed foscol meant the evidence pinned to vorsoissons back to survive at least which argued against a scenario that would turn the experiment station into a glowing glass hole in the landscape resembling the lost city of vorkosigan vashnoi soudha and company did not seem to be thinking militarily thank god this scene seemed engineered for maximum humiliation and one could not embarrass the dead their nextofkin however miles thought of his father and shuddered and ekaterin and nikolai and of course lord auditor vorthys oh yes vorsoisson coming to full consciousness at last reared up and discovered the limits of his bonds he swore muzzily then with increasing clarity of expression and yanked his arms against their chains after about a minute he stopped he stared around and found miles vorkosigan what the hell is going on here we appear to have been parked out of the way while soudha and his friends finish decamping from the experiment station they seem to have realized their time had run out miles wondered if he ought to mention to vorsoisson what was taped to his back then decided against it the man was already breathing heavily from his struggles vorsoisson swore some more monotonously but after a bit seemed to become aware that he was repeating himself and ran down tell me more about this embezzlement scheme of soudhas miles said into the eerie silence no insect or bird chirps enlivened the komarran night and no tree leaves rustled in the faint chill breeze no further sounds came from the buildings behind them the only noise was the susurration of their breath masks powered fans filters and regulators when did you find out about it just yesterday a week ago yesterday soudha panicked i think and tried to bribe me i didnt want to embarrass kats uncle vorthys by blowing it wide open while he was here and i had to be sure before i started accusing people right and left foscol says you lie miles wasnt sure which of them he trusted least by now foscol could have invented her evidence against vorsoisson using the same skills she had apparently called on to hide soudhas thefts he would have to let the impsec forensic specialists sort it out and carefully miles simultaneously sympathized with and was deeply suspicious of vorsoissons claimed hesitation a dizzying state of mind to endure on top of a stunner migraine he had never thought of fastpenta as a medicine for headache but he wished he had a hypospray of it to jab in vorsoissons ass right now later he promised himself without fail is that all thats going on dyou think what do you mean all i dont quite if i were soudha and his group fleeing the scene of our crime they did have some lead time to prepare their retreat maybe as long as three or four weeks if they knew radovass body was likely to be found topside and what the hell was radovass body doing up there anyway i still dont have a clue longer if they kept their emergency backup plans up to date and soudha is an engineer if ever i met one hes got to have had failsafes incorporated into his schemes wouldnt it make more sense to scatter travel light try to get out of the empire in ones and twos not leave in a bunch with two liftvans full of whatever the hell they needed two liftvans to transport not their money surely vorsoisson shook his head which shifted his breath mask slightly he had to rub his face against the railing to reseat it after a few minutes he said in a small voice vorkosigan miles hoped from the humbler tone the man might be going to edge toward true confession after all yes he said encouragingly im almost out of oxygen didnt you check miles tried to bring up the image in his pulsing brain of the moment vorsoisson had snatched his breath mask out of the cabinet back in his office and donned it no he hadnt checked anything about it a fullycharged mask would support twelve to fourteen hours of vigorous outdoor activity under normal circumstances miless visitors mask had presumably been taken from a central store where some tech had the job of processing and recharging used masks before setting them on the rack ready for reuse dont forget to put your mask on the recharger vorsoissons wife had said to him and been snapped at for nagging was vorsoisson in the habit of stuffing his equipment away uncleaned in his office madame vorsoisson couldnt very well pick up after him the way she doubtless did at home at one time miles could have crushed his own fragile hand bones and drawn his hand out through a restraint before his flesh began to swell enough to trap it again hed actually done that once on a hideously memorable occasion but the bones in his hands were all sturdy synthetics now less breakable even than normal bone all that his applied strength could do was make his chafed wrists bleed vorsoissons wrists began to bleed too as he struggled more frantically against his chains vorsoisson hold still miles called urgently to him conserve your oxygen theres supposed to be someone coming go limp breathe shallowly make it last why hadnt the idiot mentioned this earlier to miles to foscol even had foscol intended this result maybe shed meant both miles and vorsoisson to die one after the other how long till the promised someone came to collect them a couple of days murdering an imperial auditor in the middle of a case was considered an act of treason worse than murdering a ruling district count and only barely short of assassinating the emperor himself nothing could be more surely calculated to send impsecs entire forces in frenzied pursuit of the fleeing embezzlers with an implacable concentration reaching potentially across decades and distance and diplomatic barriers it was a suicidal gesture or unbelievably foolhardy how much do you have left vorsoisson wriggled his chin and tried to peer down over his nose into the dim recesses of his jacket to see the top of the canister strapped there oh god i think its reading zero those things always have some safety margin stay still man try for some selfcontrol instead vorsoisson began to struggle ever more frantically he threw himself forward and backward with all his considerable strength trying to break the railing blood drops flew from the flayed skin of his wrists and the railing reverberated and bent but it did not break he pulled up his knees and then flung himself down through the meterwide opening between the posts trying to propel his full body weight against the chains they held and then his backwardscrambling legs could not regain the walkway his boot heels scraped and scrabbled on the wall his dizzied choking at the last led to vomiting inside his breath mask when it slipped down around his neck in his final paroxysms it seemed almost a mercy except for the way it revealed his distorted purpling features but the screams and pleas stopped and then the gasps and gulpings the kicking legs twitched and hung limply miles had been right vorsoisson might have had a full twenty or thirty minutes more oxygen if he had hunkered down quietly miles stood very still and breathed very shallowly and shivered in the cold shivering he recalled dimly used more oxygen but he could not make himself stop the silence was profound broken only by the hiss of miless regulators and filters and the beating of the blood in his own ears he had seen many deaths including his own but this was surely one of the ugliest the shocky shudders traveled up and down his body and his thoughts spun uselessly they kept circling back to the spuriously calm observation that a barrel of fastpenta would be no damned use to him now if he went into a convulsion and dislodged his breath mask in the process he could be well on his way to asphyxiating before he even returned to consciousness impsec would find him hanging there beside vorsoisson choked identically on his own spew and nothing was more likely to set off one of his seizures than stress miles watched the slime begin to freeze on the sagging corpses face scanned the dark skies in the wrong direction and waited chapter eleven ekaterin set down her cases next to lord vorkosigans in the vestibule and turned for one last automatic check of the premises one last patrol of her old life all lights were out all windows were sealed all appliances were off the comconsole chimed just as she was leaving the kitchen she hesitated let it go let it all go but then she reflected it might be tuomonen or someone trying to reach lord vorkosigan or uncle vorthys though she was not sure she even wanted to talk to him tonight she turned back to the machine but her hand hesitated again with the thought that it might be tien in that case i will simply cut the com if it was tien about to attempt some other plea or threat or persuasion at least it was a guarantee he was someplace else and not here and she could still walk away but the face that formed over the vidplate at her reluctant touch was that of a komarran woman from tiens department lena foscol ekaterin had only met her in person a couple of times but soudhas words over this same vidplate last night leapt to her mind lena foscol in accounting is the most meticulous thief ive ever met oh god she was one of them the background was out of focus but the woman was wearing a parka thrown open over domewear suggesting she was either on her way to or on her way back from some outside expedition ekaterin regarded her with concealed revulsion madame vorsoisson foscol said brightly without waiting for ekaterins answer she went on please come pick up your husband at the waste heat experiment station hell be waiting for you outside on the northwest side of the engineering building but what was tien doing out there at this time of night how did he get out there doesnt he have a flyer cant he get a ride back with someone else everyone else has left her smile widened and she cut the com but ekaterin raised a hand in futile protest too late drat and then after a moment damn it retrieving tien from the experiment station would be a twohour chore at least she would first have to take a bubblecar to a public flyer livery and rent a flyer since she had no authority to requisition one from tiens department shed been seriously considering sleeping on a park bench tonight just to save her pittance of funds for the uncertain days to come until she found some form of paying work except that the dome patrollers didnt permit vagrants to loiter in any of the places where she might feel safe foscol hadnt said if lord vorkosigan was with tien which suggested he was not which meant that shed have to fly back to serifosa alone with tien who would insist on taking the controls and what if he finally got serious about his suicide threats when they were halfway back and decided to take her down with him no it wasnt worth the risk let him rot out there till morning or let him call someone else her hand upon her case again she reconsidered still hostage to fortune in this mess or at least to everyones good behavior was nikki tiens relationship to his son was mostly neglectful interspersed with occasional bullying but with enough spasms of actual attention that nikki at least still seemed to show attachment to him the two of them were always going to have a relationship separate from her own she and tien would be forced to cooperate for nikkis sake an ironcladding of surface courtesy that must never crack tiens anger or potential brutality were no more of a threat to her future than some belated attempt on his part at affection or placation she could face down either now she thought with equal stoniness i am not here to vent my feelings i am here to achieve my goals yes she could foresee that was going to be her new mantra in the weeks to come with a grimace she opened her case and retrieved her personal breath mask checked its reservoirs pulled on her parka and headed out for the bubblecar station the delays were every bit as aggravating as ekaterin had foreseen komarrans sharing her bubblecar forced two extra stops she suffered a thirtyminute clog in the system within sight of her goal by the time it spat her out at the westernmost dome lock she was quite ready to chuck her plan of courtesy and go back to the apartment except for the thought of facing another thirtyminute delay en route the lightflyer they issued to her was elderly and not very clean alone at last flying through the vast silence of the komarran night her heart eased a little and she toyed with the fantasy of flying somewhere else anywhere just to extend the heavenly solitude there might be more to pleasure than the absence of pain but she couldnt prove it just now the absence of pain of other human beings and their needs pressing down upon her seemed paradise enough a paradise just out of reach besides she had no elsewhere she could not even return to barrayar with nikki without first earning enough to pay for their passage or borrowing the money from her father or her distant brothers or uncle vorthys distasteful thought what you feel doesnt count girl she reminded herself goals youll do whatever you have to do the bright lights of the experiment station isolated in this barren wilderness made a glow on the horizon that drew the eye from kilometers off she followed the black silky gleam of the river that wound past the facility as she neared she made out several vehicles grounded in the stations lot and frowned in anger foscol had lied about there being no one left at the station to give tien a lift on the other hand this raised the possibility that ekaterin might get a ride back to serifosa with someone else she checked her impulse to turn the flyer around in midair and landed in the lot instead she adjusted her breath mask released the canopy and walked to the office building hoping to arrange another ride before she saw tien the airlock opened to her touch on the control pad there was not much reason to leave anything locked up way out here she turned up the first welllit hallway calling hello no one answered no one appeared to be here about half the rooms were bare and empty the rest were rather messy and disorganized she thought a comconsole was opened up its insides torn out melted in fact that must have been a spectacular malfunction her footsteps echoed hollowly as she crossed through the pedestrian tube to the engineering building hello tien no answer here either the two big assembly rooms were shadowed and sinister and deserted anyone if foscol hadnt lied after all why were all those aircars and flyers in the lot where had their owners gone and in what hell be waiting for you outside on the northwest side she had only a vague idea which side of the building was the northwest shed halfexpected tien to be waiting in the parking lot she sighed uneasily and adjusted her breath mask again and stepped out through the pedestrian lock it would only take a few minutes to circle the building i want to fly back to serifosa right now this is weird slowly she started around the building to her left her footsteps sounding sharp on the concrete in the chill and toxic night air a raised walkway really the level edge of the buildings concrete foundation skirted the wall with a railing along the outside as the ground fell away below it made her feel as though she were being herded into some trap or a corral she rounded the second corner halfway down the walk a small human shape huddled on its knees arms outflung its forehead pressed against the railing another bigger shape hung by its wrists between two widespaced posts its body dangling down over the edge of the raised concrete foundation feet a halfmeter from the ground what is this the dark seemed to pulsate she swallowed her panic and hastened toward the odd pair the dangling figure was tien his breath mask was off twisted around his neck even in the colored halflight from the spots in the vegetation below she could see his face was mottled and purple with a cold doughy stillness his tongue protruded from his mouth his bulging eyes were fixed and frozen very very dead her stomach churned and knotted in shock and her heart lumped in her chest the kneeling figure was lord vorkosigan wearing her secondbest jacket that she had been unable to find while packing a short eternity ago his breath mask was still uphe turned his head his eyes going wide and dark as he saw her and ekaterin melted with relief the little lord auditor was still alive at least she was frantically grateful not to be alone with two corpses his wrists she saw at last were chained to the railings posts just as tiens were blood oozed from them soaking darkly into the jackets cuffs her first coherent thought was unutterable relief that she had not brought nikki with her how am i going to tell him tomorrow that was a problem for tomorrow let him play away tonight in the bubble of another universe one without this horror in it madame vorsoisson lord vorkosigans voice was muffled and faint in his breath mask oh god fearfully she touched the cold chains around his wrists the torn flesh was swollen up around the links almost burying them ill go inside and look for some cutters she almost added wait here but closed her lips on that inanity just in time no wait he gasped dont leave me alonetheres a key supposedly on the walk back there he jerked his head she found it at once a simple mechanical type it was cold a slip of metal in her shaking fingers she had to try several times to get it inserted in the locks that fastened the chains she then had to peel the chain out of vorkosigans bloodcrusted flesh as if from a rubber mold before his hand could fall when she released the second one he nearly pitched headfirst over the edge of the concrete she grabbed him and dragged him back toward the wall he tried to stand but his legs would not at first unbend and he fell over again give yourself a minute she told him awkwardly she tried to massage his legs to restore circulation even through the fabric of his gray trousers she could feel how cold and stiff they were she stood holding the key in her hand and stared in bewilderment at tiens body she doubted she and vorkosigan together could lift that dead weight back up to the walk its much too late said vorkosigan watching her his brows were crooked with concern im ssorry leave him for tuomonen what is this on his back she touched the peculiar arrangement what appeared to be a plastic packet fixed in place with engineering tape leave that said lord vorkosigan more sharply please and then in more of a rush stuttering in his shivering im sorry im sorry i ccouldnt bbreak the chains hell he couldnt either and hes sstronger than i am i thought i ccould break my hand and get it out but i couldnt im sorry you need to come inside where its warm here she helped pull him to his feet with a last look over his shoulder at tien he suffered himself to be led hunched over leaning on her and lurching on his unsteady legs she led him through the airlock into the office building and guided him to an upholstered chair in the lobby he more fell than sat in it he shivered violently bbbutton he muttered to her holding up his hands like paralyzed paws toward her what little button on the sside of wristcomm press it she did so he sighed and relaxed against the seat back his stiff hands yanked at his breath mask she helped him pull it off over his head and pulled down her own mask god i am glad to get out of that thing alive i ththought i was gonna have a seizure out therehe rubbed his pale face scrubbing at the red pressurelines engraved in the skin from the edges of the mask and it itched ekaterin spotted the control on a nearby wall and hastily tapped in an increase of the lobbys temperature she was shivering too though not from the cold in suppressed shocky shudders lord vorkosigan captain tuomonens anxious voice issued thinly from the wrist com whats going on where the hell are you vorkosigan lifted his wrist toward his mouth waste heat experiment station get out here i need you what are you should i bring a squad dont need guns now i dont think youll need forensics though and a medical team are you injured my lord tuomonens voice grew sharp with panic not to speak of he said apparently oblivious to the blood still leaking from his wrists administrator vorsoisson is dead though what the hellyou didnt check in with me before you left the dome dammit what the hell is going on out there we can discuss my failings at length later carry on captain vorkosigan out he let his arm fall wearily his shivering was lessening now he leaned his head back against the upholstery the dark smudges of exhaustion under his eyes looked like bruises he stared sadly at ekaterin i am sorry madame vorsoisson there was nothing i could do i would scarcely think so he looked around squinting and added abruptly power plant what about it asked ekaterin gotta check before the troops arrive i spent a lot of time wondering if it might have been sabotaged when i was tied up out there his legs were still not working right he almost fell over again as he tried to turn on his heel she rose and just caught him under his elbow good he said vaguely to her and pointed that way she was evidently drafted as support he hobbled off in determination clinging to her arm without apology the forced action actually helped her to recover if not calm a sort of tenuous physical coherence her shudders damped out and her incipient nausea passed leaving her belly feeling hot and odd another pedestrian tube led down to the power plant next to the river the river was the largest in the sector and the proximate reason for siting the experiment station here by barrayaran standards it would have been called a creek vorkosigan barged awkwardly around the power plants control room examining panels and readouts nothing looks abnormal he muttered i wonder why they didnt set it to selfdestruct i would have he fell into a station chair she pulled up another one and sat opposite him watching him fearfully what happened iwe came out tien brought me out herehow the devil did you come here lena foscol called me at home and told me tien wanted a ride she almost didnt catch me id been about to leave she didnt even tell me you were out here you might still be no no im almost certain shed have made some other arrangement if shed missed you altogether he sat up straighter or tried to what time is it now a little before i would have guessed it was much later they stunned us you see i dont know how long what time did she call you it was just after hours his eyes squeezed shut then opened again it was too late it was already too late by then do you understand he asked urgently his hand jerked toward hers on her knee as she leaned toward him to catch his hoarse words but then fell back no there was something questionable going on in the waste heat department your husband brought me out here to show mewell i dont quite know what he thought he was going to show me but we ran headlong into soudha and his accomplices in the process of decamping soudha got the drop on mestunned us both i came to chained to that railing out there i dont thinki dont know i dont think they meant to kill your husband he hadnt checked his breath mask ysee his reservoirs were almost empty the komarrans didnt check it either before they left us i didnt know no one did komarrans wouldnt ekaterin said woodenly their maskcheck procedures are ingrained by the time theyre three years old theyd never imagine an adult would go outside the dome with deficient equipment her hands clenched in her lap she could picture tiens death now it was quick vorkosigan offered at least that it was not neither quick nor clean please do not lie to me please do not ever lie to me all right he said slowly but i dont think i dont think it was murder to set up that scene and then call youhe shook his head manslaughter at most death by misadventure death from stupidity she said bitterly consistent to the end he glanced up at her his eyes not so much startled as aware and questioning ah lord auditor vorkosigan she swallowed her throat was so tight it felt like a muscle spasm the silence in the building and outside was eerie in its emptiness she and vorkosigan might as well have been the only two people left alive on the planet you should know when i said foscol called as i was leaving i was leaving leaving tien id told him so when he came home from the department tonight and just before he went back i suppose to get you what did he do he took this in without much response at first as if thinking it over all right he echoed himself softly at last he glanced across at her basically he came in babbling about some embezzlement scheme which had been going on in waste heat management apparently for quite some time he sounded me out about declaring him an imperial witness which he seemed to think would save him from prosecution its not quite that simple i didnt commit myself tien would hear what he wanted to hear she said softly i so i gathered he hesitated watching her face how long what do you know about it and how long have i known it ekaterin grimaced and rubbed her face free of the lingering irritation of her own mask not as long as i should have tien had been talking for months you have to understand he was irrationally afraid of anyone finding out about his vorzohns dystrophy i actually do understand that he offered tentatively yes and no its tiens older brothers fault in part ive cursed the man for years when his symptoms began he took the old vor way out and crashed his lightflyer it made an impression on tien he never shook off set an impossible example wed had no idea his family carried the mutation till tien who was his brothers executor was going through the records and effects and we realized both that the accident was deliberate and why it was just after nikki was born but wouldnt it have id wondered when i read your filethe defect should have turned up in the gene scan before the embryo was started in the uterine replicator is nikki affected or nikki was a bodybirth no gene scan the old vor way old vor have good blood you know no need to check anything he looked as if hed bitten into a lemon whose bright idea was that i dont quite remember how it was decided tien and i decided together i was young we were just married i had a lot of stupid romantic ideas i suppose it seemed heroic to me at the time how old were you twenty ah his mouth quirked in an expression she could not quite interpret a sad mixture of irony and sympathy yes obscurely encouraged she went on tiens scheme for dealing with the dystrophy without anyone ever finding out he had it was to go get galactic treatment somewhere far from the imperium it made it much more expensive than it needed to be wed been trying to save for years but somehow something always went wrong we never made much progress but for the past six or eight months tiens been telling me to stop worrying he had it under control except tien always talks like that so i scarcely paid attention then last night after you went to sleep i heard you tell him straight out you wanted to make a surprise inspection of his department today i heard youhe got up in the night and called administrator soudha to warn him i listened i heard enough to gather they had some sort of payroll falsification scheme going and im very much afraid no im certain tien was taking bribes because she stopped and took a breath i broke into tiens comconsole this morning and looked at his financial records she glanced up to see how vorkosigan would take this his mouth renewed the crooked quirk im sorry i ripped at you the other day for looking through mine she said humbly his mouth opened and closed he merely gave her a little encouraging wave of his fingers and slumped down a bit more in his chair listening with an air of uttermost attention listening she went on hurriedly not before her nerve broke for she scarcely felt anything now but before she dragged to a halt from sheer exhaustion hed had at least forty thousand marks that i couldnt see where theyd come from not from his salary certainly had if the information on the comconsole was right hed taken all forty thousand and borrowed sixty more and lost it all on komarran trade fleet shares all well no not quite all about threequarters of it at his astonished look she added tiens luck has always been like that i always used to say you made your own luck though ive been forced to eat those words often enough i dont say it so much anymore well i think it must be true or how else could his luck have been so consistently bad the only common factor in all the chaos was tien she leaned her head back wearily though i suppose it might have been me somehow tien often said it was me after a little silence he said hesitantly did you love your husband madame vorsoisson she didnt want to answer this the truth made her ashamed but she was done with dissimulation i suppose i did once in the beginning i can hardly remember anymore but i couldnt stop caring for him cleaning up after him except my caring got slower and slower and finally it stopped too late or maybe too soon i dont know but if of course she had not broken from tien just then in just that way he would not tonight have and and and along the whole chain of events that led to this moment that ifonly could of course be said equally for any link in the chain not more not less not repairable i thought if i let go he would fall she stared at her hands eventually i didnt expect it to happen so soon it began to be borne in upon her what a mess tiens death was going to leave in her lap she would be trading the painful legalities of separation for the equally painful and difficult legalities of sorting out his probably bankrupt estate and what was she supposed to do about his body or any kind of funeral and how to notify his mother and yet solving the worst problem without tien seemed already a thousand times easier than solving the simplest with tien no more deferential negotiations for permission or approval or consensus she could just do it she felt like a patient coming out of some paralysis stretching her arms wide for the first time and surprised to discover they were strong she frowned in puzzlement will there be charges against tien vorkosigan shrugged it is not customary to try the dead though i believe it was done occasionally in the time of isolation lord vorventa the twicehung springs to mind no there will be investigations there will be reports oh my head the reports impsecs and my own and possibly the serifosa sectors securityi anticipate argument over jurisdictionthere may be testimony required of you in the prosecution of other persons he broke off to hitch himself around with difficulty in his chair and shove a now somewhat less stifffromcold hand into his pocket persons who i suppose got away with my stunner his expression changed to one of dismay and he spasmed to his feet and turned out both his trouser pockets then checked his jacket shucked it off and patted his gray tunic damn what asked ekaterin in alarm i think the bastards took my auditors seal unless it just fell out of my pocket somewhere in all the horsing around tonight oh god itll open any government or security comconsole in the empire he took a deep breath then brightened on the other hand it has a locatorcircuit impsec can trace it if theyre close enoughimpsec can trace them ha with difficulty he forced his red and swollen fingers to open a channel on his comm link tuomonen he inquired were on our way my lord tuomonens voice came back instantly were in the air about halfway there i estimate will you please leave your channel open listen i think my assailants have taken off with my auditors seal delegate someone to start trying to track it at once find it and youll find them if its not just been dropped around here somewhere you can check that possibility when you get here vorkosigan then insisted on a tour of the building drafting ekaterin once more as occasional support though he stumbled very little now he frowned at the melted comconsole and at the empty rooms and stared with narrowed eyes at the jumbles of equipment tuomonen and his men arrived just as they were reentering the lobby lord vorkosigans lips twitched in bemusement as two halfarmored guards stunners at the ready leaped through the airseal door they gave vorkosigan anxious nods which he acknowledged with a wry salutelike gesture then pelted after each other through the facility for a rather noisy security check vorkosigan hitched himself into a deliberately more relaxed posture leaning against an upholstered chair captain tuomonen another barrayaran soldier in halfarmor and three men in medical gear followed into the lobby my lord said tuomonen pulling down his breath mask his tone of voice sounded familiarly maternal to ekaterins ear halfway between thank god youre safe and im going to strangle you with my bare hands good evening captain said vorkosigan genially so glad to see you you didnt notify me yes it was entirely my mistake and ill be certain to note your exoneration in my report vorkosigan said soothingly its not that dammit tuomonen strode over to him motioning a medic in his wake he took in vorkosigans macerated wrists and bloody hands who did that to you i did it to myself rather im afraid vorkosigans pose of studied ease slipped back into his original grimness it could have been worse as i will show you directly around back i want you to record everything a complete scan anything youre in doubt of leave for the experts from hq i want a top forensics team scrambled from solstice immediately two teams one for out here one for those royally buggered comconsoles at the terraforming offices but first i think he glanced at the medtechs and at ekaterin we should get administrator vorsoissons body down heres the key said ekaterin numbly producing it from her pocket thank you said vorkosigan taking it from her wait here please he jerked up his chin checked and pulled up his mask and led the stillprotesting tuomonen back out the airseal doors imperiously motioning the medics to follow ekaterin could still hear the clattering and strained sharp voices of the armed guards echoing from distant corridors deeper in the office building she huddled into the chair vorkosigan had vacated feeling very odd not to be following the men to tien but someone else was going to be cleaning up the mess this time it appeared a few tears leaked from her eyes residue of her bodyshock she supposed for she surely felt no more emotion than if shed been a lump of lead after a long while the men returned to the lobby where tuomonen finally persuaded vorkosigan to sit down and let the senior medic attend to his injured wrists this isnt the treatment im most concerned about just now vorkosigan complained as a hypospray of synergine hissed into the side of his neck i have to get back to serifosa theres something i really need out of my luggage yes my lord said the medtech soothingly and went on cleaning and bandaging tuomonen went out to his aircar to relay some terse communication with his impsec superiors in solstice then returned to lean on the back of the chair and watch the medtech finish up vorkosigan eyed ekaterin across the medtech madame vorsoisson in retrospect thinking back did your husband ever say anything that indicated this scam had to do with something more than money ekaterin shook her head tuomonen in gruff tones put in im afraid madame vorsoisson that impsec is going to have to take charge of your late husbands body there must be a complete examination yes of course ekaterin said faintly she paused then what well let you know madame he turned to vorkosigan evidently continuing a conversation so what else did you think of when you were tied up out there all i could really think about was when my next seizure was due said vorkosigan ruefully it became kind of an obsession after a while but i dont think foscol knew about that hidden defect either i still want to call it murder and attempted murder for the allsectors alert order said tuomonen evidently continuing a debate and the attempted murder of an imperial auditor makes it treason which disposes of any arguments about requisitions yes very good sighed vorkosigan in acquiescence make sure your reports have the facts clear though please as i see them my lord tuomonen grimaced then burst out damn to think how long this thing must have been going on right under my nose not your jurisdiction captain observed vorkosigan it was the imperial accounting offices job to spot this kind of fraud in the civil service still theres something very wrong here i should say so no i mean beyond the obvious vorkosigan hesitated they abandoned all their personal effects yet took at least two airvans of equipment to sell ekaterin posited no that makes no sense mm and they left in a group didnt split up these people seemed to me to be komarran patriots of a sort i can see where they might classify theft from the barrayaran imperium as something between a hobby and a patriotic duty but to steal from the komarran terraforming project the hope of their future generations and if it wasnt just to line their pockets what the devil were they using all the money for he scowled that will be for impsecs forensic accounting team to sort out i suppose and i want engineering experts in here to see if they can make anything at all from the mess thats been left and not left its clear soudhas crew put something together in the engineering building and i dont think it had anything to do with waste heat he rubbed his forehead and muttered ill bet marie trogir could tell us damn but i wish id fastpentad madame radovas when i had the chance ekaterin swallowed a lump of dread and humiliation im going to have to tell my uncle vorkosigan glanced up at her ill take over that task madame vorsoisson she frowned torn between what seemed to her weak gratitude and a dreary sense of duty but could not muster the energy to argue with him the medic finished winding the last medical tape around vorkosigans wrists i must leave you in charge here captain and return to serifosa i dont dare fly myself madame vorsoisson would you be so kind you will take a guard said tuomonen a little dangerously i have to get the flyer back said ekaterin its rented she squinted realizing how stupid that sounded but it was the only fragment of order in this mortal chaos it was presently in her power to restore and then belatedly the realization came i can go home its safe to go home her voice strengthened certainly lord vorkosigan the presence of the hulking young guard crowded into the flyer behind them vorkosigans exhaustion and ekaterins emotional disorientation combined to blunt conversation on the flight back to serifosa she drew stares turning the flyer back in at the rental desk while trailed politely by a large fullyarmed halfarmored soldier and a dwarfish man with bloody clothes and bandages on his wrists but on the other hand they had a bubblecar all to themselves for the ride back to the apartment there were no delays in the system on this return leg ekaterin noted with weary irony she wondered if there would be any point later when this all got sorted out to check if vorkosigans insistence that it had already been too late for tien when foscol had called her was precisely true her steps quickened in the hallway of her apartment she felt like an injured animal wanting nothing more than to go hide in her burrow she came to an abrupt halt at her door and her breath drew in the palmlock panel was hanging partway out of the wall and the sliding door was not entirely closed a thin line of light leaked along its edge she backed up a step and pointed vorkosigan took it all in at once and motioned to the guard who equally silently stepped up to the door and drew his stunner vorkosigan put his finger to his lips took her by the arm and drew her back halfway to the lifttubes the automatic door wasnt working the guard had to grasp it awkwardly and lean to push it back into its slot stunner raised and visor lowered he slipped inside ekaterins heart hammered after a few minutes the impsec guard his visor up again poked his head back out the door someones been through here right enough mlord but theyre gone now vorkosigan and ekaterin followed him inside both vorkosigans cases and her own which she had left sitting by the door in the vestibule had been broken open their clothing was scattered in mixed heaps all around on the floor little else in the apartment appeared to have been touched some drawers were opened their contents stirred but aside from the disorder nothing had been vandalized was it a violation when she herself had all but vacated this space abandoned those possessions she scarcely knew this is not how i left my things vorkosigan observed mildly to her when they fetched up in the vestibule again after their first short survey its not how i left them either she said a bit desperately i thought you would be coming back with tien and then leaving so id packed them all for you ready to take away touch nothing especially the comconsoles till the forensics folks get here vorkosigan told her she nodded understanding they both shucked their heavy jackets automatically ekaterin hung them up vorkosigan then proceeded to ignore his own dictate and kneel in the vestibule to sort through the heaps did you pack my codelocked data case yes its gone now he sighed rose and raised his wristcomm to report these new developments to captain tuomonen still at the experiment station the overburdened tuomonen apprised swore briefly and ordered his soldier to stick with the lord auditor like glue until relieved for once vorkosigan didnt object vorkosigan returned to the mess turning over an untidy pile of ekaterins clothing ha he cried and pounced on the gelpack case which contained that odd device he opened it hurriedly his hands shaking a little thank god they didnt take this he looked up at her measuringly madame vorsoisson his normally forceful tone grew uncertain i wonder if i could trouble you to assist me in this she almost said yes without thinking but managed to alter the word to what before it left her mouth he smiled tightly i mentioned my seizure disorder to you it doesnt have a cure unfortunately but my barrayaran doctors came up with a palliative of sorts i use this little machine to stimulate seizures bleed them off in a controlled time and place so they dont happen in an uncontrolled time and place they tend to be exacerbated by stress by his grimace she could see him picturing the cold walkway on the backside of the engineering building i suspect im now overdue i would like to get it over with at once i understand but what do i do im supposed to have a spotter to see i dont spit out my mouth guard or or injure myself or damage anything while im out there shouldnt be much to it all right under the dubious eye of the impsec guard she followed him to the living room he headed for the curved couch if you lie on the floor ekaterin suggested diffidently still not sure how spectacular a show to expect you cant fall any further ah right he settled himself on the carpet the case open in his hand she made sure the space around them was clear and knelt beside him he unfolded the device which resembled a set of headphones with a pad on one end and a mysterious knob on the other he fitted it over his head and adjusted it to his temples he smiled at ekaterin in what she belatedly realized was extreme embarrassment and muttered im afraid this looks a little stupid fitted a plastic mouthguard onto his teeth and lay back wait said ekaterin suddenly as his hand reached for his temple wha could whoever came in here have tampered with that thing maybe it ought to be checked first his wide eyes met hers as certainly as if she had been telepathic she knew she shared with him at that moment a vision of his head being blown off at the touch of his hand on the stimulators trigger he ripped it back off his head sat up spat out his mouthguard and cried shit he added after a moment in a tone level but about half an octave higher than his norm youre quite right thank you i wasnt thinking i made many cosmic promises that if i made it back here id do this first thing and never never never put it off just one extra day again hyperventilating he stared in consternation at the device clutched in his hand then his eyes rolled up and he fell over backwards ekaterin caught his head just before it banged into the carpet his lips were drawn back in a strange grin his body shuddered in waves passing down to his toes and fingertips but he did not flail wildly about as shed halfexpected the guard hovered looking panicked she rescued the mouth guard and fitted it back over his teeth not as difficult a task as it at first appeared despite an impression to that effect he was not rigid she sat back on her heels and stared triggered by stress yes i see his face was altered his personality clearly not present but in a way that resembled neither sleep nor death it seemed terribly rude to watch him so in all his vulnerability courtesy urged her to look away but he had explicitly appointed her to this task she checked her chrono about five minutes hed said these things lasted it seemed a small eternity but was in fact less than three minutes when his body stilled he lay slumped in alarmingly flaccid unconsciousness for another minute beyond that then drew in a shuddering breath his eyes opened and stared about in palpable incomprehension at least his dilated pupils were the same size sorry sorryhe muttered inanely didnt mean to do that he lay staring upward his eyebrows crooked he added after a moment what does it look like anyway really strange ekaterin answered him honestly i like your face better when youre at home in your head she had not realized how powerfully his personality enlivened his features or how subtly until shed seen it removed i like my head better when im at home in it too he breathed he squeezed his eyes shut and opened them again ill get out of your way now his hands twitched and he tried to sit up ekaterin didnt think he ought to be trying to do anything yet she pressed him firmly back down with a hand on his chest dont you dare take away that guard till my door gets fixed not that its expensive electronic lock had appeared to do the least good oh no of course not he said faintly it was abundantly apparent that vorkosigans implicit claim that he bounced back out of his seizures with no ill effects was a well if not a lie a gross exaggeration he looked terrible she raised her gaze to catch that of the disturbed guard corporal would you please help me to get lord vorkosigan to bed until he is more recovered or at least until your people arrive sure maam he seemed relieved to have this direction provided for him and helped her pull vorkosigan to his unsteady feet ekaterin made a lightning calculation nikkis bed was the only one instantly available and his room had no comconsole if vorkosigan went to sleep which he obviously desperately needed to do after this nights ordeal there was a chance he might be let to stay that way even when the impsec forensic invasion arrived this way she nodded to the guard and led them down the hall the incoherence of vorkosigans mumbled protests assured ekaterin that she was doing precisely the right thing he was shivering again she helped him off with his tunic made him lie down dragged off his boots covered him with extra blankets turned the rooms heat up to high doused the lights and withdrew there was no one to put her to bed but she did not care to attempt conversation with the guard who took up station in her living room to wait for his overextended reinforcements her whole body felt as though it had been beaten she took some painkillers and lay down fully dressed in her own bedroom a thousand uncertainties and conflicting scenarios for what she must do next jostling in her mind tiens body which had breathed beside her in this space last night must be in the hands of the impsec medical examiner by now laid out naked and still on a cold metal tray in some clinical laboratory here in serifosa she hoped they would treat his congealed husk with some measure of dignity and not the nervous jocularity death sometimes evoked when this bed had been impossible to bear in the night it had been her habit to sneak off to her workroom and fiddle with her virtual gardens the barrayaran garden had increasingly been her choice of late it lacked the texture the smell the slow dense satisfactions of the real but it had soothed her mind nonetheless but first vorkosigan had occupied the room and now hed ordered her not to touch the comconsoles till impsec had drained them she sighed and turned over huddled in her accustomed corner of the bed even though the rest was unoccupied i want to leave this place as soon as i can i want to be someplace where tien has never been she did not expect to sleep but whether from the pain meds or exhaustion or the combination she fell into a doze at last chapter twelve miles could tell right away that he wasnt going to enjoy waking up a bad seizure usually left him with hangoverlike symptoms the following day and the lingering effects of heavy stun included muscle aches muscle spasms and pseudomigraines the combination it appeared was downright synergistic he groaned and tried to regain unconsciousness a gentle touch on his shoulder thwarted his intent lord vorkosigan it was ekaterin vorsoissons soft voice his eyes sprang open on thankfullydim lighting he was in her son nikkis room and could not remember how hed arrived here he rolled over and blinked up at her she had changed clothes since his last memory of her kneeling beside him on her living room floor she now wore a soft highnecked beige shirt and darkertoned trousers in the komarran style her long dark hair lay loose in damp newwashed strands on her shoulders he still had on his bloodstained shirt and wrinkled trousers from yesterdays nightmare im sorry to wake you she continued but captain tuomonen is here ah said miles thickly he struggled upright madame vorsoisson was holding out a tray with a large mug of black coffee and a bottle of painkiller tablets two tablets had already been extracted from the bottle and lay ready for ingestion beside the cup only in his imagination did a heavenly choir supply background music oh my she didnt say anything more till he had fumbled the tablets to his lips and swallowed them his swollen hands werent working too well but did manage to clutch the mug in something resembling a deathgrip a second swallow scalded away a world of nastiness lingering in his mouth well worth the challenge to the queasiness in his stomach thank you after a third gulp he achieved what time is it its about an hour after dawn hed been out of the loop for about four hours then all sorts of events could occur in four hours not parting with the mug he kicked his legs out of the bed his sockclad feet groped for the floor walking was going to be a chancy business for the first few minutes is tuomonen in a hurry i cant tell he looks tired he says they found your seal that decided it tuomonen before a shower he swallowed more coffee handed the mug back to ekaterto madame vorsoissonand levered himself to his feet after an awkward smile at her he did a few bends and stretches to be certain he could walk down the hall without falling over in front of impsec he had not the first idea what to say to her im sorry i got your husband killed was inaccurate on a couple of counts up to the point he had been stunned miles might have done half a dozen different things to have altered last nights outcome but if only vorsoisson had checked his own damned breath mask before going out the way he was supposed to miles was pretty certain he would still have been alive this morning and the more he learned about the man the less convinced he was that his death was any disservice to his wife widow after a moment he essayed are you all right she smiled wanly and shrugged all things considered thin lines etched parallels between her eyes did you umhe gestured at the bottle of tablets get any of those for yourself several thank you ah good harm has been done you and i dont know how to fix it it was going to take a hell of a lot more than a couple of pills though he shook his head regretted the gesture instantly and staggered out to see tuomonen the imp sec captain was waiting on the circular couch in the living room also gratefully sucking down madame vorsoissons coffee he appeared to consider standing at some sort of quasiattention when the lord auditor entered the room but then thought better of it tuomonen gestured and miles seated himself across the table from the captain they each mumbled their goodmornings madame vorsoisson followed with miless halfempty coffee cup and set it before him then after a wary glance at tuomonen quietly seated herself if tuomonen wanted her to leave he was going to have to ask her himself miles decided and then justify the request in the event tuomonen merely nodded thanks to her and shifted around and drew a plastic packet from his tunic it contained miless goldencased auditors electronic seal he handed it across to miles very good captain said miles i dont suppose you were so fortunate as to find it on the person of its thief no mores the pity youll never guess where we did find it miles squinted and held the plastic bag up to the light a sheen of condensation fogged the inside in a sewer pipe halfway between here and the serifosa dome waste treatment plant would be my first guess tuomonens jaw fell open how did you know forensic plumbing was once a sort of hobby of mine not to sound ungrateful but has anyone washed it yes in fact oh thank you miles opened the packet and shook the heavy little device into his palm it appeared undamaged tuomonen said my lieutenant had its signal traced or at any rate triangulated within half an hour of your call he led an assault team down into the utility tunnels after it i wish i could have seen it when they finally figured out what was going on you would have appreciated it im almost certain miles grinned despite his headache i was in no shape last night to appreciate anything im afraid well they made an impressive delegation when they went to wake up the serifosa dome municipal engineer shes komarran of course impsec coming for her in the middle of the nighther husband about had a heart spasm my lieutenant finally got him calmed down and got across to her what we needed im afraid she found it an occasion for er considerable irony we are all grateful that my lieutenant didnt yield to his first impulse which was to have his team blast open the pipe section in question with their assault plasma rifles miles almost choked on a swallow of coffee exceedingly grateful he stole a glance at ekaterin vorsoisson who was leaning back against the cushions listening to this eyes alight a hand pressed to her lips his painkillers were cutting in she didnt look so blurry now there was no sign by then of our human quarry of course tuomonen finished with a sigh long gone miles stared at his distorted reflection in the dark surface of his drink one sees the scenario you should be able to work out the timetable quite precisely foscol and an unknown number of accomplices pick my pocket tie me and the administrator to the railing fly back to serifosa call madame vorsoisson probably from someplace nearby as soon as she vacates her apartment they break in knowing they have at least an hour to explore before the alarm goes up they use my seal to open the data case and access my report files then they flush the seal down the toilet and leave not even breathing hard too bad they werent tempted to keep it mm they clearly realized it was traceable hence their little joke he frowned but why my data case they might have been looking for something about radovas what all was in your data case my lord copies of all the classified technical reports and autopsies from the soletta accident soudhas an engineer he doubtless had a very good idea what was in there were going to have an interesting time later this morning at the terraforming project offices said tuomonen glumly trying to figure out which employees are absent because they fled and which ones are absent because they are fictional i need to get over there as soon as possible to supervise the preliminary interrogations well have to fastpenta them all i suppose i predict it will be a great waste of time and drugs agreed miles but theres always the chance of someone knowing more than they think they know mm yes tuomonen glanced at the listening woman speaking of whichmadame vorsoissonim afraid im going to have to ask you to cooperate with a fastpenta interrogation as well its standard operating procedure in a mysterious death of this nature to question the closest relatives the dome police may also be wanting in on it or at least demand a copy depending on what decisions are made about jurisdiction by my superiors i understand said madame vorsoisson in a colorless voice there was nothing mysterious about administrator vorsoissons death miles pointed out uneasily i was standing right next to him well kneeling technically shes not a suspect tuomonen said a witness and a fastpenta interrogation would help to keep it that way miles realized with reluctance when do you wish to do this captain madame vorsoisson asked quietly well not immediately ill have a better set of questions after this mornings investigations are complete just dont go anywhere her glance at him silently inquired am i under house arrest at some point i have to go get my son nikolai he was staying overnight at a friends home he hasnt been told anything about this yet i dont want to tell him over the comconsole and i dont want him to hear it first on the news that wont happen said tuomonen grimly not yet anyway though i expect ill have the information services badgering us soon enough someone is bound to notice that the most boring impsec post on komarr is suddenly boiling with activity i must either go get him or call and arrange for him to stay longer which would you prefer miles put in before tuomonen could say anything i if you are going to do the interrogation here today id rather wait till its over with to get nikki ill have to explain to his friends mother something of the situation at least that tien was killed in an accident last night have you bugged her comconsoles miles asked tuomonen bluntly tuomonens look queried this revelation but he cleared his throat and said yes you should be aware madame vorsoisson that impsec will be monitoring all calls in and out of here for a few days she looked blankly at him why there is the possibility that someone either from soudhas group or some other connection we havent yet discovered not yet realizing the administrator is dead might try to communicate she accepted this with a slightly dubious nod thank you for warning me speaking of calls miles added please have one of your people bring me a secured vidlink here i have a few calls to make myself will you be staying here my lord asked tuomonen for a while till after your interrogation and until lord auditor vorthys gets downside as he will surely wish to do thats the first call i want to make ah of course miles looked around his seizure stimulator its case and his mouthguard were still lying where theyd been dropped a few hours ago miles pointed and if you please could you have your lab check my medical gear for any sign of tampering then return it to me tuomonens brows rose do you suspect it my lord it was just a horrible thought but i think its going to be a very bad idea to underestimate either the intelligence or the subtlety of our adversaries in this thing eh do you need it urgently no not anymore the data packet foscol left on administrator vorsoissons personhave you had a chance to look at it miles went on he managed to avoid glancing at madame vorsoisson just a quick scan said tuomonen he did look at madame vorsoisson and away spoiling miless effort at delicacy her lips thinned only a little i turned it over to the impsec financial analysta colonel no lessthat hq sent out to take charge of the financial part of the investigation oh good i was going to ask if hq had sent you relief troops yet yes everything you requested the engineering team arrived on site at the experiment station about an hour ago the packet foscol left seems to be documentation of all the financial transactions relating to the um payments made by soudhas group to the administrator if its not all lies its going to be an amazing help in sorting out the whole embezzlement part of the mess which is really very odd when you think about it foscol clearly had no love for vorsoisson but surely everything that incriminates him incriminates the komarrans equally quite odd yes if only his brain hadnt been turned to pulsing oatmeal miles felt he could follow out some line of logic from this later an impsec tech wearing black fatigues emerged from the back of the apartment he carried a black box identical to in fact possibly the same asthe one which tuomonen had used at madame radovass and said to his superior ive finished all the comconsoles sir thank you corporal go back to the office and transfer copies to our files to hq solstice and to colonel gibbs the tech nodded and trod out through the miles noticed stillruined door and oh yes would you please detail a tech to repair madame vorsoissons front door miles added to tuomonen possibly he could install a somewhat betterquality locking system while hes about it she shot him a quietly grateful look yes my lord i will of course keep a guard on duty while you are here a duenna of sorts miles supposed he must try to get madame vorsoisson something rather better suspecting hed loaded poor sleepless tuomonen with enough chores and orders for one session miles requested only that he be notified at once if impsec caught up with soudha or any member of his group and let the captain go off to his suddenly multiplied duties by the time hed showered and dressed in his last good gray suit the painkillers had achieved their full effect and miles felt almost human when he emerged madame vorsoisson invited him to her kitchen tuomonens door guard stayed in the living room would you care for some breakfast lord vorkosigan have you eaten well no im not really hungry likely not but she looked as pale and washedout as he felt tactically inspired he said ill have something if you will something bland he added prudently groats she suggested diffidently oh yes please he wanted to say i can get themmixing up a packet of instant groats was well within his impsec survivaltrained capabilities he could have assured herbut he didnt want to risk her going away so he sat an obedient guest and watched her move about she seemed uneasy in what should have been this core place of her domain where would she fit someplace much larger she set up and served them both they exchanged commonplace courtesies when shed eaten a few bites she worked up an unconvincing smile and asked is it true fastpenta makes you rather foolish mm like any drug people have varied reactions ive conducted any number of fastpenta interrogations in the line of my former duties and ive had it given to me twice her interest was clearly piqued by this last statement oh i umhe wanted to reassure her but he had to be honest dont ever lie to me shed said in a voice of suppressed passion my own reaction was idiosyncratic dont you have that allergy impsec is supposed to give to itswell no of course not or you wouldnt be here impsecs defense against the truth drug was to induce a fatal allergic response in its key operatives one had to agree to the treatment but as it was a gateway to larger responsibilities and hence promotions the security force had never lacked for volunteers no in fact chief illyan never asked me to undergo it in retrospect i cant help wondering if my father had a hand there but in any case it doesnt make me truthful so much as it makes me hyper i babble fastfoolish i guess the one um hostile interrogation i underwent i was actually able to beat by continually reciting poetry it was a very bizarre experience in normal people the degree of well ugliness depends a lot on whether you fight it or go along with it if you feel that the questioner is on your side it can be just a very relaxing way of giving the same testimony you would anyway oh she did not look reassured enough i cant claim it doesnt invade your reserve and she possessed a reserve oceansdeep but a properly conducted interview ought not to shame you be too bad though if last nights events had not shaken her out of her daunting selfcontrol he hesitated then added how did you learn to underreact the way you do her face went blank do i underreact yes you are very hard to read oh she stirred her black coffee i dont know ive been this way for as long as i can remember a more introspective look stilled her features for a time no no there was a time i suppose it goes back to i had i have three older brothers a typical vor family structure of their generation too damned many boys a token girl added as an afterthought hadnt any of those parents possessed a foresight and b the ability to do simple arithmetic hadnt any of them wanted to be grandparents the eldest two were out of my range she went on but the youngest was close enough in age to me to be obnoxious he discovered he could entertain himself mightily by teasing me to screaming tantrums horses were a surefire subject i was horsemad at the time i couldnt fight backi hadnt the wits then to give as good as i got and if i tried to hit him he was enough bigger than meim thinking of the time when i was about ten and he was about fourteenhe could just hold me upside down he had me so welltrained after a while he could set me off just by whinnying she smiled grimly it was a great trial to my parents couldnt they stop him he usually managed to be witty enough he got away with it it even worked on mei can remember laughing and trying to hit him at the same time and i think my mother was starting to be ill by then though neither of us knew it what my mother told mei can still see her holding her headwas the way to get him to stop was for me to just not react she said the same thing when i was teased at school or upset about most anything be a stone statue she said then it wouldnt be any fun for him and he would stop and he did stop or at least he grew out of being a fourteenyearold lout and left for university were friends now but i never unlearned to respond to attack by turning to stone looking back now i wonder how many of the problems in my marriage were due to well she smiled and blinked my mother was wrong i think she certainly ignored her own pain for far too long but im stone all the way through now and its too late miles bit his knuckles hard right so at the dawn of puberty shed learned no one would defend her she could not defend herself and the only way to survive was to pretend to be dead great and if there were a more fatally wrong move some awkward fellow could possibly make at this moment than to take her in his arms and try to comfort her it escaped his wildest imaginings if she needed to be stone right now because it was the only way she knew how to survive let her be marble let her be granite whatever you need you take it milady ekaterin whatever you want youve got it what he finally came up with was i like horses he wondered if that sounded as idiotic as it sounded her dark brows crinkled in amused bafflement so apparently it did oh i outgrew that years ago outgrew or gave up i was an only child but i had a cousinivanwho was as loutish as they come and of course much bigger than me though were about the same age but when i was a kid i had a bodyguard one of the countmyfathers armsmen sergeant bothari he had no sense of humor at all if ivan had ever tried anything like your brother no amount of wit would have saved him she smiled your own bodyguard now theres an idyllic childhood indeed it was in a lot of ways not the medical parts though the sergeant couldnt help me there nor at school mind you i didnt appreciate what i had at the time i spent half of my time trying to figure out how to get away from his protection but i succeeded often enough i guess to know i could succeed is sergeant bothari still with you one of those crusty old vor family retainers he probably would be if he were still alive but no we were uh caught in a war zone on a galactic trip when i was seventeen and he was killed oh im sorry it was not exactly my fault but my decisions were pretty prominent in the causal chain that led to his death he watched for her reaction to this confession as usual her face changed very little but he taught me how to survive and go on the last of his very many lessons you have just experienced destruction i know survival let me help her eyes flicked up did you love him he was a difficult man but yes ah he offered after a time however you came by it you are very levelheaded in emergencies i am she looked surprised you were last night she smiled clearly touched by the compliment dammit she shouldnt take in this mild observation as if it were great praise she must be starving half to death if such a scrap seems a feast it was the most nearly unguarded conversation shed ever granted him and he longed to extend the moment but theyd run out of groats to push around in the bottom of their dishes their coffee was cold and the tech from impsec arrived at this moment with the secured comconsole uplink miles had requested madame vorsoisson pointed out to the tech her late husbands office as a private space to set up the machine the forensics people had been and gone while miles slept after briefly watching the new installation she retreated into housewifery like a red deer into underbrush apparently intent on erasing all traces of their invasion of her space miles turned to face the next most difficult conversation of the morning it took several minutes to establish the secure link with lord auditor vorthys aboard the probablecause teams mothership now docked at the soletta array miles settled himself as comfortably as his aching muscles would allow and prepared to cultivate patience in the face of the irritating severalsecond time lag between every exchange vorthys when he at last appeared was wearing standardissue shipknits evidently in preparation for donning a pressure suit the closefitting cloth did not flatter his bulky figure but he seemed to be well up for the day the standardmeridian solstice time kept topside was a few hours ahead of serifosas time zone good morning professor miles began i trust youve had a better night than we did at the top of the bad news your nephewinlaw etienne vorsoisson was killed last night in a breathmask mishap at the waste heat experiment station im here now at ekaterins apartment shes holding up all right so far ill have a very long transmission in explanation over to you the trouble with the time lag was just how agonizingly long one had in which to anticipate the change of expression and of peoples lives occasioned by the arrival of words one had sent but could no longer call back and edit vorthys looked every bit as shocked as miles had expected when the message reached him my god go ahead miles miles took a deep breath and began a blunt precis of yesterdays events from the futile hours of being given the royal runaround at the terraforming offices to vorsoissons hasty return to drag him out to the experiment station the revelation of his involvement with the embezzlement scheme their encounter with soudha and madame radovas the waking up chained to the railing he did not describe vorsoissons death in detail ekaterins arrival impsec teams called out in force too late the business with his seal vorthyss expression changed from shocked to appalled as the details mounted miles this is horrible ill come downside as soon as i can poor ekaterin do please stay with her till i get there wont you he hesitated before this came up i was actually thinking of requesting you to come topside weve found some very odd pieces of equipment up here which have undergone some quite incredible physical distortions id wondered if you might have seen anything like it in your galactic military experiences there are some traceable serial numbers left here and there in the debris though which id hoped may prove a lead ill just have to leave them to my komarran boys for the moment odd equipment eh soudha and his friends left with a lot of odd equipment too at least two liftvans full have your komarran boys send those serial numbers to colonel gibbs care of impsec serifosa hes going to be tracing a lot of serial numbers in terraforming project purchases thatmay not be as bogus as id first assumed theres got to be more connections between here and there than just poor radovass body look um impsec here wants to fastpenta ekaterin on account of tiens involvement do you want me to delay that till you arrive i thought you might wish to supervise her interrogation at least lag vorthyss brow wrinkled in worried thought i dear god no i want to but i should not my niecea clear conflict of interest miles my boy do you suppose would you be willing to sit in on it and see that they dont get carried away impsec hardly ever uses those lead lined rubber hoses anymore but yes i planned to do just that if you do not disapprove sir lag i should be excessively relieved thank you of course i also should very much like to have your evaluation of whatever the impsec engineering team turns up out at the experiment station at the moment i have very little evidence and lots of theories im itching to reverse the proportions professor vorthys smiled dry appreciation of this last line when it arrived arent we all i have another suggestion sir ekaterin seems very alone here she doesnt seem to have any close komarran women friends that ive seen so far and of course no female relatives i wondered if it might not be a good idea for you to send for the professora vorthyss face lit when this one registered not only good but wise and kind yes of course at once given a family emergency of this nature her assistant can surely supervise her final exams the idea should have occurred to me directly thank you miles everything else can wait till you get downside unless something breaks in the case on impsecs end ill get ekaterin in here before i close the transmission i know she longs to talk with you but tiens involvement in this mess is pretty humiliating for her i suspect the professors lips tightened ah tien yes i understand its all right miles miles was silent for a time professor he began at last about tien fastpenta interrogations tend to be a lot more controllable if the interrogator has some clue what hes getting into i dont want um can you give me some sense of what ekaterins marriage looked like from her familys point of view the time lag dragged while vorthys frowned i dont like to speak ill of the dead before their offering is even burned he said at last i dont think were going to have a lot of choice here huh he said glumly when miless words reached him well i suppose it seemed like a good idea to everyone at the time ekaterins father shasha vorvayne had known tiens late fatherhe was recently deceased then a decade ago already my word the time has gone fast well the two older men had been friends both officers in the district government the families knew each other tien had just quit the military and had used his veterans rights to obtain a job in the district civil service goodlooking healthy seemed poised to follow in his fathers footsteps you know though i suppose it ought to have been a clue that he had put in his ten years and never risen beyond the rank of lieutenant vorthys pursed his lips miles reddened slightly there can be a lot of reasons never mind go on vorvayne had begun to recover from my sisters untimely death he had met a woman nothing unseemly an older woman violie vorvayne is a charming ladyand begun to think of remarriage he wanted i suppose to see ekaterin properly settledto honorably tie off the last of his obligations to the past if you will my nephews were all out on their own by then tien had called on him in part as courtesy to his late fathers friend in part to get a reference for his district service application they struck up as much of an acquaintance as might be between two men of such dissimilar ages my brotherinlaw doubtless spoke highly of ekaterin settled in her fathers mind equated with married i take it not say graduated from university and employed at an enormous salary only for the boys my brotherinlaw can be more old vor than you high vor in a lot of ways vorthys sighed but tien sent a reputable baba to arrange the contracts the young people were permitted to meet ekaterin was excited flattered the professora was distressed that vorvayne hadnt waited a few more years but young people have no sense of time twenty is old the first offer is the last chance all that nonsense ekaterin didnt know how attractive she was but her father was afraid i think that she might settle on some inappropriate choice nonvor miles interpreted this or worse maybe even a mere tech who knew vorthys permitted himself one tiny ironic glint ah yes until his auditorial apotheosis three years ago so startling to his relatives vorthys had had a most unvorish career himself and marriage and hed started both back when the old vor were a lot more old vor than they were nowmiles thought of his grandfather by way of exemplar and suppressed a shudder and the marriage seemed to start out well the professor went on she seemed busy and happy there was little nikki come along tien changed jobs rather often i thought but he was new in his career sometimes it takes a few false starts to find your legs ekaterin grew out of touch with us but when we did see her she was quieter tien never did settle down always chasing some rainbow no one else could see i think all the moves were hard on her he frowned as if thinking back for missed clues miles did not dare explain about the vorzohns dystrophy without ekaterins express permission he decided it was not his right he confined himself to remarking i think ekaterin may feel free to explain more of it now the professor squinted worriedly at him oh i wonder what answers id get to those same questions if i could ask the professora miles shook his head and went to call ekaterin to the comconsole ekaterin he tasted the syllables of her name in his mind it had been so easy speaking with her uncle to slip into the familiar form but she had not yet invited him to use her first name her late husband had called her kat a pet name a little name as if he hadnt had time to pronounce the whole thing or wished to be bothered it was true her full array ekaterin nile vorvayne vorsoisson made an impractical mouthful but ekaterin was light on the teeth and the tip of the tongue yet elegant and dignified and entirely worth an extra second of of anyones time madame vorsoisson he called quietly down the hall she emerged from her workroom he gestured to the secured vidlink her face was grave and her steps reluctant he closed the office door softly on her and left her and her uncle in private privacy was going to be a rare and precious element for her in the days to come he could foresee the repair tech arrived at last along with another duty guard miles took them aside for a word i want you both to stay here till i get back understand madame vorsoisson is not to be left unguarded um when youre done with the door find out from her if there are any other repairs she needs done around here and take care of them for her yes my lord trailed by his own guard miles took himself off to the terraforming project offices he passed impsec guards on the bubblecar platform in the building lobby and at the corridor entrances to terraformings floors miles was put glumly in mind of an old vor aphorism about posting a guard on the picket line after the horses were stolen once within the impsec personnel shifted from steelyeyed goons to intent techs and clerks efficiently downloading comconsoles and examining files terraforming project employees watched them in suppressed terror miles found colonel gibbs set up in vorsoissons outer office with his own imported comconsole planted firmly therein rather to his surprise the rabbity venier was dancing worried attendance upon the impsec financial analyst venier shot miles a look of dislike as he strode in good morning vennie i didnt expect to see you somehow miles greeted him cordially he was oddly glad the fellow hadnt been one of soudhas hello colonel im vorkosigan sorry for dragging you out on such short notice my lord auditor i am at your disposal gibbs stood formally and took miless proffered hand for a dry handshake gibbs was a delight to miless eye a spare middleaged man with graying hair and a meticulous manner who despite his imperial undress greens looked every bit an accountant even having held his new rank for almost three whole months it still felt odd to miles to accept the older mans deference i trust captain tuomonen has briefed you and passed on the interesting data packet we acquired last night gibbs drawing up a chair for the lord auditor nodded venier took the opportunity to excuse himself and fled without further prompting at gibbs wave of permission they seated themselves and miles went on how are you doing so far he glanced at the stacks of flimsies the comconsole desk had already acquired gibbs gave him a faint smile for the first three hours work i am reasonably pleased we have managed to sort out most of waste heat managements fictitious employees i expect tracking their false accounts to go quickly your madame foscols report on the late administrator vorsoissons receipts is very clear verifying its truth should not present a serious problem be very cautious about any data which may have passed through her hands miles warned oh yes shes quite good i suspect i am going to find it a pleasure and a privilege to work with her if you take my meaning my lord gibbs eyes glinted so nice to meet a man who loves his job well hed asked solstice hq to send him their best dont speak too soon about foscol i have what promises to be a tedious request for you ah in addition to fictitious employees i have reason to believe waste heat made a lot of fictitious equipment purchases phony invoices and the like yes ive turned up three dummy companies they appear to have used for them already that was quick how i ran a data match of all invoices paid by the terraforming project with a list of all real companies in the tax registry of the empire not you understand routine for inhouse audits though i believe ill forward a suggestion that it should be added to the list of procedures in future there were three companies left over my field people are checking them out i should have confirmation for you by the end of today it is i believe not excessively optimistic to hope we may track every missing mark in a week my most urgent concern is not actually the money gibbs brows rose at this miles forged on soudha and his coconspirators also left with a large amount of equipment it has crossed my mind that if we had a reliable list of waste heats equipment and supply purchases and subtracted from it the current physical inventory of whats out there at their experiment station the remainder ought to include everything they took with them so it should gibbs eyed him with approval its a bruteforce approach miles said apologetically and not alas quite as simple as a data match that murmured gibbs is why enlisted men were invented they smiled at each other in pleased understanding miles continued this will only work if the supply list is truly accurate i want you to hunt particularly for phony invoices covering real but nonstandard nonaccounted equipment purchases i want to know if soudha smuggled in anything odd gibbss head tilted in interest his eyes narrowed thoughtfully easy enough for them to have used their dummy companies also to launder those if you find anything like that redflag it and notify myself or lord auditor vorthys at once and especially if you turn up any matches with the equipment vorthyss probablecause crew are presently finding at the site of the soletta accident ah the connection begins to come clear i must say i had been wondering why this intense imperial interest in a mere embezzlement scheme though its a very nice embezzlement scheme he hastened to assure miles professional quite consider that equipment list your top priority please colonel very good my lord leaving gibbs frowningrather interestedly miles thought at a fountain of data displays on his comconsole miles went to find tuomonen the tiredlooking impsec captain reported no surprises uncovered so far this morning the field agents had not yet picked up soudhas trail hq had sent in a major with an interrogation unit who had taken over the systematic examination of the departments remaining employees the inquisition was now going on in the conference chamber but its going to take days to work through them all tuomonen added do you still want to do madame vorsoisson this afternoon tuomonen rubbed his face yes in all ill be sitting in tuomonen hesitated that is your privilege my lord miles considered going to watch the employee interrogations but decided that in his current physical state he would not contribute anything coherent everything seemed to be under control for the moment except for himself the mornings painkillers were beginning to wear off and the corridor was getting wavery around the edges if he was going to be useful to anyone later in the day hed better give his battered body a rest ill see you back at madame vorsoissons then he told tuomonen chapter thirteen ekaterin seated herself at the comconsole in her workroom and began to triage the shambles of her life it was actually simpler than her first fears had supposedthere was so little of it after all how did i grow so small she made a list of her resources at the top and most vital medical care for the dependents of a deceased project employee was guaranteed till the end of the quarter a few weeks away yet a time window of sorts she counted the days in her head it would be time enough for nikki if she didnt waste any a few hundred marks remained in her household account and a few hundred marks in tiens her use of this apartment also ran till the end of the quarter when she must vacate it to make way for the next administrator to be appointed to tiens position that was fine she didnt want to stay here longer no pension of course she grimaced guaranteed passage back to barrayar unavailable while tien was alive was due her and nikki as another death benefit and thank heavens tien hadnt figured out how to cash that in the physical objects she owned were more burden than asset given that she must transport them by jumpship the free weight limit was not generous shed apportion nikki the bulk of their weight allowance his little treasures meant more to him than most of her larger ones did to her it was stupid to let herself feel overwhelmed by a few rooms of things shed been willing to abandon altogether bare hours ago she could still abandon them if she chose shed frequented a certain secondhand shop in a seedier part of the dome to clothe herself and nikki she could sell tiens clothing and ordinary effects there a chore which need only take a few hours for herself she longed to travel light on the other side of the ledger her debts too were simple if overwhelming first were the twenty thousand marks tien had borrowed and not paid back thenwas she honorbound for the sake of vor pride and nikkis family name to make restitution to the imperium for the bribe money tien had accepted well you cant do it today pass on to what you can do she had researched the medical resources on komarr for treating genetic disorders till the information had worn grooves in her brain fantasized solutions that tiens paranoiasand his legal control of his heirhad blocked her from carrying out technically nikkis legal guardian now was some male third cousin of tiens back on barrayar whom ekaterin had never met nikki not being heir to a fortune or a countship the transfer of his guardianship back to her was probably hers for the asking she would deal with that legal kink later too for now it took her something under nine minutes to contact the top clinic on komarr in solstice and browbeat them into setting up nikkis first appointment for the day after tomorrow instead of the five weeks from today they first tried to offer her yes so simple she shook with a spasm of rage at tien and at herself this could have been done months ago when theyd first come to komarr as easily as this if only shed mustered the courage to defy tien next she must notify tiens mother his closest living relative ekaterin could leave it to her to spread the news to tiens more distant relatives back on barrayar not feeling up to recording a vid message she put it in writing hoping it would not appear too cold an accident with a breath mask which tien had failed to check nothing about the komarrans nothing about the embezzlement nothing to which impsec could object tiens mother might never need to know of tiens dishonor ekaterin humbly requested her preferences as to ceremonies and the disposition of the remains most likely she would want them returned to barrayar to bury beside tiens brother ekaterin could not help imagining her own feelings in some future scene if she entrusted nikki to his bride with all bright promise only to have him returned to her later as a heap of ashes in a box with a note no she would have to see this through in person all that also must come later she sent the message on its way the physical was easy she could be finished and packed in a week the financial was no not impossible just not possible to solve at once presumably she must take out a loan on longer terms to pay off the first oneassuming anyone would loan money to a destitute and unemployed widow tiens antilegacy clouded the glimmerings of the new future she ached to claim for herself she imagined a bird released from ten years in a cage told she could at last fly freeas soon as these lead weights were attached to her feet this birds going to get there if she has to walk every step the comconsole chimed startling her from this determined reverie a man soberly dressed in the komarran style appeared over the vidplate at her touch he wasnt anyone she knew from tiens department how do you do maam he said looking at her uncertainly my name is ser anafi and i represent the rialto sharemarket agency im trying to reach etienne vorsoisson she recognized the name of the company whose money tien had lost on the trade fleet shares hes not available im madame vorsoisson what is your question anafis gaze at her grew more stern this is the fourth reminder notice of his outstanding loan balance now overdue he must either pay in full or take immediate action to set up a new repayment schedule how do you normally set up such a schedule anafi appeared surprised at this measured response had he dealt with tien before this he unbent slightly leaning back in his chair well we normally calculate a percentage of the customers salary mitigated by any available collateral they may be able to offer i have no salary i have no possessions anafi she suspected would not be pleased to learn this tien died in an accident last night things are in some disarray here today anafi looked taken aback oh im sorry madame he managed i dont suppose was the loan insured ill check madame vorsoisson let us hope anafi turned to his comconsole after a moment he frowned im sorry to say it was not ah tien how should i pay it back anafi was silent a long moment as if thinking if you would be willing to cosign for the loan i could set up a payment schedule today for you you can do that at a tentative knock on the door frame of her workroom she glanced around lord vorkosigan had returned and stood leaning in the opening how long had he been standing there he gestured inside and she nodded he walked in and eyed anafi over her shoulder who is this guy he murmured his names anafi hes from the company tien owes for the fleet shares loan ah allow me he stepped up to the comconsole and tapped in a code the view split and a grayhaired man with colonels tabs and eyeofhorus pins on his green uniform collar appeared colonel gibbs said lord vorkosigan genially i have some more data for you regarding administrator vorsoissons financial affairs ser anafi meet colonel gibbs impsec he has a few questions for you good day impsec said anafi in startled horror impsec what does he blipped out at lord vorkosigans flourishing gesture no more anafi he said with some satisfaction not for the next several days anyway now was that nice asked ekaterin amused in spite of herself they loaned that money to tien in all good faith nevertheless dont sign anything till you take legal advice if you knew nothing of the loan its possible tiens estate is liable for it and not you his creditors must squabble with each other for the pieces and when its gone its gone but theres nothing in tiens estate but debts and dishonor then the squabble will be short but is it fair death is an ordinary business riskin some businesses more than others of coursehe smiled briefly ser anafi was getting ready to have you sign on the spot this suggests to me that he was perfectly aware of his risk and thought he might hustle you into taking over a debt not rightfully yours while you were still in shock not fair in fact not ethical at all yes i think we can leave him to impsec this was all rather highhanded but it was hard not to respond to the enthusiastic glint in vorkosigans eye as hed annihilated her adversary thank you lord vorkosigan but i really need to learn how to do these things for myself oh yes he agreed without the least hesitation i wish tsipis were here hes been my familys man of business for thirty years he adores tutoring the uninitiated if i could turn him loose on you youd be up to speed in no time and hed be just ecstatic im afraid he found me a frustrating pupil in my youth i only wanted to learn about the military he finally managed to smuggle in some economic education by presenting it as logistics and supply problems he leaned against the comconsole desk and crossed his arms and tilted his head do you think you will be returning to barrayar anytime soon just as soon as i possibly can i can hardly bear being in this place i think i understand where ah would you go on barrayar she stared broodingly at the empty vidplate im not sure yet not to my fathers household to be crammed back into the status of a child again she pictured herself arriving penniless and without resources to batten upon her father or one of her brothers theyd let her batten all right generously but they would also act as if her dependence deprived her of rights and dignity and even intelligence they would then arrange her life for her own good im sure id be welcome but im afraid his solution to my problems would be to try to marry me off again the idea makes me gag just now oh said lord vorkosigan a brief silence fell what would you do if you could do anything he asked suddenly no limited resources to juggle no practical considerations anything at all i dont i usually start with the possible and pare away from there try for more scope a vague wave of his arm taking in the planet from zenith to horizon indicated his idea of scope she thought back all the way back to the point in her life where she had made that fatal wrong turn so many years lost well i suppose i would go back to university but this time id know what i was about formal training in horticulture and in art for garden design chemistry and biochemistry and botany and genetic manipulation real expertise the kind that means you cant be intimidated or or persuaded to go along with something stupid because you think everyone in the universe knows more than you do she frowned ruefully so you could design gardens for pay more than that her eyes narrowed as she struggled for her inner vision planets terraforming oh good heavens that training takes ten years and another ten years of internship beyond it before you can even begin to grasp the complexities so they have to hire someone good god they hired tien he was only an administrator she shook her head daunted all right he said cheerfully bigger than a garden smaller than a planet that still leaves sufficient scope id say a barrayaran district could be a good start one with incomplete terraforming say and and forestry projects and oh damaged land reclamation and a crying need for a touch of beauty and he went on you could work up to planets she had to laugh what is this obsession with planets will nothing smaller do for you elli qua friend of mine used to say aim high you may still miss the target but at least you wont shoot your foot off his grin winked at her he hesitated then said more slowly you know your father and brothers arent your only relatives the professor and the professora are boundless in their enthusiasm for education you cant convince me they wouldnt be pleased to shelter you and nikki in their home while you got your new start and youd be right there in vorbarr sultana practically next door to the university and um everything good schools for nikki she sighed it would be such a lovely change for him to stay in one place for a while he could finally cultivate friends he wouldnt have to abandon but ive come to despise dependency he eyed her shrewdly because it betrayed you or lured me into betraying myself mm but surely there is a qualitative difference between um a greenhouse and a cryochamber both provide shelter but the first promotes growth while the second merely um he seemed to have become a little tangled in his metaphor retards decay ekaterin politely tried to help unwind him just so his brief grin again anyway im pretty sure the professors are a human greenhouse all those studentstheyre used to people growing up and moving on they regard it as normal id think youd like it there he wandered to her window and glanced out i did like it there she admitted wistfully then it all sounds perfectly possible to me good thats settled have you had lunch what she laughed and clutched her hair lunch he repeated deadpan many people eat it at about this time of day youre mad she said with conviction ignoring this willful piece of misdirection do you always dispose of peoples futures in that offhand fashion only when im hungry she gave up i suppose i have something i can fix certainly not he said indignantly i sent a minion i just spotted him returning across the park with a very promising large bag the guards have to eat too you see she contemplated briefly the spectacle of a man who casually sent impsec for carryout there probably were security concerns about meals on duty at that she let vorkosigan shepherd her into her own kitchen where they selected from a dozen containers ekaterin snitched a flaky apricot tart to set aside for nikki and they sent the remainder to the living room for the guards to picnic off the only thing vorkosigan permitted her to do was supply fresh tea did you find out anything new this morning she asked him when they were settled at the table she tried not to think about her last conversation here with tien oh yes i want to go home any word on soudha and foscol not yet part of me expects impsec to catch up with them at any moment part of me is not so optimistic i keep wondering just how long they had to plan their departure well i dont think they were expecting imperial auditors to arrive in serifosa that at least came as a surprise to them hm ah i know why this whole thing feels so odd its as though my entire brain is suffering a time lag and its not just the bloody seizures im on the wrong side im on the damned defense not the offense one step behind all the time reacting not actingand im horribly afraid it may be an intrinsic condition of my new job he downed a bite of sandwich unless i can sell gregor on the idea of an auditor provocateur well anyway i did have one idea which i propose to spring on your uncle when he gets downside he paused silence fell after a moment he added if you make an encouraging noise ill go on hed caught her with her mouth full hmm lovely yes you see suppose suppose this thing of soudhas is more than a mere embezzlement scheme maybe they were diverting all those imperial funds to support a real research and development project although nothing to do with waste heat management it may be a prejudice of my military background but i keep thinking they might have been building a weapon some new variation on the gravitic imploder lance i dont know he gulped tea i never had the impression that soudha or any of the other komarrans in the terraforming project were very militaryminded quite the opposite they neednt be for an act of sabotage some grand stupid vile gesturei keep worrying about gregors wedding coming up soudha isnt grandiose said ekaterin slowly nor vile particularly she didnt doubt that tiens death had been unintended nor stupid vorkosigan sighed regretfully i merely suggest that timetable to make myself nervous keeps me awake but suppose it was a weapon did they perhaps attack that ore ship as a test vile enough did their smoke test go very wrong was the subsequent damage to the mirror accidental or deliberate or was it the other way around the condition of radovass body suggests something backfired a fallingout among thieves anyway to anchor this spate of speculation to some sort of physical fact i plan to get a list of every piece of equipment soudha bought for his department subtract from it everything they left there and produce a parts list for their secret weapon at this point my brilliance fails and i plan to dump it on your uncle oh said ekaterin hell like that hell growl at you is that a good sign yes hm so positing a secretweapon sabotageattack how close are they to success i keep coming backsorryto foscols odd behavior in providing that data packet of evidence against tien it seems to proclaim it doesnt matter if the komarrans are incriminated becausefill in the blank because why because they will not be here to suffer the consequences that suggests flight which runs counter to the weapon hypothesis which requires that they linger to use it or that they believed you would not be here to inflict the consequences said ekaterin had they meant vorkosigan to die too or what oh nice thats reassuring he bit rather aggressively into the last of his sandwich she rested her chin on her hand and regarded him with wry curiosity does impsec know you babble like this only when im very tired besides i like to think out loud it slows it down so i can get a good look at it it gives you some idea of what living in my head is like i admit very few people can stand to listen at length he shot her an odd sideways look indeed whenever his animation slowedwhich was not oftena gray weariness flashed underneath anyway you encouraged me you sang hmm she stared in amused indignation and refused to rise to the bait sorry he said in a smaller voice i think im a little disoriented just now he gave her an apologetic grimace i actually came back here to rest is that not sensible of me i must be getting old both their lives were out of phase with their chronological ages ekaterin realized bemusedly she now possessed the education of a child and the status of a dowager vorkosigan was young for his post to be sure but this whole posthumous second life of his was surely as old as you could be at any age time is out of joint she murmured he looked up sharply and seemed about to speak voices from the vestibule interrupted whatever hed been about to say ekaterins head turned tuomonen so soon do you want to put this off vorkosigan asked her she shook her head no i want to get it over with i want to go get nikki ah he drained his tea mug and rose and they both went out to her living room it was indeed captain tuomonen he nodded to vorkosigan and greeted her politely he had brought a female medtech with him in the uniform of the barrayaran military medical auxiliary whom he also introduced she carried a medkit which she placed on the round table and opened ampoules and hyposprays glittered in their gel slots other firstaid supplies hinted at more sinister possibilities tuomonen indicated ekaterin should sit on the circular couch are you ready madame vorsoisson i suppose so ekaterin watched with concealed fear and some loathing as the medtech loaded her hypospray and showed it to tuomonen to crosscheck the medtech laid a second hypospray out at the ready and pulled a small burrlike patch off a plastic strip would you hold out your wrist madame ekaterin did so the woman pressed the allergy test patch firmly against her skin then peeled it up again she continued to hold ekaterins wrist while she marked time on her chrono her fingers were dry and cold tuomonen dispatched the two guards to the perimeter namely the hallway and the balcony and set up a vid recorder on a tripod he then turned to vorkosigan and with a rather odd emphasis said may i remind you lord vorkosigan that more than one questioner can create unnecessary confusion in a fastpenta interrogation vorkosigan gave him an acknowledging hand wave quite i know the drill go ahead captain tuomonen glanced at the medtech who stared closely at ekaterins wrist then released it shes clear the woman reported proceed please at the medtechs direction ekaterin rolled up her sleeve the hypospray hissed against her skin with a cold bite count backwards slowly from ten tuomonen told her ten ekaterin said obediently nine eight seven chapter fourteen two one ekaterins voice almost inaudible at first grew more firm as she counted down miles thought he could almost mark ekaterins heartbeats as the drug flooded her system her tightly clenched hands loosened in her lap tension in her face neck shoulders and body melted away like snow in the sun her eyes widened and brightened her pale cheeks flushed with soft color her lips parted and curved and she looked up at miles beyond tuomonen with an astonished sunny smile oh she said in a surprised voice it doesnt hurt no fastpenta doesnt hurt said tuomonen in a level reassuring tone that isnt what she means tuomonen if a person lived in hurt like a mermaid in water till hurt became as invisible as breath its sudden removalhowever artificialmust come as a stunning event miles breathed covert relief that ekaterin apparently wasnt going to be a giggler or a drooler nor was she one of the occasional unfortunates in whom the drug released a torrent of verbal obscenities or an almost equally embarrassing torrent of tears no the kicker here is going to be when we take it away again the realization chilled him but my god isnt she beautiful when she is not in pain her open smiling warmth looked strangely familiar to him and he tried to remember just when hed seen that sweet air about her before not today not yesterday it was in your dream oh he sat back and rested his chin in his hand fingers across his mouth as tuomonen started down the list of standard neutral questions name birth date parents names the usual the purpose was not only to give the drug time to take full effect but also to set up a rhythm of questionandanswer which would help carry the interrogation along when the questions and answers became more difficult ekaterins birthday was just three weeks before his own miles noted in passing but the war of vordarians pretendership which had so disrupted their mutual birth year in the regions around vorbarr sultana had scarcely touched the south continent the medtech had settled herself on a chair drawn up outside the conversation circle out of the line of sight between interrogator and subject but not alas entirely out of earshot miles trusted she had suitable top security clearances he didnt know and decided not to ask if her gender represented delicacy on tuomonens part tacit acknowledgment that a fastpenta interrogation could be a mindrape physical brutality did not mix with fastpenta interrogation which had helped to eliminate certain unsavory psychological types from successful careers as interrogators but physical assault was not the only possible kind nor even necessarily the worst or maybe shed just been next up on the roster of available personnel tuomonen moved on to more recent history exactly when had tien acquired his komarran post and how had he known anyone in his departmenttobe or met with anyone in soudhas group before theyd left barrayar no had she seen any of his correspondence ekaterin growing ever more cheerful in fastpenta elation rattled on as confidingly as a child shed been so excited about the appointment about the promised proximity to good medical facilities certain she would get galacticclass help for nikki at last she had agonized over tiens application and helped him to write it well yes written most of it for him serifosa dome was fascinating and their assigned apartment much larger and nicer than shed been led to expect tien said the komarrans were all technosnobs but she had not found them to be so gently tuomonen led her back to the issue at hand just when had she discovered her husbands involvement in the embezzlement scheme and how she repeated the same story about tiens midnight call to soudha she had given miles last night larded with more extraneous detailsamong other things she insisted on giving tuomonen a complete recipe for spiced brandied milk fastpenta did do odd things to ones memory even though it did not despite rumor give one perfect recall her report of the overheard conversation sounded nearly verbatim though despite his obvious fatigue tuomonen was skillful and patient allowing her to ramble on at length alert for the hidden gem of critical information in these flowing associations an interrogator always hoped would turn up but usually didnt her description of breaking into her husbands comconsole the following morning included the mulish side comment if lord vorkosigan could do it i could do it which at tuomonens alert query triggered an embarrassing detour into her views of miless earlier impsecstyle raid on her own comconsole miles bit his lip and met tuomonens raised brows blandly he did say he liked my gardens though nobody else in my family wants to even look at them she sighed and smiled shyly at miles dared he hope he was forgiven tuomonen consulted his plastic flimsy if you didnt discover your husbands debts until yesterday morning why did you transfer almost four thousand marks into his account on the previous morning his attention sharpened at ekaterins look of drunken dismay he lied to me bastard said we were going for the galactic treatment no he didnt say it damn it fool me i wanted it to be true so much better a fool than a liar is it i didnt want to be like him tuomonen sought enlightenment of miles with a quick baffled glance miles blew out his breath ask her if it was nikkis money nikkis money she confirmed with a quick nod despite the fastpenta wooze she frowned fiercely this make sense to you my lord tuomonen murmured im afraid so she had saved just that sum out of her household accounts toward her sons medical treatment i saw the account in her files when i was taking that um unfortunate tour i take it that her husband claiming to be using it for that purpose instead relieved her of it to stave off his creditors embezzlement indeed miles exhaled to bring his blood pressure back down have you traced it tien transferred it upon receipt to the rialto sharemarket agency theres no getting it back i suppose ask gibbs but i dont think so ah miles bit his knuckle and nodded for tuomonen to proceed now armed with the right questions tuomonen confirmed this interpretation explicitly and went on to draw out all the intensely personal details about the vorzohns dystrophy in exactly the same neutral tone tuomonen asked did you arrange your husbands death no ekaterin sighed did you ask anyone or pay anyone to kill him no did you know he was to be killed no fastpenta frequently made subjects bloody literalminded you always asked the important questions the ones you were hot about in a number of different ways to be sure did you kill him yourself no did you love him ekaterin hesitated miles frowned facts were impsecs rightful prey feelings maybe less so but tuomonen wasnt quite out of line yet i think i did once i must have i remember the wonderful look on his face the day nikki was born i must have he wore it out i can hardly remember that time did you hate him no yes i dont know he wore that out too she looked earnestly at tuomonen he never hit me you know what an obituary when i go down into the ground at last as god is my judge i pray my bestbeloved may have better to say of me than he didnt hit me miles set his jaw and said nothing are you sorry he died watch it tuomonen oh but it was such a relief what a nightmare today would have been if tien were still alive though i suppose impsec would have taken him away theft and treason but i would have had to go see him lord vorkosigan said i could not have saved him there was not enough time after foscol called me im so glad its so ugly to be so glad i suppose i should forgive tien for everything because hes dead now but ill never forgive him for turning me into something so ugly despite the drug tears were leaking from her eyes now i didnt use to be this kind of person but now i cant go back some truths cut deeper than even fastpenta could soak expressionlessly miles reached past tuomonen and handed ekaterin a tissue she blotted the moisture in owlish distress does she need more drug the medtech whispered no miles made a handdown gesture for silence tuomonen asked some more neutral questions till something like his subjects original sunny and confiding air returned yeah nobody should have to do this much truth all at once tuomonen looked at his flimsy glanced uneasily at miles licked his lips and said your cases and lord vorkosigans were found together in your vestibule were you planning to leave together shock and fury flushed through miles in a hot wave tuomonen you dare but the memory of sorting through all that mixed underwear under the eye of the impsec guard stopped his words so yes it could have looked odd to someone who didnt know what was going on he converted his boiling words to a slow breath which he let out in a trickle tuomonens eyes flicked sideways wary of that sigh ekaterin blinked at him in some confusion id hoped to what oh she means at the same time miles gritted through his teeth to tuomonen not together try that was lord vorkosigan planning to take you away away oh what a lovely idea nobody was taking me away who would i had to take myself away tien threw my aunts skellytum over the balcony but he didnt quite dare throw me he wanted to i think miles was diverted to brood on these last words how much physical courage had it taken her to stand up to tien at the last miles did not underestimate just what nerve it took to face down large angry men who had the power to pick you up and pitch you across the room nerve and wit and never letting yourself get within arms reach nor blocked from the door the calculations were automatic and you had to stay in practice for ekaterin it must have felt like landing a fullyloaded freight shuttle on her very first flying lesson tuomonen trying desperately for clarity and still with one eye on miles repeated were you going to elope with lord vorkosigan her brows flew up no she said in astonishment no of course not miles tried to recapture his first properly stunned reaction to the accusation except that it now came out what a great idea why didnt i think of it which rather blunted the fine edge of his outrage anyway shed never have run off with him it was all he could do to get a barrayaran woman to walk down the street with a sawedoff mutie like him oh hell have you fallen in love with this woman idiot boy um yeah hed been falling for days he realized in retrospect it was just that hed finally hit the ground he should have recognized the symptoms oh tuomonen the things we learn under fastpenta he could finally see what tuomonen was getting at though all complete a nice neat little conspiracy murder tien blame it on the komarrans run off with his wife over his dead body a most flattering scenario tuomonen miles breathed to the impsec captain quick work on my part considering i only met her five days ago i thank you was ever woman in this humor wooed was ever woman in this humor won i think not tuomonen shot him a flatlipped glower if my guard could think of it and i could think of it so could someone else best to knock the notion in the head as soon as possible its not as though i could fastpenta you my lord no not even if miles volunteered his known idiosyncratic reaction to the drug so historically useful in evading hostile interrogation also made it impossible for him to use it to clear himself of any accusation tuomonen was just doing his job and doing it well miles leaned back and growled yeah yeah all right but youre optimistic if you think even fastpenta is fast enough to compete with titillating rumor as a courtesy to his imperial majestys auditors reputations do have a word with that guard of yours after this tuomonen didnt argue or pretend to misunderstand yes my lord temporarily undirected ekaterin was burbling along on her freeassociation tangent i wonder if the scars below his belt are as interesting as the ones above i could hardly have got him out of his trousers in that bubblecar i suppose i had a chance last night and i didnt even think of it mutie vor how does he do it i wonder what it would be like to sleep with someone you actually liked stop said tuomonen belatedly she fell silent and blinked at him just when it was getting really interesting miles quelled a narcissistic or perhaps masochistic impulse to encourage her to go on in this strain hed invited himself along on this interrogation to keep impsec from abusing its opportunities im finished my lord tuomonen said aside to him in a low voice he did not quite meet miless eyes is there anything else you think i should ask or that you wish to ask could you ever love me ekaterin alas questions of future probability were unanswerable even under fastpenta no i would ask you to note nothing shes said under fastpenta substantially contradicts anything shes told us straight out the two versions are in fact unusually congruent compared to other interrogations in my experience mine as well tuomonen allowed very good he motioned to the silently waiting medtech go ahead and administer the antagonist the woman stepped forward adjusted the new hypospray and pressed it against the inside of ekaterins arm the lizardhiss of the antidrug going in licked miless ears he counted ekaterins heartbeats again one two three it was a horribly vampiric thing to watch as if life itself were being sucked out of her her shoulders drew in her whole body hunched in renewed tension and she buried her face in her hands when she raised it again it was flushed and damp and strained but she was not weeping merely utterly exhausted and closed again he had thought she would weep fastpenta doesnt hurt eh couldnt prove it now oh milady can i ever make you look that happy without drugs of more immediate importance would she forgive him for being a party to her ordeal what a very odd experience madame vorsoisson said neutrally her voice was hoarse it was a wellconducted interview miles assured the room at random all things considered ive seen much worse tuomonen gave him a dry look and turned to ekaterin thank you madame vorsoisson for your cooperation this has been extremely useful to the investigation tell the investigation it is welcome miles was not just sure how to interpret that one instead he said to tuomonen that will be all for her wont it tuomonen hesitated obviously trying to sort out whether that was a question or an order i hope so my lord ekaterin looked across at miles im sorry about the suitcases lord vorkosigan i never thought how it might look no why should you have he hoped his voice didnt sound as hollow as it felt tuomonen said to ekaterin i both suggest and request you rest for a while madame vorsoisson my medtech will stay with you for about half an hour to be sure youre fully recovered and dont have any further drug reactions yes i that would probably be wise captain rubberylegged she rose the medtech went to her side and escorted her off toward her bedroom tuomonen shut down his vid recorder he said gruffly sorry about that last round of questions my lord auditor it was not my intention to offer an insult to either you or madame vorsoisson yeah well dont worry about it whats next from impsecs point of view tuomonens weary brow wrinkled im not sure i wanted to make certain i conducted this interrogation myself colonel gibbs has everything in hand at the terraforming offices and major demorie hasnt called to complain yet about anything at the experiment station what we need next preferably is for the field agents to catch up with soudha and his friends i cant be in all three places miles said reluctantly barring an arrest coming through the professor is en route and has had the advantage of a full nights sleep you i believe have had none my field instincts say this is the time to knock off for a while do i need to make that an order no tuomonen assured him earnestly you have your wristcomm i have mine field has our numbers and orders to report the news ill be glad to get home for a meal even if it is last nights dinner and a shower he rubbed his stubbled chin he finished packing the recorder exchanged farewells with miles and went off to consult with his guards hopefully to apprise them of madame vorsoissons change of status from suspectwitness to free woman miles considered the couch rejected it and wandered into ekaterinsmadame vorsoissons ekaterins dammit in his mind if not on his lipsekaterins workroom automatic lighting still sustained the assortment of young plantings on the trellised shelves in the corners the gravbed was gone oh yes hed forgotten shed had it removed the floor looked remarkably inviting though a flash of scarlet in the trash bin caught his eye investigating he found the remains of the bonsaid skellytum bundled up in a square of plastic sheeting mixed with pieces of its pot and damp loose dirt curiously he dug it out and cleared a place on ekaterins work table and unrolled the plastic botanical body bag he supposed the fragments put him in mind of the soletta array and the ore ship and also of a couple of the more distressing autopsies hed recently reviewed methodically he began to sort them out broken tendrils in one pile root threads in another shards of the poor burst barrel of the thing in another the fivefloor plunge had had something of the same effect on the liquidconserving central structure of the skellytum as a sledgehammer applied to a watermelon or a needlegrenade exploding inside someones chest he picked out sharp potsherds and made tentative tries at piecing the bits of plant into place like a jigsaw puzzle was there a botanical equivalent of surgical glue which could hold it all together again and allow it to heal or was it too late a brownish tinge to the pale interior lumps suggested rot already in progress he brushed the damp soil from his fingers and realized suddenly that he was touching barrayar this bit of dirt had come from south continent dug up perhaps from a tart old vor ladys backyard he dragged over the station chair from the comconsole climbed precariously up onto it and retrieved what proved to be an empty pan from an upper shelf safely on his feet again he carefully gathered up as much of the soil as he could and dumped it in the pan he stood back hands on his hips and studied his work so far it made a sad pile compost my barrayaran friend youre destined to be compost for all of me a decent burial may be all i can do for you though in your case that might actually be the answer to your prayers a faint rustle and an indrawn breath made him suddenly aware that he was not alone he turned his head to find ekaterin on her feet again and pausing in the doorway her color looked better now than it had immediately after the interrogation her skin not so puffy and lined though she still looked very tired her brows were drawn down in puzzlement what are you doing lord vorkosigan um visiting a sick friend reddening he gestured to his efforts laid out on her work bench has the medtech released you yes shes just left she was very conscientious miles cleared his throat i was wondering if there was any way to put your skellytum back together seemed a shame not to try seventy years old and all that he drew back respectfully as she came up to the bench and turned over a fragment i know you cant sew it up like a person but i cant help thinking there ought to be something im afraid im not much of a gardener my parents let me try once when i was a little kid back behind vorkosigan house i was going to grow flowers for my betan mother sergeant bothari ended up doing the spade work as i recall i dug the seeds up twice a day to see if theyd sprouted yet my plants did not thrive for some reason after that we gave up and turned it into a fort she smiled a real smile not a fastpenta grin we did not break her after all no you cant put it back together she said the only way is to start over what i could do is take the strongest root fragmentsseveral of them to make sure her long hands sorted through his pile and set them to soak in a hormone solution and then when it starts to put out new growth repot it i saved the dirt miles pointed out hopefully idiot do you know what an idiot you sound like but she merely said thank you following up on her words she rummaged in her shelves and found a shallow basin and filled it with water from the work benchs little sink another cupboard yielded a box of white powder she sprinkled a tiny amount into the water and stirred it with her fingers taking a knife from her tool drawer she trimmed the most promising root fragments and pushed them into the solution there maybe something will come of that she stretched to set the basin carefully out of the way on the shelf miles had had to reach by standing on the chair and shook the pan of dirt into a plastic bag which she sealed and put next to the basin she then rolled up the decaying remains in their tarp again to take over and shake into another bin the plastic went back into the trash by the time id thought of this poor skellytum again it would have gone out with the organic recycle and been too late id abandoned hope for it last night when i thought i had to leave with just what i could carry i didnt mean to burden you will it be awkward to carry home on the jumpship ill put it in a sealed container by the time i reach my destination it should be just about ready to replant she washed and dried her hands miles followed suit damn tuomonen anyway for forcing to miless consciousness a desire his backbrain had known very well was too unripe and out of season for any fruitful result time is out of joint shed said now he was going to have to deal with it now he was going to have to wait how long how about until after tien is buried for starters his intentions were honorable enough at least some of them were but his timing was lousy he shoved his hands deep into his pockets and rocked on his heels ekaterin folded her arms leaned against the counter and stared at the floor i wish to apologize lord vorkosigan for anything i might have said under fastpenta that was not appropriate miles shrugged i invited myself along but i thought you could use a spotter you did as much for me after all a spotter she looked up her expression lightening i had not thought of it like that he opened his hand and smiled hopefully she smiled briefly in return but then sighed id been so frantic all day for impsec to be done so i could go get nikki now i think they were doing me a favor i dread this part i dont know what to tell him i dont know how much i should tell him about tiens mess as little as possible the whole truth neither feels right miles said slowly were still in the middle of a classified case here you cant burden a nineyearold boy with government secrets or that kind of judgment call i dont even know yet how much of this will eventually become public knowledge things not done right away get harder she sighed as im finding now miles drew up the comconsole chair for her and motioned her into it and pulled out the stool from under the work bench he perched on it and asked had you told him you were leaving tien not even that yet i think that for today you should only tell him that his father suffered an accident with his breath mask leave the komarrans out of it if he asks for more details than you know how to deal with send him to me and ill take the job of telling him he cant know or cant know yet her level look asked can i trust you take care you dont stir up more curiosity than you quell i understand the problem of the whole truth is as much a question of when as what but after we both get back to vorbarr sultana i would like with your permission to take you to talk with grwith a close friend of mine hes vor too he had the experience of being in something like nikkis position his father died under ah grievous circumstances when he was much too young to be told the details when he stumbled across some of the uglier facts in his early twenties it was pretty traumatic ill bet hell have a better feel than either of us for what to tell nikki and when he has a fine judgment she gave him a provisional nod that sounds right i would like that very much thank you he returned her a halfbow from his perch glad to be of service madame hed wanted to introduce her to gregor the man his fosterbrother not emperor gregor the imperial icon anyway this might serve more than one purpose i also have to tell nikki about his vorzohns dystrophy and i cant put that off i made an appointment for him at a clinic in solstice for the day after tomorrow he does not know he carries it she shook her head tien would never let me tell him she studied him gravely i think you were in something like nikkis position too when you were a child did you have to undergo a great many medical procedures then god yes years of em what can i say thats useful dont lie about whether its going to hurt dont leave him alone for long periods or you either there was finally something he could do for her events permitting may i ride along with you to solstice and render what assistance i can i cant spare your uncle to youhes going to be buried in technical problems by day after tomorrow if my parts list takes shape i cant take you away from your duties my experience suggests to me that if soudha hasnt been arrested by then what i will be doing by day after tomorrow is spinning my mental wheels a day away from the problems may be just what i will need to give me a fresh approach you would be doing me a service i assure you she pursed her lips doubtfully i admit i would be grateful for the company did she mean any company generally or his company particularly down boy dont even think about it good voices drifted in from the vestibule one of the guards and a familiar rumble ekaterin jumped up my uncle is here he made very good time miles followed her into the hallway professor vorthys his broad face wrinkled with concern gave his valise over to the guard and folded his niece in his arms murmuring condolences miles watched in exquisite envy her uncles warm sympathy almost broke her down as all of impsecs cool professionalism had not miles made a mental note cool and practical that was the ticket she dashed tears from her eyes dispatched the guard with his case to tiens old office as before and led her uncle to the living room after a very brief conference it was decided the professor would accompany her to go collect nikolai miles seconded this despite what he ironically recognized as his present lovesick mania for volunteerism vorthys had a family right and miles himself was too close to tiens death he was also swaying on his feet as the set of painkillers and stimulants hed taken before lunch wore off taking a third dose today would be a bad mistake instead he saw the professor and ekaterin out then checked in with impsec hq in solstice on the secured comconsole no new news he wandered back toward the living room ekaterins uncle was here miles should go now collect his things and decamp to that mythical hotel hed been gassing about for the last week there was no room for him in this little apartment with vorthys reinstalled in the guest room nikki would need his own bed back and he was damned if he was going to trouble ekaterin to rustle up another gravbed or worse for his vor lordly use what had she been expecting when shed ordered in that thing he should definitely go he was obviously not being as civilly neutral toward his hostess as hed imagined if that blasted guard could make whatever comment it had been that had set off tuomonen on that list of embarrassing questions about the suitcases do you need anything my lord the door guards voice at miless elbow startled him awake um yeah next time one of your boys comes over from solstice hq have him bring me a standard militaryissue bedroll in the meanwhile miles staggered over and curled up on the couch after all he was asleep in minutes miles awoke when the little party returned with nikki he sat up and managed to be reasonably composed by the time he had to face the boy nikki looked subdued and scared but was not weeping or hysterical he evidently turned his reactions inward rather than outward like his mother in the absence of female friends of ekaterins bearing casseroles and cakes in the barrayaran manner miles caused impsec to supply dinner the three adults kept the conversation neutral in front of nikki after which he went off to play by himself in his room and miles and the professor retired to the study for a dataexchange the new equipment found topside was indeed peculiar including some powertransfer equipment heavyduty enough for a small jumpship parts of which had ripped apart melted and apparently exploded in a shower of plasma the professor called it truly interesting an engineering codephrase that caught miless full attention in the middle of this colonel gibbs reported in via comconsole he smiled dryly at both imperial auditors an expression which miles was beginning to recognize as gibbss version of ecstasy my lord vorkosigan i have the first documented connection you were looking for weve traced the serial numbers of a pair of hastings converters my lord vorthyss people found topside back through the chain to a waste heat purchase eight months ago the converters were originally delivered to their experiment station right breathed miles finally more of a link than just radovass body we have hold of the real string all right thank you colonel carry on chapter fifteen ekaterin slept better than shed expected to but woke to the realization that shed got through most of yesterday on adrenaline today with its enforced wait for action was going to be harder ive been waiting nine years i can manage nineteen more hours lying in bed allowed a kind of numb foggy grief to descend despite her release from the late chaos of tiens life so she rose dressed carefully ducked around the guard in her living room made breakfast and waited the auditors stirred soon thereafter and came out gratefully for food but carried off their coffee to the secured comconsole she ran out of things to clean up and went out to her balcony but found the presence of another guard on post inhibited her from resting there so she gave the guards coffee and retreated to her kitchen and waited some more lord vorkosigan emerged again he fended off her offers of more coffee and instead seated himself at her table impsec sent me the autopsy report on tien this morning how much do you want to know about it the vision of tiens congealed body hanging in the frost flashed in her memory was there anything unexpected not with respect to cause of death they found his vorzohns dystrophy of course yes poor tien to spend all those years in a suppressed panic over his disease only to die of another cause altogether she shook her head so much effort so misplaced how far advanced was it could they tell the nervous lesions were very distinct according to the examiner though how they can tell one microscopic blob from another the outward symptoms if i interpret the medical jargon correctly would have been impossible to conceal very soon yes i think i knew that it was the inward progress i wondered about when did it start how much of tiens oh bad judgment and other behavior was his disease should she have somehow held on longer could she have until what other desperate denouement had played itself out the damage builds slowly for a long time which parts of the brain are affected varies from person to person for what its worth his seemed concentrated in the motor regions and peripheral nervous system though it may be possible to blame some of his actions on the disease later if a facesaving gesture is needed how politic facesaving for whom i dont wish it he smiled a bit grimly i didnt think you did but i have the unpleasant conviction that this case is going to shift from its nice clean engineering parameters into some very messy politics sooner or later i never discard a possible reserve he looked down at his hands clasped loosely before him on the table his gray sleeves imperfectly concealed the white bandages ringing his wrists how did nikki take the news last night that was hard he started outbefore i told himtrying to argue me into letting him stay and play another night getting passionate and sulking you know how kids are i so much wished i could simply let him go on not having to know i wasnt able to prepare him as much as i would have liked i finally had to sit him down and tell him straight out nikki you have to come home now your da was killed in a breath mask accident last night it just wiped him blank i almost wished for the whining back ekaterin looked away she wondered what oblique forms nikkis reactions might eventually take and whether she would recognize them or handle them well or not i dont know how its going to go in the long run when i lost my mother i was older and we knew it was coming but it was still a shock that day that hour i always thought there would be more time ive not yet lost a parent said vorkosigan grandparents are different i think they are old its their destiny somehow i was shaken when my grandfather died but my world was not i think my fathers was though yes she looked up gratefully thats the difference exactly its like an earthquake something that isnt supposed to move suddenly dumps you over i think the world is going to be a scarier place for nikki this morning have you hit him with his vorzohns dystrophy news yet im letting him sleep ill tell him after breakfast i know better than to stress a kid who has low blood sugar odd i feel the same way about troops is there anything can i help or would you prefer to be private im not sure he doesnt have school today anyway werent you taking my uncle out to the experiment station this morning directly it can wait an extra hour for this i think i would like it if you can stay its not good to make of the disease something all secret thats too awful to even talk about that was tiens mistake yes he said encouragingly its just a thing you deal with it her brows rose as in one damn thing after another yes very like he smiled at her his gray eyes crinkling through whatever combination of luck and clever surgery no scars marred his face she realized it works as tactics if not strategy true to his offer lord vorkosigan drifted back into her kitchen as nikki was finishing his breakfast he lingered suggestively stirring the coffee he took black and leaning against the far counter ekaterin took a deep breath and settled beside nikki at the table her own halfempty and cold cup a mere prop nikki eyed her warily you wont be going to school tomorrow she began hoping to strike a positive note is that when das funeral is will i have to burn the offering not yet your grandmadame has asked that we bring his body back to barrayar to bury beside your uncle who died when you were little tiens mothers return message had come in by comconsole this morning beamed and jumped through the wormholerelays in writing as ekaterins had been and perhaps for similar reasons writing allowed one to leave so much out well do all the ceremonies and burn the offering then when everyone can be there will we have to take him on the jumpship with us asked nikki looking disturbed from the side of the room lord vorkosigan said in fact impsthe imperial civil service will take care of all those arrangements with your permission madame vorsoisson he will probably be back home before you are nikki oh said nikki oh ekaterin echoed i i was wondering i thank you he sketched a bow allow me to pass on your motherinlaws address and instructions you have enough other things to do she nodded and turned back to her son anyway nikki you and i are going to solstice tomorrow to visit a clinic there we never mentioned this to you before but you have a condition called vorzohns dystrophy nikki made an uncertain face whats that its a disorder where with age your body stops making certain proteins in quite the right shape to do their job nowadays the doctors can give you some retrogenes that produce the proteins correctly to make up for it youre too young to have any symptoms and with this fix you never will at nikkis age and on the first pass it was probably not yet necessary to go into the complications it would entail for his future reproduction she noticed dryly how she had managed to get through the longanticipated spiel without once using the word mutation ive collected a lot of articles about vorzohns dystrophy which you can read when you want to some of them are too technical but there are a couple i think you could get through with a little help there if she could avoid setting off his homework alarms that ought to set up a reasonably neutral way to give him the information to which he had a right and he could pursue it at his own pace thereafter nikki looked worried will it hurt well they will certainly have to draw blood and take some tissue samples vorkosigan put in ive had both done to me what seems like a thousand times over the years for various medical reasons the blood draw hurts for a moment but not later the tissue sampling doesnt hurt because they use a medical microstun but when the stun wears off it aches for a while they only need a tiny sample from you so it wont be much nikki appeared to digest this do you have vorzohns thing lord vorkosigan no my mother was poisoned with a chemical called soltoxin before i was born it damaged my bones mainly which is why im so short he wandered over to the table and sat down with them ekaterin was expecting nikkis next to be something along the lines of will i be short but instead his brown eyes widened in extreme worry did she die no she recovered completely fortunately for us all shes fine now he took this in was she scared nikki ekaterin realized had not yet sorted out just who lord vorkosigans mother was in relation to the people hed heard about in his history lessons vorkosigans brows rose in some bemusement i dont know you can ask her yourself someday whenif you meet her id be fascinated to hear the answer he caught ekaterins unsettled gaze but his eyebrows remained unrepentant nikki regarded lord vorkosigan dubiously did they fix your bones with retrogenes no mores the pity it would have been much easier on me if it had been possible they waited till they thought i was done growing and then they replaced them with synthetics nikki was diverted how dyou replace bones how do you get them out cut me open vorkosigan made a slicing motion with his right hand along his left arm from elbow to wrist chop the old bone out pop the new one in reconnect the joints transplant the marrow to the new matrix glue it up and wait for it to heal very messy and tedious did it hurt i was asleepanesthetized youre lucky you can have retrogenes all you have to have are a few fiddling injections nikki looked vastly impressed can i see after an infinitesimal hesitation vorkosigan unfastened his shirt cuff and pushed back his left sleeve that pale little line there see nikki stared with interest both at vorkosigans arm and speculatively at his own he wriggled his fingers and watched his arm flex as the muscles and bones moved beneath his skin i have a scab he offered in return want to see awkwardly he pushed up his pant leg to display the latest playground souvenir on his knee gravely vorkosigan inspected it and agreed it was a good scab and would doubtless fall off very soon now and yes perhaps there would be a scar but his mother was very right to tell him not to pick it to ekaterins relief everyone then refastened their clothes and the contest went no further the conversation lagging after that high point nikki pushed a few last smears of groats and syrup artistically around the bottom of his dish and asked can i be excused of course said ekaterin wash the syrup off your hands she called after his retreating form she watched himrun not walkout and said uncertainly that went better than i expected vorkosigan smiled reassurance you were matteroffact so you gave him no reason to be otherwise after a little silence ekaterin said was she scared your mother his smile twisted spitless i believe his eyes warmed and glinted but not i understand witless the two auditors left for an onsite inspection of the waste heat experiment station shortly thereafter waiting carefully for a natural break in nikkis quiet play in his room ekaterin called him in to her workroom to read the simplest and most straightforward article she had found on the subject of vorzohns dystrophy she sat him in her lap in her comconsole station chair something she seldom did any more now he had become so leggy it was a measure of his hidden unease this morning she thought that he did not resist the cuddle nor her direction he read through the article with fair understanding stopping now and then to demand pronunciations and meanings of unfamiliar terms or for her to rephrase or interpret some baffling sentence if he had not been on her lap she would not have detected the slight stiffening of his body as he read the line later investigations concluded this natural mutation first appeared in vorinniss district near the end of the time of isolation only with the arrival of galactic molecular biology was it determined that it was unrelated to several old earth genetic diseases which its symptoms sometimes mimic any questions ekaterin asked when theyd finally wended to the end of the thing naw nikki elbowed off her lap and slid to his feet you can read more whenever you want huh with difficulty ekaterin restrained herself from pursuing some more definite response from him realizing she wanted it more for her sake than his own are you all right is it all right do you forgive me he would not could not work through it all in an hour or a day or even a year each day must have the challenge and response appropriate to it one damn thing after another vorkosigan had said but not thank heavens all things simultaneously the addition of lord vorkosigan to the expedition to solstice made startling alterations in ekaterins carefully calculated travel plans instead of rising in the middle of the night to catch economyclass seats on the monorail they awoke at a leisurely hour to take passage on an impsec suborbital courier shuttle which waited their pleasure and would cover the intervening time zones with an hour to spare for lunch before nikkis appointment i love the monorail vorkosigan had confided apologetically at her first startled protest at the news of this change sprung on her late in the evening when the two auditors returned from their days investigations in fact im thinking of urging my brother mark to invest in some of the companies trying to build more of them on barrayar but with this case heating up impsecs made it pretty clear they would rather i did not travel by public transportation just now thank you very much my lord they also had two bodyguards they wore discreet komarranstyle civilian clothes which made them look exactly like a pair of barrayaran military bodyguards in civvies vorkosigan seemed equally able to deal easily with them or ignore them as though they were invisible at will he brought reports to read on the flight but only glanced over them seeming a little distracted ekaterin wondered if nikkis restlessness broke his concentration and if she ought to try and suppress the boy but a quiet word from vorkosigan at apogee won an excited nikki an invitation to come forward and spend ten minutes in the pilots compartment how is the case going this morning ekaterin asked him during this private interlude exactly as i predicted unfortunately he said impsecs failure to catch up with soudha is growing more disturbing by the hour i really thought theyd have nailed him by now between colonel gibbss group and that team of earnest impsec boys we have counting widgets out at the experiment station my parts list is starting to take shape but it will be at least another day before its complete did my uncle like the idea heh he said it was tedious which i already knew and then he appropriated it from me which i take to indicate approval he rubbed his lips introspectively thanks to your uncle we did get one spot of encouragement last night hed thought to confiscate radovass personal library when we visited madame radovas and we sent it off to impsec hq for analysis their analyst confirmed radovass primary interest in jumpship technology and wormhole physics which does not surprise me much but then we got a bonus soudha or his techs did a superb job of erasing everyones comconsoles before impsec got to them but evidently no one thought of the library some of the technical volumes had notes entered in the margin boxes the professor was quite excited about the mathematical fragments but more obviously there were reminders to confide this or that thought or calculation to some names jotted next to them mostly members of the waste heat group but also a couple of others including one who appears to be one of the late members of the stationkeeping crew at the soletta array were now positing that radovas and his equipment with inside help had been smuggled up to the soletta for whatever it was they were trying to do rather than being aboard the ore freighter so was the soletta essential to what they were doing or were they only using it for a test platform impsec has agents out all over the planet today questioning and requestioning colleagues relatives and friends of everyone on the soletta or having anything to do with their resupply shuttle tomorrow i will get to read all those reports nikkis return dried up this amiable flow of information and they soon landed at one of impsecs own private shuttleports on the edge of the vast sealed city of solstice instead of taking a public bubblecar they were provided with a floater and driver who took them down into the restricted tunnels by some dizzying back route that brought them to their destination in about twothirds the time of the bubblecar system the first stop was a restaurant atop one of solstices highest towers providing diners a spectacular view of the capital glittering halfway to the horizon though the place was crowded no one was seated near them while they ate ekaterin observed the bodyguards did not join in the meal the menu had no prices triggering a moment of panic in ekaterins heart she had no way to direct nikki or herself for that matter to the cheaper selections if you have to ask you cant afford it her initial determination to argue possession of her portion of the bill with vorkosigan sagged vorkosigans height and appearance drew the usual covert doubletakes for the first time in his company she became aware of being mistaken for a couple or even a family her chin rose defensively what did they think him too odd to attach a woman it was none of their business anyway the next stopand ekaterin was very grateful she did not have to navigate to it herselfwas the clinic a comfortable quarter hour early vorkosigan did not appear to notice anything in the least remarkable about the whole magic carpet ride though nikki had been enthusiastically diverted throughout had vorkosigan planned that the boy grew suddenly very much quieter as they took the lifttubes up to the clinic lobby when they were ushered to the booth of an admissions clerk vorkosigan pulled up a chair for himself just behind ekaterin and nikki and the bodyguards faded discreetly out of range ekaterin presented identification and civil service payment documentation and all seemed to go smoothly until they came to the information that nikkis father was lately deceased and the clinic comconsole demanded formal permissions from nikkis legal guardian that thing is much too well programmed ekaterin thought and embarked on an explanation of the distance to tiens third cousin back on barrayar and the timeconstrained need for nikkis treatment to be completed before their return the komarran clerk listened with understanding and sympathy but the comconsole program did not agree and after a couple of attempts to override it the clerk went off to fetch her supervisor ekaterin bit her lip and rubbed her palms on her trouser knees to come so far to be so close to get hung up on some legal technicality now the supervisor a pleasant young komarran man returned with the clerk and ekaterin gave her explanation again he listened and rechecked all the documentation and turned to her with an air of earnest regret im sorry madame vorsoisson if you were a komarran planetary shareholder instead of a barrayaran subject the rules would be very different all komarran planetary shareholders are barrayaran subjects vorkosigan pointed out from behind her in a bland tone the supervisor managed a pained smile im afraid thats not quite what i meant the thing is a similar problem came up for us just a few months ago regarding treatment under quasiemergency conditions of a vor child of komarrresident barrayarans we went with what seemed to us to be the commonsense approach the childs legal guardian later disagreed and the judicial er negotiations are still going on it proved to be a very costly error of judgment for the clinic given that vorzohns dystrophy is a chronic and not an immediately lifethreatening condition and that you should in theory be able to obtain your legal permissions in a week or two im afraid im going to have to ask you to reschedule ekaterin took a deep breath whether to argue or scream she was not sure but lord vorkosigan leaned past her shoulder and smiled at the supervisor hand me that readpad will you the puzzled supervisor did so vorkosigan rummaged in his pocket and pulled out his gold auditors seal which he uncapped and pressed to the pad along with his right palm he spoke into the vocorder by my order and for the good the imperium i request and require all assistance to wit suitable medical treatment for nikolai vorsoisson vorkosigan imperial auditor he handed it back see if that doesnt make your machine happier he murmured aside to ekaterin just like swatting flies with a laser cannon the aims a bit tricky but it sure takes care of the flies lord vorkosigan i cant her tongue stumbled to a halt cant what this wasnt like waffling over the lunch bill tiens benefits would be paying for nikkis treatment if only the komarrans could be persuaded to disgorge it vorkosigans offered contribution was entirely intangible nothing your esteemed uncle would not have done for you if i could have spared him to you today he gave her one his ghostbows seated the supervisors expression changed from suspicious to stunned as his comconsole digested this new data you are lord auditor vorkosigan at your service i er uh in what capacity are you here my lord friend of the family vorkosigans smile twisted just slightly red tape cutter and general expediter to his credit the supervisor managed not to gibber he dismissed the clerk and sped them through processing and himself escorted them upstairs and into the hands of the medtechs in the genetics department he then vanished but things ran blazingly quickly thereafter it almost seems unfair ekaterin murmured when nikki was whisked away briefly by a tech to pee into a sampler to think nikki just jumped the queue there yes well i found last winter that an auditors seal had the same enlivening effect on impmils veterans treatment division whose hallways are much draftier and drab than these and whose queue times are legendary quite ridiculous i was charmed vorkosigans face grew more introspective and sober im afraid ive not quite found my balance with this imperial auditor thing yet what is the just use of power what is its abuse i could have ordered madame radovas to be fastpentad or ordered tien to land us at the experiment station that first evening and events would now be well i dont quite know what they would now be except different than this but i did not wish to he trailed off and for just a flash ekaterin caught an impression of a much younger man beneath his habitual mask of irony and authority he is no older than me after all did you anticipate that problem with the permissions i should have thought of it i suppose but they took all the information when i made the appointment and didnt say anything so i thought i assumed not specifically but i hoped i might have a chance to do some little service or another today im pleased it was so easy yes she realized enviously he could just wave all ordinary problems out of his path leaving only the extraordinary ones her envy ebbed it occurred belatedly to ekaterin that he too might feel some guilt about tiens death and that was why he was going to such lengths to assist tiens widow and orphan so intense a concern seemed unnecessary and she wondered how to reassure him that she did not blame him without creating more awkwardness than she erased a battery of tests was completed upon nikki in about half the time ekaterin had mentally allotted for them the komarran physician met with them in her comfortable office very shortly thereafter vorkosigan dismissed the bodyguards to lurk in the corridor nikkis gene scan shows the dystrophy complex to be very much in the classic mode the doctor told them when ekaterin and nikki were seated side by side in front of her comconsole desk vorkosigan as usual took a backseat and just watched he has a few idiosyncratic complications but nothing our lab cant handle she illustrated her talk with a holovid of the actual offending chromosomes and a computergenerated vid of exactly how the retrovirus would deliver the splice that would work to supplement their deficiencies nikki did not ask as many questions as ekaterin had hoped he wouldwas he intimidated weary bored i believe our gene techs can have the retrovirus personalized for nikki in about a week the doctor concluded im going to have you return for the injection then nikki plan to stay overnight in solstice for a recheck the following day madame vorsoisson and if possible visit us again just before you leave komarr nikki will need to be reexamined monthly thereafter for three months which you can have done at a clinic i will recommend to you in vorbarr sultana well give out a disk with all the records and they should be able to pick it up from there after that assuming all goes well a early checkup should suffice thats all said ekaterin weak with relief thats all there was no damage yet we are in time no hes fine its hard to project with vorzohns dystrophy but i would guess in his case the onset of detectable gross cellular damage would have begun to appear in his late teens or early twenties you are in good time ekaterin held nikkis hand hard as they exited her steps firm to keep her feet from dancing with an aw mama nikki extracted himself and walked with independent dignity beside her vorkosigan his hands shoved deep in his gray trouser pockets followed smiling nikki fell asleep in the shuttle with his head pillowed on ekaterins lap she watched him fondly and stroked his hair lightly so as not to wake him vorkosigan sitting across from them with his reader on his knees again watched her in turn and murmured is it well its well she said softly but it feels so strange nikkis illness has been the whole focus of my life for so long i gradually pared away all the other impossibilities to concentrate wholly on this the one main thing it feels as though i had been steeling myself to batter down some unscalable wall and then when i finally took a deep breath and put my head down and charged it just fell all in a heap like that and now im stumbling around in the dust and the bricks blinking i feel very unbalanced where am i now who am i now oh youll find your center you cant have mislaid it totally even if you have been revolving around other people give yourself time i thought my center was to be vor like the women before me she glanced across at him feeling inarticulate and urgent and then i chose tien you have to understand it was my choice my marriage was arranged offered but it wasnt forced i wanted it wanted to have children form a family carry on the pattern make my place in this i dont know generational pageant i am the eleventh of my name i know about the vor pageant yes she said gratefully it wasnt that i didnt choose what i wanted or gave away my center or any of those things but somehow i didnt end up with the beautiful vor patternweave i was trying to make i ended up with this tangle of strings her fingers wriggled in air miming chaos his lips quirked introspective and ironic i know tangles too but do you knowwell of course you would but the business with the brick wall failure failure was grown familiar to me comfortable almost when i stopped struggling against it i did not know achievement was so devastating huh he was leaning back now his reader forgotten on his lap regarding her with his entire attention yes vertigo at apogee eh and the reward for a job well done is another job and what have you done for us lately and is that all lieutenant vorkosigan and yes achievement is devastating or at least disorienting and they dont warn you in advance its the sudden change of momentum and direction i think she blinked how very strange i expected you to tell me i was being foolish deny your perfectly correct perception why should you expect that habit i suppose mm you can learn to enjoy the sensation of winning you know once you get over the initial queasiness its an acquired taste how long did it take you to acquire it he smiled slowly once thats not a taste thats an addiction its one that would look well on you his eyes were uncomfortably bright challenging she smiled in confusion and stared out the port at the darkening komarran sky as the shuttle began its descent he rubbed his lips not quite erasing their odd quirk and returned his attention to his reports uncle vorthys met them at the apartment door data disks in his hand and a vague distracted smile on his face he gave ekaterins hand a warm grasp and fended off nikkis immediate attempt to appropriate him and carry him off to hear about the wonders of the impsec shuttle just a moment nikki we shall go to the kitchen for dessert and you can tell me all about it ekaterin ive heard from the professora shes taken ship on barrayar and will be here in three days time i didnt like to tell you till she was sure she could get away oh ekaterin almost jumped with delight mitigated immediately by concern oh no sir do you meant to say you are dragging that poor woman through five wormhole jumps from barrayar to komarr for me she gets so jumpsick it was lord vorkosigans idea actually said uncle vorthys vorkosigan put on a bright trapped smile at this and shrugged warily although i had fully intended to drag her here for my own sake uncle vorthys continued at the end of the term this just advanced the timetable she does like komarr once she gets here and has a day to recover from the jumplag i thought you would like it you shouldnt havebut oh i do like it very much vorkosigan straightened at these words and his smile relaxed into a selfsatisfaction that amused her vastly ekaterin wasnt sure if she was reading the subtleties of his expression better now or if he was concealing them less if i get you a ticket would you go out to meet her at the jumppoint station uncle vorthys added im afraid i wont have time and she hates traveling alone you could see her a day earlier and have some time together on the last leg downside certainly sir ekaterin almost shivered with the realization of how much she longed to see her aunt shed been living in tiens orbit so long shed become used to her isolation as the norm ekaterin counted the professora as one of the few nondisheartening relatives she possessed a friendan ally the komarran women ekaterin had met were nice enough but there was so much they didnt understand aunt vorthys might make acerbic comments but she understood deeply yes yes nikki said uncle vorthys miles when you are ready ill meet you in my room and we can go over todays progress on the comconsole have we some is it interesting uncle vorthys made a balancing gesture with his free hand id be interested in what pattern you see emerging if any at your convenience knock on my door when youre ready vorkosigan smiled at nikki gave the professor a vague salutelike gesture and withdrew nikki impatiently waiting his turn now dragged his greatuncle off to the kitchen as promised ekaterin could only be grateful that of his days events the impsec shuttle seemed to loom so much larger than the medical examinations she followed satisfied chapter sixteen early the next morning miles in shirt and trousers but barefoot stepped into the hallway with his toiletries case in hand he must remind tuomonen to return his medical kit the impsec techs couldnt have found any interesting explosive devices in it or he would have been informed by now his bleary meditations suffered a check when he discovered ekaterin still dressed in a robe and with her hair in unusual but fetching disarray leaning against the hall bathroom door nikki she hissed open this door at once you cant hide all day in there a muffled young voice returned mulishly yes i can lips tight she tapped again urgently but quietly then jumped a little as she saw miles and clutched the neck of her robe oh lord vorkosigan good morning madame vorsoisson he said civilly ah trouble she nodded ruefully i thought yesterday went awfully easily nikki tried to insist he was too sick to go to school today because of his vorzohns dystrophy i explained again it didnt work that way but he got more and more stubborn he begged to stay home no not just stubborn scared i think this isnt the usual malingering she jerked her head toward the locked door i tried getting firm it was not the right tactic now hes panicked miles bent to glance at the lock which was an ordinary mechanical one too bad it wasnt a palm lock he knew some tricks with those this one didnt even have screws but some kind of rivets it was going to take a pry bar or subterfuge nikki called ekaterin hopefully lord vorkosigan is out here he needs to get washed and dressed so he can go to work silence im torn murmured ekaterin in lower tones were leaving in a few weeks a few missed lessons wouldnt matter but thats not the point i went to a private vor school rather like his when i was his age miles murmured back i know what hes afraid of but i think your instincts are correct he frowned thoughtfully then set his case down and rummaged for his tube of depilatory cream which he smeared liberally over his nights bristles nikki he called more loudly can i come in im all over depilatory cream and if i dont wash it off itll start eating through my skin wont he realize you can wash in the kitchen ekaterin whispered maybe but hes only nine im gambling depilation is still a bit of a mystery after a moment nikkis voice came you can come in but im not coming out and im locking it again thats fair miles allowed some rustling near the door should i grab him when it opens ekaterin asked very dubiously nope it would violate our tacit agreement ill go in then well see what happens at least youll have a spy inside the gate at that point it seems wrong to use you so mm but kids only dare defy those whom they really trust the fact that im still mostly a stranger to him gives me an advantage which i invite you to use true enough well all right the door opened a cautious crack miles waited it opened a little wider he sighed turned sideways and slipped through nikki shut it again immediately and snapped the lock the boy was dressed for school in his braided uniform of sober gray and maroon but minus his shoes the shoes presumably had been the sticking point with their implicit commitment to going out nikki backed up and seated himself on the edge of the tub miles laid out his toiletries kit on the counter and rolled up his sleeves trying to think fast before coffee or think at all his eloquence had inspired his soldiers to face death in the past or so he dimly recalled now lets try something really hard playing for time and inspiration he methodically brushed his teeth by which time the depilatory had finished working he washed off the resultant goo rubbed his face dry with the towel flung it over his shoulder and leaned with his back against the door slowly unrolling his sleeves and fastening his cuffs so nikki he said at last whats the trouble with going to school this morning moisture smeared around the boys defiant eyes glistened when it caught the light im sick ive got vorzohns thing its not catching you cant give it to anybody except for the way you got it from the blank look on nikkis face the idea of being dangerous to anyone else had never crossed his mind ah the selfcenteredness of childhood miles hesitated wondering how to approach the real problem for almost the first time he wondered how certain aspects of his childhood had looked from his parents point of view the doubled vision was dizzying how the devil did i wind up on the enemy side you know miles essayed no one will even know you have it unless you tell them its not like they can smell it on you eh the mulish look redoubled thats what mama said scratch that trial balloon there was an inherent problem in suggesting secrecy anyway as tiens life demonstrated suppressing a passing desire to strangle the boy for inflicting yet more distress on ekaterin just now miles asked have you had breakfast yet yeah starving him out or bribing him with food would be too slow then well deal i wont tell you youre blowing it all out of proportion if you wont tell me i dont understand nikki glanced up from his seat his attention arrested yeah see me kid miles considered and immediately discarded any argument that smacked of threat that attempted to chivvy nikki in the right direction by upping the pressure for instance the one that started out how do you ever expect to have the courage to jump through wormholes if you havent the courage to face this nikki was up against the wall now driven into this untenable retreat upping the pressure would just squash him the trick was to lower the wall i went to a private school a bit like yours i cant remember a time i wasnt dealing with being a mutie vor in my classmates eyes by the time i was your age i had a dozen strategies some of them were pretty counterproductive i admit hed gone through medical hell in his childhood with a stiff lip but a few stillremembered playfellows upon discovering that his brittle bones made physical harassment too dangerousto themselves when they found they couldnt conceal the evidencehad learned to reduce him to humiliated tears with words alone sergeant bothari delivering miles daily to this academic purgatory quickly made a routine of an expert shakedown relieving him of weapons ranging from kitchen knives to a military stunner stolen from captain koudelkas holster after that miles had gone to war in a subtler fashion it had taken almost two years to teach certain of his classmates to leave him alone learning all round upon reflection offering his own age ninetotwelve solutions might not be the best idea in fact letting nikki even find out what some of them had been could be a supremely bad idea but that was twenty years ago on barrayar times have changed what exactly do you think your friends here will do to you nikki shrugged dunno well give me some guesses you cant plan a strategy without good intelligence nikki shrugged again after a time he added its not what theyll do it what theyll think miles blew out his breath thats a little tenuous for me to work with yknow what you fear someone will think in the future i usually have to use fastpenta to find out what people really think and even fastpenta wont tell me what theyre going to think nikki hunched miles regretfully gave up the notion of telling him that if he kept making those turtlebacked gestures his spine would freeze like that just as miless had there was a faint awful possibility the boy might believe him what we need miles sighed is an impsec agent someone to scout unknown territory not knowing what the strangers they meet are going to do or think listen carefully watch and remember report back and they have to do it over and over in new places all the time its bloody daunting the first time nikki looked up how do you know you said you were a courier damn the kid was sharp im um not supposed to talk about it youre not cleared but do you think your school is as dangerous as say jacksons whole or eta ceta just to pick a couple of ah random examples nikki stared in silent and miles feared justified scorn of this adult floundering tell you something i did learn though nikki was drawn or at least looked up go with it he wont give you more its not as daunting the second time i wished later i could have started with the second time but the only way to get to the second time is to do the first time seems paradoxical that the fastest way to get to easy is through hard in any case i cant spare you an impsec agent to check out your school for antimutant activity nikki snorted warily alive to the least hint of patronization miless grin twisted in bleak appreciation besides it would be overkill dont you think probly grouchy hunching the ideal impsec scout would be someone who could blend in anyway someone who knew the territory like that back of his hand and wouldnt make dangerous mistakes out of ignorance someone who could keep his own counsel and not let his assumptions get in the way of his observations and not get into fights because it would blow his cover very practical people the successful imperial agents ive known he eyed nikki meditatively this was not going well try another the youngest subagent i ever employed was about ten it wasnt on barrayar needless to say but i dont think youre any less bright or competent than she was ten said nikki temporarily startled out of his surly knot she it was for a spot of simple courier duty she could pass unnoticed where a uniformed mercenwhere a uniformed adult could not now im willing to be your tactical consultant on this ah schoolpenetration mission but i cant work without intelligence and the best agent to collect it in this case is already in place do you dare nikki shrugged but his lipbiting stony look had faded into one of speculation ten a girl a hit a very palpable hit i put her down on my impsec expenditures log as a local informant she was paid of course same rates as an adult a small but measurable contribution to speeding that particular mission to a successful conclusion miles stared off into the middle distance for a moment with an air of reminiscence of the sort which usually preceded long boring adult stories when he judged the hook was set he feigned to come back to himself and smiled faintly at nikki well thats enough of that duty drives i havent had breakfast if you decide to come out ill be here for another ten minutes or so miles unlatched the lock and let himself out he didnt think nikki had bought more than one word of his in three though for a change and in contrast to several of his historic negotiations it had all been true but at least hed managed to offer a line of retreat from an impossible position ekaterin was waiting in the hall he put his finger to his lips and waited a moment the door stayed closed but the lock did not click again miles motioned ekaterin to follow and tiptoed away to the living room whew said miles i think thats the toughest audience ive ever played to what happened demanded ekaterin anxiously is he coming out not sure yet i gave him a couple of new things to think about he didnt seem as panicked and its going to get really boring in there after a bit lets give him some time and see miles was just finishing his groats and coffee when nikki cautiously poked his head around the kitchen door he lingered in the doorway kicking his heel against the frame ekaterin seated across from miles put her hand to her lips and waited wherere my shoes asked nikki after a moment under the table said ekaterin maintaining with obvious effort a perfectly neutral tone nikki crawled under to retrieve them and sat crosslegged on the floor by the door to put them on when he stood up again ekaterin said carefully do you want anyone to go with you naw his gaze crossed miless just briefly then he slouched into the living room to collect his school bag and let himself out the front door ekaterin turning back from her arrested halfrise from her chair sank down limply my word i wonder if i ought to call the school to make sure he arrives miles thought it over yes but dont let nikki know you checked right she swirled the coffee around in the bottom of her cup and added hesitantly how did you do that do what get him out of there if it had been tien they were both stubborn tien would get so frustrated with nikki sometimes not without cause he would have threatened to take the door down and drag nikki to school i would have run around in circles placating frantically afraid things would get out of hand though they never quite seemed to i dont know if that was because of me or tien would always be a little ashamed later not that he would ever apologize but he would buy well it doesnt matter now miles made a crosshatch pattern in the bottom of his dish with his spoon hoping his desire for her approval was not too embarrassingly obvious physical solutions have never come easily to me i just played with his mind eased him out i try never to take away somebodys face when im negotiating not even a childs her lips quirked and her brows flicked up in an expression he wasnt sure how to interpret a rare approach so maybe my tactics had the novelty of surprise i admit i did think of ordering my impsec minions into the breach but it would have looked like a very silly order nikkis dignity wasnt the only one on the line well thank you for being so patient one doesnt normally expect busy and important men to take the time for kids her voice was warm she was pleased oh good he babbled in relief well i do expect it that is my da always did you seetake time for me later when i learned not everyones da did the same i just assumed it was only a trait of the most busy and most important men hm she looked down at her hands resting on either side of her cup and smiled crookedly professor vorthys lumbered in dressed for the day in his comfortable rumpled suit scarcely more formfitting than his pajamas it was tailormade garb appropriate to his status as an imperial voice but he must miles reflected have driven his tailor to despair before coaxing just the fit he wanted with lots of room in the pockets as hed once explained to miles while the professora rolled her eyes heavenward vorthys was stuffing data disks into these capacious compartments are you ready miles impsec just called to say theyll have an aircar and driver waiting for us at the west locks yes very good with an apologetic smile to ekaterin miles tossed off the last of his coffee and rose will you be all right today madame vorsoisson yes of course i have a lot to do i have an appointment with an estate law counselor and any amount of sorting and packing the guard wont have to go with me will he not unless you wish we are leaving one man on duty here by your leave but if our komarrans had wanted hostages they could have taken me and tien that first night and bought themselves loads more trouble if only they had miles reflected regretfully his case could be ever so much further along by now soudha was too damned smart if i thought you and nikki were in any possible danger id figure some way to use you for bait no no if you are in the least uncomfortable id be happy to assign you a man no indeed that faint smile again miles felt he could happily spend the rest of the morning studying all the subtle expressions of her lips equipment lists youre going to go study equipment lists then i bid you good morning madame lord auditor vorthys after his first survey of the new situation had chosen to set up his personal headquarters out at the waste heat experiment station miles had to admit the security there was great no one was likely to blunder in by accident or wander across its bleak surroundings unobserved well he and tien had but the occupants had been distracted at the time and tien had apparently possessed a dire luck which amounted to antigenius miles wondered which had come first for soudha had the administrative acquisition of such a perfect site for secret work triggered the idea for his shadow project or had he had the idea first and then maneuvered himself into the right promotion to capture control of the station just one of a long list of questions miles was itching to ask the man under fastpenta after the impsec aircar delivered the two auditors miles went off first to check the progress of his or rather impsec engineering major demories inventory crews the sergeant in charge promised completion of the tedious identification counting and crosscheck of every portable object in the station before the end of today miles then returned to vorthys who had set up a sort of engineers nest in one of the long upstairs workrooms in the office section with roomy tables lots of light and a proliferating array of highpowered comconsoles the professor grunted greetings from behind a multicolored spaghettiarray of mathematical projections glimmering above his vidplate miles settled down in a comconsole station chair to study the growing list of real objects colonel gibbs claimed waste heat had paid for but which were no longer to be found on waste heats premises hoping some subliminally familiar ordnance pattern might emerge after a while the professor shut off his holovid display and sighed well no doubt they built something the topside crews picked up some more fragments yesterday mostly melted so does our inventory represent one something destroyed along with radovas or two somethings miles wondered aloud oh i should think two at least though the second may not have been assembled yet if one thinks it through from soudhas point of view one realizes hes been having a very bad month yes if that whole mess topside wasnt some really bizarre suicide mission or internecine sabotage or and where is marie trogir blast it im not at all sure the komarrans knew either when he talked to me soudha seemed to be angling to find out if i knew anything of her unless that was just more of his misdirection are you seeing anything in your inventory yet asked vorthys mm not exactly what im looking for the final autopsy report on radovas revealed some cellular distortions in addition to the gross and i use that term advisedly damage they reminded me a little of what happens to human bodies which have suffered a nearmiss from a gravitic imploder beam a hit of course is very distinctive in a messy and violentlydistributed way but a nearmiss can kill without actually bursting the body ive been wondering since i first saw the cell scans if soudha has reinvented the gravitic imploder lance or some other gravitic field weapon scaling them down to personnel size has been an ongoing ambition of the weapons boffins i know but the parts list doesnt quite jibe theres a load of heavyduty power transmission equipment among this stuff but im damned if i see what theyre transmitting it to the math fragments found in radovass library intrigue me very much said vorthys you spoke to soudhas mathematician cappellwhat was your impression of him its hard to say now that i know he was lying through his teeth at me through the whole interview said miles ruefully i deduce that soudha trusted him to keep his head at a time when the whole team must have been scrambling like hell to complete their withdrawal soudha was very selective i now realize in just who he gated through to me miles hesitated not just sure he could lay out the logic of his next conclusion i think cappell was a key man maybe next after soudha himself although the accountant foscol no i give you a foursome soudha foscol cappell and radovas theyre the core ill bet you betan dollars to sand the farrago about a love affair between radovas and trogir was a complete fabrication a convincing smoke screen they developed after the accident to buy time but in that case where is trogir now after a moment he added and were they planning to use their thing or sell it if sell theyd almost have to find a customer out of the empire maybe trogir doublecrossed everyone and took off with the specs to some high bidder impsecs got a tight watch for our missing komarrans on all the jumppoint exits from the empire they only had a couple hours start they cant have got out before the lid clamped down but trogir had a twoweek head start she could be long gone by now vorthys shook his head declining to reason in advance of his data miles sighed and returned to his list by the end of an hour miles was crosseyed from staring at meters and meters of really supremely boring inventory readouts his mind wandered revolving a plan to go attach himself like a hyperactive leech to all the field agents searching for the fugitive komarrans sequentially he supposed he had learned not to wish to be twins or any other multiple of himself miles thought of the old barrayaran joke about the vor lord who jumped on his horse and rode off in all directions forward momentum only worked as a strategy if one had correctly identified which way was forward after all lord auditor vorthys didnt run around in circles he sat composedly in the center and let it all come to him miless meditations on the proven disadvantages of cloning were interrupted when colonel gibbs called them gibbs was sporting a demure smile of amazing smugness the professor wandered over into range of the vid pickup and leaned on the back of miless chair as gibbs spoke my lord auditor my lord auditor gibbs nodded to them both ive found something odd i expect you want we finally succeeded in tracing the real purchase orders of waste heats largest equipment expenditures they have over the last two years bought five customdesigned necklin field generators from a komarran jumpship powerplant firm i have the companys name and address and copies of the invoices bollan design thats the builderstill has the tech specs on file soudha was building a jump ship miles muttered trying to picture it wait a minute necklin rods come in pairs maybe they broke one colonel has impsec visited bollan yet we did to confirm the invoice forgery bollan design appears to be a perfectly legitimate though small company theyve been in business about thirty years which rather predates this embezzlement operation theyre unable to compete head to head with the major builders like toscane industries so theyve specialized in odd and experimental designs and custom repairs of outsystem and obsolete jumpship rods bollan as a company does not appear to have violated any regulation and seems to have dealt with soudha as a customer in all good faith the invoices at the time they left bollan were not yet altered that was done when they arrived on foscols comconsole apparently nevertheless the chief design engineer who worked on the order directly with soudha has not been to work for three days nor did my field agent find him at home miles swore under his breath ducking fastpenta interrogation you bet unless his body turns up dead in a ditch could be either at this point you have a detainment order out on him i trust certainly my lord shall i download everything weve acquired so far this morning on your secured channel yes please said miles especially the tech specs put in vorthys over his shoulder after i look at them i may want to talk to the people at bollan who are still there may i trouble impsec to be sure none of the rest of them go on an extempore vacation before i get in touch with them colonel already been done my lord still looking smug gibbs signed off to be replaced by the promised financial and technical data vorthys tried to foist the financial records off on miles who promptly filed them and went to look at vorthyss tech readouts well said vorthys when after a cursory initial scan he was able to pull up a holovid schematic which rotated slowly and colorfully in three dimensions above his vidplate what the hell is that i was hoping youd tell me miles breathed now hanging in turn over the back of vorthyss station chair sure doesnt look like any necklin rod ive ever seen the lines turning in air sketched out a shape like a cross between a corkscrew and a funnel all the designs are slightly different noted vorthys bringing up four more shapes to hang in series beside the first judging by the dates they were scaling up with each subsequent model according to the attached measurements the first three were relatively smaller a couple of meters long and a meter or so wide the fourth was double the dimensions of the third the fifth probably four meters wide at the larger end and six meters in length miles pictured the size of the assembly room doors in the building next to this one wherever that last one had been delivered tofour weeks agoit hadnt been here and one did not leave a delicate precision device like a necklin rod out in the wind and rain those things generate necklin fields said miles what shape with a pair of jumpship rods the fields counterrotate and fold the ship through fivespace he held his hands out parallel with each other palm up then pressed them inward in the metaphor hed been given the field wrapped around the ship to create a fivespace needle of infinitesimal diameter and unlimited length to punch through that area of fivespace weakness called a wormhole and unfold again into threespace on the other side hed also been dragged through a more convincing mathematical demonstration in his last term at the academy all details of which never called on subsequently thereafter had evaporated out of his brain shortly after the final exam that was long before his cryorevival so it was one bit of memory loss he could not blame on the snipers needlegrenade i used to know this stuff he muttered plaintively despite this broad hint the professor did not break into an enlightening lecture he just sat in his station chair his chin cupped in his palm after a moment he leaned forward and called up a dizzying succession of data files from the probablecause investigation ah here it is a wriggly graph appeared flanked by a list of elements and percentages running down one side a fast pass through the data from bollan produced another similar list the professor leaned back ill be damned what said miles i did not expect to get this lucky that he pointed to the first graph is an analysis of the composition of a very melted and distorted mass fragment we picked up topside it has nearly the same composition fingerprint as this fourth device here the figures which are a tiny bit off are just the sort of lighter and more volatile elements id expect to lose in such a melt huh i didnt think wed ever be able to reconstruct the source of those blobs now we dont have to if that was the fourth said miles slowly wheres the fifth the professor shrugged the same place as the first second and third do you have enough information from the inventory to reconstruct its power supply at that point wed have the whole machine mapped wouldnt we mm maybe it will certainly supply some parameters how much power continuous or phased bollan had to know to supply the proper coupler ah he noodled again with the specs and fell into a study of the complicated diagram miles rocked impatiently on his heels when he felt he could no longer maintain his respectful silence without the top of his head blowing off he said yes but what does it do just what it says presumably generates a fivespace distortion field which does what to what ah the professor sank back in his station chair and rubbed his chin ruefully answering that may take a little longer cant we run comconsole simulations to be sure but to get the right answer one must first correctly frame the question i wanthumpha mathematical physicist specializing in fivespace theory probably dr riva shes at the university of solstice if shes komarran impsec will object yes but shes here onplanet ive consulted her before when i investigated a politically suspicious wormhole jump accident on the sergyar route two years ago she thinks sideways better than any of the other fivespace people i know miles was under the impression that all fivespace math experts thought sideways to the rest of humanity but he nodded understanding of the importance of this character trait i want her i shall have her but before i drag her out of her comfortable academic routine i think i want to visit bollan in person your colonel gibbs is very good but he cant have asked all the questions miles considered denying personal ownership of impsec and anyone in it but recognized ruefully that he was now identified as the authority on impsec among the auditors just as vorthys was identified as the engineering expert its an impsec problem he pictured some future conclave of his colleagues concluding give it to vorkosigan right the trip to bollan designs plant did not prove as enlightening as miles had hoped a hop in a suborbital shuttle to a dome one sector west of serifosa soon brought miles and vorthys facetoface with bollans upset owners since theyd already thrown open all their records to impsec that morning they had little more to offer the imperial auditors the administrative people knew only of financial and contractual details with soudhas mythical private research institute that had supposedly ordered the work some techs whod worked in the fabrication shop had very little to add to the specs already in vorthyss possession if the missing engineer had been as innocent of the true identity of the customer and purpose of the device as were the rest of the bollan employees hed have had no reason to flee bollan design had committed no crime that miles could identify however the techs were able to recall dates of several visits from men answering to descriptions of soudha cappell and radovas definitely one from soudha as recently as the previous week their supervisor had never included them in these conferences they had been told never to discuss the odd necklin generators outside their work group as the devices were experimental and not yet patented trade secrets soon to transmute into profit or loss the progression so far had looked a lot more like loss than profit the customers had always picked up the finished devices from the plant themselves not had them delivered anywhere miles made a note to find out if waste heat had owned their own large transport and if not to have impsec check out recent liftvan rentals of anything big enough to have hauled those last two generators nosing around the plant while the professor went off to speak high engineering to the bilingual miles felt himself increasingly drawn to the hypothesis that the chief designer had gone missing voluntarily upon closer examination it had been found that many of the mans personal notes had apparently gone with him bollans plant security was not military grade but it would be a stretch to imagine soudhas hurried komarrans first murdering the man then smoothly and surgically removing quite so many comconsole records from quite so many locations without inside help anyway miles didnt wish the man dead in a ditch he wished him very much alive at the business end of tuomonens hypospray that was the trouble people anticipated fastpenta now modern conspirators were a lot more tightlipped than back in the bad old days of mere physical torture three days ago if someone had told miles that gibbs was going to hand him what amounted to complete design specs of soudhas secret weapon on a platter he would have been delighted to imagine his case nearly solved ha miles and vorthys arrived back at ekaterins apartment that light too late for dinner but in time for a handmade dessert obviously tailored to the professors tastes involving chocolate cream and quantities of hydroponic pecans they all sat around ekaterins kitchen table to devour it whatever nikki had encountered from his playmates today it hadnt been unpleasant enough to affect his appetite miles noted with approval how was school today miles asked him ashamed to let such a deadly boring triteness fall from his lips but how else was he supposed to find out all right nikki said around a mouthful of cream think youll have any trouble tomorrow naw the tone of his monosyllables had returned to its normal preadolescent adultwary indifference no more the breathy panicked edge of this morning good miles said affably ekaterins eyes were smiling miles noted out of the corner of his own good when nikki finished bolting his dessert and galloped off she added wryly and how was work today i wasnt sure if the extra hours represented progress or the reverse how was work today her tone seemed to apologize for the prosaic quality of the question miles wondered how to explain to her that he found it altogether delightful and wished shed do it again and again and her perfume was making his reptilebrain want to roll over and do tricks and he wasnt even sure she was wearing any this mindmelting mixture of lust and domesticity was entirely novel to him well half novel he knew how to handle lust it was the domesticity that had ambushed his guard we have advanced to new and surprising levels of bafflement miles told her the professor opened his mouth closed it then said that about sums it up lord vorkosigans hypothesis has proved correct the embezzlement scheme was got up to support the production of a um novel device secret weapon miles corrected i said secret weapon the professors eyes glinted in amusement define your terms if its a weapon then whats the target its so secret miles explained to ekaterin we cant even figure out what it does so im at least half right he glanced after nikki i take it once nikki got into his usual routine things smoothed out yes id been almost certain they would said ekaterin thank you so much for your help this morning lord vorkosigan im very grateful that miles was saved from certain embarrassment by the chime of the hall door ekaterin rose and went to answer it and the professor followed blocking miles from his planned counterbid how did things go with the estate law counselor i was sure you could get on top of it the impsec guard was now on post in the hallway miles reminded himself he didnt need to make a parade out of this tucking the line away in his head for the next conversationopener he tapped open the airseal door and wandered out onto the balcony both sun and soletta had set hours ago only the city itself gave a glow to the night a few pedestrians still crossed the park below moving in and out of the shadows hurrying on their way to or from the bubblecar platform or strolling more slowly in pairs miles leaned on the railing and studied one sauntering couple his arm draped across her shoulders her arm circling his waist in zero gee a height difference like that would cancel out by god and how did the spacedwelling fourarmed quaddies manage these moments hed met a quaddie musician once he was certain there must be a quaddie equivalent to a grip so humanly universal his idle envious speculations were derailed by the sound of voices within the apartment ekaterin was welcoming a guest a mans voice komarran accented miles stiffened as he recognized the rabbity veniers quick speech impsec didnt take as long to release his personal effects as i would have imagined so colonel gibbs said i might bring them to you thank you venier ekaterins voice replied in the soft tone miles had come to associate with wariness in her just put the box down on the table why dont you now where did he go a clunk most of it is nothing styluses and the like but i figured you would want the vidclipper with all the holos of you and your son yes indeed actually there is more to my visit than just cleaning out administrator vorsoissons office venier took a deep breath i wanted to speak to you privately miles who had been about to reenter the kitchen from the balcony froze dammit impsec had questioned and cleared venier hadnt they what new secret could he be about to offer and to ekaterin of all people if miles entered would he clam up well well all right um why dont you sit down thank you the scrape of chairs venier began again ive been thinking about how awkward your situation here has become since the administrators death im so very sorry but i couldnt help being aware watching you over the months that things were not what they should have been between you and your late husband tien was difficult i didnt realize it showed tien was an ass venier stated flatly that showed sorry sorry but its true and we both know it its moot now her tone was not encouraging venier forged on i heard about how he played fast and loose with your pension his death has plunged you into a monstrous situation i understand you are being forced to return to barrayar ekaterin said slowly i plan to return to barrayar yes he ought to clear his throat miles thought trip over a balcony chair pop back through the door and cry vennie fancy meeting you here he began breathing through his mouth for silence instead i realize this is a bad time to bring this up much too soon venier went on but ive been watching you for months the way you were treated practically a prisoner in a traditional barrayaran marriage i could not tell how willing a prisoner you were but nowhave you considered staying on komarr not going back into your cell you have this chance you see to escape miles could feel his heart begin to beat in a freeform panic where was venier going with this i the economics our return passage is a death benefit you see that same wary softness i have an alternative to offer you venier swallowed miles swore he could hear the slight gurgle in his narrow neck marry me it would give you the legal protection you need to stay here no one could force you back then i could support you while you train up to your full strength botany or chemistry or anything you choose you could be so much i cant tell you how its turned my stomach to see so much human potential wasted on that clown of a barrayaran i realize that for you it would have to start as a marriage of convenience but as a vor thats surely not an alien idea for you and it could grow to be more in time im certain it could i know its too soon but soon youll be gone and then it will be too late venier paused for breath miles bent over mouth still open in a sort of silent scream my lines my lines those were all my lines dammit hed expected vorish rivals for ekaterins hand to come pouring out of the woodwork as soon as the widow touched down in vorbarr sultana but my god she hadnt even got off komarr yet he hadnt thought of venier or any other komarran as possible competition he wasnt competition the idea of vennie as competition was laughable miles had more power position money rank all to lay at her feet when the time was finally ripevenier wasnt even taller than ekaterin he was a good four centimeters shorter the one thing miles couldnt offer though was less barrayar in that venier had an advantage miles could never match there followed a long terrifying silence during which miless brain screamed say no say no say no thats very kindly offered ekaterin said at last what the hell is that supposed to mean and was venier wondering the same thing kindness has nothing to do with it i venier cleared his throat again admire you very much oh dear he added eagerly ive applied for the administrative position as head of terraforming here i think i have a good chance because of the disruption in the department hq is surely going to be looking for some continuity or if the mud has splattered on the innocent as well as the guilty ill do whatever i have to do to get another shot a chance to clear my professional reputationi can make serifosa sector a showcase i know i can if you stay i can get you voting shares we could do it together we could make this place a garden stay here and help build a world another long terrifying silence then ekaterin said i suppose youd be assigned this apartment if you succeeded to tiens position it goes with it said venier in an uncertain voice right that wasnt a selling point though miles wasnt sure if venier knew it i can hardly bear being in this place shed said you offer is kind and generous venier but you have mistaken my situation somewhat no one is forcing me to return home komarr im afraid these domes give me claustrophobia anymore every time i pull on a breath mask im going to think about the ugly way tien died ah said venier i can understand that but perhaps in time oh yes time vor custom calls for a widow to mourn for one year miles could not guess what gesture what facial expression went with these words a grimace a smile do you hold to that archaic custom must you why i never understood it i thought in the time of isolation they tried to keep all women married all the time actually i think it was practical it gave time to be certain any pregnancy that might have been started could be completed while the woman was still under the control of her late husbands family so they could be sure of claiming custody of any male issue but still whether i believe in formal mourning or not wont matter as long as people think i do i can use it to defend myself fromfrom unwanted suits i so much need a quiet time and place to find my balance again there was a short silence then venier said more stiffly defend i did not mean my proposal as an attack kat of course i dont think that she replied faintly lie lie of course she bloody well did ekaterin had experienced marriage as one long siege of her soul after ten years of tien she probably felt about matrimony the way miles felt about needlegrenade launchers this was very bad for venier good but it was equally bad for miles bad good bad good bad kat i i wont make a pest of myself but think about it think about all your alternatives before you do anything irrevocable ill still be here another awful silence then i dont wish to give you pain who never gave me any but its wrong to make people live on false hopes a long indrawn breath as if she was mustering all her strength no yes and then added more weakly but thank you so much for caring about me longer silence then venier said i meant to help i can see ive made it worse i really must be going i still have to pick up dinner on the way home yes and eat it alone you miserable rabbit ha madame vorsoisson good night let me see you to the door thank you again for bringing tiens things i do hope you get tiens job venier im sure you could do it well its time they started promoting komarrans into the higher administrative positions again miles slowly unfroze wondering how he was going to slip past her now if she went on to check nikki as she might he could nip into her workroom without her seeing him and pretend hed been there all the time instead he heard her steps return to the kitchen a scrape and rattle a sigh then a louder rattle as the contents of a box were apparently dumped wholesale into the trash chute a chair being pulled or pushed he inched forward to peek around the door port she had sat again for a moment her hands pressed against her eyes crying laughing she rubbed her face threw back her head and stood turning toward the balcony miles hastily backed up looked around and sat in the nearest chair he extended his legs and threw back his head artistically and closed his eyes dare he try to fake a snore or would that be overdoing it her steps paused oh god what if she sealed the door locking him out like a strayed cat would he have to bang on the glass or stay out here all night would anyone miss him could he climb down and come back in the front door the thought made him shudder he wasnt due for another seizure but you never knew that was part of what made his disorder so much fun her steps continued he let his mouth hang slack then he sat up blinking and snorting she was staring at him in surprise her elegant features thrown into strong relief by the halflight from the kitchen oh madame vorsoisson i must have been more tired than i thought were you asleep his yes mutated to a weak mm as he recalled his promise not to lie to her he rubbed his neck id have been halfparalyzed in that position her brows drew down quizzically and she crossed her arms lord vorkosigan i didnt think imperial auditors were supposed to prevaricate like that what badly he sat all the way up and sighed im sorry id stepped out to contemplate the view and i didnt think anything when i first heard vennie enter and then i thought it might be something to do with the case and then it was too late to say anything without embarrassing us all as bad as the business with your comconsole all over again sorry accidents both im not like this really she cocked her head a weird quirky smile tilting her mouth what insatiably curious and entirely free of social inhibitions yes you are its not the impsec training youre a natural no wonder you did so well for them was this a compliment or an insult he couldnt quite tell good bad goodbadgood he rose smiled abandoned the idea of asking her about the estate law session bid her a polite good night and fled in ignominy chapter seventeen ekaterin made an early start the following morning to meet her aunt inbound from barrayar the ferry from komarr to the wormhole jump station broke orbit before noon solstice time ekaterin settled into her private sleepercell aboard the ferry with a contented guilty sigh it was just like uncle vorthys to have provided this comfort for her he did nothing by halves no artificial shortages she could almost hear him enthusiastically booming though he usually recited that slogan in reference to desserts so what if she could stand in the middle of the cabinette and touch both walls she was glad not to be rubbing shoulders with the crowds in the economy seats as she had done on her first passage even if it was only an eighthour flight from komarr orbit to jump station dock she had sat then between tien and nikki at the climax of a sevenday passage from barrayar and been hardpressed to name which of them had been more tired tense and cranky including herself if only shed accepted veniers proposal she wouldnt be facing a repeat of that wearing journey a point in his favor vennie could not have guessed at just as well she thought of his unexpected offer last night in her kitchen and her lips twisted in remembered embarrassment amusement and an odd little flash of anger how had venier ever got the idea that she was available in wariness of tiens irrational jealousy shed thought she had tamped out any possible comeon signal from her manner long ago or did she really look so pitiful that even a modest soul like vennie could imagine himself her rescuer if so that surely wasnt his fault neither veniers nor vorkosigans enthusiastic plans for her future education and employment were distasteful to her indeed they matched her own aspirations and yet both somehow implied you can become a real person but only if you play our game why cant i be real where i am drat it she was not going to let this churning mess of emotions spoil her precious slice of solitude she dug her reader out of her carryon arranged the generous allotment of cushions and stretched out on the bunk at a moment like this he could really wonder why solitary confinement was considered such a severe punishment why no one could get at you she wriggled her toes luxuriating the guilt was for nikki left ruthlessly behind with one of us school friends putatively so that he would miss no classes if as ekaterin sometimes felt she really did do nothing of value all day long why did she have to inconvenience so many people to take over her duties when she left something didnt add up not that madame vortorren whose husband was an aide to the imperial counsellors serifosa deputy hadnt seemed cordially willing to help out the new widow nor was adding nikki to her household any great strain on its resources he had four children of her own whom she somehow managed to feed clothe and direct amidst a general chaos which never seemed to ruffle her air of benign absentmindedness madame vortorrens children had learned early to be selfreliant and was that so bad nikki had been fended off in his plea to accompany ekaterin with the reminder that the ferry pilots had strict rules against allowing passengers on the flight deck and anyway it wasnt even a jumpship in reality ekaterin looked forward to a private time to talk frankly with her aunt about her late life with tien without nikki overhearing every word her pentup thoughts felt like an overfilled reservoir churning in her head with no release she could barely sense the acceleration as the ferry sped onward she popped the bookdisk the law counselor had recommended to her on estate and financial management into her viewer and settled back the counselor had confirmed vorkosigans shrewd guess about tiens debts ending with his estate she would be walking away after ten years with exactly nothing emptyhanded as she had come except for the value of the experience she snorted upon reflection she actually preferred to be beholden to tien for nothing let all debts be canceled the management disk was dry stuff but a disk on escobaran water gardens waited as her reward when she was done with her homework it was true she had no money to manage as yet that too must change knowledge might not be power but ignorance was definitely weakness and so was poverty time and past time to stop assuming she was the child and everyone else the grownups ive been down once im never going down again she finished one book and half the other got in an exquisite uninterrupted twohour nap and waked and tidied herself by the time the ferry arrived and began maneuvering to dock she repacked her overnight bag hitched up its shoulder strap and went off to watch through the lounge viewports as they approached the transfer station and the jump point it served this station had been built nearly a century ago when fresh explorations of the wormhole had yielded up the rediscovery of barrayar the lost colony had been found at the end of a complex multijump route entirely different from the one through which it had originally been settled the station had undergone modification and enlargement during the period of the cetagandan invasion komarr had granted the ghem lords right of passage in exchange for massive trade concessions throughout the cetagandan empire and a slice of the projected profits of the conquest a bargain it later came to regret a quieter period had followed till the barrayarans graduates of the harsh school of the failed cetagandan occupation had poured through in turn under the new barrayaran imperial management the station had grown again into a farflung and chaotic structure housing some five thousand resident employees their families and a fluctuating number of transients and serving some hundreds of ships a week on the only route to and from culdesac barrayar a new long docking bar was under construction sticking out from the bristling structure the barrayaran military station was a bright dot in the distance bracketing the invisible fivespace jump point ekaterin could see half a dozen ships in flight between civilian station and jump point maneuvering to or from dock and a couple of localspace freighters chugging off with cargoes to transfer at one of the other wormhole jump points then the ferry itself slid into its docking bay and the looming station occluded the view the tedious business of customs checks having been got through back in komarr orbit before boarding the ferrys passengers disembarked freely ekaterin checked her holocube map very necessary in this fantastic maze of a place and went off to ensure a hostel room for the night for herself and her aunt and to drop off her luggage there the hostel room was small but quiet and should do nicely to give poor aunt vorthys time to recover from her jump sickness before completing the last leg of her journey ekaterin wished shed had such a luxury available on her own inbound passage realizing that the last thing the professora would want to face immediately was a meal ekaterin prudently paused for a snack in an adjoining concourse cafe then went off to wait her ships docking in the disembarkation lounge nearest its assigned bay she selected a seat with a good view of the airseal doors and faintly regretted not bringing her reader in case of delays but the station and its denizens were a fascinating distraction where were all these people going and why most arresting to her eye were the obvious galactics notfromaroundhere in strange planetary garb were they passing through for business diplomacy refuge recreation ekaterin had seen two worlds in her life would she ever see more two she reminded herself was one more than most people ever got dont be greedy how many had vorkosigan seen her idle thoughts circled back to her own personal disaster like a flood victim sorting through her ruined possessions after the waters have receded was the old vor ideal of marriage and family an intrinsic contradiction of a womans soul or was it just tien whod been the source of her shrinkage it was not clear how to sort out the answer without multiple trials and marriage was not an experiment she cared to repeat yet the professora seemed to be proof of the possible she had public achievementshe was a historian teacher scholar in four languagesshe had three grown children and a marriage heading for the halfcentury mark had she made secret compromises she had a solid place in her profession might she have had a place at the top she had three childrenmight she have had six we are going to have a race madame vorsoisson do you wish to run with your right leg chopped off or your left leg chopped off i want to run on both legs aunt vorthys had run on both legs reasonably serenely ekaterin had lived in her household and didnt think she overidealized her auntbut then shed been married to uncle vorthys ones career might depend solely on ones own efforts but marriage was a lottery and you drew your lot in late adolescence or early adulthood at a point of maximum idiocy and confusion perhaps it was just as well if people were too sensible the human race might well come to an end evolution favored the maximum production of children not of happiness so how did you end up with neither she snorted selfderision then sat up as the doors slid open and people began trickling through most of the tide had passed when ekaterin spotted the short woman with the wobbly step assisted by a shipping line porter who saw her through the doors and handed her the leash of the float pallet holding her luggage ekaterin rose smiling and started forward her aunt looked thoroughly frazzled her long gray hair escaping its windings atop her head to drift about her face which had lost its usual attractive pink glow in favor of a greenishgray tinge her blue bolero and calflength skirt looked rumpled and the matching embroidered travel boots were perched precariously atop the pile of luggage replaced on her feet with what were obviously bedroom slippers aunt vorthys fell into ekaterins hug oh so good to see you ekaterin held her out to search her face was the trip very bad five jumps said aunt vorthys hollowly and it was such a fast ship there wasnt as much time to recover between be glad youre one of the lucky ones i get a touch of nausea ekaterin consoled her on the theory that misery might appreciate company it passes off in about half an hour nikki is the lucky oneit doesnt seem to affect him at all tien had concealed his symptoms in grouchiness afraid of showing something he construed as weakness should she have tried to it doesnt matter now let it go i have a nice quiet hostel room waiting for you to lie down in we can get tea there oh lovely dear here why is your luggage riding and you walking ekaterin rearranged the two bags on the float pallet and flipped up the little seat sit down and ill tow you if its not too dizzy a ride the jumps made my feet swell of all things ekaterin helped her aboard made sure she felt secure and started off at a slow walk i apologize for uncle vorthys dragging you all the way out here for me im only planning to stay a few more weeks you see id meant to come anyway if his case went on much longer it doesnt seem to be going as quickly as he expected no well no ill tell you all the horrible details when we get in a public concourse was not the venue for discussing it all quite dear you look well if rather komarran ekaterin glanced down at her dun vest and beige trousers ive found komarran dress to be comfortable not the least because it lets me blend in someday id love to see you dress to stand out not today though no probably not do you plan on traditional mourning garb when you get home yes i think it would be a very good idea it might save save dealing with a lot of things i dont want to deal with just now i understand despite her jump sickness aunt vorthys stared around with interest at the passing station and began updating ekaterin on the lives of her vorthys cousins her aunt had grandchildren ekaterin thought yet still seemed latemiddleaged rather than old in the time of isolation a barrayaran woman would have been old at fortyfive waiting for deathif she made it even that far in the last century womens life expectancies had doubled and might even be headed toward the tripleportion taken for granted by such galactics as the betans had ekaterins own mothers early death given her a false sense of time and of timing i have two lives for my foremothers one two lives in which to accomplish her dual goals if one could stretch them out instead of piling them atop one another and the arrival of the uterine replicator had changed everything too profoundly why had she wasted a decade trying to play the game by the old rules yet a decade at twenty did not seem quite a straight trade for a decade at ninety she needed to think this through away from the docks and locks area the crowds thinned to an occasional passerby the station did not run so much on a dayandnight rhythm as on a ships in dock everybody switch load and unload like mad because time was money ships out quiet falls again pattern which did not necessarily match the solsticestandard time kept throughout komarr localspace ekaterin turned up a narrow utility corridor shed discovered earlier which provided a shortcut to the food concourse and her hostel beyond one of the kiosks baked traditional barrayaran breads and cannily vented their ovens into the concourse for advertising ekaterin could smell yeast and cardamom and hot brillberry syrup the combination was redolent of barrayaran winterfair and a wave of homesickness shook her coming down the otherwiseunpeopled corridor toward them along with the aromas was a man wearing stationerstyle dockworker coveralls the commercial logo on his left breast read southport transport ltd done in tilted speedylooking letters with little lines shooting off he carried two large bags crammed with mealboxes he stopped short and stared in shock as did she it was one of the engineers from waste heat managementarozzi was his name he recognized her at once too unfortunately madame vorsoisson and more weakly imagine meeting you here he stared around with a frantic trapped look is the administrator with you ekaterin was just mustering a plan for im sorry i dont believe i know you followed by dancing around him blankly walking away without looking back turning the corner and dashing madly for the nearest emergency call box but arozzi dropped his bags dug a stunner out of his pocket and fumbled it right way round before shed made it any further than im sorry so am i he said with evident sincerity and fired ekaterins eyes opened on a cockeyed view of the corridor ceiling her whole body felt like pins and needles and refused to obey her urgent summons to move her tongue felt like a waddedup sock stuffed in her mouth dont make me stun you arozzi was pleading with someone i will i believe you came aunt vorthyss breathless voice from just behind ekaterins ear ekaterin realized she was now aboard the float pallet halfsitting up against her aunts chest her legs hung limply over the rearranged luggage in front of her the professoras hand gripped her shoulder arozzi after a desperate look around set his mealboxes in her lap picked up the float pallets lead and started off down the corridor as fast as the whining overburdened pallet would follow help thought ekaterin im being kidnapped by a komarran terrorist her cry as they turned down another corridor and passed a woman in a food service uniform came out a low moan the woman barely glanced at them not an unusual sight this two very jumpsick transients being towed to their connecting ship or to a hostel or maybe to the infirmary or the morgue heavy stun ekaterin had been given to understand knocked people out for hours this must be light stun was this a favor she could not feel her limbs but she could feel her heart beating thudding heavily in her chest as adrenaline struggled uselessly with her unresponsive peripheral nervous system more turns more drops more levels was her map cube still in her pocket they passed out of passengercountry into more utilitarian levels devoted to freight and ship repair at last they turned in at a door labeled southport transport ltd in the same logo style as on the coveralls and authorized personnel only in larger red print arozzi led them around a turn through some more airseal doors and down a ramp into a large loading bay it smelled cold all oil and ozone and a sharp sick scent of plastics they were at the outermost skin of the station anyway whatever direction theyd come shed seen the southport logo before ekaterin realized it was one of those minor shoestringbudgeted localspace shipping companies that eked out a living in the few interstices left by the big komarran family firms a tall squarelybuilt man also in workers coveralls trod across the bay toward them his footsteps echoing it was dr soudha dinner at last he began then he caught sight of the float pallet what the hell roz what is this madame vorsoisson he stared at her in astonishment she stared back at him in muzzy loathing i ran smack into her when i was coming away from the food concourse explained arozzi grounding the float pallet i couldnt help it she recognized me i couldnt let her run and report so i stunned her and brought her here roz you fool the last thing we need right now is hostages shes sure to be missed and how soon i didnt have a choice whos this other lady he gave the professora a weirdly polite harried howdyoudo nod my name is helen vorthys said the professora not lord auditor vorthyss wife yes her voice was cold and steady but as sensation returned ekaterin could feel the slight tremble in her body soudha swore under his breath ekaterin swallowed ran her tongue around her mouth and struggled to sit up arozzi rescued his boxes then belatedly drew his stunner again a woman attracted by the raised voices approached around a stack of equipment middleaged with frizzy grayblond hair she also wore southport transport coveralls ekaterin recognized lena foscol the accountant ekaterin husked aunt vorthys who are these people do you know them ekaterin said loudly if a little thickly theyre the criminals who stole a huge sum of money from the terraforming project and murdered tien foscol startled said what we did no such thing he was alive when i left him left him chained to a railing with an empty oxygen canister which you never checked and then called me to come get him an hour and a half too late ekaterin spat scorn an exquisite setup madame mad emperor yuri would have considered it a work of art oh foscol breathed she looked sick is this true youre lying no one would go outdome with an empty canister you knew tien said ekaterin what do you think foscol fell silent soudha was pale im sorry madame vorsoisson if that was what happened it was an accident we intended him to live i swear to you ekaterin let her lips thin and said nothing sitting up with her legs swung out to the deck she was able to get a less dizzying view of the loading bay it was some thirty meters across and twenty deep strongly lit with catwalks and looping power lines running across the ceiling and a glasswalled control booth on the opposite side from the broad entry ramp down which theyd come equipment lay scattered here and there around a huge object dominating the center of the chamber its main part seemed to consist of a wriggly trumpetshaped cone made of some dark polished substancemetal glassresting in heavily padded clamps on a grounded float cradle a lot of power connections slotted in at its narrow end the mouth of the bell was more than twice as tall as ekaterin was this the secret weapon lord vorkosigan had posited and how had they ever got it and themselves past the impsec manhunt impsec was surely checking every shuttle that left the planetary surfacenow ekaterin realized this thing could have been transported weeks ago before the hunt even started and impsec was probably concentrating its attention on jumpships and their passengers not on freight tugs trapped in local space soudhas conspirators had had years to develop their false id they acted as though they owned this placemaybe they did foscol spoke to ekaterins fraught silence almost as tightlipped as ekaterin herself we are not murderers not like you barrayarans ive never killed anyone in my life for notmurderers your body count is getting impressive ekaterin shot back i dont know what happened to radovas and trogir but what about the six poor people on the soletta crew and that ore freighter pilotand tien thats eight at least maybe ten maybe twelve if i dont watch my step i was a student at solstice university during the revolt foscol snarled clearly very rattled by the news about tien i saw friends and classmates shot in the streets during the riots i remember the outgassing of the green park dome dont you darea barrayaransit there and make mouth at me about murder i was five years old at the time of the komarr revolt said ekaterin wearily what do you think i ought to have done about it eh if you want to go back in history the professora put in dryly you komarrans were the people who let the cetagandans in on us five million barrayarans died before the first komarran ever did crying for your past dead is a piece of onedownsmanship a komarran cannot win that was longer ago said foscol a little desperately ah i see so the difference between a criminal and a hero is the order in which their vile crimes are committed said the professora in a voice dripping false cordiality and justice comes with a sellby date in that case youd better hurry you wouldnt want your heroism to spoil foscol drew herself up we arent planning to kill anyone all of us here saw the futility of that kind of heroics twentyfive years ago things dont seem to be running exactly according to plan then do they murmured ekaterin rubbing her face it was becoming less numb she wished she could say the same for her wits i notice you dont deny being thieves just getting some of our own back glinted foscol the money poured into komarran terraforming doesnt do barrayar any direct good you were stealing from your own grandchildren what we took we took to make an investment for komarr that will pay back incalculable benefit to our future generations foscol returned had ekaterins words stung her maybe soudha looked as though he was thinking furiously eyeing the two barrayaran women keep them arguing ekaterin thought people couldnt argue and think at the same time or at least a lot of people shed met seemed to have that trouble if she could keep them talking while her body recovered a little more from the stun she could what her eye fell on a fire and emergency alarm at the base of the entry ramp maybe ten steps away alarm false alarm the attention of irate authorities drawn to southport transport could arozzi stun her again in less than ten steps she leaned back against her aunts legs trying to look very limp and let one hand curl around the professoras ankle as if for comfort the novel device loomed silently and mysteriously in the center of the chamber so what are you planning to do ekaterin said sarcastically shut down the wormhole jump and cut us off or are you going to make her voice died as the shocked silence her words had created penetrated she stared around at the three komarrans staring at her in horror in a suddenly smaller voice she said you cant do that can you there was a military maneuver for rendering a wormhole temporarily impassable which involved sacrificing a shipand its pilotat a midjump node but the disruption damped out in a short time wormholes opened and closed yes but they were astrographic features like stars involving time scales and energies beyond the present human capacity to control you cant do that ekaterin said more firmly whatever disruption you create sooner or later it will become passable again and then youll be in twice as much trouble as before unless soudhas conspiracy was just the tip of an iceberg with some huge coordinated plan behind it for all of komarr to rise against barrayaran rule in a new komarr revolt more war more blood under glassthe domes of komarr might give her claustrophobia but the thought of her komarran neighbors going down to destruction in yet another round of this endless struggle made her sick to her stomach the revolt had done vile things to barrayarans too if new hostilities were ignited and went on long enough nikki would come of an age to be sucked into them you cant hold it closed you cant hold out here you have no defenses we can and we will said soudha firmly foscols brown eyes shone were going to close the wormhole permanently well get rid of barrayar forever without firing a shot a completely bloodless revolution and there will be nothing they can do about it an engineers revolution said soudha and a ghost of a smile curved his lips ekaterins heart hammered and the echoing loading bay seemed to tilt she swallowed and spoke with effort youre planning to shut the wormhole to barrayar with the butcher of komarr and threefourths of barrayars spacebased military forces on this side and you actually think youre going to get a bloodless revolution and what about all the people on sergyar you are idiots the original plan said soudha tightly was to strike at the time of the emperors wedding when the butcher of komarr and threefourths of the space forces would have been safely in barrayar orbit along with a lot of innocent galactic diplomats and not a few komarrans i cannot think of a better fate for all the top collaborators said foscol than to be locked in with their lovely barrayaran friends the old vor lords are always saying how much better they had it back in their time of isolation were just giving them their wish ekaterin squeezed the professoras ankle and climbed slowly to her feet upright she swayed wishing her unbalance really were artistic fakery to put the komarrans offguard she spoke with deadly venom in the time of isolation i would have been dead at forty in the time of isolation it would have been my job to cut my mutant infants throats while my female relatives watched i guarantee at least half the population of barrayar does not agree with the old vor lords including most of the old vor ladies and you would condemn us all to go back to that and you dare to call it bloodless then count yourself lucky youre on the komarran side said soudha dryly come on folks we have work to do and less time than ever to do it starting from now all sleep shifts are canceled lena go wake up cappell and we have to figure out how to lock these ladies down safely out of the way for a while the komarrans were no longer waiting for the emperors wedding to provide their ideal tactical moment it appeared how close were they to putting their device into action close enough it appeared that even the arrival of two unwanted hostages wasnt enough to divert them aunt vorthys was trying to sit up straighter arozzis eye had returned to the boxes of cooling food at his feet now ekaterin launched herself forward barreling into arozzi and dashing onward arozzi swung around after her but was temporarily distracted by a blue boot thrown with surprising accuracy if limited strength by aunt vorthys which bounced off the side of his head soudha and foscol both began sprinting after her but ekaterin made it to the alarm and yanked down the lever hard hanging on it as arozzis wavering stun beam found her it hurt more this time her hands spasmed open and she fell the first beat of the klaxon smote her ears before the shock and blackness took her away again ekaterin opened her eyes to see her aunts face sideways she realized she was lying with her head on the professoras lap she blinked and tried to lick her lips her body was all pins and needles and deep aches a wave of nausea wrenched her stomach and she struggled to lean sideways a couple of spasms did not result in vomiting however and after a muffled belch she rolled back are we rescued she mumbled they did not look rescued to her they appeared to be sitting on the floor of a tiny lavatory chilly and hard no said the professora in a tone of disgust her face was tense and pale with red bruises showing in the soft skin of her face and neck her hair was half down straggling over her brow they gagged me and dragged us both over behind that thing the station squad burst in all right but soudha made all sorts of fasttalk apologies he claimed it was an accident when arozzi stumbled into the wall and agreed to pay some enormous fine or another for turning in false alarms i tried to make a noise but it didnt do any good then they locked us in here oh said ekaterin drat oversocialized maybe but stronger words seemed just as inadequate just so dear it was a good try though for a moment i thought it would work and so did your komarrans they were very upset it will make the next try harder very likely agreed her aunt we must think carefully what it ought to be i dont think we can count on a third chance brutality does not seem to come naturally to them but they do act very stressed i dont believe those are safe people just now for all that they know you when do you think we will be missed not very soon said ekaterin regretfully i sent a message to uncle vorthys when i first got in to the station hostel he may not expect another till we fail to get off the ferry tomorrow night something will happen then said the professora her tone of quiet confidence was undercut when she added more faintly surely yes but what will happen between now and then yes ekaterin echoed she stared around the locked lavatory surely chapter eighteen professor vorthyss requested experts were due to arrive at the serifosa shuttleport at nearly the same early hour as ekaterin departed for her connection with the jump station ferry so miles managed to invite himself along on what would otherwise have been a family farewell ekaterin did not discuss last nights visit from venier with her uncle miles had no opportunity to urge her dont accept any marriage proposals from strangers while youre out there the professor loaded her with verbal messages for his wife and got a goodbye hug miles stood with his hands shoved in his pockets and nodded a cordial safejourney to her what miles thought of as the boffin express a commercial morning flight from solstice landed a short time later the fivespace expert dr riva turned out to be a thin intense oliveskinned woman of about fifty with bright black eyes and a quick smile a stout sandy young man she had in tow whom miles first pegged as an undergraduate student was revealed as a mathematics professor colleague dr yuell a highpowered impsec aircar waited to whisk them directly out to the waste heat experiment station when they arrived the professor led them all upstairs to his nest which seemed to have acquired more comconsoles stacks of flimsies and tables littered with machine parts overnight to everyones discomfort but not to miless surprise impsec major demorie took formal recorded oaths of loyalty and secrecy from the two komarran consultants miles thought the loyalty oath was redundant since neither academic could have held their current posts without having taken one previously as for the secrecy oath miles wondered if either of the komarrans had noticed yet that they had no way of leaving the experiment station except by impsec transport the five of them all then sat down to a lecture conducted by lord auditor vorthys which seemed halfway between a military briefing and an academic seminar with a tendency to drift toward the latter miles wasnt sure if demorie was there as participant or observer but then miles didnt have much to say either except to confirm one or two points about the autopsies when he was cued by vorthys miles wondered again whether he might be more useful elsewhere such as out with the field agents he could hardly be less useful here he realized glumly as the mathematical references began flying over his head when you folks convert all that to the pretty colored shapes on the comconsole show me the picture i like my storybooks to have pictures in them perhaps he ought to go back to school for two or three years himself and brush up he consoled himself with the reflection that it was seldom he found himself in company who made him feel this stupid it was probably good for his soul the power thats fed into thei suppose we can call it the hornof the necklin field generator is pulsed definitely pulsed vorthys told the komarrans highly directional rapid and adjustablei almost want to say tunable thats so very odd said dr riva jumpship rods have steady powerin fact keeping unwanted fluctuations out of the power is a major design concern lets try some simulations with the various hypotheses miles woke up and bent closer as the assorted theories began to take visible form as threedimensional vector maps above the vidplate professor vorthys provided some limiting parameters based on the projected nature of the power supply the boffins did indeed produce some pretty pictures but except for aesthetic considerations involving color contrasts miles didnt see what was to choose among them what happens if somebody stands in front of the directional fivespace pulses from that thing he asked at last at various distances say or runs an ore freighter in front of it not much said riva staring at the whirls and lines with an intensity at least equal to miless im not sure it would be good for you on the cellular level to be that close to any power generator of this magnitude but it is after all a fivespace field pulse any threespace effects would be due to some unfocus on the fringe and doubtless take the energy form of gravitational waves artificial gravity is a fivespacethreespace interface phenomenon as is your military gravitic imploder lance demorie twitched slightly but trying to keep a fivespace physicist from knowing about the principles of the imploder lance was an exercise in futility right up there with trying to keep weather secret from a farmer the best the military could hope for was to keep the engineering details under wraps for a time could it be i dont know that were looking at half the weapon riva shrugged but looked interested rather than scornful so miles hoped it wasnt a stupid question have you determined if it is meant to be a weapon at all she said weve got some very dead people to account for miles pointed out that alas does not necessarily require a weapon professor vorthys sighed carelessness stupidity haste and ignorance are quite as powerfully destructive of forces as homicidal intent though i must confess a special distaste for intent it seems so unnecessarily redundant its antiengineering dr riva smiled now said vorthys what i want to know is what happens if you aim this device at a wormhole or possibly activate it while jumping through a wormhole one would in that case also have to take into account effects due to the necklin field it was traveling inside hmm said riva she and the sandyhaired youth went into close mathgibberishmode punctuated by some reprogramming of the simulation console the first colorful display was rejected by them both with the muttered comment thats not righta couple more went by riva sat back at last and ran her hands through her short curls any chance of taking this home to sleep on overnight ah said lord auditor vorthys im afraid i was unclear to you over the comconsole last night this is something in the nature of a crash program here we have reason to suspect time could be of the essence were all here for the duration till we figure this out no data leave this building what no dinner at the top of the dome in serifosa said yuell sounding disappointed not tonight vorthys apologized unless someone gets really inspired food and bedding will be supplied by the emperor riva glanced around the room and by implication the facility is this going to be the impsec budget hostel again bedrolls and readymeals the professor smiled wryly im afraid so i should have remembered that part from the last time well its motivation of a sort i suppose yuell thats enough of this comconsole for now somethings not right i need to pace the corridor is at your disposal professor vorthys told her cordially did you bring your walking shoes certainly i did remember that from our last date she stuck out her legs displaying comfortable thicksoled shoes and rose to go off to the hallway she began walking rapidly up and down murmuring to herself from time to time riva claims to think better while walking vorthys explained to miles her theory is that it pumps the blood up to her brain my theory is that since no one can keep up with her it cuts down on the distracting interruptions a kindred spirit by god can i watch yes but please dont talk to her unless she talks to you of course both vorthys and yuell returned to fooling with their comconsoles the professor appeared to be trying to refine his hypothetical design for the missing powersupply system or the novel device miles wasnt sure but what yuell was playing some sort of mathematical vid game miles leaned back in his station chair stared out the window and addressed his imagination to the question if i were a komarran conspirator with impsec on my tail and a novel device the size of a couple of elephants where would i hide it not in his luggage for damn sure he scratched out ideas on a flimsy and drew rejecting lines through most of them demorie studied the professors work and reran some of the earlier simulations after about threequarters of an hour miles became aware hat the echo of soft rapid footsteps from the corridor had eased he rose and went and poked his head out the door dr riva was seated on a window ledge at the end of the corridor gazing pensively out over the komarran landscape it fell away toward the stream here and was much less bleak than the usual scene being liberally colonized by earth green miles ventured to approach her she looked up at him with her quick smile as he neared which he returned he hitched his hip over the low ledge and followed her gaze out the sealed window then turned to study her profile so he said at last what are you thinking her lips twisted wryly im thinking that i dont believe in perpetual motion ah well if it had been easy or even just moderately difficult the professor would not have called for reinforcements miles reflected hm she turned her gaze from the scenery to him and said after a moment so youre really the son of the butcher im the son of aral vorkosigan he replied steadily yes her version of the perpetual question was neither the accidental social blunder of tien nor the deliberate provocation of venier it seemed something more scientific what was she testing for the private life of men of power isnt what we expect sometimes he jerked up his chin people have some very odd illusions about power mostly it consists of finding a parade and nipping over to place yourself at the head of the band just as eloquence consists of persuading people of things they desperately want to believe demagoguery i suppose is eloquence sliding to some least moral energy level he smiled bleakly at his boot pushing people uphill is one hell of a lot harder you can break your heart trying that literally but he saw no point in discussing the butchers medical history with her i was given to understand that power politics had chewed you up surely she could not see scars through his gray suit oh miles shrugged the prenatal damage was just the prologue the rest i did to myself if you could go back in time and change things would you prevent the soltoxin attack on my pregnant mother if i could only pick one event to change maybe not what because you wouldnt want to risk missing an auditorship at thirty her tone was only faintly mocking softened by her wry smile what the devil had vorthys told her about him anyway she was highly aware though of the power of an emperors voice i almost arrived at thirty in a coffin a couple of times an auditorship was never an ambition of mine that appointment was a caprice of gregors i wanted to be an admiral its not that he paused and drew in breath and let it out slowly ive made a lot of grievous mistakes in my life getting here but i wouldnt trade my journey now id be afraid of making myself smaller she cocked her head measuring his dwarfishness not missing his meaning thats as fair a definition of satisfaction as any ive ever heard he shrugged or loss of nerve dammit hed come out here to pick her brain so what do you think of the novel device she grimaced and rubbed her hands slowly palm to palm unless you want to posit that it was invented for the purpose of giving headaches to physicists i think its time to break for lunch miles grinned lunch we can supply lunch as threatened was indeed militaryissue readymeals though of the highest grade they all sat around one of the tables in the long room pushed aside chunks of equipment to make space and tore off the wrappers from the selfheating trays the komarrans eyed their food dubiously miles explained how it could have been much worse getting a giggle from riva the conversation became general touching on husbands and wives and children and tenure and an exchange of scurrilous anecdotes about the fecklessness of former colleagues demorie had a couple of good ones about early impsec cases miles was tempted to top them with a few about his cousin ivan but nobly refrained though he did explain how hed once sunk himself and his personal vehicle in several meters of arctic mud this led to the subject of the progress of komarran terraforming and so by degrees back to work riva miles noticed grew quieter and quieter she maintained her silence as they all took to the cornconsoles again after lunch she did not resume her pacing miles watched her covertly then less covertly she reran several simulations but did not play with further alterations miles knew damn well one couldnt hurry insight this kind of problemsolving was a lot more like fishing than like hunting waiting patiently and to a degree helplessly for things to rise up out of the depths of the mind he thought about the last time hed been fishing he considered rivas age shed been in her teens at the time of the barrayaran conquest of komarr in her twenties at the time of the revolt shed survived shed endured shed cooperated her years under imperial rule had been good including an obviously successful life of the mind and a single marriage shed compared children with vorthys and spoken of an eldest daughters upcoming wedding no komarran terrorist she if you could go back in time and change things the only moment in time you could change things was the elusive now which slipped through your fingers as fast as you could think about it he wondered if she was thinking about that right now too now now the professoras ship from barrayar would be getting ready for its final wormhole jump now ekaterins ferry would be approaching the jumppoint station now soudha and his crew of earnest techs would be doing what where now he was sitting in a room on komarr watching a quietly brilliant woman who had stopped thinking he rose and went to touch major demorie on his greenuniformed shoulder major can i have a word with you outside surprised demorie shut down his comconsole where hed been checking out some question about available power transformers vorthys had put to him he followed miles into the hall and down the corridor major do you have a fastpenta interrogation kit available demories brows rose i can check my lord do so get one and bring it to me please yes my lord demorie went off miles lingered by the window it was twenty minutes before demorie returned but he had the familiar case in his hand miles took it thank you now i would like you to take dr yuell for a walk discreetly ill let you know when you can come back in my lord if its a matter for fastpenta im sure impsec would want me to observe i know what impsec wants you may be assured i will tell them what they need to know afterward turnabout hah for all those briefings with vital pieces missing lieutenant vorkosigan had once endured life was good sometimes miles smiled a little sourly demorie intelligently veered off yes my lord auditor miles stood aside for demorie to exit with dr yuell when he entered the long room he locked the door after himself both professor vorthys and dr riva looked up at him in puzzlement whats that for dr riva asked as he set the case on the table and opened it dr riva i request and require a somewhat franker conversation with you than the one we had earlier he held up the hypospray and calibrated the dosage for her estimated body mass allergy check he didnt think he needed it but it was standard operating procedure if he didnt have to guess he didnt have to guess wrong he tore off a testdot from the coiled strip of them and walked over to her station chair she was too startled to resist at first when he took her hand turned it over and pressed the tester to the inside of her wrist but she jerked back her arm at the prickle he let it go miles said professor vorthys in an agitated voice what is this you cant fastpenta dr riva is my invited guest that wording was one step away from the sort of vor challenge that used to result in duels in the bad old days miles took a deep breath my lord auditor dr riva i have made two serious errors of judgment on this case so far if id avoided either of them your nephewinlaw would still be alive wed have nailed soudha before he got away with all his equipment and we would not now all be sitting at the bottom of a deep tactical hole playing with jigsaw puzzles they were both at heart the same error the first day we toured the terraforming project i did not insist on tien landing the aircar here though i wanted to see the place and on the second night i did not insist on a fastpenta interrogation of madame radovas though i wanted to youre the failure analyst professor am i wrong no but you could not have known miles oh but i could have known thats the whole point but i didnt choose to do what was necessary because i did not want to appear to use or abuse my auditorial power in an offensive way especially not on here on komarr where everyone is watching me the son of the butcher to see what ill do besides i spent a career fighting the powersthatbe now i am them naturally i was a little confused rivas hand was to her mouth there was no hive or red streak on the inside of her arm well and good miles returned to the table and picked up the hypospray lord vorkosigan i do not consent to this said riva stiffly as he approached her dr riva i did not ask you to his left hand guarded his right as in knifeplay the hypospray darted in to touch her neck even as she turned and began to rise from her chair it would be too cruel a dilemma she sank back glaring at him angry but not desperate she was divided in her own mind then which had doubtless saved them both the embarrassment of him chasing her around the room even at her age and dignity she could probably outrun him if she were truly determined to do so miles said the professor dangerously it may be your auditorial privilege but you had better be able to justify this hardly a privilege only my duty he stared into rivas eyes as her pupils dilated and she sank back limply in her chair he didnt bother with the standard opening litany of neutral questions while waiting for the drug to cut in but merely watched her lips their thin tension slowly softened to the stereotypical fastpenta smile her eyes remained more focused than those of the usual subject he bet she could make this a lengthy and circuitous interrogation if she chose hed do his best to cut that circuit as short as possible the shortest way across a hostile district was around three sides this was a really interesting fivespace problem that professor vorthys set you miles observed to her sort of a privilege to be brought in on it oh yes she agreed cordially she smiled frowned her hands twitched then her smile settled in more securely could be prizes and academic preferment when its all sorted out at last oh better than that she assured him new physics only come along once in a lifetime and usually youre too young or too old strange ive heard military careerists make the same complaint but wont soudha get the credit i doubt it was soudha who thought of it id bet it was the mathematician cappell or maybe poor dr radovas it should be named after radovas he died for it i suspect i dont want anybody else to die for it oh no she agreed earnestly what did you say it was again professor riva miles did his best to pitch his voice like a bewildered undergraduates i didnt understand the wormhole collapsing technique there ought to be a better name for it i wonder if your dr soudha calls it something shorter lord auditor vorthys whod been watching with sliteyed disapproval sat slowly upright his eyes widening his lips moving the last time miles had felt his stomach behave like this hed been on a combat drop from low orbit wormhole collapsing technique does this mean what i think it does wormhole collapsing technique he repeated blandly in his best fastpenta interrogator style wormholes collapse but didnt think anything people could do could cause them to wouldnt it take an awful lot of power they seem to have found a way around that resonance fivespace resonance amplitude augmentation you see shut down forever dont think it would work in reverse though cant be antientropic miles glanced at vorthys the words obviously meant something to him good dr riva waved her hands dreamily in front of her higher and higher and higher andboop she giggled it was a very fastpentaish sort of giggle the disturbing sort which suggested that on some other level in her drugscrambled brain she was not giggling at all maybe she was screaming as miles was except she added that theres something very wrong somewhere no lie he walked over and picked up the hypospray of antagonist and glanced up at vorthys anything you want to add while shes still under or is it time to go back to normal mode vorthys still had an abstracted inward look his mind obviously ratcheting over everything hed learned during the investigation in light of this new revolutionary idea he glanced up and over at the goofily grinning riva i think we need all our wits about us his brows drew down in something like pain one sees of course why she hesitated to confide her theory to us in case it is right miles walked over to riva with the second hypospray this is the fastpenta antagonist it will neutralize the drug in your system in less than a minute to his astonishment she threw up a restraining hand wait had it i could almost see it in my mind like a vid proaction energy transfers flowing field reservoir wait she closed her eyes and leaned her head back her feet tapped gently and rhythmically on the floor her smile came and went came and went her eyes popped open at last and he stared briefly and intently at vorthys the keyword she intoned is elastic recoil remember it she glanced at miles and held out a languid arm you may proceed my lord she giggled again he applied the hypospray over the blue vein inside her proffered elbow it hissed briefly he gave her an odd little halfbow and stepped back and waited her loose limbs tightened she buried her face in her hands after about a minute she looked up again blinking what did i just say she asked vorthys elastic recoil he repeated watching her intently what does it mean she was silent a moment staring at her feet it means i compromised myself for nothing her lips thinned bitterly soudhas device doesnt work or at any rate it doesnt work to collapse a wormhole she sat up and shook herself out stretching the sense of her body doubtless coming back to her as the last of the antagonist chased through her system i thought that stuff would make me sick reactions vary wildly from subject to subject said miles indeed hed never seen one quite like that before a woman we interrogated the other day said she found it very restful it had the strangest effect on my internal visualizations she stared at the hypospray with speculative respect i may try it on purpose someday i want to be there if you do miles had a sudden exciting vision of using the drug to augment his own insightsinstant brainsthen remembered to his extreme disappointment that fastpenta didnt work like that on him riva glanced at miles if i ever get out of a barrayaran prison am i under arrest now miles chewed his lip what for isnt violating loyalty and security oaths treason you havent violated any security oath yet as for the other when two imperial auditors say they didnt see something it can become remarkably invisible vorthys smiled suddenly i thought you were sworn to tell the truth lord auditor only to gregor what we tell the rest of the universe is negotiable we just dont advertise the fact that alas is true vorthys sighed how will you explain the missing drug doses to impsec one i am an imperial auditor i dont have to explain anything to anyone least of all impsec two we used it experimentally to enhance scientific insight which i gather is the truth so i return to go and collect my tokens her lips twisted up in a genuine if wryly baffled smile i see i think in short this never happened you are not under arrest and we have work to do for my curiosity though before i call our junior colleagues back incan you give me a quick synopsis of your chain of reasoning in nonmathematical terms please its only in nonmathematical terms so far if i cant run some real numbers in under thiswell ill just have to dismiss it as an interesting hallucination you were convinced enough to dry up on us i was stunned not so much convinced as breathless with hope with i dont quite know she shook her head i may yet be proved wrong and it wouldnt be the first time but you are familiar i assume with examples of positive feedback loops in resonant phenomenasound for example feedback squeals yes or a pure note that breaks a wineglass and in structures you know why soldiers must break step when marching across a bridge so that the resonance of their steps doesnt collapse he structure miles grinned i actually saw that happen once it involved a squad of imperial junior scouts a flag ceremony a wooden footbridge and my cousin ivan dumped twenty really obnoxious teenage boys into a creek he added aside to the professor they wouldnt let me march with my squad that evening because they said my height would mess up their symmetry so i was watching from the back benches it was glorious i think i was about thirteen but ill treasure the memory forever did you see it coming or did it take you by surprise asked the professor curiously i saw it coming though not i admit very far in advance hm rivas brows twitched she licked her lips and began wormholes resonate in fivespace very slightly and at a very high state i believe that the function of soudhas device is to emit a fivespace energy pulse precisely tuned to the natural frequency of a wormhole the pulses power is low compared to the latent energies involved in the wormholes structure but if properly tuned it mightno would gradually build up the amplitude of the wormholes resonance until it exceeded its phase boundaries and collapsed or rather i think soudhas group thought it must collapse what i think actually happened is more complex elastic recoil vorthys prodded hopefully in a sense what i think happened is that the pulse amplified the resonance energies until the phase boundaries recoiled and the energy was abruptly returned to threespace in the form of a directed gravitational wave good god said miles do you mean to say soudhas found way to turn an entire wormhole into a giant imploder lance mmmm said riva er maybe what i dont know is if that was what he meant to do the first theory made more political sense to me as a komarran it quite seduced me i wonder if they were seduced as well if he did mean the wormhole to act as a sort of imploder lance i dont see that hes found a way to aim it i think the gravitational pulse was returned back along the initial path i dont know if radovas committed suicide but im very much afraid he may have shot himself my word breathed vorthys and the ore ship if their test platform was indeed aboard the soletta array the involvement of the ore ship was sheer bad luck bad timing it blundered into the gravitational pulse and was ripped apart then was funneled toward and struck the soletta array and thoroughly confused the issue if the device was aboard the ore shipwell same result including the confusion said vorthys ruefully but but theres still something very wrong you have presumably calculated most of the energy vectors involved in the soletta accident over and over you trust the numbers you gave me yes and youve put limits on what energies the device can have transferred over various lengths of time there are some fairly strict and obvious engineering limits to its potential peak power output agreed vorthys what we dont know is how long they could run it well the fivespace physicist took a deep breath unless they were running it for weeks and radovas and trogir were seen downside much later than that i think youve got more energy out of the wormhole than went into it from where presumably from the wormholes deep structure somehow unless you want to posit that soudha has invented perpetual motion as well which is against my religion vorthys was looking wildly excited this is wonderful miles call yuell call demorie we must check those numbers when demorie returned with yuell all the tech folk were too entranced with the breakthrough regarding the novel device to broach any embarrassing questions about where the fastpenta had gone demorie would doubtless think to ask later miles would be bland and uninformative he decided riva clearly didnt want to waste time and mental energy on anger when there was physics to be had but if she decided to be pissed at him later he would grovel as needed for now miles sat back watched and listened feeling that he understood perhaps one sentence in three so did soudha now imagine that he possessed a wormhole collapseror a giant imploder lance he had stolen much of the technical data from the accident investigation he had a lot of the same numbers vorthys did and the same amount of time to look them over while simultaneously managing a complex evacuation of some dozen persons and several tons of equipment miles reminded himself soudha had been rather busy of course he hadnt had to waste time reconstructing the plans of his device from scattered specs but the gravitational backlash from the test wormhole near the soletta array must have surprised radovashowever brieflyand soudha the accident had stopped their research brought auditors down upon them compelled their flight it made no sense none to posit the destruction of the soletta as deliberate sabotage and suicide if one wanted to blow up barrayarans there were much more inviting targets around such as the military stations guarding each wormhole exit from komarr local space as an imploder lance variant the device wasnt going to make a very useful military weapon till they figured out how to aim it at someone besides themselves though if one could set it up in secret aboard a military station turn it on and flee before the blast occurred had soudha figured out what had happened yet he had data yes but his fivespace man was dead arozzi was only a junior engineer and cappell the math man did not show any special brilliance in his academic record vorthys had been able to tap the top fivespace expert on the planet not to mention yuell the wonderboy who miles noted was just at this moment arguing math with vorthys and winning given the data and enough time radovas might have made the same conceptual breakthrough as riva but soudha in his flight was not equipped to unless hed found a replacement for radovas miles made a note to tell impsec to check for the disappearance of any other komarran fivespace experts in the last weeks soudhas flight miles decided had to be following one of three logic branches either they had abandoned all and fled or theyd withdrawn to hide painfully rebuild their safe base and try again another day or they had moved up their timetable and elected to risk all on an early strike of some kind miles wondered if theyd put what should have been a technicallydriven decision to a vote they were komarrans after all and apparently volunteers amateur conspirators not that it was exactly a licensed trade option one didnt feel right given what miles had seen so far option two seemed more likely but gave impsec time enough to do their job the komarrans might have thought so too if youre going to worry worry about option three there was a lot to worry about in option three panicked and desperate people were capable of very strange moves indeed look at some of the incidents in his own career professor vorthys dr riva miles had to repeat himself more loudly before they looked up so you aim this device at a wormhole and switch it on and it starts pumping in energy at some point it builds up to a breakpoint and bounces back at you what happens if you turn it off before that point i am not certain said riva that that wasnt exactly what happened the backlash may have been triggered by either exceeding the phase boundaries or by radovas turning off the pulse source it is unclear if the phaseboundary deaugmentation is discontinous or not so once activated the device may become in effect its own deadman switch turning it off sets it off im not sure it would be a good point to test from a suitable distance well if you figure it out please let me know eh carry on after a moment to either digest his question or wait to see if hed pop out with any other interruption the conversation around the table returned to its original polyglot of english mathematics and engineering miles settled back feeling anything but reassured if soudha had perfected his device with an eye to using the wormholes as power sources to blow up the military stations that guarded them as a surprise opening for a shooting war the way to do it would be to blow up all six at once coordinated with a komarrwide uprising on the scale of the illfated komarr revolt miles was not totally pleased with impsecs performance in this case so far but soudhas had been a small group running close to the ground the signs of a massive revolt brewing must be too widespread for even impsec to miss besides the chief conspirators were all of an age to have been through that once anyone whod experienced the debacle of the komarr revolt on the komarr side had reason to mistrust their fellows almost as much as they mistrusted barrayarans the last people soudha would want in on his plot were a bunch more komarrans and they didnt have six devices theyd had five the fourth was destroyed and the three earlier ones seemed to have been smallerscale prototypes it was like having a gun with one bullet in it youd want to pick your target very carefully suppose soudha still imagined he possessed a wormholecollapser albeit one with a few bugs in the design there were six active wormholes in komarr local space but miles hadnt any doubt which one soudha would go for the sole jump to barrayar cut us off at one stroke yeah from a komarran viewpoint that was a plot worth all of these five years of devotion all the sweat and risk closing barrayars only gate to the galactic wormhole nexus a bloodless revolution by god sure to appeal to these tech types theyd return komarr to the good old days of its glory a century agoand barrayar to its bad old days in a new time of isolation whether everyone or indeed anyone on either komarr or barrayar wanted to go there or not did the conspirators imagine theyd be permitted to live once the truth was unraveled probably not but if riva spoke straight the process was not reversible the wormhole once collapsed could not be reopened the deed would be done and no tears or prayers would undo it like an assassination soudha and his friends might imagine themselves as a new and more effective generation of martyrs content to be enshrined after death they had seemed too practical but who knew one could be hypnotized by the hard choices in ways that had nothing to do with ones intelligence yes miles now knew where the komarrans were going if they werent there already the civilianor the military no the civilian transfer station which served the wormhole jump to barrayar you just sent ekaterin there shes there now so was the professora and so were several thousand other innocent people he reminded himself he fought panic to follow out his thread of thought to the end soudha might have a bolthole of some kind set up on the station prepared perhaps months or years in advance he would plan to set up his novel device aim it at the wormhole draw power fromwhere if from the station someone might notice if they mounted it aboard a ship and it had to have been on some kind of ship to get out there they could draw ships power but traffic control and the barrayaran military were unlikely to tolerate any ship hanging around the wormhole without a filed flight plan from which it had better not deviate ship or station he had insufficient data to decide but if soudha had not seriously modified his device the plot which began with a bloodless plan to collapse the wormhole could end in the bloody chaos of a major disaster to the transfer station miles had seen space disasters on various scales he didnt want to ever see another miles could imagine a dozen different scenarios from the data they had in hand but only this one gave him no time or room to be wrong go he reached for the secured comconsole and punched up impsec komarr hq at solstice this is lord auditor vorkosigan give me general rathjens immediately its an emergency vorthys looked up from the long table what ive just figured out that if theres any action coming up its got to be at the transfer station by the barrayar jump but milessurely soudha would not be so foolish as to try again after his initial disaster i dont trust soudha in any way have you heard from ekaterin or your wife yes ekaterin messaged when you were out getting your ah supplies shed reached her hostel safely and was off to meet the professora did she leave a number yes its on the comconsole general rathjenss face appeared above the vidplate my lord auditor general i have new data suggesting our escaped komarrans are at or are heading for the barrayar transfer station i want a maxpenetration impsec searchsweep for them on the station and aboard any inbound traffic to commence as quickly as possible i want impsec courier transport for myself out to there as fast as you can scramble it ill give you the details once im en route when all thats in motion i want to send a tightbeam personal message to um he did a quick search this number rathjenss brows rose but he said only yes my lord auditor ill be most interested in those details indeed you will thanks rathjenss face vanished in a few moments the tightbeam link blinked its goahead ekaterin miles spoke rapidly and with all his will into the vid pickup as if he might so speed the message take the professora and get yourselves aboard the first outbound transport you can find any local space destinationkomarr orbit one of the other stations anywhere well arrange to pick you both up later and get you home right and tight just get yourselves off the station and go at once he hesitated over his closing no this was not the time or place to declare i love you no matter what dangers he imagined threatening her by the time this message arrived she might well be back in her hostel room with the professora listening over her shoulder be careful vorkosigan out as miles rose to go vorthys said doubtfully do you think i should go with you no i think you all should stay here and figure out what the hell happens when somebody tries to turn that infernal device off and when you do please tightbeam me the instructions vorthys nodded miles gave the lot of them an impsec analysts salute which was a vague wave of the hand in the vicinity of ones forehead turned and strode for the door chapter nineteen ekaterin watched morosely as the sonic toilet ate her shoes with scarcely a burp it was worth a try dear said aunt vorthys glancing at her expression there are too many failsafe systems on this space station ekaterin said this worked for nikki on the jumpship coming out here what an uproar there was the ships steward was so upset with us my grandchildren could make short work of this ill bet agreed the professora its too bad we dont have a few nineyearolds with us yes sighed ekaterin and no that nikki was safely back on komarr right now was a source of liberating joy in some secret level of her mind but there ought to be some way to sabotage a sonic toilet that would light up a station techs board and bring an investigation how to turn a sonic toilet into a weapon was just not in ekaterins job training vorkosigan probably knew how she reflected bitterly just like a man to be underfoot in her life for days and then a quarter of a solar system away when she really needed him for the tenth time she felt the walls tried the door inventoried their clothes practically the only flammable item in the room was the womens hair setting a fire in a room in which one was locked did not much recommend itself to ekaterins mind though it was a possible last resort she stuck her hands in the wall slot and turned them letting the sonic cleaner loosen the dirt and the uv light bathe away the germs and the air fan presumably whisk their little corpses away she drew her hands out again the engineers might swear the system was more effective but it never made her feel as fresh is an oldfashioned water wash and how were you supposed to put a babys bottom in the thing she glowered at the sanitizer if we had any kind of a tool at all we ought to be able to do something with this i had my vorfemme knife said the professora sadly it was my best enameled one had it was in my bootsheath the boot i threw i believe oh you dont carry yours these days not on komarr i was trying to be i dont know modern her lips twisted i do wonder about the cultural message in the vorfemme knife i mean yes it made you better armed than the peasants but never as wellarmed as the twosword men were the vor lords afraid of their wives getting the drop on them remembering my grandmother its possible said the professora mm and my greataunt vorvayne ekaterin sighed and glanced worriedly at her present aunt the professora was leaning on the wall with one hand supporting her looking still very pale and shaky if you are done with the attempted sabotage i think i would like to sit down again yes of course it was a stupid idea anyway the professora sank gratefully onto the only seat in the tiny lavatory and ekaterin took her turn leaning on the wall i am so sorry i dragged you into this if you hadnt been with me one of us must get away if you see a chance ekaterin take it dont wait for me that would still leave soudha with a hostage i dont think thats the most important issue just now not if the komarrans were telling the truth about what that great ugly thing out there does ekaterin rubbed her toe over the smooth gray deck of the lav in a quieter voice she asked do you suppose our own side would sacrifice us if it came to a standoff for this yes said the professora or at any rate they certainly ought to do the professor and lord auditor vorkosigan and impsec know what the komarrans have built no not as of yesterday that is they knew soudha had built somethingi gather they had almost managed to reconstruct the plans then they will know said the professora firmly and a little less firmly eventually i hope they wont think we ought to sacrifice ourselves like in the tragedy of the maiden of the lake she was actually sacrificed by her brother as the tradition would have it said the professora i do wonder if it was quite so voluntary as he later claimed ekaterin reflected dryly on the old barrayaran legend as the tale went the town of vorkosigan surleau on the long lake had been besieged by the forces of hazelbright loyal vassals of the absent count a vor officer and his sister had held out till the last on the verge of the final assault the maiden of the lake had offered up her pale throat to her brothers sword rather than fall to the ravages of the enemy troops the very next morning the siege was unexpectedly lifted by the subterfuge of her betrothedone of their auditor vorkosigans distant ancestors come to think of it the latterly famous general count selig of that namewho sent the enemy hurriedly marching away to meet the false rumor of another attack but it was of course too late for the maiden of the lake much barrayaran historical sympathy in the form of plays and poems and songs had been expended upon the subsequent grief of the two men ekaterin had memorized one of the shorter poems for a school recitation in her childhood ive always wondered said ekaterin if the attack really had taken place the next day and all the pillage and rape had proceeded on schedule would they have said oh thats all right then probably said aunt vorthys her lips twitching after a time ekaterin remarked i want to go home but i dont want to go back to old barrayar no more do i dear its wonderful and dramatic to read about so nice to be able to read dont you know i know girls who pine for it they like to play dressup and pretend being vor ladies of old rescued from menace by romantic vor youths for some reason they never play dying in childbirth or vomiting your guts out from the red dysentery or weaving till you go blind and crippled from arthritis and dye poisoning or infanticide well they do die romantically of disease sometimes but somehow its always an illness that makes you interestingly pale and everyone sorry and doesnt involve losing bowel control ive taught history for thirty years one cant reach them all though we try send them to my class next time ekaterin smiled grimly id love to silence fell for a time while ekaterin stared at the opposite wall and her aunt leaned back with her eyes closed ekaterin watched her in growing worry she glanced at the door and said at last do you suppose you could pretend to be much sicker than you really are oh said aunt vorthys not opening her eyes that would not be at all difficult by which ekaterin deduced that she was already pretending to be much less sick than she really was the jumpnausea seemed to have hit her awfully hard this time was that grayfaced fatigue really all due to travelsickness stunner fire could be unexpectedly lethal for a weak heartwas there a reason besides bewilderment that her aunt had not tried to struggle or cry out under arozzis threats so how is your heart these days ekaterin asked diffidently aunt vorthyss eyes popped open after a moment she shrugged soso dear im on the waiting list for a new one i thought new organs were easy to grow now yes but surgical transplant teams are rather less so my case isnt that urgent after the problems a friend of mine had i decided id rather wait for one of the more proven groups to have a slot available i understand ekaterin hesitated ive been thinking we cant do anything locked in here if i can get anyone to come to the door i thought we might try to feign you were dangerously sick and get them to let us out after thatwho knows it cant be worse than this all youd have to do is go limp and moan convincingly im willing said aunt vorthys all right ekaterin fell to pounding on the door as loudly as she could and calling the komarrans urgently by name after about ten minutes of this the lock clicked the door slid back and madame radovas peeked in from a slight distance arozzi stood behind her with his stunner in his hand what she demanded my aunt is ill said ekaterin she cant stop shivering and her skin is getting clammy i think she may be going into shock from the jumpsickness and her bad heart and all this stress she has to have a warm place to lie down and a hot drink at least maybe a doctor we cant get you a doctor right now madame radovas peered worriedly past ekaterin at the limp professora we could arrange the other i guess some of us wouldnt mind having the lav back arozzi muttered its not so good all of us having to parade up and down the corridor to the nearest public one theres no other safe place to lock them up said madame radovas to him so put them out in the middle of the room and keep an eye on them stick them back in here later ones sick the other has to take care of her what can they do its no good if the old lady dies on us ill see what i can do said madame radovas to ekaterin and closed the door again in a little while she came back to escort the two barrayaran women to a cot and a folding chair set up at the edge of the loading bay as far as possible from any emergency alarm ekaterin and madame radovas supported the stumbling professora to the cot and helped her lie down and covered her up leaving arozzi to guard them madame radovas went off and returned with a steaming mug of tea and set it down arozzi then turned the stunner over to her and returned to his work madame radovas drew up another folding chair and sat down a few prudent meters away from her captives ekaterin supported her aunts shoulders while she drank the tea blinked gratefully and sank back with a moan ekaterin made play of feeling the professoras forehead and rubbing her chill hands and looking very concerned she stroked the tousled gray hair and stared covertly around the loading bay shed merely glimpsed before the device still sat in its float cradle but more power lines snaked across the floor to it now soudha was overseeing the attachment of one such cable to the awkward array of converters at the base of the horn a man she did not recognize busied himself in the glasswalled control booth at his gestures cappell drew careful chalk lines on the deck near the device when he finished he consulted with soudha and soudha himself took the float cradles remote control stepped back and with exquisite care set the cradle to lift move forward till it almost touched the outer wall and gently land again in precise alignment with the chalk marks the horn was now aimed not quite squareon with the inner door of the large freight lock were they getting ready to load it aboard a ship and take it out to point at the wormhole or could they use it right from here ekaterin drew her map cube from her pocket madame radovas sat up in alarm aiming the stunner saw what it was and settled back uneasily but did not move to take the map from her ekaterin checked the location of the southport transport docks and locks the company had leased three loading bays in a line and ekaterin was not sure just which she was now in the threedimensional vid projection did not supply any exterior orientation but she rather thought they were on the same side of the station as the wormhole which might well put this lock in lineofsight to it i dont think theres very much time left at all in addition to the ramp by which shed entered and the door to the lavatory there appeared to be two other airsealed exits from the bay one was clearly a personnel lock to the exterior next to the freight lock another went back into a section which might be offices if this was indeed the center bay of the three ekaterin mentally traced a route through it to the nearest public corridor several komarrans had come and gone through that door perhaps they were all camping back there in any case it seemed more heavily populated than the door shed come in but closer the control booth was a dead end ekaterin eyed her fellowwidow strange to think that their different domestic paths had brought them both to the same place in the end madame radovas looked tired and worn this has been a nightmare for everyone how do you imagine youre going to get away after this ekaterin asked her curiously will you take us along surely the komarrans would have to madame radovass lips thinned we hadnt planned to till you two came along im almost sorry it was simpler before collapse the wormhole and die now its all possibilities and distractions and worries again worries worse than expecting to die i left three children back on komarr if i were dead impsec would have no reason to bother them hostages all round indeed besides said madame radovas i voted for it i could do no less than my husband did you took a vote on what and how do you divide up komarranstyle voting shares in a revolt you had to have taken everyone alongif anyone who knew anything had been left to be questioned under fastpenta it would have been all up soudha foscol cappell and my husband were considered the primary shareholders they decided i had inherited my husbands voting stock the choices were simple enoughsurrender flee or fight to the last the count was three to one for this oh who voted against it she hesitated soudha how odd said ekaterin startled hes your chief engineer nowdoesnt that worry you soudha said madame radovas tartly has no children he wanted to wait and try again later as though there would be a later if we do not strike now impsec will shortly hold all our relatives hostage but if we close the wormhole and die there will be no one left for impsec to threaten with their harm my children will be safer even if i never see them again her eyes were bleak and sincere what about all the barrayarans on komarr and sergyar who will never see their families again cut off not ever knowing their fate mine for instance theyll be the same as dead to each other it will be the time of isolation all over again she shivered in horror at the cascading images of shock and grief so be glad youre on the good side of the wormhole madame radovas snapped at ekaterins cold stare she relented a little it wont be like your old time of isolation at all you have a fully developed planetary industrial base now and a much larger population which has experienced a hundredyearlong inflow of new genes there are plenty of other worlds which scarcely maintain any galactic contact and they get along just fine the professoras eyes slitted open i think you are underestimating the psychological impact what you barrayarans do to each other afterwards is not my responsibility said madame radovas as long as you can never do it to us again how do you expect to die asked ekaterin take poison together walk out an airlock and will you kill us first i expect you barrayarans will take care of those details when you figure out what happened said madame radovas foscol and cappell think we will escape afterwards or that we might be permitted to surrender i think it will be the solstice massacre all over again we even have our very own vorkosigan for it im not afraid she hesitated as if contemplating her own brave words or at any rate im too tired to care anymore ekaterin could understand that unwilling to murmur agreement with the komarran woman she fell silent staring unseeing across the loading bay dispassionately she considered her own fear her heart beat yes and her stomach knotted and her breath came a bit too fast yet these people did not frighten her deep down nearly as much as she thought they ought to once upon a time shortly after one of tiens unfathomable uncomfortable jealous jags had subsided back to whatever fantasy world it came from hed earnestly assured her that he had thrown his nerve disrupter illegally owned because he did not carry it in issuance from their district liege lord from a bridge one night and got rid of it she hadnt even known hed possessed it these komarrans were desperate and dangerous in their desperation but she had slept beside things that scared her more than soudha and all his friends how strange i feel there was a tale in barrayaran folklore about a mutant who could not be killed because he hid his heart in a box on a secret island far from his fortress naturally the young vor hero talked the secret out of the mutants captive maiden stole the heart and the poor mutant came to the usual bad end maybe her fear failed to paralyze her because nikki was her heart and safe away far from here or maybe it was because for the first time in her life she owned herself whole a few meters away across the loading bay soudha crossed again to the novel device aimed the remote at the float cradle and adjusted its position fractionally cappell called some question from the other side of the bay and soudha set the remote down on the edge of the cradle and paced along one of the power cables examining it closely till he reached the wall slot cappell was fussing over they bent their heads together over some loose connection or other cappell yelled a question to the man in the glass booth who shook his head and went out to join them if i think about this the chance will be gone if i think about this even my mutants heart will fail me had she the right to take this much risk upon herself that was the real fear yes and it shook her to her core this wasnt a task for her this was a task for impsec the police the army a vor hero anyone but her who are not here but oh if she tried and failed she failed for all barrayar for all time and who would take care of nikki if he lost both parents in the space of barely a week the safe thing to do was to wait for competent grownup male people to rescue her like tien yeah are you getting any warmer now aunt vorthys ekaterin asked have you stopped shivering she rose and bent over her aunt with her back to madame radovas and pretended to tuck the blanket tighter while actually loosening it madame radovas was shorter than ekaterin and slighter and twentyfive years older now ekaterin mouthed to the professora moving smoothly but not suddenly she turned paced toward madame radovas and flung the blanket over the womans head as she jumped to her feet the chair banged over backward another two paces and she was able to wrap her arms around the smaller woman pinning her arms to her side the stunners beam splashed buzzing on the deck at their feet and the nimbus made ekaterins legs tingle she lifted madame radovas off her feet and shook her the stunner clattered to the deck and ekaterin kicked it toward her aunt who was fighting to get upright on her cot ekaterin flung the blanketmuffled komarran woman away from her as hard as she could turned and sprinted for the float cradle she snatched up the remote control and spun away toward the glass control booth as fast as her legs could push her her sweating bare feet firm against the smooth surface the men at the wall outlet shouted and started toward her she didnt look back she galloped around the corner and up the two stairs to the booth in one leap she batted frantically at the door control pad the door took forever to slide shut cappell was almost to the steps before she was able after two tries with her shaking fingers to activate the lock cappell hit the door with a resounding thud and began pounding on it she did not dared not look back to see what was happening to the professora instead she raised the remote and pointed it through the glass at the float cradle the controls included six buttons and a fourpronged knob shed never been good at this sort of coordination fortunately subtlety was not her object now the third stab of her fingers on a button found the up vector all too slowly the float cradle began to rise off the loading bay deck perhaps there were some sort of sensors in it which kept it level the first four combinations she tried seemed to do nothing finally she was able to make the thing begin to rotate it bumped into the catwalks above making nasty grinding noises good power cables snapped off and whipped around the strange man barely dodged the spitting sparks soudha was screaming trying to jump up at the glass wall in front of her she could barely hear him the glass after all was supposed to stand up to vacuum he scrambled back and aimed a stunner at her the beam splashed harmlessly off the window at last she was able to make the sensor program appear in the remotes little readout she canceled its running instructions and then the cradle became more lively shed achieved an almost degree rotation bottom to top then she turned the cradles power off it was only about a fourmeter drop from the catwalks to the deck she had no idea what material the huge horn was fabricated from she anticipated having to try a couple of times to achieve some dent or crack soudha could not repair in the day it would take for her and her aunt to be missed at the ferry instead the bell burst likelike a flower pot the boom shook the bay shards big and small skittered off across the deck like shrapnel one jagged piece whanged past centimeters from soudhas head and smacked into the booths glass and ekaterin ducked involuntarily but the glass held amazing material she was glad the devices horn hadnt been cast of it laughter bubbled out of her throat bravura berserker joy she wanted to destroy a hundred devices she turned on the float cradles power again and bounced the smashed remains on the deck a few more times just because she could the maiden of the lake fires back the professora was sitting on the deck by the far wall bent over not running away not even close to making an escape not good madame radovas was on her feet and had recovered her stunner cappell the mathematician was beating on the control booths door with a meterlong hightorque wrench hed found somewhere arozzi his face running with blood from a flying piece of hornshrapnel dissuaded him before he rendered it unopenable soudha came running up with a handful of electronic tools and he and arozzi disappeared below the doors window scratchy sounds penetrated by the door lock more sinister even than cappells frantic blows ekaterin caught her breath and looked around the control booth she couldnt empty the air from the loading bay her aunt was out there too there there was the comconsole should she have gone for it first no she was doing this in he right order no matter how screwed up impsecs response vas no matter how misapplied or incompetent their tactics hey could not possibly lose barrayar now hello emergency ekaterin panted as the vidplate activated my name is ekaterin vorsoisson she had to stop as the automated system tried to route her to her choice of travelers aids she rejected lost amp found selected security and started over not certain shed reached a human yet and praying it would all be recorded my name is ekaterin vorsoisson lord auditor vorthys is my uncle im being held prisoner along with my aunt by komarran terrorists at the southport transport docks and locks im in a loading bay control booth right now but theyre getting the door open she glanced over her shoulder soudha had defeated the lock the airseal door bent from cappells efforts with the wrench whined and refused to retreat into its slot soudha and arozzi put their shoulders to it grunting and it inched open tell lord auditor vorkosigantell impsec then the swearing soudha slipped sideways through the door followed by cappell still clutching his wrench laughing hysterically tears running down her cheeks ekaterin turned to face her fate chapter twenty miles barely restrained himself from pressing his face to his courier ships airlock window while waiting for the tube seals from the jump station to finish seating themselves when the door hissed open at last he swung himself through in one motion to land on his feet with a thump and glare around the hatch corridor his reception committee at the private lock the ranking impsec man aboard and a fellow in blueandorange civilian security garb both braced to attention after only the briefest beat of surprise at his heighthe could tell by the way their eyes had to track downward to meet his faceand appearance lord auditor vorkosigan the strainedlooking impsec man vorgier acknowledged miles this is groupcommander husavi who heads station security captain vorgier commander husavi are there any new developments in the situation in the last he glanced at his chrono fifteen minutes almost a full three hours had passed since the first message from vorgier had turned his journey from komarr orbit into this viscous nightmare of suppressed panic never had an impsec courier ship seemed to move so slowly and since no amount of auditorial screaming at the crew could change the laws of physics miles had perforce seethed in silence my men backed by those of commander husavi are almost into position for our assault vorgier assured him we believe we can get an emergency tube seal into place over the outer door of the airlock containing the vor women before or almost before the komarrans can evacuate the air the moment the hostages are retrieved our armored men can enter the southport bay at will it will be over in minutes too bloody likely snapped miles several engineers have had several hours to prepare for you these komarrans may be desperate but i guarantee they are not stupid if i can think of putting a pressuresensitive explosive in the airlock so can they what a set of mental images vorgiers words conjureda tube seal misapplied or applied too late to the outer skin of the station ekaterins and the professoras bodies blown outward into spacesome spacearmored impsec goon missing his catchmiles could almost hear his embarrassed bass oops over the audio link now in his minds ear such a blessing that vorgier hadnt confided these details earlier when miles would have had all those hours en route to reflect upon them stuck aboard his courier ship the vor ladies are not expendable madame dr vorthys has a weak heart her husband lord auditor vorthys tells me and madame vorsoisson isjust not expendable and the komarrans are the least expendable of all we want them alive for questioning sorry captain but i mislike your plan vorgier stiffened my lord auditor i appreciate your concern but i believe this will be most quickly and effectively concluded as a military operation civilian authority can help best by staying out of the way and letting the professionals do their job the impsec deck had dealt him two men in a row of exceptional competence tuomonen and gibbs why oh why couldnt good things come in threes they were supposed to dammit this is my operation captain and i will answer personally to the emperor for every detail of it i spent the last ten years as an impsec galactic agent and ive dealt with more damned situations than anyone else on simon illyans roster and i know just exactly how fuckedup a professional operation can get he tapped his chest so climb down off your vor horse and brief me properly vorgier looked considerably taken aback husavi tamped out a smile which told miles all too much about how things had been going here to vorgiers credit he recovered almost instantly and said come this way my lord auditor to the operations center ill show you the details and you can judge for yourself better they started off down the corridor almost quickly enough for miless taste has there been any change or increase in powerdraw into the southport transport area not yet husavi answered as you ordered my engineers shut down their lines to just that necessary to run their life support i dont know how much power the komarrans are able to tap from the local system freighter they have docked there soudha has said if we try to capture or remove the ship theyll open the airlock on the vor ladies so weve waited our remote sensors dont indicate any unusual readings from there yet good baffling but good miles could not imagine why the komarrans hadnt switched on their wormholecollapsing device yet in a lastditch effort to accomplish their longsought goal had soudha figured out its inherent defect corrected it or tried to was it not quite ready yet and the komarrans even now frantically preparing it in any case once it was powered up they were all in deepdeep because the professor and riva had concluded with some pretty unreassuring handwaving something like a fifty percent probability of an immediate gravitational backblow from the wormhole the moment it was switched off ripping the station apart when miles had inquired what the technical difference was between a fiftyfifty chance and we dont know he hadnt got a straight answer from them further theoretical refinements had come to an abrupt halt when the news had come through about the standoff here the professor was on his way now to the jump point just a few hours behind miles they turned a corner and entered a lifttube miles asked whats the current status of the station evacuation husavi replied weve waved off all incoming ships that could be diverted a couple had to dock in order to refuel or they couldnt have made it to an alternate station he waited till theyd exited into another corridor before continuing weve managed to remove most of the transient passengers and about five hundred of our nonessential personnel so far what story are you giving them were telling them its a bomb scare excellent and effectively true most are cooperating some arent hm but theres a serious problem with transportation there are simply not enough ships in range to remove everyone in less than ten hours if the powerdraw to the southport bay spikes suddenly youll have to start shuttling people over to the military station though miles was by no means sure the gravitational event if it occurred wouldnt suck in and damage or destroy the military station as well theyll have to help out captain vorgier and i discussed this possibility with the military commander my lord he wasnt happy with the prospect of a sudden influx of um randomly selected uncleared persons onto his station miles bet not ill speak with him he sighed vorgiers operations center turned out to be the local impsec offices the central communications chamber did indeed bear a passing resemblance to a warships tactics room miles had to allow vorgier called up a holovid display of the southport docks and locks area one with rather better technical detail than the one miles had spent the last hour studying he ran over the expected placement of his men and the projected timing and technique of his assault it wasnt a bad plan as assaults went in his youth out on covert ops miles had come up with things just as bravura and idiotic on equally short notice all right more idiotic he admitted ruefully himself someday miles his boss impsec chief simon illyan had once said to him i hope you live to have a dozen subordinates just like you miles hadnt realized till now that had been a formal curse on illyans part vorgiers sales pitch kept fading out in miless mind displaced by an instantreplay of the recording of the last message from ekaterin which vorgier had thoughtfully supplied miles by tightbeam hed memorized every nuance of it in the last three hours im in a loading bay control booththeyre forcing the door open she hadnt said anything about the novel device unless some report had been going to follow the tell lord vorkosigantell impsecpart which had been rudely interrupted by the redfaced soudhas paw abruptly descending on the comconsole control nothing could be seen in the fuzzy background however computerenhanced but the bay control booth and the mathematician cappell gripping wrench he looked ready to use for something other than tightening bolts but evidently hadnt impsec had received vids in the loading bay airlocks safety channel of both women being bundled alive into it before soudha had cut off the signal off those brief images too burned in miless brain all right captain vorgier miles interrupted hold your plan as a possible last resort to be implemented under what circumstances my lord auditor over my dead body miles did not reply vorgier might not understand it wasnt a joke before we start blowing walls in i want to try to negotiate with soudha and his friends these are komarran terrorists madmenyou cant negotiate with them the late baron ryoval had been a madman the late ser galen had been a madman without question and the late general metzov hadnt exactly been rowing with both oars in the water either come to think of it miles had to admit there had been a definite negative trend to all those negotiations im not without experience in the problem vorgier but i dont think dr soudha is a madman hes not even a mad scientist hes merely a very upset engineer these komarrans may in fact be the most sensible revolutionaries ive ever met he stood a moment staring unseeing at vorgiers colorful ominous tactical display the logistics of the station evacuation warring in his head with guesses about the komarrans state of mind delusion political passion personality judgment visions of ekaterins terror and despair spun in his backbrain if so spacious a containment as a komarran dome gave her claustrophobia stop it he pictured a thick sheet of glass sliding down between him and that personal maelstrom of anxiety if his authority here was absolute so was his obligation to keep his thinking clear every hour buys lives well play for time get me a channel to the military stations commander miles ordered after that well see whether soudha will answer his comconsole the deliberately blank chamber in which miles sat might as easily have been on the nearby military station or a ship lying several thousand kilometers offstation as the few hundred meters from the southport bay it actually was soudhas location when his face formed at last over the vidplate was not so anonymous he sat in the same glasswalled control booth from which ekaterin had sent her alarm miles wondered what techs were monitoring the corridors for moves on impsecs part and who was keeping a nervous finger on the personnel airlocks outer door control had they arranged it as a deadmans switch soudhas face was drawn and sincerely weary no more the bland bluff liar lena foscol sat tensely to the right of his station chair on a rolling stool looking like some frumpy vizier madame radovas too looked on her face halfshadowed behind him and cappell stood off to the side almost out of focus good a komarran stockholders voting quorum if he read the signs right at least they honored his imperial auditors authority to that extent good evening dr soudha miles began youre out here soudhas brows rose as he took in the lack of transmission lag yes well unlike administrator vorsoisson i got out of my chains at the experiment station alive i still dont know if you intended me to survive he didnt really die did he foscol interrupted oh yes miles made his voice deliberately soft i got to watch just as you arranged every filthy minute of it it was a remarkably ugly death she fell silent soudha said this is all beside the point now the only message we want to receive from you people is that you have the jumpship ready to transport us to the nearest neutral spacepol or escobarwhereupon you will get your vor ladies back if its not that im cutting this com i have a few pieces of free information for you first said miles i dont think theyre ones you anticipate soudhas hand hovered go on im afraid your wormholecollapser no longer qualifies as a secret weapon we caught up with your specs on file at bollan design professor vorthys invited dr riva of solstice university in to consult are you aware of her reputation soudha nodded warily cappells eyes widened madame radovas stared wearily foscol looked deeply suspicious well putting together your specs the data from the soletta accident and rivas physicsthere was a mathematician by the name of dr yuell in there too if the name means anything to youthe empires top failure analyst and the empires top fivespace expert have concluded that you did not in fact manage to invent a wormholecollapser what you managed to invent was a wormholeboomerang riva says that when the fivespace waves amplified the wormholes resonance past its phase boundaries instead of collapsing the wormhole returned the energy to threespace in the form of a gravitational pulse tangling with this pulse was what destroyed the soletta array and the ore ship andim sorry madame radovaskilled dr radovas and marie trogir the probablecause crew finally found her body a few hours ago i regret to report wrapped up in some of the wreckage theyd retrieved almost a week back only a puff of breath from cappell marked his grief but water glittered in his eyes check thought miles i thought hed protested too much nobody looked surprised merely oppressed so if you succeed in getting your thing working what you will actually do is destroy this station the five thousand or so people aboard and yourselves and tomorrow morning barrayar will still be there miles let his voice fall to a near whisper all for nothing and less than nothing he lies said foscol fiercely into the shocked silence he lies soudha gave a weird snort ran his hands through his hair and shook his head then to miless dismay he laughed out loud cappell stared at his colleague do you really think thats why that it malfunctioned like that it would explain began soudha it would explain oh god he trailed off i thought it was the ore ship he said at last interfering somehow i should also mention miles put in still uneasily watching soudhas odd reaction that impsec has arrested all the waste heat personnel and their families you left back at the southport transport facility at solstice and then there are all your other relatives and friends the innocents who knew nothing the hostage game is a bad game a sad and ugly game thats a lot easier to start than end the worst versions ive seen ended up with neither side in control or getting anything they wanted and the people who stand to lose the most in it frequently arent even playing barrayaran threats foscol lifted her chin do you think after all this we cant stand up to you im sure you can but for what reason there arent too many prizes left in this mess the biggest one is gone you cant shut off barrayar you cant keep your secret or shield anyone you left behind on komarr about the only thing you can do now is kill more innocent people great goals can call for great sacrifices yes but your possible rewards are steadily shrinking yes that was it dont raise the pressure lower the wall we did not husked cappell rubbing his eyes with the back of his hand go through all this just to deliver the weapon of the century straight into barrayaran hands its already there as a weapon it appears to have some fundamental defects so far but riva says theres evidence you got more power out of the wormhole than you put into it this suggests possible future peaceful economic uses when the phenomena are better understood really said soudha sitting up how did she figure what are her numbers soudha said foscol reprovingly madame radovas winced and soudha subsided albeit reluctantly staring at miles through narrowed eyes on the other hand miles continued until further research assures us that collapsing a wormhole is indeed quite impossible none of you are going anywhere and especially not to any other planetary government its one of those ugly military decisions yknow and im afraid its mine the vor ladies are not expendable hed told vorgier was he lying then or now well if he couldnt figure it out maybe the komarrans couldnt either you are all headed inexorably for a barrayaran prison he went on the devils bargain part about being vor which lot of people including some vor overlook is that our lives are made for sacrifice there is no threat no torture no slow murder you can apply to two barrayaran women that will change your outcome was this the right tack above the vidplate their listening images were undersized a little ghostly hard to read miles wished he were having this conversation facetoface half the subliminal clues of body language of the subtle nuances of expression and voice were washed out in transmission and unavailable to his instincts but handing himself over to them person to augment their hostage collection could only have served to stiffen their wavering resolve the memory of a womans hand slipping through his fingers into a screaming fog flickered through his mind his fists clenched helplessly in his lap never again you said not expendable you said he watched the komarrans faces intently for all flickers of expression he could get reflections of truth lies belief suspicion trust there are advantages to prisons he went on persuasively some of them are comfortably furnished and unlike graves sometimes eventually you can get out of them again now i am willing in exchange for your peaceful surrender and cooperation to personally guarantee your lives not note your freedomthat will have to wait but time passes old crises are succeeded by new ones people change their minds live ones do anyway there are always those amnesties in celebration of this or that public eventthe birth of an imperial heir for instance i doubt any of you will be forced to spend as much as a full decade in prison some offer said foscol bitterly miles let his brows rise its an honest one you have a better hope of amnesty than tien vorsoisson does that ore freighter pilot will enjoy no visits from her children i reviewed her autopsy did i mention all the autopsies if i have a moral claim its that im bargaining away the rights of the dead solettakeepers families to any justice for their slain there ought to be civil trials for manslaughter over this even foscol looked away at these words good go on the more time he burned the better and they were tracking his arguments as long as he could keep soudha from cutting the com he was making some twisty sort of progress you bitch endlessly about barrayaran tyranny but somehow i dont think you folks took a vote of all komarran planetary shareholders before you attempted to sealor steal their future and if you could have i dont think you would have dared twenty years ago even fifteen years ago maybe you could have counted on majority support by ten years ago it was already too late would your fellows really want to close off their nearest market now and lose all that trade lose all their relatives whove moved to barrayar and their halfbarrayaran grandchildren your trade fleets have found their barrayaran military escorts bloody useful often enough who are the true tyrants herethe blundering barrayarans who seek however awkwardly to include komarr in their future or the komarran intellectual elitists who seek to exclude all but themselves from it he took a deep breath to control the unexpected anger which had boiled up with his words aware he was teetering on the edge with these people watch it watch it so all that remains for us is to try and salvage as many lives as possible from the wreckage after a little time madame radovas asked how would you guarantee our lives they were the first words she had spoken though she had listened intently throughout by my order as an imperial auditor only emperor gregor himself could gainsay it so why wont emperor gregor gainsay it asked cappell skeptically hes not going to be happy about any of this miles answered frankly and im going to have to give him the report god help me but if i lay my word on the line i dont think hell deny me he hesitated or else i will have to resign foscol snorted how nice for us to know that after we are dead you will resign what a consolation soudha rubbed his lips watching miles watching his truncated image miles reminded himself he was not the only one missing body cues the engineer was silent thinking what your word cappell grimaced do you know what a vorkosigans word means to us yes said miles levelly do you know what it means to me madame radovas tilted her head and her quiet stare became if possible more focused miles leaned forward into the vid pickup my word is all that stands between you and impsecs aspiring heroes coming through your walls they dont need the corridors you know my word went down on my auditors oath which holds me at this moment unblinking to a duty i find more terrific than you can know i only have one names oath it cannot be true to gregor if it is false to you but if theres one thing my fathers heartbreaking experience at solstice taught its that id better not put my word down on events i do not control if you surrender quietly i can control what happens if impsec has to detain you by force it will be up to chance chaos and the reflexes of some overexcited young men with guns and gallant visions of thwarting mad komarran terrorists we are not terrorists said foscol hotly no youve succeeded in terrifying me miles said bleakly her lips thinned but soudha looked less certain if you unleash impsec the consequences will be your doing said cappell almost correct miles agreed if i unleash impsec the consequences will be my responsibility its that devils distinction between being in charge and being in control im in charge youre in control you can imagine how much this thrills me soudha snorted one corner of miless mouth tilted up in unwilling response yeah soudha knows all about that one too foscol leaned forward this is all a smoke screen captain vorgier said they were sending for a jumpship wheres it vorgier was lying for time which was his clear duty there will not be a jumpship shit that did it there were only two ways this could go now there were only two ways it could go before we have a pair of hostages do we have to space one of them to prove were serious i believe you are deathly serious which one gets to watch the aunt or the niece miles asked softly settling back again you claim to not be mad terrorists and i believe you youre not yet you are also not murderers i actually accept that all the deaths youve left in your wake were accidents so far but i also know that line gets easier to slip over with practice please observe that you have now gone as far as you can without turning yourselves into a perfect replica of the enemy you set out to oppose he let those last words hang in the air for a time for emphasis vorkosigans right i think said soudha unexpectedly weve come to the end of our choices or to the beginning of another set one that isnt the set i signed up for we have to stick together or its no good said foscol urgently if we have to space one of them i vote for that hellcat vorsoisson would you do it with your own hands said soudha slowly because i think i decline even after what she did to us what in gods name did gentle ekaterin do to you miles kept his expression as blank as he could his body still soudha hesitated seems it made no difference after all cappell and madame radovas both began to speak at once but soudha held up a restraining hand he blew out his breath like a man in pain no let us continue as we began the choice is plain stop nowunconditional surrenderor call vorkosigans bluff now its no secret to you i thought the time to go into hiding for a later try was before we ever left komarr im sorry i voted against you the last time cappell said to soudha soudha shrugged yeah well if were going to quit the times come no it hasnt miles thought frantically this was too abrupt there was time for another ten hours of chit chat at the very least he wanted to slide them to surrender not stampede them to suicide or murder if they believed him about the defects of their device as they appeared to it must soon occur to them that they could hold the whole station hostage if they didnt mind the selfimmolating aspect well if they werent going to think of that themselves far be it from him to point it out he leaned back in his station chair and chewed on the side of his finger and watched and listened theres no benefit in waiting either way soudha went on the risk increases every minute lena no surrender said foscol sturdily we go on and more bleakly somehow cappell the mathematician hesitated a long time i cant stand that marie died for nothing hold out myself soudha let his big square hand fall open stop now that weve lost surprise this goes nowhere the only question is how long it takes to arrive he turned to madame radovas oh my turn already i didnt want to go last yours would be the tiebreaking vote in any case said soudha madame radovas fell silent staring out the control booths glassat the airlock door across the bay miless gaze could but help following hers her turn back caught him at it and he flinched youve done it now boy ekaterins life and your souls oath hang on a frigging komarran shareholders debate how did you let this happen this wasnt in the plans his eye relocated and ignored the code on his comconsole that would launch vorgier and his waiting troops madame radovass gaze returned to window she said to no one in particular our safety before always depended on secrecy now even if we get to pol or escobar or further impsec will follow us there would not ever be a safe time give up our hostages in exile or not it will be prisons always prisoners im tired of being a prisoner of hope of fear you were not a prisoner said foscol you were one of us i thought madame radovas looked across at her i supported my husband if i hadnthe would still be alive lena im tired foscol said tentatively maybe you should rest before deciding the look she got from madame radovas in return for that line made her drop her eyes and look away madame radovas said to soudha do you believe him about the device not working soudha frowned deeply yes im afraid so or i would have acted differently poor barto she stared at miles for a long time in an almost detached wonder encouraged by her apparent dispassion he asked curiously why is your vote the tiebreaker the scheme was my husbands idea originally this obsession has dominated my life for seven years his voting share is always considered the greatest how very komarran then soudha had actually been the secondincommand forced into the dead mans shoes was all amazingly irrelevant now maybe theyll name it after him the radovas effect belike we are both heirs of a sort then indeed the widows lips twisted you know i will never forget the look on your face when that fool vorsoisson told you there was no place on his forms for an imperial order i almost laughed out loud despite it all miles smiled briefly scarcely daring to breathe madame radovas shook her head in disbelief but not he thought of his promises well lord vorkosigan ill take your word and find out what its worth she searched the faces of each of her three colleagues but when she spoke she looked at him i vote to stop now miles waited tensely for signs of dissension protest internal revolt cappell struck his fist on the booths glass wall which reverberated and turned away his features working foscol buried her face in her hands after that silence thats it then said soudha bleakly exhausted miles wondered if the news of the devices inherent defect had sapped his will more than any argument we surrender on your word for our lives lord auditor vorkosigan he squeezed his eyes shut and opened them again now what a lot of sensible slow moves first i gently detach impsec from its vision of a heroic assault they were getting pretty worked up out here then you inform the rest of your group then disarm whatever boobytraps youve set and pile any weapons you may possess well away from yourselves unlock the doors then sit down quietly on the loading bay floor with your hands behind your heads at that point ill let the boys in he added prudently please avoid sudden movements that sort of thing so be it soudha cut his comm the komarrans winked out miles shuddered in sudden disorientation alone again in his little sealed room the screaming man behind the glass wall in his mind was getting out a battering ram it felt like miles opened the channel on his comconsole and ordered a medical squad to accompany the arresting officers from impsec and station security who were to be armed with stunners and stunners only he repeated that last command a couple of times to be sure he felt as if hed spent a century in his station chair when he tried to stand up he nearly fell over then he ran miless only compromise with vorgiers anxiety for the imperial auditors personal safety was to march down the ramp into the southport loading bay behind instead of in front of the security team the ten or so komarrans sitting crosslegged on the floor twisted around to watch as the barrayarans entered after miles came the tech squad which spread out looking for boobytraps and behind them the medical team with a float pallet the first thing which caught miless eye after the live target inventory was the upsidedown float cradle in the middle of the bay atop a pile of tangled wreckage he was able barely to recognize it from the diagrams hed seen back on komarr of the fifth novel device his heart lifted at this inexplicable welcome sight he walked around it staring and came up to where soudha was being frisked down and restrained my goodness your wormholecollapser appears to have met with an accident but it wont do you any good we have the plans cappell and a man miles recognized as the engineer whod fled from bollan design stood nearby glowering at him foscol struggled into earshot barely controlled by her female arresting officer it wasnt us sighed soudha it was her a jerk of his thumb drew miless attention to the inner door of the bays personnel airlock a metal bar was placed crookedly across the airseal doors jamb the ends were melted onto floor and wall respectively miless eyes widened and his lips parted in breathless anticipation her the bitch from hell or barrayar which is almost the same thing to hear her tell it madame vorsoisson remarkable the source of several oddly tilted responses on the komarrans part to his recent negotiations began at last to come clear to miles um how all three komarrans tried to answer him at once with a medley of blamecasting which included a lot of phrases like if madame radovas hadnt let her out if you hadnt let radovas let her out how was i supposed to know the old lady looked sick to me still does if you hadnt put the remote down right front of her if you hadnt left the damned control booth if you had just moved faster if you had run for the float cradle and cut the power so why didnt you think of that huh by which miles slowly pieced together the most glorious mental picture hed had all day all year for quite a long time actually im in love im in love i just thought i was in love before now i really am i must i must i must have this woman mine mine mine lady ekaterin nile vorvayne vorsoisson vorkosigan yes shed left nothing here for impsec and all the emperors auditors to do but sweep up the bits he wanted to roll on the floor and howl with joy which would be most undiplomatic of him under the circumstances he kept his face neutral and very straight somehow he didnt think the komarrans appreciated the exquisite delight of it all when we stuffed her in the airlock i welded it shut said soudha morosely i wasnt going to let her do us a third time third time miles said if that was the second what was the first when that idiot arozzi first brought her down here she damn near blew the whole thing right then by hitting the emergency alarm miles glanced aside at the alarm on the nearby wall and then what happened we had a sudden influx of station accident control i thought id never get rid of them ah i see how curious vorgier never mentioned that part later you mean weve spent the last five hours scrambling to evacuate this station for nothing soudha smiled sourly you coming to me for sympathy barrayaran heh never mind most of the prisoners were formed up and marched out with a gesture miles ordered soudha to be held behind moment of truth soudha have you boobytrapped this thing there is a motionsensitive charge attached to the outer door opening it from this side should not set it off with iron selfcontrol miles watched as an impsec tech torched off the metal bar it fell to the deck with a clang he paused in one last moment of sick fear what are you waiting for asked soudha curiously just pondering the depth of your political ingenuity suppose this is set to go off and snatch our prize from us at the last now why its over said soudha revenge manipulation maybe you figure to drive me berserk and trigger a repeat of the solstice massacre all over again writ somewhat smaller that could be a propaganda coup whether it would be worth spending your lives for is all in your point of view of course properly massaged the incident could help start a new komarr revolt i suppose you have a really twisted mind lord vorkosigan said soudha shaking his head was it your upbringing or your genetics yes miles sighed after a brief moment of reflection miles waved the guards on and soudha was marched out after his colleagues after a goahead nod from the imperial auditor the tech tapped the control pad the inner door whined sticking halfway miles pressed it gently sideways with his boot and it shuddered open ekaterin was on her feet between the inner door and the professora who sat on the deck wearing her nieces vest over her own bolero ekaterins face bore a red bruise her hair was hanging every which way her fists were clenched and she looked perfectly demented and altogether gorgeous in miless personal opinion smiling broadly he held out both his hands and leaned inside she glared back at him about time she stalked past muttering in a voice of loathing men after the briefest lurch miles managed to convert his open arms into a smooth bow toward the professora madame dr vorthys are you all right why hello miles she blinked at him gray faced and very chilledlooking ive been better but i believe ill survive i have a float pallet for you these sturdy young men will help you to it oh thank you dear miles stood back and waved the medtechs forward the professora looked perfectly content to be whisked aboard the medical pallet and covered with warm wraps a cursory examination and a few words of debate resulted in a halfdose of synergine for her but no iv then the pallet rose into the air the professor will be here shortly miles assured her in fact hell likely be along before you both are done at the station infirmary ill see he gets sent straight on to you im so pleased the professora motioned him nearer when he bent over her she grabbed him by the ear and planted a kiss on his cheek ekaterin was wonderful she whispered i know he breathed his eyes crinkled and she smiled back he stepped back from the pallet to ekaterins side hoping her aunts example might inspire herhe wouldnt mind salvaging some little show of appreciationyou didnt seem surprised to see me he murmured the pallet started off under the guidance of a medtech and he and ekaterin followed in procession the impsec technicians politely waited till theyd cleared the chamber to plunge in to the airlock to disarm the charge ekaterin shoved a strand of hair back over one ear with a hand that trembled only slightly red bruises glared on her arms too as her sleeve slid back miles frowned at them i knew it had to be our side she said simply or else it would have been the other door eh quite three hours shed had to contemplate that possibility my fast courier was slow they turned up the next corridor in reflective silence gratifying as it might have been to have her fling herself into his arms and weep relief intowell if not his shoulder at least the top of his headin front of that herd of impsec fellows he had to admit he admired this style even more so what is this thing you have about tall women and unrequited love his cousin ivan would doubtless have some cutting things to sayhe growled in anticipation in his mind he would deal with ivan and other hazards to his courtship later do you know you saved about five thousand lives he asked her her dark brows drew down what the novel device was defective if the komarrans had managed to get it started the gravitational backblow from the wormhole would have taken out this station just like the soletta array possibly with as few survivors and i shudder at the thought of the property damage bill to think how illyan used to complain about my equipment losses back when i was just covert ops you mean it didnt work after all i did all that for nothing she stopped short her shoulders sagging what do you mean nothing ive met imperial generals who completed their entire careers with less to show for them you should get a bloody medal i think except that this whole thing is going to end up so classified theyre going to have to invent a whole new level of classification just to put it in and then classify the classification her lips puffed not quite mirthfully what would i do with so useless an object as a medal he thought bemusedly of the contents of a certain drawer at home in vorkosigan house frame it use it as a paperweight dust it just what i always wanted more clutter he grinned at her she smiled back at last clearly beginning to come off her adrenaline jag and without breaking down either she drew breath and started forward again and he kept pace she had met the enemy mastered her moment hung three hours on deaths doorstep all that and shed emerged still on her feet and snarling oversocialized hah oh yeah da i want this one he stopped at the door to the infirmary the professora vanished within borne off by her medical minions like a lady on a palanquin ekaterin paused with him i have to leave you for a time and check on my prisoners the stationers will take care of you her brow wrinkled prisoners oh yes how did you get rid of the komarrans miles smiled grimly persuasion she stared down at him one side of her lovely mouth curving up her lower lip was split he wanted to kiss it and make it well not yet timing boy and one other thing you must be very persuasive i hope so he took a deep breath i bluffed them into believing that i wouldnt let them go no matter what they did to you and the professora except that i wasnt bluffing we could not have let them go there betrayal confessed his empty hands clenched she stared at him in disbelief his heart shrank well of course not eh what dont you know what they wanted to do to barrayar she demanded it was a horror show utterly vile and they couldnt even see it they actually tried to tell me that collapsing the wormhole wouldnt hurt anyone monstrous fools thats what i thought actually so wouldnt you put your life on the line to stop them yes but i wasnt putting my lifei was putting yours but im vor she said simply his smile and his heart revived dizzy with delight true vor milady he breathed a female medtech was approaching murmuring anxiously madame vorsoisson miles yielded to her shepherding motions gave ekaterin an analysts salute and turned away he was humming offkey by the time he rounded the first corner chapter twentyone the station infirmary personnel insisted on keeping both vor women overnight a precaution with which neither argued despite her exhaustion ekaterin did get dispensation to go pick up her valise from her neverused hostel room under the watchful eye of a very young impsec guard who called her maam in every sentence and was determined to carry her luggage one message waited on her hostel rooms comconsole an urgent order from lord vorkosigan for her to take her aunt and flee the station at once delivered in a tone of such intense conviction as to almost send her scurrying off despite its obviously outdated content instructions only she noted no explanations whatsoever he really must have once held military command the contrast between this strained forceful lord and the almost goofy geniality of the young man whod bowed her out of the airlock bemused her which was the real lord vorkosigan for all his apparently selfrevealing babble the man remained as elusive as a handful of water water in the desert the thought popped unbidden into her mind and she shook her head to clear it after she returned to the infirmary ekaterin sat up for a while with her aunt waiting for the professor uncle vorthys arrived in the next hour he was unusually breathless and subdued as he sat on the edge of his wifes bed and embraced her she hugged him back tears starting in her eyes for almost the first time in this whole nights ordeal you shouldnt frighten me like that woman he told her in mock severity running around getting kidnapped thwarting komarran terrorists putting impsec out of a job your premature demise would entirely disarrange my selfish plan to drop dead first and leave you to pick up after me kindly dont do that she laughed shakily ill try not to dear the patient gown she wore was not a very flattering fashion but her color did look rather better ekaterin thought synergine hot liquids warmth quiet and safety were working to banish her more alarming symptoms without further medical intervention so that even her anxious husband was fairly quickly reassured ekaterin let her aunt tell him most of the story of their harrowing hours with the komarrans only putting in a few murmurs of correction when she waxed too flattering of her nieces part in it all ekaterin reflected with bleak envy on the nature of a marriage that its principals could regard as prematurely threatened after a mere fortyplus years not for me ive lost that option the professor and the professora were surely among the fortunate few whatever personal qualities it took to achieve this happy state it was abundantly plain to ekaterin that she did not possess them so be it the professors booming voice and precise academic diction returned to usual as he proceeded to harry the medtechs unnecessarily on his wifes behalf ekaterin intervened to suggest firmly that what aunt vorthys needed most now was rest after one last disruptive pass through the private room he took himself off to find lord vorkosigan and tour the late battlefield at the southport locks ekaterin didnt think she could ever sleep again but after she cleaned up and crawled into her own infirmary bed a medtech brought her a potion and invited her to drink it ekaterin was still complaining muzzily that such things didnt work for her when the bed sheets seemed to suck her right down whether due to the potion exhaustion sheer nervous collapse or the absence of a nineyearold demanding services she slept late the restful residue of the morning spent chatting desultorily with her aunt had drifted toward noon when lord vorkosigan trooped into the infirmary room he was clean as a cat and his fine gray suit was crisp and fresh though his face was traced with fatigue he carried an enormous and awkward flower arrangement under each arm ekaterin hurried to help relieve him of them sliding them onto a table before he dropped them both good day madame dr vorthys youre looking much better excellent madame vorsoisson he ducked his head at her and his white grin winked wherever did you find such gorgeous flowers on a space station ekaterin asked astonished in a shop its a komarran space station theyll sell you anything well not anythingthat would be jacksons whole but it stands to reason with all the people meeting and greeting and parting through here that there would be a market niche for this sort of thing they grow them right here on the station you know along with all their truck garden vegetables why do they call them truck gardens i wonder i dont think they ever grew trucks in them even back on old earth he dragged over a chair and sat down near her at the foot of the professoras bed i believe that dark red fuzzy thing is a barrayaran plant by the way it made me break out in hives when i touched it yes bloody puffwad she agreed is that its name or a value judgment she smiled i believe it refers to the color it comes from south continent on the western slopes of the black escarpment i was at the black escarpment for winter training once happily these things must have been buried under several meters of snow at the time how shall we ever get them home miles said the professora half laughing dont burden yourself he recommended you can always give them to the medtechs when you leave but they must be very expensive said ekaterin in worry ridiculously so for something they could only enjoy for a few hours expensive he said blankly automated weaponscontrol systems are expensive combat drop missions which go wrong are very expensive these are cheap really anyway it supports a business which is good for the imperium if you get a chance you ought to ask for a tour of the stations hydroponics section before you leave id think youd find it pretty interesting well see if theres time said ekaterin its been such a bizarre experience its strange to realize im not even late getting back to pick up nikki yet just a few more days to complete his treatment and im done with komarr do you have everything in hand for that everything you need your aunt he nodded at the professora is with you now i expect ill be able to handle anything that comes up this time ekaterin assured him i expect you will that scimitar smile flickered over his face again we only missed the ship we were originally scheduled to take this morning because uncle vorthys insisted we wait and travel back to komarr with him in his fast courier do you know when that will be i should send a message to madame vortorren he has a few chores here yet impsec komarr sent us out a special squad of boffins and techs to clean up and document that mess you made in the southport loading bay oh dear im sorry she began automatically no no it was a beautiful mess couldnt have made a better one myself and ive made a few anyway he will be overseeing them and then returning to komarr to set up a secret scientific commission to study the device explore its limits and all that and hq sent me some highpowered interrogators whom i wanted to personally brief before they took charge of my prisoners captain vorgier wasnt too happy that i wouldnt let any of his local people question our conspirators but ive already declared all details of this case needtoknow under my auditors seal so hes out of luck he cleared his throat your uncle and i have decided i get the job of going straight back to vorbarr sultana from here and making the preliminary report to emperor gregor in person hes only been getting impsec digests oh she said startled leaving so soon what about all your thingsyou shouldnt go off without your seizure stimulator should you half selfconsciously he rubbed his temple the white bandages were gone from his wrists she noticed leaving only pale red rings of new scars to add to his collection presumably i had tuomonen pack up all my kit and send it out here with the crew from hq it arrived a couple of hours ago so im all set good old impsec they do piss me off sometimes tuomonen is going to get a major black mark because the conspiracy in serifosa terraforming took place on his watch and he never caught it even though it was really the imperial accounting office which should have been the first line of defense and that idiot vorgier is getting a commendation there is no justice poor tuomonen i liked him isnt there anything you can do about that mm i turned down a chance to be in charge of impsecs internal affairs so no i think id better not will he keep his post its uncertain at this time i told him if he finds his military career at a stand to look me up i think im going to be able to use a good trained assistant in this auditor job the work will be irregular though the trend of my life he sucked thoughtfully on his lower lip and glanced across at her the reclassification of this case from a peculation scam to something far more serious also affects what you can tell nikki im afraid its all headed into a security black hole as fast as we can stuff it in there and its going to stay there for quite some time there will therefore be no public prosecutions and no need for you to testify though impsec may be around for another interview or twonot under fastpenta in retrospect im very relieved i played it as close to my chest as i did but for nikki and all tiens relatives and anyone else the story is going to have to remain that he died in a simple breath mask accident from being caught outside with a low reservoir and you dont know any more details than that madame dr vorthys this is for you too i understand said the professora i am both relieved and disturbed said ekaterin slowly in time the security considerations will soften you will have to rejudge the problem then when well when many things may have changed i did wonder if for nikkis names honor i ought to try to pay back the imperium all the bribe money tien received he looked startled good god no if anyone owes anything its foscol she stole it in the first place and we certainly wont be getting anything back from her something is owed she said gravely tien settled his debt with his life hes quits with the imperium i assure you in the emperors voice if necessary she took this in death did wipe out debt it just didnt erase the memory of pain time was still required for that healing your time is your own now that felt strange she could take all the time she wanted or needed riches beyond dreams she nodded all right the past is paid please notify me about tiens funeral though i wish to attend if i can he frowned i too owe something there she shook her head mutely in any case do call me when you and your aunt get back to vorbarr sultana he glanced again at the professora she and nikki will be staying with you for a time yes ekaterin was not quite sure if that was phrased as a question or a demand yes indeed aunt vorthys smiled so here are all my addresses he spoke again to ekaterin and handed her a plastic flimsy the numbers for the vorkosigan residences in vorbarr sultana hassadar and vorkosigan surleau for master tsipis in hassadarmy man of business i believe i mentioned him to youhe usually knows where to get hold of me in a pinch when im out in the districtand a dropnumber through the imperial residence which will always know how to reach me any time day or night aunt vorthys leaned back with her finger on her lips and regarded him with growing bemusement do you think those will be enough miles perhaps you can think of three or four more just to be sure to ekaterins surprise he flushed a little i trust these will suffice he said and of course i should be able to reach you through your aunt right of course murmured aunt vorthys id like to show you over my district sometime he added to ekaterin avoiding the professoras eye theres a great deal to see there you might find of interest theres a major forestry project going on in the dendarii mountains and some radiation reclamation experiments my family owns several maple syrup and winery operations theres botany all over the damn place in fact you can hardly move without tripping over a plant perhaps later on said ekaterin uncertainly what will happen to the terraforming project as a result of all this mess with the komarrans mm not too much i now suspect the security classification is going to limit the immediate public political repercussions in the long run too though the amount of money that was stolen from serifosa sectors budget was huge from the viewpoint of a private individual from the standpoint of the bureaucracy it wasnt that big a bite there are nineteen other sectors after all the damage to the soletta array is actually going to be the biggest bill will the imperium repair it properly ive so hoped they would he brightened i had this great idea about that im going to pitch it to gregor that we should declare the soletta repairand enlargementas a wedding present from gregor to laisa and from barrayar to komarr im going to recommend its size be nearly doubled adding the six new panels the komarrans have been begging for since forever i think this mischance can be turned into an absolute propaganda coup with the right timing well shove the appropriation through the council of counts and ministers quickly before midsummer while everyone in vorbarr sultana is still sentimentally wound up for the imperial wedding she clapped her hands in enthusiasm then paused in doubt will that work i didnt think the crusty old council of counts was susceptible to what tien used to call romantic drivel oh he said airily im sure they are im a cadet member of the counts myselfwere only human after all besides we can point out that every time a komarran looks upwell half the timetheyll see this barrayaran gift hanging overhead and know what its doing to create their future the power of suggestion and all that it could save us the expense of putting down the next komarran conspiracy i hope so she said i think its a lovely idea he grinned clearly gratified he looked over at the professora and away shifted around and drew a small packet from his trouser pocket i dont know madame vorsoisson whether gregor will give you a medal or not for your quick thinking and cool response in the southport bay she shook her head i dont need but i thought you should have something to remember it all by this he stuck out his hand she took the packet and laughed do i recognize this probably she unfolded the familiar wrapping and opened the box to reveal the little model barrayar from the jewelers shop in serifosa now on a slender chain of braided gold she held it up it spun in the light look aunt vorthys she said shyly and handed it across for inspection and approval the professora examined it with interest squinting a trifle very fine dear very fine indeed call it the lord auditor vorkosigan award for making his job easier said vorkosigan you really did you know if the komarrans hadnt already lost their infernal device they would never have surrendered even if id talked myself blue in fact soudha said something to that effect during our preliminary interrogations last night so you may consider it confirmed if not for you this station would be in a million hurtling pieces by now she hesitated should she accept she glanced at her aunt who was smiling at her benignly and without apparent misgivings about the propriety of it not that aunt vorthys was particularly passionate about proprietythat indifference was in fact one of the qualities which made her ekaterins favorite female relative think on that thank you she said sincerely to lord vorkosigan i will remember and i do remember she added um youre supposed to forget the unfortunate part about the pond never her lips curved up it was the highlight of the day was it some sort of psychic precognition that you laid this by i dont think so chance favors the prepared and all that fortunately for my credit from the outside most people cant tell the rapid exploitation of a belatedly recognized opportunity from deeplaid planning he positively smirked as she slid the chain over her head you know youre the first girlfr female friend ive had ive ever succeeded in giving barrayar to not for lack of trying her eyes crinkled have you had a great many girlfriends if he hadnt shed have to dismiss her whole gender as congenital idiots the man could charm snakes from their holes nineyearolds from locked bathrooms and komarran terrorists from their bunkers why werent females following him around in herds could no barrayaran woman see past his surface or their own cockedup noses mmma rather long hesitation the usual progression i suppose hopeless first love this and that over the years unrequited mad crushes who was the hopeless first love she asked fascinated elena the daughter of one of my fathers armsmen who was my bodyguard when i was young is she still on barrayar no she emigrated years ago had a galactic military career and retired with the rank of captain shes a commercial shipmaster now jumpships yes nikki would be so envious um what exactly is this and that if i may ask would he answer er well yes i think you should all things considered better sooner than later belike he was growing terribly barrayaran she thought that use of belike was pure dendarii mountain dialect this outburst of confidences was at least as entertaining as putting him on fastpenta might be better given what hed said about his weird reaction to the drug there was elli she was a free mercenary trainee when i first met her what is she now fleet admiral actually so she was this who was that there was taura what was she when you first met her a jacksonian bodyslave of house ryovalvery bad news house ryoval used to be i must ask more about those covert ops missions of yours sometime so what is she now master sergeant in a mercenary fleet the same fleet as um the this yes her brows rose helplessly her aunt vorthys was leaning back with her finger over her lips again her eyes alight with laughter no the professora clearly wasnt going to interfere with this and she led him on beginning to be immensely curious as to how long hed keep going why in the world did he think all this romantic history was something she ought to know not that she would stop him nor would aunt vorthys apparently not for a bribe of five kilos of chocolates but her secret opinion of her gender began to rise mm there was rowan that was that was brief and she was a technical serf of house fell shes a cryorevival surgeon in an independent clinic on escobar now though im happy to say very pleased with her new citizenship tien had protected her proudly she reflected in the little vorlady fortress of her household tien had spent a decade protecting her so hard especially from anything that resembled growth shed felt scarcely larger at thirty than shed been at twenty whatever it was vorkosigan had offered to this extraordinary list of lovers it hadnt been protection do you begin to notice a trend in all this lord vorkosigan yes he replied glumly none of them would marry me and come live on barrayar so what about the unrequited mad crush ah that was rian i was young just a new lieutenant on a diplomatic mission and what does she do now he cleared his throat now shes an empress he added under the pressure of ekaterins wide stare of cetaganda they have several you see a silence fell and stretched he shifted uneasily in his chair and his smile flicked on and off she rested her chin in her hand and regarded him her brows quirked in quizzical delight lord vorkosigan can i take a number and get in line whatever it was hed been expecting her to say it wasnt that he was so taken aback he nearly fell off his chair wait she hadnt meant it to come out sounding quite like his smile stuck in the on position but decidedly sideways the next number up he breathed is one it was her turn to be taken aback her eyes fell scorched by the blaze in his he had lured her into levity his fault for being so luring she stared wildly around the room groping for some suitably neutral remark with which to retrieve her reserve it was a space station there was no weather my the vacuum is hard out today not that either she gazed beseechingly at aunt vorthys vorkosigan observed her involuntary recoil and his smile acquired a sort of stuffed apologetic quality he too looked cautiously to the professora the professora rubbed one finger thoughtfully over her chin and are you traveling back to barrayar on a commercial liner lord vorkosigan she asked him affably the mutually alarmed parties blinked at her in suffused gratitude no said vorkosigan fast courier in fact its waiting for me right now he cleared his throat jumped to his feet and made a show of checking his chrono yes right now professora madame vorsoisson i trust i shall see you both back in vorbarr sultana yes certainly said ekaterin barely avoiding breathlessness i will look forward to it with great fascination said the professora piously his smile went crooked in trenchant appreciation of her tone he backed out with a flourishing selfconscious bow a courtly effect slightly spoiled by his caroming off the doorjamb his quick steps faded down the corridor a nice young man observed aunt vorthys into a room seeming suddenly much emptier a pity hes so short hes not so short said ekaterin defensively hes just concentrated her aunts smile grew maddeningly bland i could see that dear ekaterin lifted her chin in what remained of her dignity i see you are feeling very much better shall we go ask about that hydroponics tour
