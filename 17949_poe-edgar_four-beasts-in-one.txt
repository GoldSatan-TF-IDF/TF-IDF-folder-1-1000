four beasts in one by edgar allan poe chacun a ses vertus crebillons xerxes antiochus epiphanes is very generally looked upon as the gog of the prophet ezekiel this honor is however more properly attributable to cambyses the son of cyrus and indeed the character of the syrian monarch does by no means stand in need of any adventitious embellishment his accession to the throne or rather his usurpation of the sovereignty a hundred and seventyone years before the coming of christ his attempt to plunder the temple of diana at ephesus his implacable hostility to the jews his pollution of the holy of holies and his miserable death at taba after a tumultuous reign of eleven years are circumstances of a prominent kind and therefore more generally noticed by the historians of his time than the impious dastardly cruel silly and whimsical achievements which make up the sum total of his private life and reputation let us suppose gentle reader that it is now the year of the world three thousand eight hundred and thirty and let us for a few minutes imagine ourselves at that most grotesque habitation of man the remarkable city of antioch to be sure there were in syria and other countries sixteen cities of that appellation besides the one to which i more particularly allude but ours is that which went by the name of antiochia epidaphne from its vicinity to the little village of daphne where stood a temple to that divinity it was built although about this matter there is some dispute by seleucus nicanor the first king of the country after alexander the great in memory of his father antiochus and became immediately the residence of the syrian monarchy in the flourishing times of the roman empire it was the ordinary station of the prefect of the eastern provinces and many of the emperors of the queen city among whom may be mentioned especially verus and valens spent here the greater part of their time but i perceive we have arrived at the city itself let us ascend this battlement and throw our eyes upon the town and neighboring country what broad and rapid river is that which forces its way with innumerable falls through the mountainous wilderness and finally through the wilderness of buildings that is the orontes and it is the only water in sight with the exception of the mediterranean which stretches like a broad mirror about twelve miles off to the southward every one has seen the mediterranean but let me tell you there are few who have had a peep at antioch by few i mean few who like you and me have had at the same time the advantages of a modern education therefore cease to regard that sea and give your whole attention to the mass of houses that lie beneath us you will remember that it is now the year of the world three thousand eight hundred and thirty were it laterfor example were it the year of our lord eighteen hundred and fortyfive we should be deprived of this extraordinary spectacle in the nineteenth century antioch isthat is to say antioch will bein a lamentable state of decay it will have been by that time totally destroyed at three different periods by three successive earthquakes indeed to say the truth what little of its former self may then remain will be found in so desolate and ruinous a state that the patriarch shall have removed his residence to damascus this is well i see you profit by my advice and are making the most of your time in inspecting the premisesin satisfying your eyes with the memorials and the things of fame that most renown this city i beg pardon i had forgotten that shakespeare will not flourish for seventeen hundred and fifty years to come but does not the appearance of epidaphne justify me in calling it grotesque it is well fortified and in this respect is as much indebted to nature as to art very true there are a prodigious number of stately palaces there are and the numerous temples sumptuous and magnificent may bear comparison with the most lauded of antiquity all this i must acknowledge still there is an infinity of mud huts and abominable hovels we cannot help perceiving abundance of filth in every kennel and were it not for the overpowering fumes of idolatrous incense i have no doubt we should find a most intolerable stench did you ever behold streets so insufferably narrow or houses so miraculously tall what gloom their shadows cast upon the ground it is well the swinging lamps in those endless colonnades are kept burning throughout the day we should otherwise have the darkness of egypt in the time of her desolation it is certainly a strange place what is the meaning of yonder singular building see it towers above all others and lies to the eastward of what i take to be the royal palace that is the new temple of the sun who is adored in syria under the title of elah gabalah hereafter a very notorious roman emperor will institute this worship in rome and thence derive a cognomen heliogabalus i dare say you would like to take a peep at the divinity of the temple you need not look up at the heavens his sunship is not thereat least not the sunship adored by the syrians that deity will be found in the interior of yonder building he is worshipped under the figure of a large stone pillar terminating at the summit in a cone or pyramid whereby is denoted fire harkbeholdwho can those ridiculous beings be half naked with their faces painted shouting and gesticulating to the rabble some few are mountebanks others more particularly belong to the race of philosophers the greatest portion howeverthose especially who belabor the populace with clubsare the principal courtiers of the palace executing as in duty bound some laudable comicality of the kings but what have we here heavens the town is swarming with wild beasts how terrible a spectaclehow dangerous a peculiarity terrible if you please but not in the least degree dangerous each animal if you will take the pains to observe is following very quietly in the wake of its master some few to be sure are led with a rope about the neck but these are chiefly the lesser or timid species the lion the tiger and the leopard are entirely without restraint they have been trained without difficulty to their present profession and attend upon their respective owners in the capacity of valetsdechambre it is true there are occasions when nature asserts her violated dominionsbut then the devouring of a manatarms or the throttling of a consecrated bull is a circumstance of too little moment to be more than hinted at in epidaphne but what extraordinary tumult do i hear surely this is a loud noise even for antioch it argues some commotion of unusual interest yesundoubtedly the king has ordered some novel spectaclesome gladiatorial exhibition at the hippodromeor perhaps the massacre of the scythian prisonersor the conflagration of his new palaceor the tearing down of a handsome templeor indeed a bonfire of a few jews the uproar increases shouts of laughter ascend the skies the air becomes dissonant with wind instruments and horrible with clamor of a million throats let us descend for the love of fun and see what is going on this waybe careful here we are in the principal street which is called the street of timarchus the sea of people is coming this way and we shall find a difficulty in stemming the tide they are pouring through the alley of heraclides which leads directly from the palacetherefore the king is most probably among the rioters yesi hear the shouts of the herald proclaiming his approach in the pompous phraseology of the east we shall have a glimpse of his person as he passes by the temple of ashimah let us ensconce ourselves in the vestibule of the sanctuary he will be here anon in the meantime let us survey this image what is it oh it is the god ashimah in proper person you perceive however that he is neither a lamb nor a goat nor a satyr neither has he much resemblance to the pan of the arcadians yet all these appearances have been giveni beg pardonwill be givenby the learned of future ages to the ashimah of the syrians put on your spectacles and tell me what it is what is it bless me it is an ape truea baboon but by no means the less a deity his name is a derivation of the greek simiawhat great fools are antiquarians but seeseeyonder scampers a ragged little urchin where is he going what is he bawling about what does he say oh he says the king is coming in triumph that he is dressed in state that he has just finished putting to death with his own hand a thousand chained israelitish prisoners for this exploit the ragamuffin is lauding him to the skies hark here comes a troop of a similar description they have made a latin hymn upon the valor of the king and are singing it as they go mille mille mille mille mille mille decollavimus unus homo mille mille mille mille decollavimus mille mille mille vivat qui mille mille occidit tantum vini habet nemo quantum sanguinis effudit flavius vospicus says that the hymn here introduced was sung by the rabble upon the occasion of aurelian in the sarmatic war having slain with his own hand nine hundred and fifty of the enemy which may be thus paraphrased a thousand a thousand a thousand a thousand a thousand a thousand we with one warrior have slain a thousand a thousand a thousand a thousand sing a thousand over again soho let us sing long life to our king who knocked over a thousand so fine soholet us roar he has given us more red gallons of gore than all syria can furnish of wine do you hear that flourish of trumpets yes the king is coming see the people are aghast with admiration and lift up their eyes to the heavens in reverence he comeshe is comingthere he is whowherethe kingdo not behold himcannot say that i perceive him then you must be blind very possible still i see nothing but a tumultuous mob of idiots and madmen who are busy in prostrating themselves before a gigantic cameleopard and endeavoring to obtain a kiss of the animals hoofs see the beast has very justly kicked one of the rabble overand anotherand anotherand another indeed i cannot help admiring the animal for the excellent use he is making of his feet rabble indeedwhy these are the noble and free citizens of epidaphne beasts did you saytake care that you are not overheard do you not perceive that the animal has the visage of a man why my dear sir that cameleopard is no other than antiochus epiphanes antiochus the illustrious king of syria and the most potent of all the autocrats of the east it is true that he is entitled at times antiochus epimanesantiochus the madmanbut that is because all people have not the capacity to appreciate his merits it is also certain that he is at present ensconced in the hide of a beast and is doing his best to play the part of a cameleopard but this is done for the better sustaining his dignity as king besides the monarch is of gigantic stature and the dress is therefore neither unbecoming nor over large we may however presume he would not have adopted it but for some occasion of especial state such you will allow is the massacre of a thousand jews with how superior a dignity the monarch perambulates on all fours his tail you perceive is held aloft by his two principal concubines elline and argelais and his whole appearance would be infinitely prepossessing were it not for the protuberance of his eyes which will certainly start out of his head and the queer color of his face which has become nondescript from the quantity of wine he has swallowed let us follow him to the hippodrome whither he is proceeding and listen to the song of triumph which he is commencing who is king but epiphanes saydo you know who is king but epiphanes bravobravo there is none but epiphanes nothere is none so tear down the temples and put out the sun well and strenuously sung the populace are hailing him prince of poets as well as glory of the east delight of the universe and most remarkable of cameleopards they have encored his effusion and do you hearhe is singing it over again when he arrives at the hippodrome he will be crowned with the poetic wreath in anticipation of his victory at the approaching olympics but good jupiter what is the matter in the crowd behind us behind us did you sayoh ahi perceive my friend it is well that you spoke in time let us get into a place of safety as soon as possible herelet us conceal ourselves in the arch of this aqueduct and i will inform you presently of the origin of the commotion it has turned out as i have been anticipating the singular appearance of the cameleopard and the head of a man has it seems given offence to the notions of propriety entertained in general by the wild animals domesticated in the city a mutiny has been the result and as is usual upon such occasions all human efforts will be of no avail in quelling the mob several of the syrians have already been devoured but the general voice of the fourfooted patriots seems to be for eating up the cameleopard the prince of poets therefore is upon his hinder legs running for his life his courtiers have left him in the lurch and his concubines have followed so excellent an example delight of the universe thou art in a sad predicament glory of the east thou art in danger of mastication therefore never regard so piteously thy tail it will undoubtedly be draggled in the mud and for this there is no help look not behind thee then at its unavoidable degradation but take courage ply thy legs with vigor and scud for the hippodrome remember that thou art antiochus epiphanes antiochus the illustriousalso prince of poets glory of the east delight of the universe and most remarkable of cameleopards heavens what a power of speed thou art displaying what a capacity for legbail thou art developing run princebravo epiphanes well done cameleopardglorious antiochushe runshe leapshe flies like an arrow from a catapult he approaches the hippodrome he leapshe shriekshe is there this is well for hadst thou glory of the east been half a second longer in reaching the gates of the amphitheatre there is not a bears cub in epidaphne that would not have had a nibble at thy carcase let us be offlet us take our departurefor we shall find our delicate modern ears unable to endure the vast uproar which is about to commence in celebration of the kings escape listen it has already commenced seethe whole town is topsyturvy surely this is the most populous city of the east what a wilderness of people what a jumble of all ranks and ages what a multiplicity of sects and nations what a variety of costumes what a babel of languages what a screaming of beasts what a tinkling of instruments what a parcel of philosophers come let us be off stay a moment i see a vast hubbub in the hippodrome what is the meaning of it i beseech you thatoh nothing the noble and free citizens of epidaphne being as they declare well satisfied of the faith valor wisdom and divinity of their king and having moreover been eyewitnesses of his late superhuman agility do think it no more than their duty to invest his brows in addition to the poetic crown with the wreath of victory in the footracea wreath which it is evident he must obtain at the celebration of the next olympiad and which therefore they now give him in advance
