jeffery deaver speaking in tongues copyright i the whispering bears crazy megan parks the car doesnt want to do this no way doesnt get out listens to the rain the engine ticked to silence as she looked down at her clothes it was her usual outfit jnco jeans a sleeveless white tee under a dark denim work shirt combat boots wore this all the time but she felt uneasy today embarrassed wished shed worn a skirt at least the pants were too baggy the sleeves dangled to the tips of her blackpolished fingernails and her socks were orange as tomato soup well what did it matter the hourd be over soon maybe the man would concentrate on her good qualitiesher wailing blue eyes and blond hair oh and her body too he was a man anyway the clothes covered up the extra seven well all right ten pounds that she carried on her tall frame stalling crazy megan doesnt want to be here one bit rubbing her hand over her upper lip she looked out the rain spattered window at the lush trees and bushes of suburbia this april in northern virginia had been hot as july and ghosts of mist rose from the asphalt nobody on the sidewalksit was deserted here shed never noticed how empty this neighborhood was crazy megan whispers just say no and leave but she couldnt do that megahassle she took off the wooden peace symbol dangling from her neck and flung it into the backseat megan brushed her blond hair with her fingers pulled it away from her face her ruddy knuckles seemed big as golf halls a glance at her face in the rearview mirror she wiped off the black lipstick pulled the blond strands into a ponytail secured the hair with a green rubber band okay lets do it get it over with a jog through the rain she hit the intercom and a moment later the door latch buzzed megan mccall walked into the waiting room where shed spent every saturday morning for the past seven weeks ever since the incident she kept waiting for the place to become familiar it never did she hated this the sessions were bad enough but the waiting really killed her dr hanson always kept her waiting even if she was on time even if there were no other patients ahead of her he always started the session five minutes or so late it pissed her off but she never said anything about it today though she found the new doctor standing in the doorway smiling at her lifting an eyebrow in greeting right on time youre megan the man said offering an easy smile im bill peters he was about her fathers age handsome full head of hair hanson was bald and looked like a shrink this guy maybe a little george cooney crazy megan decides her wariness fades slightly and he doesnt call himself doctor interesting hi come on in he gestured she stepped into the office hows dr hanson she asked sitting in the chair across from his desk somebody in his familys sick his mother an accident i hear shell be all right but he had to go to leesburg for the week so you re like a substitute teacher he laughed something like that i didnt know shrtherapists took over other patients some dont dr petersbill petershad called yesterday after school to tell her that hanson had arranged for him to take over his appointments and if she wanted she could make her regular session after all no way crazy megan had whispered at first but after megan had talked with peters for a while she decided shed give it a try there was something comforting about his voice besides baldy hanson wasnt doing diddly for her the sessions amounted to her lame bitching about school and about being lonely and about amy and josh and brittany and hanson nodding and saying she had to be friends with herself whatever the hell that meant thisll he repeating some things peters now said but if you dont mind could we go over some of the basics i guess he asked its megan collier no colliers my fathers name i use my mothers mccall she rocked in the stiffbacked chair crossing her legs her tomato socks showed she uncrossed her legs and planted her feet squarely on the floor you dont like therapy do you he asked suddenly this was interesting too hanson had never asked that wouldnt ask anything so blunt and unlike this guy hanson didnt look into her eyes when he spoke staring right back she said no i dont he seemed amused you know why youre here silent as always crazy megan answers first because im fucked up im dysfunctional im a nutcase im psycho im loony and half the school knows and do you hare a fucking clue how hard it is to walk through those halls with everyone looking at you and thinking shrink bait shrink bait crazy megan also mentions what just plain megan would never in a million years tell himabout the fake computerized picture of megan in a straitjacket that made the rounds of jefferson high two weeks ago but now megan merely recited cause if i didnt come to see a therapist theyd send me to juvenile detention when shed been found drunk strolling along the catwalk of the municipal water tower two months ago shed been committing a crime the county police got involved and she maybe pushed maybe slugged a cop but finally everybody agreed that if she saw a counselor the commonwealths attorney wouldnt press charges thats true but its not the answer she lifted an eyebrow the answer is that youre here so that you can feel better oh please crazy megan begins rolling her crazy eyes and okay it was totally stupid his words themselves but but there was something about the way dr peters said them that just for a second less than a second megan believed that he really meant them this guys in a different universe from dr loser elbow patch hanson he opened his briefcase and took out a yellow pad a brochure fell out onto the desk she glanced at it a picture of san francisco was on the cover oh youre going there she asked a conference he said flipping through the brochure he handed it to her awesome i love the city he continued im a former hippie tiedyedinthewool deadhead and jefferson airplane fan whole nine yards course that was before your time no way im totally into janis joplin and hendrix yeah you ever been to the bay area not yet but im going someday my mother doesnt know it but i am he squinted hey you know there is a resemblancevon and joplin if you didnt have your hair up itd he the same as hers megan now wished she hadnt done the pert n perky ponytail the doctor added youre prettier of course and thinner can you belt out the blues like i wish but you dont remember hippies he chuckled time out she said enthusiastically ive seen woodstock like eight times she also wished shed kept the peace symbol so tell me did you really try to kill yourself cross your heart and hope to die she joked he smiled she said no what happened oh i was just drinking a little southern comfort all right maybe more than a little joplin s drink he said too fucking sweet for me whoa the fword cool she was almostalmostbeginning to like him he glanced again at her hairthe fringes on her face then back to her eyes it was like one of joshs caresses somewhere within her she felt a tiny pingof reassurance and pleasure megan continued her story and somebody i was with said no way theyd climb up to the top and i said i would and i did thats it like a dare is all all right so you got nabbed by the cops on some bullshit charge thats about it not exactly the crime of the century i didnt think so either but they were so you know i know he said now tell me about yourself your secret history well my parents are divorced i live with bett she has this business its really a decorating business but she says shes an interior designer cause it sounds better tates got this farm in prince william he used to be this famous lawyer but now he just does peoples wills and sells houses and stuff he hires people to run the farm for him sharecroppers sound like slaves or whatever but theyre just people he hires and your relationship with the folks is the porridge too hot too cold or just right just right he nodded made a small notation on his pad though he mightve been just doodling maybe she bored him maybe he was writing a grocery list things to buy after my appointment with crazy megan she told him about growing up about the deaths of her mothers parents and her fathers dad the only other relative shed been close to was her aunt susanher mothers twin sister shes a nice lady but shes had a rough time shes been sick all her life and she really really wanted kids but couldnt have them ah he said none of it felt important to her and she guessed it was even less important to him what about friends count em on one hand crazy megan says shhhh i hang with the goth crowd mostly she told the doctor as in gothic yeah only she decided she could tell him the truth what it is is i kinda stay by myself a lot i meet people but i end up figuring why bother therere a lot of losers out there oh yeah he laughed thats why my business is so good she blinked in surprise then smiled too whats the boyfriend situation this wont take much time she said laughing ruefully i was going with this guy joshua and he was like all right only he was older and he was black i mean he wasnt a gangsta or anything his fathers a soldier like an officer in the pentagon and his mothers some big executive i didnt have a problem with the race thing but dr hanson said i was probably involved with him just to make my parents nuts were you i dont know i kinda liked him no i did like him but you broke up sure dr hanson said i ought to dump him he said that well not exactly but i got that impression crazy megan thinks that mr handsome shrink mr george clooney stud ought tove figured it out how can a psycho nutcase like me go out with anybody if i hadnt dumped joshwhich i cried about for two weeksif i hadnt left then everybody at his school would be on his case hes the one with the loony girl and then his folks would find out theyre the nicest people in the universe and totally in loveand theyd be crushed well of course i had to leave nobody else on the horizon he asked nope she shook her head okay lets talk about the family some more your mother bett and i get along great she hesitated only its funny about hershes into her business but she also believes in all this new age stuff crap im like just chill okay that stuff is so bogus but she doesnt hassle me about it doesnt hassle me about anything really its great between us really great the only problem is shes engaged to a geek do you two talk your mom and you chew the fat as my grandmother used to say sure i mean shes busy a lot but who isnt right yeah we talk she hoped he didnt ask her about what shed have to make up something and how bout dad she shrugged hes nice he takes me to concerts shopping we get along great great cmcrazy meganchides is that the only word you know bitch great great great you sound like a parrot yeah megan said only only what well its like we dont have a lot to talk about he wants me to go windsurfing with him but i went once and its a totally superficial way to spend your time id rather read a book or something you like to read yeah i read a lot whore some of your favorite authors oh i dont know her mind went blank crazy megan isnt much help yep hes gonna think youre damaged quiet megan ordered her alter ego she remembered the last book shed read you know márquez im reading autumn of the patriarch his eyebrow lifted oh i loved it no kidding i dr peters added love in the time of cholera best love story ever written ive read it three times another ecstatic ping the book was actually sitting on her bedside table me too well i only read it once tell me more he continued about your father urn hes pretty handsome stilli mean for a guy in his forties and hes in pretty good shape he dates a lot but he cant seem to settle down with anybody he says he wants a family does he yeah but if he does then why does he date girls named bambi just kidding but they look like theyre bambis they both laughed tell me about the divorce i dont really remember them together they split up when i was three why they got married too young thats what bett says they kind of went different ways mom was like real flighty and into that new age stuff i was telling you about and dad was just the opposite whose idea was the divorce i think my dads he jotted another note then looked up so how mad are you at your parents im not really he asked as if he were completely surprised youre sure the porridge isnt too hot i love em they love me we get along grefine the porridge is just right what the fuck is porridge anyway dont have a clue peters said quickly give me an early memory about your mother what quick now do it his eyes flashed megan felt a wave of heat crinkle through her face i dont hesitate he whispered say whats on your mind she blurted betts getting ready for a date putting on makeup staring in a mirror and poking at a wrinkle like shes hoping itll go away she always does that like her face is the most important thing in the world to her her looks you know and what do you think as you watch her his dark eyes were fervent her mind froze again no youre hesitating tell me slut he nodded now thats wonderful megan she felt swollen with pride didnt know why but she did brilliant now give me a memory about your father fast bears she gasped and lifted a hand to her mouth no wait let me think but the doctor pounced bears at the zoo no never mind tell me she was shaking her head no tell me megan he insisted tell me about the bears its not important oh it is important he said leaning forward listen youre with me now megan forget whatever hansons done i dont operate his way groping around in the dark i go deep she looked into his eyes and frozelike a deer in headlights dont worry he said softly trust me im going to change your life forever they werent real bears toys bears in a story whats so hard about this dr peters asked i dont know crazy megan gives her a good burst of sarcasm oh good job loser youve blown it now you had to tell him about the book but the other side of her was thinking seven weeks of bullshit with dr shiny head hanson and she hadnt felt a thing but bored ten minutes with dr peters and she was hooked up to an electric current crazy megan says its too hard it hurts too much but bill couldnt hear gm of course go on he encouraged and she went on i was about six okay i was spending the weekend with tate he lives in this big house and nobodys around for miles its in the middle of his cornfields and its all quiet and really really spooky i was feeling weird all scared i asked him to read me a story but he said he didnt have any childrens books i was really hurt i started to cry and asked why didnt he have any he got all freaked and went out to the old barnwhere he told me i wasnt ever supposed to goand he came hack with this book it was called the whispering bears only it turned out it wasnt really a kids story at all i found out later it was a book of folk stories from europe do you remember it yeah tell me its stupid no peters said leaning forward again ill bet its anything but stupid tell me there was a town by the edge of the woods and everybody who lived there was happy you know like in all fairy stories before the bad shit happens people walking down the street singing going to market having dinner with their families then one day these two big bears walked out of the woods and stood at the edge of town with their heads down and it sounded like they were whispering to each other at first nobody paid any attention then little by little the people stopped what they were doing and tried to hear what the bears were saying but nobody could that night the bears went back into the forest and the townspeople stood around and one woman said she knew what they were whispering aboutthey were making fun of the people in the village and then everybody started noticing how everybody else walked funny or talked funny or looked stupid and they all ended up laughing at each other and everybody got mad and there were all kinds of fights in town okay then the next day the bears came out of the forest again and started whispering blah blah blah you get the picture then that night they went back into the woods and this time some old man said he knew what they were talking about they were gossiping about the people in town and so everybody figured that everybody else knew all their secrets and so they went home and closed all their windows and doors and they were afraid to go out in public thenthe third daythe bears came out again and it was the same thing only this time the duke or mayor or somebody said i know what theyre saying theyre making plans to attack the village and they went to get torches to scare away the bears but they accidentally set a house on fire and the fire spread and the whole town burned down megan felt a shiver her eyes slipped to the top of the desk and she couldnt look up at dr peters she continued tate only read it to me once but i still remember the last line it was and do you know what the bears were really whispering about why nothing at all dont you know bears cant talk this is so bogus crazy megan scoffs whats he going to think about you now but the doctor calmly asked and the story was upsetting yeah why i dont know maybe cause everybodys lives got ruined for no reason but there was a reason for it megan shrugged he continued the town was destroyed because people projected their own pettiness and jealousy and aggression on some innocent creatures thats the moral of the story how people destroy themselves i guess but i was just thinking it wasnt much of a kids story i guess i wanted the lion king or dalmatians she smiled but peters didnt he looked at her closely what happened after your father finished it why did lie ask that she wondered her palms sweating why megan looked away and shrugged again thats all bett came and picked me up and i went home this is hard isnt it megan get a clue quiet megan snapped to cm she looked at dr peters yeah i guess would it be easier to write down your feelings a lot of my patients do that theres some paper she took the sheets that he nodded toward and rested them on a booklet he pushed forward for her to write on reluctantly megan picked up a pen she stared at the paper i dont know what to say say what you feel i dont know how i feel yes you do he leaned close i think youre just afraid to admit it well say whatever comes into your mind anything say something to your mother first write a letter to her go another wave of that scalding heat spotlight on crazy megan he whispered go deep i cant think pick one thing why are you so angry with her im not yes you are she clenched her fist because why i dont know because shes she goes out with these young men its like she thinks she can cast spells on them so what he challenged her she can date who she wants shes single whats really pissing you off i dont know yes you do he shot back well shes just a businesswoman and shes engaged to this dweeb shes not a fairy princess at all hke shed like to be shes not a cover girl but she wears an exotic image why does she do that i guess to make herself happy she wants to be pretty and young forever she thinks this asshole brads going to make her happy but he isnt shes greedy is that what youre saying yes megan cried thats it she doesnt care about me the night on the water tower she was at brads and she was supposed to call me but she didnt who her fiancés yeah she went up there to baltimore and she never called they were fucking ill bet and she forgot about me it was just like when i was little shed leave me alone all the time by yourself no with sitters my uncle mostly which uncle my aunt susans husband my moms twin sister shes been real sick most of her life i told you heart problems and bett spent all this time with her in the hospital when i was young uncle harrisd babysit me he was real nice but but you missed your mother i wanted her to be with me she said it was only for a little while because aunt susan was real sick she said she and susan were totally close nobody was closer to her than her sister he shook his head seemed horrified she said that to you her own daughter megan nodded you should have been the person closest to her in the world these words gripped her by the throat she wiped more tears and struggled for breath finally she continued aunt susand do anything to have kids but she couldnt because of her heart and here mom got pregnant with me and susan felt real bad about that so mom spent a lot of time with her theres no excuse for neglecting children none absolutely none megan snagged a kleenex and wiped her face and you didnt let yourself be angry why not because my mother was doing something good my aunts a nice lady she always calls and asks about me and wants me to come visit her only i dont cause because youre angry with her she took your mother away from you a chill yeah i guess she did come on megan what else why the guilt because my aunt needed my mom more back then when i was little see crazy megan interrupts oh you cant tell him that yes i can i can tell him anything see uncle harris killed himself he did i felt so bad for my aunt forget it he snapped megan blinked youre betts daughter you should have been the center of her universe what she did was inexcusable say it say it i say it it was inexcusable good now write it to her every bit of the anger you feel get it out the pen rolled from megans lap onto the floor she bent down and picked it up it weighed a hundred pounds the tears ran from her nose and eyes and dripped on the paper tell her the doctor said tell her that shes greedy that she turned her back on her daughter and took care of her sister instead but megan managed to say thats greedy of me of course its greedy you were a child youre supposed to be greedy parents are there to fill your needs thats the whole point of parents tell her what you feel her head swamfrom the electricity in the black eyes boring into hers from her desire her fear from her anger in ten seconds it seemed shed filled the entire sheet she dropped the paper on the floor it floated like a pale leaf the doctor ignored it now your father megan froze shaking her head she looked desperately at the wall clock next time please no now what are you mad about her stomach muscles were hard as a board well im mad cause why doesnt he want to see me he didnt even fight the custody agreement i see him every two or three months tell him i tell him she wrote she poured her fury on to the page when the sheet was half full her pen braked to a halt what else is it megan what arent you telling me nothing oh what do i hear he said the passions slipping somethings wrong youre holding back dr peters frowned whispering bears something about that storys important what i dont know go into the place where it hurts the most we go deep remember thats how i operate im super shrink crazy megan cant take it anymore she just wants to curl up into a little crazy ball and disappear the doctor moved closer pulling his chair beside her their knees touched come on what is it no i dont know what it is you want to tell me you need to tell me he dropped to his knees gripped her by the shoulders touch the most painful part touch it your fathers read you the story he comes to the last line bears cant talk he puts the book away then what happens she sat forward shivering and stared at the floor i go upstairs to pack your mothers coming to pick you up eyes squinting closed painfully shes here i hear the car in the driveway okay bett walks inside youre upstairs and your parents are downstairs theyre talking yeah theyre saying things i cant hear at first then i get closer i sneak down to the landing you can hear them yes what do they say i dont know stuff what do they say the doctors voice filled the room tell me they were talking about a funeral funeral whose i dont know but there was something bad about it something really bad theres something else isnt there megan they say something else no she said desperately just the funeral megan tell me i go on touch the place it hurts tate said megan felt faint she struggled to control the tears he called me they were talking about me and my daddy said she took deep gulps of air which turned to fire in her lungs and throat the doctor blinked in surprise as she screamed my daddy shouted it would allve been different without her without that damn inconvenient child up there she ruined everything megan lowered her head to her knees and wept the doctor put his arm around her shoulders she felt his hand stroke her head and how did you feel when you heard him say that he brushed away the stream of her tears i dont know i cried did you want to run away i guess i did you wanted to show him didnt you if thats what he thinks of me ill pay him back ill leave thats what you thought isnt it another nod you wanted to go someplace where people werent greedy where people loved you where people had childrens books for you where they read and talked to you she sobbed into a wad of kleenex tell him megan write it down get it out so you can look at it she wrote until the tears grew so bad she couldnt see the page then she collapsed against the doctors chest sobbing good megan he announced very good she gripped him tighter than shed ever gripped a lover pressing her head against his neck for a moment neither of them moved she was frozen here embracing him fiercely desperately he stiffened and for a moment she believed that he was feeling the same sorrow she was megan started to back away so that she could see his kind face and his black eyes but he continued to hold her tightly so hard that a sudden pain swept through her arm a surge of alarming warmth spread through her body it was almost arousing then they separated her smile faded as she saw in his face an odd look jesus whats going on his eyes were cold his smile was cruel he was suddenly a different person what she asked whats wrong he said nothing she started to repeat herself but the words wouldnt come her tongue had grown heavy in her swollen mouth it fell against her dry teeth her vision was crinkling she tried once again to say something but couldnt she watched him stand and open a canvas bag that was resting on the floor behind his desk he put away a hypodermic syringe he was pulling on latex gloves whatre youshe began then noticed on her arm where the pain radiated a small dot of blood no she tried to ask him what he was doing but the words vanished in comic mumbling she tried to scream a whisper he walked to her and crouched cradling her head which sagged toward the couch crazy megan is beyond crazy she loves him shes terrified of him she wants to kill him go to sleep he said in a voice kinder than her fathers ever sounded go to sleep finally from the drug or from the fear the room went black and she slumped into his arms one hundred and thirty years ago the dead reb had wandered through this field maybe shuffling along the very path this tall lean man now walked in the hot april rain tate collier looked over his shoulder and imagined that he saw the legendary ghost staring at him from a cluster of brush fifty yards away then he laughed to himself and crunching through rainwet corn husks and stalks the waste from last years harvest he continued through the field inspecting hairline fractures in an irrigation pipe that promised far more water than it had been delivering lately itd have to be replaced within the next week he concluded and wondered how much the work would cost loping along awkwardly somewhat stooped tate was in a brooks brothers pinstripe beneath a yellow souwester and outrageous galoshes having come here straight from his strip mall law office in fairfax virginia where hed just spent an hour explaining to mattie howe that suing the prince william advocate for libel because the paper had accurately reported her drunkdriving arrest was a lawsuit doomed to failure hed booted her out goodnaturedly and sped back to his twohundredacre farm he brushed at his unruly black hair plastered around his face by the rain and glanced at his watch a half hour until bett and megan arrived again the uneasy twist of his stomach at the thought he glanced once more over his shouldertoward where hed seen the wisp of the ghostly soldier gazing at him from the cluster of vines and kudzu and loblolly pine tate returned to the damaged pipe recalling what his grandfatherborn charles william collier but known throughout northern virginia as the judgehad told him about the dead reb a young private in the bold experiment of the confederacy took a musket ball between the eyes at the first battle of bull run by all laws of mercy and physiology he should have fallen dead at the picket line but hed simply dropped his musket stood up and wandered southeast until he came to the huge woods that bordered the dusty town of manassas there he lived for six months growing dark as a slave sucking eggs and robbing cradles the human victuals were legend only the judge appended in a verbal footnote the dead reb was personally responsible for the cessation of all foot traffic after dusk through the centreville woods that falluntil he was found stark naked and dead indeed sitting upright in what was the middle of jacksons corner now a prime part of tate colliers farm well no ghosts here now tate reflected only a hundred feet of pipe to be replaced straightening up now he wiped his watch crystal twenty minutes till they were due look he told himself relax through the misty rain tate could see a mile away the house hed built eighteen years ago it was a miniature tara complete with done columns and was white as a cloud this was tates only real indulgence in life paid for with some inheritance and the hope of money that a young prosecutor knows will be showered upon him for his brilliance and flair despite the fact that a commonwealths attorneys meager salary is a matter of public record the sixbedroom house still groaned beneath a hearty mortgage when the judge deeded over the fertile piedmont land to tate twenty years agoskipping tates father for reasons never articulated though known to one and all of the collier clanthe young man decided impulsively he wanted a family home the judges residence wasnt on the farmland itself but was eight miles away in fairfax tate kept a twoacre parcel fallow for one season and built on it the next the house sat between the two barnsone new one the originalin the middle of a rough grassy field punctuated with patches of blackeyed susans hop clover and bluestem a stand of bitternut hickory trees a beautiful american beech and eastern white pines the eerily balmy wind grabbed his rain slicker and shook hard he closed two buckles of the coat and happened to be gazing toward the house when he saw a downstairs light go out so megan had arrived it had to be the girl bett didnt have keys to the house no hope of cancellation now well if you live three miles from a civil war battlefield you have to appreciate the persistence of the past he glanced once more at the fractured pipe and started toward the house heavy boots slogging through the untilled fields like the dead reb no he reflected nothing so dramatic more like the introspective man of fortyfour years that hed become an enthymeme is an important rhetorical device used in formal debate its a type of syllogism all cats see in the dark midnight is a cat therefore midnight sees in the dark though the enthymeme is abbreviated it leaves out one line of logic all cats see in the dark therefore midnight sees in the dark experienced debaters and trial lawyers like tate collier rely on this device frequently in their debates and courtroom arguments but it works only when theres a common understanding between the advocate and his audience everybodys got to understand that the animal in question is a cat they have to supply the missing information in order for the logic to hold up tate reflected now that he his exwife and megan had virtually none of this common understanding the mind of betty susan mccall would be as alien to him as his was to her except for his exwifes startling reappearance seven weeks agowith the news about megans drunken climb up the water towerhe hadnt seen her for nearly two years and their phone conversations were limited to practical issues about the girl and the few residual financial threads between people divorced fifteen years and as for meganhow can anyone know a seventeenyearold girl her mind was a moving target her only report on the therapy sessions was dad therapys for like losers okay and her walkman headset went back on he didnt expect her to be any more informativeor articulatetoday as he approached the house he now noticed that all of the inside lights had been shut off but when he stepped out of the field he saw that neither megans nor betts car was in the drive he unlocked the door and walked into the house which echoed with emptiness he noticed megans house keys on the entryway table and dropped his own beside them looking up the dim hallway the only light in the cavernous space was from behind himthe bony light from outside filtering through the entryway whats that noise a wet sound sticky came from somewhere on the first floor repetitive accompanied by a faint hungry gasping the chill of fear stirred at his neck megan the noise stopped momentarily then with a guttural snap of breath it resumed again there was a desperation about the sound tates stomach began to churn and his skin prickled with sweat and that smell something pungent and ripe blood he believed like the smell of hot rust megan he called again alarmed now he walked farther into the house the noise stopped though the smell was stronger almost nauseating tate thought of weapons he had a pistol but it was locked away in the barn and there was no time to get it he stepped forcefully into the den seized a letter opener from the desk flipped on the light and laughed out loud his twoyearold dalmatian her back to him was flopped down on the floor chewing intently tate set the opener on the bar and approached the dog his smile faded what is that tate squinted suddenly with a wild raging snarl the dog spun and lunged at him he gasped in shock and leapt back cracking his elbow on the corner of a table just as quickly the dog turned away from him back to its trophy tate circled the animal then stopped between the dogs bloody paws was a bone from which streamed bits of flesh tate stepped forward the dogs head swiveled ominously the animals eyes gleamed with jealous hatred a fierce growl rolled from her sleek throat and the black lips pulled back revealing bloody teeth jesus what is it tate wondered queasy had the dog grabbed some animal that had gotten into the house it was so badly mauled he couldnt tell what it had been no tate commanded but the dog continued to defend its prize a raspy growl rose from her throat come the dog dropped her head and continued to chew keeping her malevolent eyes turned sideways toward tate the crack of bone was loud come no response tate lost his temper and stepped around the dog reaching for its collar the animal leapt up in a frenzy snapping at him baring sharp teeth tate pulled back just in time to save his fingers he could see the bloody object it looked like a beef leg bone the kennel owner from whom hed bought the dalmatian told him that bones were dangerous treats tate never bought them and he assumed megan must have been shopping on her way here and picked one up she sometimes brought chew sticks or rubber toys for the animal tate made a strategic retreat slipped into the hallway hed wait until the animal fell asleep tonight then throw the damn thing out he walked to the basement stairs which led down to the recreation room tate had built for the family parties and reunions hed planned on hostingpeople clustered around the pool table lounging at the bar drinking blender daiquiris and eating barbecued chicken the parties and reunions never happened but megan often disappeared down to the dark catacombs when she spent weekends here he descended the stairs and made a circuit of the small dim rooms nothing he paused and cocked his head from upstairs came the sound of the dogs growl once more urgent and ominous megan is that you his baritone voice echoed powerfully he was angry megan and bett were already twenty minutes late here hed gone to the trouble of inviting them over doing his fatherly duty and this was what he got in return the growling stopped abruptly tate listened for footsteps on the ground floor but heard nothing he climbed the stairs and stepped out into the drizzle once more he made his way to the old barn stepped inside and called megans name no response he looked around the spooky place in frustration straightened a stack of old copies of wallaces fanner which had fallen over and glanced at the wallat a greasy framed plaque containing a saying from seaman knapp the turnofthecentury civil servant whod organized the countrys agricultural extension services program tates grandfather had copied the epigram for inspirational purposes in the same elegant meticulous lettering with which he filled in the farms ledgers and wrote legal memos for his secretary to type what a man hears he may doubt what he sees he may possibly doubt but what he does he cannot doubt megan he called again as he stepped outside then his eye fell on the old picnic bench and he thought of the funeral no he told himself dont go thinking about that the funeral was a thousand years ago its a memory deader than the dead reb and something youll hate yourself for bringing up but think about it he did of course pictured it felt it tasted the memory the funeral the picnic bench japanese lanterns bett and threeyearold megan he pictured the cluster of weekold halloween candy lying in grass a hot november day long ago until bett had shown up at his door nearly two months ago with the news of megan and the water tower he hadnt thought of that day for years what he does he cannot doubt the rain began in earnest once again and he hurried back to the house climbed to the second floor and looked in her bedroom then the others megan she wasnt here either he walked downstairs again reached for the phone but he didnt lift the receiver instead he sat on the living room couch and listened to the muted sound of the dogs teeth cracking the bone in the next room dr peterswell dr aaron matthewssped away from tate colliers farm in megans ford tempo his hands shook and his breath came fast a close call he didnt know why collier had returned home this morning he always kept saturday hours at his office or had every saturday for the past three months ten to four clockwork but not today when matthews had driven to colliers farmwith megan in the trunk no lesshed found to his shock that the lawyer had returned fortunately he was heading out into the fields when he was out of sight matthews had parked in a culdesac of brush beside colliers driveway fifty feet from the house had snuck into the large structure using megans keys hed tossed the dalmatian a beef bone to keep it busy while he did what hed come for hed managed to escape to the tempo just as collier was returning still it unnerved him it was bad luck and although he was a harvardtrained psychotherapist and did not professionally accept the existence of luck sometimes it took little more than a shadow of superstition like this to drop him into the cauldron of a mood matthews was bipolar the diagnosis that used to be called manic depression in order for him to carry out the kidnapping hed gone off his meds he couldnt afford the dulling effects of the high doses of prozac and wellbutrin hed been taking fortunately once the medication had evaporated from his bloodstream he found himself in a manic phase and hed easily been able to spend eighteen hours a day stalking megan and working on his plan but as the weeks had worn on hed begun to worry that he was headed for a fall and he knew from the past that it took very little to push him over the edge into a lethargic pit of depression but the near miss with collier faded now and he remained as buoyant as a happy child he sped to i and headed eastto the vienna virginia metro lotthe huge station for commuters fifteen miles west of dc it was saturday morning but the lot was filled with the cars of people whod taken the train downtown to visit the monuments and museums and galleries matthews drove megans car to the spot where his gray mercedes was parked then climbed out and looked around he saw only one other occupied cara white sedan idling several rows away he couldnt see the driver clearly but the man or woman didnt seem to be looking his way matthews quickly bundled megan out of the tempos trunk and slipped her into the trunk of the mercedes he looked down at the girl curled fetally and unconscious bound up with rope she was very pale he pressed a hand to her chest to make sure that she was still breathing regularly he was concerned about her matthews was no longer a licensed md in virginia and couldnt write prescriptions so to knock the girl out hed stockpiled phenobarb from a veterinarian claiming that one of his rottweilers was having seizures hed mixed the drug with distilled water but couldnt be sure of the concentration she was deeply asleep but it seemed that her respiration was fine and when he took her pulse her heart rate was acceptable between the front seats of the tempo he left the wellthumbed amtrak timetable that megan had used as a lap desk to write the letters to her parents and that now bore her fingerprints and only hershed worn gloves when handling it hed circled all the saturday trains to new york hed approached the abduction the way he once would have planned the treatment of a severely disturbed patient every detail meticulously considered hed stolen the writing paper from megans room in bett mccalls house hed spent hours in her roomwhen the mother was working and megan was in school it was there that hed gotten important insights into her personality observing the three joplin posters the black light the marquez book notes shed received from classmates laced with words like fuck and shit matthews had written a breakthrough paper for the apa journal on how adolescents unconsciously raise and lower emotional barriers to their therapist according to the doctors use of grammar and language hed observed during the session that morning how the expletives hed used had opened her psyche like keys hed been careful to leave no evidence of his breakin at bett mccalls or in leesburgwhere dr hansons mother lived that had been the biggest problem of his plan getting hanson out of the way for the weekwithout doing something as obvious though appealing as running him over with a car hed done some research on the therapist and learned that his mother lived in the small town northwest of washington dc and that she was frail on wednesday night matthews had loosened the top step leading from her back porch to the small yard behind her house then hed called pretending to be a neighbor and asked her to check on an injured dog in the backyard shed been disoriented and reluctant to go outside after dark but after a few minutes hed convinced hernearly had her in tears over the poor animal in fact shed fallen straight down the stairs onto the sidewalk the tumble looked serious and for a moment matthews was worriedif she died hanson might schedule the funeral around his patients sessions but he waited until the paramedics arrived and noted that shed merely broken bones after hanson had left a message canceling her regular session matthews had called megan and told her he was taking over hansons patients now matthews started the mercedes and switched carsparking megans in the space his had occupiedand then sped out of the parking lot he took his souls pulse and found his mood intact there was no paralysis no anger no sorrow dishing up the fishy delusions that had plagued him since he was young the only hint of neurosis was understandable matthews found himself talking silently with megan repeating the various things hed told her in the session and what shed said to him a bit obsessive but as hed occasionally said to patients so what finally he turned the mercedes onto the entrance ramp to i and doing exactly fiftyeight miles an hour headed toward the distant mountains megans new home the woman walked inside the house of which shed been mistress for three years and paused in the gothic arched hallway as if shed never before seen the place bett tate said she continued inside slowly offering her exhusband a formal smile she paused again at the den door the dalmatian looked up snarling oh my tate megan gave her a bone shes a little protective about it lets go in here he closed the den door and they walked into the living room did you talk to her he asked megan no where is she i didnt see her car shes been here but she left i dont know why she leave a note no but her house keysre here oh well bett fell silent tate crossed his arms and rocked on the carpet for a moment he walked to the window looked at the barn through the rain returned coffee he asked no thank you bett sat on the couch crossed her thin legs clad in tight black jeans she wore a black silky blouse and a complicated silver necklace with purple and black stones she sat in silence for a few moments then rose and examined the elaborate fireplace tated had built several years ago she caressed the mortar and with a pale pink fingernail picked at the stone her eyes squinted as she sighted down the mantelpiece nice she said fieldstones expensive she sat down again tate examined her from across the room with her long preraphaelite face and tangle of witchy red hair betty susan mccall was exotic something virginia rarely offeredan enigmatic celtic beauty the south is full of temptresses and lusty cowgirls and it has matriarchs galore but few sorceresses bett was a businesswoman now but beneath that façade tate collier believed she remained the enigmatic young woman hed first seen singing a folk song in a smoky apartment on the outskirts of charlottesville twentythree years ago shed performed a whaling song a cappella in a reedy breathless voice it had however been many years since any woman had ensnared him that way and he now found himself feeling very wary a dozen memories from the days when they were getting divorced surfaced murky and unsettling he wondered how he could keep his distance from her throughout this untidy family business betts eyes had disposed of the fireplace and the furniture in the living room and were checking out the wallpaper and molding his eyes dogged after hers and he concluded that she found the place unhomely and stark it needed more upholstered things more pillows more flowers new curtains livelier paint he felt embarrassed after several minutes bett said well if her cars gone she probably just went out to get something thats probably it two hours later no messages on either of their phones tate called the police the first thing tate noticed was the way konnie glanced at bett with approval as if the lawyer had finally gotten his act together no more young blondes for him and it was damn well about time this woman was in her early forties very pretty smooth skin she had quick eyes and seemed smart detective dimitri konstantinatis of the fairfax county police had commented once tate whvre all the women you date half your age and lemme guess a third your intelligence if that whys that counselor konnie strode into the living room and stuck his hand out toward her lie shook the startled womans hand vigorously as tate introduced them bett my exwife this is konniekonnies an old friend from my prosecuting days howdy oh the cops disappointed face said so shes the ex giving her up was one bad mistake mister the detective glanced at tate so counselor your daughters up n late for lunch that right been over two hours youre fretting too much tate he poked a finger at him and said to bett this fella was the sissiest prosecutor in the commonwealth we had to walk him to his car at night at least i could find my car tate shot back one of the reasons konnie loved tate was that the lawyer joked about konnies drinking he was now in recoveryno alcohol in four yearsand not a single soul in the world except tate collier would dare poke fun at him about it but what every other soul in the world didnt know was that what the cop respected most was balls bett smiled uneasily tate and konnie had worked together frequently when tate was a commonwealths attorney the somber detective had been taciturn and distant for the first six months of their professional relationship never sharing a single personal fact then at midnight of the day a serial rapistmurderer theyd jointly collared and convicted was sentenced to be paroled horizontal as the death row parlance went konnie had drunkenly embraced tate and said that the case made them blood brothers were bonded bonded what kind of pinko touchyfeely crap is that an equally drunken tate had roared theyd been tight friends ever since another knock on the front door maybe thats her bett said eagerly but when tate opened the door a crewcut man in a cheap slopeshouldered gray suit walked inside he stood very straight and looked tate in the eye mr collier im detective ted beauridge fairfax county police im with juvenile tate led him inside and introduced beauridge to bett while konnie clicked the tvs channel selector he seemed fascinated to find a tv that had no remote control beauridge was polite and efficient but clearly he didnt want to be here konnie was the sole reason megans disappearance was getting any attention at all when tate had called konnied told him that it was too early for a missing persons report twentyfour hours disappearance was required unless the individual was under fifteen mentally handicapped or endangered still konnie had somehow accidentally forgotten to get his supervisors okay and had run a tag check on megans car and hed put in a request for jane doe admissions at all the area hospitals tate ushered them into the living room bett asked would you like some coffee or her voice faded and she laughed in embarrassment looking at tate undoubtedly remembering that this had not been her house for along long time nothing thanks maam beauridge said for them both in the time it had taken konnie to arrive bett had called some friends of megans shed spent the night at amy walkers bett had called this girl first but no one had answered she left a message on the walkers voice mail then called some of her other friends brittany kelly and donna hadnt seen megan or heard from her today they didnt know if she had plans except maybe showing up at the mall later to you know like hang out konnie asked tate and bett about the girls saturday routine she normally has a therapy session saturday morning bett explained at nine but the doctor had to cancel today his mother was sick or something could she justve forgotten about coming here for lunch when we talked yesterday i reminded her about it was she good about keeping appointments beauridge asked tate didnt know shed always shown up on time when he took her shopping or to dinner at the ritz in tysons he told them this bett said that she was semigood about being prompt but she didnt think the girl would miss this lunch the three of us being together and all she added with a faint cryptic laugh what about boyfriends konnie asked she didnt tate began then halted at betts glance and he realized he didnt have a clue whether megan had a boyfriend or not bett continued she did but they broke up last month she the one broke it off yes so is he trouble you think this kid konnie tugged at a jowl i dont think so he seemed very nice easygoing so did ted bundy tate thought whats his name joshua lefevre hes a senior at george mason hes a senior in college tate asked well yes she said bett shes only seventeen i mean tate bett said again he was a nice boy his mothers some executive at eds his fathers stationed at the pentagon and joshs a championship athlete hes also head of the black students association the what tate well im just surprised i mean it doesnt matter bett shrugged with some exasperation it doesnt tate said defensively im just surprised konnie repeated wryly mr aclu speaks you know his number beauridge asked bett didnt but she got it from directory assistance and called she apparently got one of his roommates joshua was out she left a message for him to call when he returned so shes been here and gone no sign of a struggle konnie looked around the front hall none what about the alarms i had them off there a panic button she could hit if somebody was inside waiting for her yep and she knows about it bett offered she left the house keys here she has her car keys with her could somebody konnie speculated have stole her purse got the keys and broken in tate considered this maybe but her drivers license has betts address on it how would a burglar know to come here maybe she had something with my address on it but i dont know what besides nothings missing that i could see dont see much worth stealing konnie said looking at the paltry entertainment equipment you know counselor they got tvs nowadays biggern cereal boxes tate grunted okay konnie said how bout you show me her room as tate led him upstairs beauridges smooth drawl rolled sure you got nothing to worry about mrs collier its mccall upstairs tate let konnie into megans room then wandered into his own hed missed something earlier when hed made the rounds up here his dresser drawer was open he looked inside frowned then glanced across the hall as the detective surveyed the girls room something funny tate called hold that thought konnie answered with surprisingly lithe movements for such a big man he dropped to his knees and went through what must have been the standard teenage hiding places under desk drawers beneath dressers wastebaskets under beds in curtains pillows and comforters ah whatta we got here konnie straightened up and examined two sheets of paper he pointed to megans open dresser drawers and the closet thesere almost empty these drawers they normally got clothes in them tate hesitated concern on his face yes theyre usually full could you see if theres any luggage missing luggage no wait her old backpacks gone tate considered this for a moment why would she take that he wondered looking at the papers tate asked the detective whatd you find easy counselor konnie said folding up the sheets lets go downstairs what would sidney poitier do joshua lefevre shifted his muscular trapezoidal body in the skimpy seat of his toyota and pressed down harder on the gas pedal the tiny engine complained but slowly edged the car closer to the mercedes come on megan what the hellre you up to he squinted again and leaned forward as if moving eight inches closer to the merce were going to let him see more clearly through his confusion he assumed the man not megan was driving though he couldnt be sure this gave him a sliver of comfortfor some reason the thought of this guy tossing megan the keys to his big doctors car and saying you drive honey riled the young man beyond words made him furious he nudged the car faster sidney poitier what would you do lefevre had seen in the heat of the night when hed been ten on video of coursewhen the film had originally come out in the sixties the man who would be his father was doing basic training pushups in fort dix and his tobe mother was listening to smokey robinson and diana ross while she worked on her average at national cathedral school the film had affected him deeply the poitier character detective tibbs ended up stuck in the small southern town butting horns with goodoldboy sheriff rod steiger moving slow solving a local murder step by step not getting flustered not getting pissed off in the face of all the crap everybody in town was giving him sure the movie didnt have real guts it was hollywoods idea of race relations more softball than gritty but even at age ten joshua lefevre understood the film wasnt really about black or whiteit was about being a man and being persistent and not taking no when you believed yes it choked him up that flickthe way important movies always do those films that give us our role models whether its the first time we see them or the hundredth oh yes joshua nathan lefevrean honors english major at george mason university a tall young man with his fathers perfect physique and military bearing and with his mothers brainshad a sentimental side to him thick as a mountain the week that students in his nineteenthcenturylit seminar were picking apart a henry james novel like crows lefevre had slunk back to his apartment with a very different book hidden in a brown paper bag hed locked his door and read the entire novel in one sitting crying unashamedly when he came to the last page of the bridges of madison county sentimental a romantic and accordingly sidney poitierrather than samuel l jackson or wesley snipesappealed to him so what would mr tibbs do now okay he was saying to himself lets analyze it step by step heres a girls got a bad home life none of that talkshow abuse no but its clearly a case of daddy dont care and momma dont care so she drinks more than she ought and hangs with a bad crowduntil she meets lefevre and seems to get her act together though she falls off the normal wagon every once in a while and then one night she climbs up to the top of a water tower and why didnt she call me dammit instead of guzzling a fifth of comfort with donna and brittany the easy sisters and once shes up there she does a little dance on the scaffolding and the cops and fire department come to get her down and she goes to see this shrink who tells her shes got to break up with him and so she does why lefevre had asked her a few weeks ago as they sat in his car parked in front of her house on what turned out to be their last date why its not the differences meaning the age meaning the race it was what the hell was it he replayed megans little speech its just that im not ready for the same kind of relationship you want and what kind is that i dont remember proposing i dont think weve even talked about our relationship we just have fun together oh josh honey dont cry i need to see things do things i feel i dont know all tied down or something living with betts like living with a roommate you know her date for saturdays the biggest deal in the world all she worries about is her skin getting old old skin i like your mom shes pretty smart offbeat i dont get it whats her skin got to do with breaking up lefevre had been very confused as he sat in his tiny car beside the woman he loved oh honey i just need to get away i want to travel see things you know travel where was this coming from ive got a trust fund mom and dadre loaded ive lived in jeddab cyprus london and germany i speak three languages i can show you more of the world than the cunard line okay what it is is this therapist dr hanson see he thinks its not a good idea for me to be in a relationship with you right now then well back off a bit see each other once a week or so hows that no you dont understand megan had said brutally pulling away from him as he tried to take the southern comfort bottle out of her hand and shed climbed out of the passenger seat and run into her house cruising down i now lefevre leaned over and sniffed the headrest to see if he could smell her perfume heartbreakingly he couldnt he pushed the accelerator harder edging up on the gray mercedes we you dont understand no he sure as hell hadnt joshua lefevre had waited a tormented three weeks thenthis morningwoke up on autopilot he hadnt been able to take the girls silence and the suffocating frustration anymore hed driven to hansons office around the time megans appointment would be over hed parked up the street waiting for her to come out josh lefevre could benchpress pounds he could bicycle miles a day but he wasnt going for intimidation oh no he was going to poitier the man not snipes him why he was going to ask the doctor did you talk her into breaking up with me isnt that unethical lets sit down together the three of us josh had a dozen arguments all prepared he believed he could talk his way back into her heart no you dont understand but now he did god im an idiot the doctor had her break up because he wanted to luck her no psychobabble here no inner child nope the shrink wanted to play the twobacked beast with lefevres girlfriend simple as a shot in the head from where hed been parked near the office he hadnt been able to see clearly but suddenly before the appointment was supposed to be over megans tempo was pulling out of the lotwith the shrink himself driving it seemed and heading north hed followed the car to manassas to megans dads farmwhere lefevred waited for about twenty minutes then just when hed been about to pull into the long drive the car had sped out again and theyd driven to the vienna metro parking lot theyd switched carstaking the german shrinkmobileand headed west on what was it all about had she picked up some clothes from her fathers place was she going away for the weekend lefevre was crazed he had to do something but what would sidney poitier do the script had changed wait till they got to the doctors house the inn they were going to confront them there no that didnt seem right oh hell he should just go home forget this crap be a man his foot eased up on the gas good idea get off at the next exit quit acting like a lovesick loser its embarrassing go home read your melville youve got a presentation due a week from monday the mercedes pulled ahead then the thought burst within him bullshit im going to deconstruct motifs in some fucking story about a bigass whale while my girlfriends in bed whispering into her therapists ear he jammed his foot to the floor would poitier do this you bet and so lefevre kept his sweating hands on the wheel of the car straining forward and sped after the woman whom he loved and he believed somewhere in a portion of his sloppy heart who loved him still shes run away bett whispered the four of them were in the living room like strangers at a cocktail party knees pointed at one another sitting upright and waiting to become comfortable konnie continued but yall should consider that good news the profile is most runaways come back on their own within a month bett stared out the window at the misty darkness a month she announced as if answering a trivia question no no she wouldnt leave not without saying anything konnie glanced at beauridge tate caught the look im afraid she did say something konnie handed bett and tate what hed found upstairs letters to both of you under her pillow why there bett asked that doesnt make any sense so you wouldnt find em right away konnie explained give her a head start ive seen it before beauridge asked is that her handwriting konnie added theres a buddy of mine fbi document examiner parker kincaid lives in fairfax we could give him a call but bett said it was definitely megans writing bett she read aloud then looked up she called me bett not mom why would she do that she started again and read in a breathless ghostly voice betti dont care if it hurts you to say this i dont care how much it hurts she looked helplessly at her exhusband then read to herself she finished sat back in the couch and seemed to shrink to the size of a child herself she whispered she says she hates me she hates all the time i spent with my sister i mystified hurt she shook her head and fell silent tate looked down at his note it was stained with tears with rain he read tate the only way to say iti hate you for what youve done to me you dont listen to me you talk talk talk and bett calls you the silvertongued devil and you are but you never listen to me to what i want to who i am you bribe me you pay me off and hope ill go away i should of run away when i was six like i wanted to and never come back ive wanted to do that all along i still want to get away from you its what you want anyway isnt it to get rid of your inconvenient child his mouth was open his lips and tongue dry stinging from the air that whipped in and out of his lungs he found he was staring at bett tate you okay konnie said could i see that again mrs mccall beauridge asked she handed the stiff sheet over youre sure thats her writing paper bett nodded i gave it to her for christmas in a low voice bett answered questions no one had asked my sister was very sick i left megan in other peoples care a lot i didnt know she felt so abandoned she never said anything tate noted megans careless handwriting in several places the tip of the pen had ripped through the paper in anger he assumed konnie asked tate what hed found in his own room he was so stunned it took him a minute to focus on the question she took four hundred dollars from my bedside drawer bell blurted nonsense she wouldnt take its gone tate said shes the only one whos been here what about credit cards konnie asked shes on my visa and mastercard bett said shed have them with her thats good konnie offered its an easy way to trace runaways what it is well set up a realtime link with the credit card companies well know within ten minutes where shes charged something beauridge said well put her on the runaway wire shes picked up anywhere for anything on the eastern seaboard theyll let us know let me have a picture will you tate realized that they were looking at him sure he said quickly and began searching the room he looked through the bookshelves endtable drawers he couldnt find any photos beauridge watched tate uncertainly tate guessed that the young officers wallet and wall were peppered with snapshots of his own youngsters konnie himself tate remembered from some years ago kept a picture of his exwife and kids in his wallet the lawyer rummaged in the living room and disappeared into the den he returned some moments later with a snapshota photo of tate and megan at virginia beach two years ago she stared unsmilingly at the camera it was the only picture he could find pretty girl beauridge said tate konnie said ill stay on it but there isnt a lot we can do whatever konnie you know itll be appreciated bye mrs collmccall but bett was looking out the window and said nothing the white toyota was staying right behind the mercedes aaron matthews noted he wondered if it was the same auto hed seen in the vienna metro lot when he was switching cars he wished hed paid more attention matthews believed in coincidence even less than he believed in luck and superstition there were no accidents no flukes we are completely responsible for our behavior and its consequences even if we cant figure out whats motivating us to act the car behind him now was not a coincidence there was a motive there was a design matthews couldnt understand it yet he didnt know how concerned to be but he was concerned maybe hed cut the driver off and the man was mad road rage maybe it was someone whod seen him heft a large bundle into the trunk of the mercedes and was following out of curiosity maybe it was the police he slowed to fifty the white car did too sped up the car stayed with him have to think about this have to do something matthews slid into the right lane and continued through the mist toward the mountains in the west he looked back as often as he looked forward as any good therapist will advise his patients to do the rain had stopped but the atmosphere was thick as hot blood in her stylish shoes with the wide high heels bett mccall came to tates shoulder neither speaking they stood on the back porch looking over the back sixty acres of the property the collier spread was more conservative than most piedmont farms five fields rotating between soy one year and corn and rye the next a classic northern virginia spread listen to me tate the judge would say the boy always listened to his grandfather whats a legume a pea only a pea well beans too i think peas beans clover alfalfa vetches theyre all legumes they help the soil you plant year after year of cereals what happens dont know sir your soil goes to hell in a hand basket whys that judge the man had taught the boy never to be afraid to ask questions because legumes take nitrogen from the air cereals take it from the soil oh well plant mammoth brown and yellow for silage and virginia soy too wilson and haerlandts are good for seed and hay how do you prepare the land like youre planting corn the boy had responded sow them broadcast with a wheat drill out of the blue the judge might glance at his grandson and ask do you cuss tate no sir here read this the man thrust into tates hand a withered old bulletin from the virginia department of agriculture and immigration a dogeared chapter bemoaned the rise of young farmers profanity even some of our girls have taken to this deplorable habit ill keep that in mind judge tate had said remembering without guilt how hed sworn a blue streak at junior foote at school just last thursday gazing at his fields the judge had continued but if you do find it necessary to let loose just make sure therere no womenfolk around almost time for supper lets get on home tate stayed at his grandparents house in fairfax as often as at his parents tates father was a kind completely quiet man best suited to a life as say a court reportera career hed never dared pursue of course given the risk that hed be assigned to transcribe one of his fathers trials the judge had agonized over whether or not to leave the farm to his only son and had concluded the man just didnt have the mettle to handle a spread of this sort so he deeded it over to tate while the other kin got money ironically as tate learned during one of the few frank conversations hed ever had with his father the man had been dreading the day that the judge would hand over the farm to him his main concern seemed to be that running the farm would interfere with his passion of collecting lionel electric trains tates timid evertired mother suited her husband perfectly and tate could remember not a single word of dissension or passion between the two little conversation either which is why given his druthers adolescent tate would hitch or beg a ride to his grandparents house and spend as much time as he could with them as the judge had presided at the head of the groaning board table on sunday afternoons tates grandmother might offer in a whisper the only day to plant beans is good friday thats a superstition grams young tate had said to her a woman so benign that she took any conversation directed toward her even in disagreement as a compliment you can plant soy all the way through june no young man now listen to me shed looked toward the head of the table to make sure her husband wasnt listening if you laugh loud while planting corn its trouble i mean serious trouble and its good to plant potatoes and onions in the dark of the moon and you better plant beans and corn in the light that doesnt make any sense grams does shed responded root crops grow below ground so you plant them in the dark of the moon cereals are above ground so you plant in the light tate admitted there was a certain logic there this was one of three or four simultaneous discussions going on around the dinner tableaunts and uncles and cousins as well as the inevitable guest or two that the judge would invite from the ranks of the bench and bar in prince william and fairfax counties one crisp clear sunday young tate shared an iced tea with one guest whod arrived early while the judge was en route from the farm the slim softspoken visitor showed a great interest in tates ant farm the visitor was supreme court justice william brennan taking a break from penning an opinion in a decisionmaybe a landmark caseto come to judge colliers farm for roast beef yams collard greens and of course fresh corn and crams would continue scanning the table for the sin of empty serving bowls its also bad luck to slaughter hogs in the dark of the moon sure is for the hogs tate had offered the dinner would continue until four or five in the afternoon tate sitting and listening to legal war stories and planning and zoning battles and local gossip thick as cramss mashed potatoes now because his exwife stood beside him tate was keenly aware that those norman rockwell times which hed hoped to duplicate in his own life had never materialized the vestige of a familial south for tate hadnt survived long into his adulthood he bett and megan were no longer a family among the multitude of pretty and smart and wellrounded women hed dated tate collier hadnt found a single chance for family and so as concerned as he now was about megan the return of these two into his life was fraught with pain it brought practical problems too he was preparing for the biggest case hed had in years a corporation was petitioning prince william county for permission to construct a historical theme park near the bull run battlefield liberty park was going to take on kings dominion and six flags tate was representing a group of residents who didnt want the entertainment complex in their backyard even though the county had granted tentative approval last week tate had won a temporary injunction halting the development for ninety days which the developer immediately challenged next week on thursday the supreme court in richmond would hear the argument and rule whether or not to let the injunction stand if it did the delay alone might be enough to put the kibosh on the whole deal overnight tate collier had become the most popularand unpopularperson in prince william county depending on whether you opposed or supported the project the developer of the park and the lenders funding it wanted him to curl up and blow away of course but there were hundreds of local businessmen craftsmen suppliers and residents who also stood to gain by the parks approval and the ensuing migration of tourists one editorial lauding the project called tate the devils advocate a phrase that certainly resonated in this fervent outpost of the christian south liberty park s developer jack sharpe was one of the richest men in northern virginia he came from old money and could trace his prince william ancestry back to precivil war days when tate had brought the action for the injunction sharpe had hired a wellknown local firm to defend tate had chopped sharpes lawyers into little pieceshardly even sportingand the developer had fired them for the argument in richmond hed gone straight to washington dc to hire a law firm that included two former attorneys general one former vice president and possibly a future president tate and ruth his secretaryassistantparalegal had been working nonstop on the argument and motion papers for a week and would continue to do so until probably midnight of the day before the argument so betts reappearance in his lifeand megans disappearance from itmight have some serious professional repercussions queasy he thought again of that day when he and bett had fought so bitterlyten or eleven years ago hed never known the girl had overheard his outburst your inconvenient child why had fate brought them back into his life why now but however he wished otherwise they were back and there was nothing he could do about it finally tate asked his exwife think we should call my mother no bell said lets give it a few days i dont want to upset her unnecessarily what about your sister definitely not her why not tate wondered aloud he knew susan cared very much for megan more than most aunts would for a niece in fact shed always seemed almost jealous that bell had a daughter and she didnt because we dont have any answers yet bett responded then after a few moments she sighed this isnt like her she glanced at the letter in her hand then shoved it deep into her purse tate studied his wifes face tate collier had inherited several talents from the judge the main gift was of course a way with words and the other far rarer was the ability to see the future in someones face now he looked into his exwifes remarkable violet eyes saw them narrow alight on his and move on and he knew exactly what was going through her mind debate is not just about words debate is about intuition too the advocate who can see exactly where his adversary is headed will always have an advantage whatever rhetorical flourishes the opponent has in his repertoire he didnt like what he now saw bett stepped determinedly off the porch and into the backyard toward the west barn where her car was parked he followed and paused on the shaggy lawn which was badly in need of a mowing he stared intently at the white streak of the energetic dalmatian which had finally forsaken the bone and was zipping through the grass like a greyhound tate glanced at the old barn alien and yet very familiar then his eyes fell on the picnic bench that he and bell had bought at one of the furniture stores along route theyd used it only oncefor the gathering after the funeral fourteen years ago he remembered the events with perfect clarity now it seemed like last week he saw bett looking at the bench too wondered what she was thinking that had been an unseasonably warm novemberjust as odd as this aprils oppressive heat he pictured bett standing on the bench to unhook a japanese lantern from the dogwood after the last of the family and wellwishers had left or gone to bed today tate paused beside this same tree which was in its expansive pink bloom are you busy now she asked your practice lot of little things only one big case he nodded at the house where a paralyzing stack of documents for the liberty park argument rested when they were married the house had been littered with redbacked legal briefs forty or fifty pages long the supreme court of the commonwealth of virginia many of them were for death penalty cases tate was prosecuting although hed been the fairfax county commonwealths attorney tate had often argued down in richmond on behalf of other counties have voice will travel his staff had joked his specialty had become specialcircumstance murder casesthe official description of capital punishment cases these assignments and his eagerness to take such cases were a source of friction between husband and wife bett was opposed to the death penalty death tate reflected always seemed to lurk behind their relationship her sister susans continual battle with serious heart disease and the suicide of susans husband harris then the death of betts parents and tates father and grandfather all in the tragically short period of three years tate kicked at piles of cornstalks i have this feeling tate betts hands lifted and dropped to her sides do you understand what i mean no he didnt tate was dogged and smart but feelings no sir didnt trust them for a minute he saw how they got the people hed prosecuted into deep deep trouble when theyd been married bett lived on feelings intuition sensations impressions and sometimes it seemed messages from the stars drove him crazy keep going he said she shrugged i dont believe this she tapped her purse meaning the letter he supposed why do you think that i was remembering something hmm he offered noncommittally i found a bag under megans bed at home when i was cleaning last week there was a soap dish in it he noticed the womans tears he wanted to step close put his arm around her tate tried to remember the last time hed held her not just bussed cheeks but actually put his arms around her felt her narrow shoulder blades beneath his large hands no memory came to mind it was a joke between us i never had a dish in my bathroom the soap got all yucky megan said so she bought this victorian soap dish it was for my birthday next week there was a card too i mean she wouldnt buy me a present and a card and then do this wouldnt she tate wondered why not when the pressure builds to a certain point the volcano blowsand it doesnt care about the time of year or whos picnicking on the slopes drunken lovers or churchgoers any lawyer whos done domestic relations work will testify to that you think someone made her do this or that its a prank tate asked i dont know she mightve been drinking again i checked the bottles at home and they didnt look emptier but i dont know thats not much to go on her exhusband said suddenly she turned to him and spoke its not a hundred percent thing weve got megan and me therere problems of course there are but our relationship deserves more than this damn letter more than her running out she crossed her arms gazed into the fields again she repeated somethings wrong but what exactly what do you think i dont know well what should we do i want to go look for her bett said determinedly i want to find he r which is exactly what hed seen in her purple eyes a few moments earlier this is what hed known was coming yet now that he thought about it he was surprised this didnt sound like bett mccall at all bett the dreamer bett the tarot card consulter passive shed always floated where the breezes took her forrest gumps feather the least likely person imaginable to be a mother children needed guidance direction models that wasnt bett mccall when hed heard from megan that bett had become engaged last christmas tate was surprised only that it had taken her so long to accept what must have been her dozenth proposal since theyd divorced when theyd been married shed been charming and flighty and wholly ungrounded relying on him to provide the foundation she needed hed assumed that once theyd split up shed quickly find someone else to play that role he wondered if he was standing next to a betty susan mccall different from the one hed been married to and wondered too if she was thinking the same about him bett he said to reassure her shes fine shes a mature young woman she vented some steam ands going off for a few days i did it myself when i was about her age remember he doubted that she did but surprising him she said you made it all the way to baltimore and i called the judge and he came to get me a twoday runaway look megans had a lot to deal with i think the soap dish is the key the dish youre rightnobodyd buy a present and a card and then not give them to you shell be back for your birthday and know what else what theres a positive side to this shes brought up some things that we can talk about that ought to be talked about he noddedtoward the house where his letter rested like a bloody knife logic who could argue with it but bett wasnt convinced theres something else i have to tell you she chewed on her narrow lower lip the way he remembered her doing whenever shed been troubled she gripped the porch banister and lowered her head tate collier intercollegiate debate champion national moot court winner expert forensic orator recognized the body language of an impending confession go ahead he said the night of the water tower thingi was out out she sighed i mean i didnt get home i was at brads in baltimore i didnt plan on it i just fell asleep megan was really upset i hadnt called you apologized of course well it was one of those things an accident shed know that bett shook her head dismissingly i think maybe thats what started her drinking before she climbed up the tower it didnt help that she doesnt like brad much the girl had described betts fiancé as a nerd who parted his hair too carefully thought sweaters with reindeer on them were stylish and spent too much time in front of the tv tate didnt share these observations with bett now it takes a little while to get used to stepparents i see it all the time in my practice i held off going over to his place for a while after that but last night i went there again i asked her if she minded and she said she didnt i dropped her at amys on my way to baltimore so there tate smiled and caught her eye as she glanced his way what he lifted his palms its just a little payback shes over at somebodys house going to let you sweat a bit so no need to worry you go your way and ill go mine that may be bett said but ill never forgive myself if i just forget it and something happens to her tates phone buzzed he answered it counselor konnies gruff voice barked konnie whats up got good news you found her betts head swiveled the detective said shes on her way to new york how do you know tate asked i put out a dmv notice and a patrol found her car at the vienna metro station on the front seat was an amtrak schedule shed circled saturday trains to penn station manhattan the metro would take her from vienna to union station in downtown dc in a half hour from there it was three hours to new york city konnie continued you know anybody up there shed go to visit tate told this to bett who took the news cautiously he asked about where she might be going she shook her head i dont think she knows a soul up there tate relayed the answer to konnie well at least you know where shes going ill call nypd and have somebody meet the trains and ask around the station ill send em her picture okay thanks konnie he hung up looked at his exwife well he said thats that but the violet eyes disagreed what bett he asked im sorry tate i just dont buy it what her going off to new york but why you havent told me anything specific her palms slapped her hips well i dont have anything specific you want evidence you want proof i dont have any she sighed im not like you like me i cant convince you she said angrily i dont have a way with words so im not even going to try he started to say something more to cinch his argument to end this awkward reunion to send her back out of his life but he considered what shed just said and recalled somethingwhat the judge had said after tate had finished an argument before the supreme court in richmond in a death penalty case which tate later won his grandfather had been in the audience proud as could be that his offspring was handling the case later over whiskeys at the ornate jefferson hotel in richmond the somber old man had said tate that was wonderful absolutely wonderful theyll rule for you i saw it in their faces i did too hed thought wondering what else the judge had in mind the old mans eyes were dim but i want you to understand something okay the young man said youve got it in you to be the most manipulative person on earth how do you mean sir if you were greedy you could be a rockefeller if you were evil you could be a hitler thats what i mean you can talk your way into somebodys heart and get them to do whatever you want judge or jury they wont have a chance words tate words you cant see them but theyre the most dangerous weapons on earth remember that be careful son sure sir tate had said paying no attention to the old mans advice wondering if the courts decision would be unanimous it was what he does he cannot doubt bett gazed at him and in a soft voicesympathetic almost pitying she said tate dont worry about it its not your problem you go back to your practice i can handle it she fished in her purse pulled out her car keys he watched her walk away then he called come on in here she hesitated come on he said and wandered into the barn the original onebuilt in the s reluctantly she followed it was a grimy place the barn filled with as much junk as farm tools hed played here as a boy had a ream of memories horses tails twitching with muscular jerks on hot summer afternoons sparks flying as the judge edged an axe on the old grinding wheel hed tried his first cigarette here and learned much about the world from the moldy stacks of national geographics he also got his first glimpse of naked womenin the playboys the sharecroppers had stashed here he slipped off his suit jacket hanging it up on a pink padded coat hanger what was that doing here he wondered a former girlfriend he believed had left it after theyd taken a trip to the caribbean bett stood near him holding on to a beam that powderpost beetles had riddled tate rummaged through a box bell watched remained silent he didnt find what he was looking for in one box and turned to another he glanced up at her then continued to rummage he finally found the old beatup leather jacket he pulled it on took off his tie and unbuttoned the top button of his dress shirt then he righted a battered old cobblers bench dropped down onto it and took off his oxford wing tips and socks he massaged his feet his eyes fell again on the picnic bench visible just outside the door thinking again of the night of the funeral megan in bed bett unhooking the japanese lantern the november night still oddly balmy she seemed to float like a ghost in the dim air above the bench hed come up next to her startled her by speaking to her in a heartrending whisper i have something to tell you now he shoved that hard memory away and pulled on white work socks and his comfortable boots she looked at him in confusion shook her head whatre you doing you did it after all he said with a faint laugh what you convinced me he laced the boots up tight i think youre right something happened to her and were going to find out what you and me ii the inconvenient child the rain had started up again they were inside now sitting at the old dining room table dark oak and pitted with wormholes tate poured wine offered it to bett she took the glass and cradled it between both hands the way he remembered her doing when theyd been married in their first year of marriage because he was a poor young prosecutor and bett hadnt yet found her career they couldnt afford to go out to dinner very often but at least once a week theyd try to have lunch at a nice restaurant theyd always ordered wine she sipped from the glass set it on the table and watched the sheets of rain roll across the brown fields what do we do tate she asked where do we start prosecutors know as much about criminal investigations as cops do but those gears in tates mind hadnt been used for a long time he shrugged lets start with her therapist maybe she said something about running away about where shed go whats his name tate felt he should have remembered hanson bett said he had to cancel the session todayan illness or something i hope hes in town she looked up the number in her address book and dialed it its his service she whispered to tate whats your cell number she gave the doctors answering service both of their mobile numbers and asked him to return the call she said it was urgent try that friend again tate suggested amy where she spent the night he tried to picture amy hed met her once hed counted nine earrings in the girls left ear but only eight in her right hed wondered if the disparity had been intentional or if shed merely miscounted troubled he thought again about her boyfriend well she was seventeen why shouldnt she go out but with a college senior tates prosecutorial mind thought back to the virginia provisions on statutory rape bell shifted and cocked the phone closer to her ear apparently someone was now home amy its megans mother honey were trying to find her she didnt show up for lunch do you know where she went this morning after she left you and your moms bett nodded as she listened and then asked if megan had been upset about anything her face was grim tate was half listening but mostly he was studying bett the tangles of auburn hair the striking face the prominent neck bones the complexion of a woman who looked ten years younger than her age he tried to remember the last time hed seen her maybe it was megans sweet sixteen party an odd evening for a fleeting moment as he stood beside the girl and her mother delivering what everyone declared to be a brilliant toast hed had a sense of them as a family he and bett had shared a momentary smile but it had faded fast and the instant theyd stepped out of the spotlight theyd returned to their separate lives when hed seen her after that tate couldnt remember he thought shes less pretty now but more beautiful more confident more assured her sunsetsky eyes were narrowed and not flitting aroundcoy arid etherealthe way theyd habitually done fifteen years ago maybe its maturity tate reflected and he wondered again what her impression of him might be bett put her hand over the receiver and said amy said megan left about ninethirty this morning and wouldnt tell her where she was going she was secretive about it she left her book bag there i thought it might have something in it thatd give us a clue where she went i said wed be by to pick it up later good bett listened to amy again she frowned in concern tate she said that megan told her somebodyd been following her following who she doesnt know okay hard evidence the latent prosecutor in tate collier awakened a bit more let me talk to her tate took the phone amy this is megans father a pause the girl finally said urn hi is megan like okay we hope so we just want to find out where she is whats this about somebody following her she was like pretty freaked not real helpful he thought and asked tell me exactly what happened i mean her and me we were sitting around watching this movie i dont know on wednesday i guess and it was about a stalker and she goes i dont want to watch this and im like why not and shes like theres this car with some older guy in it and i think hes been following me around and i go no way but shes like yeah really where tate asked around school i think amy said any description of the guy or the car naw she didnt tell me but im like right somebody following you and shes like im not bullshim not fooling and she goes it was there yesterday by the field what field the sports field behind the school amy answered that was this last tuesday um yeah did you believe her i guess she looked pretty freaked and she says she told some people about it who i dont know some guys she didnt tell me who oh and she told mr eckhard too hes an english teacher at the middle school and he coaches volleyball after school and on the weekends and he said if he saw it hed go talk to the driver and im like wow this is totally fucktotally weird his names eckhard something like that i dont know how to spell it but if you want to like talk to him theres usually volleyball practice on saturday afternoon only i dont know when volleyballs for losers you know yeah i know tate said it had been the only sport hed played in college you think something like happened to her thats way lame wed just feel a little better knowing where she is listen amy well be around to pick up her book bag in the next couple of hours if you hear from her give us a call i will promise he asked firmly yeah like i promise as soon as tate pushed the end button on betts phone it buzzed again he glanced at her and she nodded for him to answer it he pushed receive hello urn is this megans father a mans voice asked thats right mr mccall actually its collier thats right sure sony this is dr hanson doctor thanks for calling i have to tell you it looks like megans run away there was a pause really tate tried to read the tone he heard concern and surprise we got some well some pretty angry letters from her her mother and i both did and then she vanished is there any way we can see you im in leesburg now my mothers had an accident im sorry to hear that but if bett and i drove up could you spare a half hour well its important doctor were really concerned about her i suppose so all right he gave them directions to the hospital tate looked at his watch it was noon well be there in an hour or so actually hanson said slowly i think we should talk there were some things she told me that you ought to know what tate asked i want to think about them a little more there are some confidentiality issues but its funnyid expect any number of things from megan but running away no that seems odd to me tate thanked him it was only after hanging up that he felt a disturbing twist in his belly what were the any number of things megan was capable of and were they any worse than her running away his precious cargo was in the trunk but while aaron matthews would have liked to meditate on megan mccall and on what lay ahead for both of them he was instead growing increasingly anxious the fucking white cat he was cruising down i hed planned to stop at the house hed rented last year in prince william county only two or three miles from tate colliers farmand pick up some things he wanted to take with him to the mountains but he couldnt risk leading anyone to that house and this car was just not going away it was raining again a gray drizzle in the mist and rain he couldnt see the driver clearly though he was now certain he was young and black and because he followed matthews so carelessly and obviously he sure wasnt a cop but who then matthews remembered megan had a black boyfriend josh or joshua wasnt it the boy that dr hanson had suggested she leaveif megan had been telling the truth about that bit of advice which he suspected she might not have been what was going through the young mans mind as a scientist matthews believed in logic the only time people acted illogicallyeven psychoticswas when they were having seizures we might not be able to perceive the logic they operated by and their actions might be illogical to rational observers hilt that was only because they were not being empathetic once we climb into the minds of our patients he wrote in his wellreceived essay on delusional behavior in bipolars once we understand their fears and desirestheir own internal system of logicthen we can begin to understand their motives the reasons behind their actions and we can help them change so what was this young man thinking maybe megan had planned to meet him at the office after the appointment maybe hed just happened to see her car being driven by a man he didnt recognize and followed it or maybethis accorded with matthewss perceptions on the frighteningly powerful dynamics of lovehed been waiting at the office to confront the doctor about the breakup maybe even attack him thanks for that dr hanson he thought acerbically should have broken your hip not moms rage shook him for a moment then he calmed did the boy have a car phone had he called the police and reported the mercedess license number it was a stolen plate but the number didnt belong to a gray mercedes and that discrepancy would be reason enough for the cops to pull him over and look in the trunk but no of course he hadnt called the cops theyd be after him by now if he had but what if hed called her parents what did tate collier know matthews brooded what was the man thinking what was he planning to do matthews sped on until he came to a rest stop then he pulled suddenly into the long driveway weaving slowly through the tractor trailers and fourbyfours filled with vacationers he noticed that the white toyota had made a panicked exit and was pulling into the rest stop after him fortunately the rain was heavy again which gave matthews the excuse to hold an obscuring washington post over his head as he ran to the shelter they were trotting through the rain to tates black lexus when his cell phone buzzed as they dropped into the front seats he answered hello tate collier please a mans voice speaking mr collier im special agent william mccomb with the fbis child exploitation and kidnapping unit weve just received an interagency notice about your daughter im glad you called im sorry about your girl the agent said speaking in the chunky monotone tate knew so well from working with the feds unfortunately i have to say sir based on the facts weve got theres not a lot we can do but you made some friends here when you were a commonwealths attorney and so were going to open a file and put her name out on our network that means therell be a lot more eyes looking for her anything you can do will really be appreciated my wife and i are pretty upset i can imagine the agent said registering a splinter of emotion could you give me some basics about her and the disappearance tate ran through the physical details bett helping on the specifics blond blue eyes five six pounds age seventeen then he told mccomb about the letters tate asked you heard about her car urn no sir the fairfax county police found it at vienna metro it looks like she went to manhattan really no i didnt hear that well well tell our office in new york about it but do i hear something in your voice sir are you thinking that maybe she didnt run away are you thinking there was some foul play tate had to smile hed never thought of himselfespecially his speechas transparent as a matter of fact weve been having some doubts my wife and i interesting mccomb said in a wooden monotone what specifically leads you to believe that a few things megans mother and i are on our way to leesburg right now to talk to her therapist see what he can tell us hes in leesburg his mothers in st marys hospital she had an accident and you think he might be able to tell you something he said he wanted to talk to us i dont know what hes got in mind any other thoughts well megan told her girlfriend that there was a car following her over the past few weeks car hm they get any description her girlfriend didnt but we think a teacher at her school did eckhards his name hes supposed to be at the school later coaching volleyball but id guess thats only if the rain breaks up and whats her friends name he gave the agent amy walkers name were going to talk to her too and pick up megans book bag from her were hoping it might have something in it thatll give us a clue where shes gone i see does megan have any siblings no is there anyone else whos had much contact with the girl well my wifes fiancé silence for a moment oh youre divorced thats right forgot to mention it you have his name and number mccomb asked tate asked bett who gave him the information into the phone he said his names brad markham he lives in baltimore tate gave him brads phone number as well do you think he was involved in any way the agent asked tate ive never met him but no im sure not okay you working with anyone particular at the fairfax county police konnie thatd be dimitri konstantinatis out of which office fair oaks very good sir you know nearly all runaways return on their own and most of the ones that dont get picked up and sent back home a little counseling some family therapy and things generally work out just fine thanks for your thoughts appreciate it oh one thing mr collier i guess you know about the law about how it could be lets say troublesome for you to take matters into your own hands here i do bad for everybody understood okay then enough said appreciate that too im just going to be asking a few questions good luck to both of you they hung up and he told bett what the agent had said her face was troubled what is it he felt an urge to append a honey but nipped that one fast just that it seems so much more serious with the fbi involved how foolish people are how trusting how their defenses crumble like sand when they believe theyre talking to a friend and oh how they want to believe that you are a friend why if wild animals were as trusting as human beings theyd have gone extinct ages ago aaron matthews no longer portraying the stonyvoiced fbi agent protector of children hung up the phone after speaking with tate collier he almost felt guiltyit had been so easy to draw information out of the man and what information it was oh matthews was angry his mood teetered precariously all his preparationsuch care such finesse everything constructed to paralyze collier and his wife with sorrow and send them home to brood about their lost daughter and what were they doing but playing amateur detectives their talking to hanson could be a real problem megan might have said something about loving her parents and never even considering running away even worse they might become suspicious of matthewss whole plan and have the police go through hansons office hed been careful there but hadnt wore gloves all the time there were fingerprintsand the window latch in the bathroom where matthews had snuck in was still broken then there was amy walker megans friend with a book bag that probably didnt have anything compromising but mightmaybe a diary or those notes teenage girls are always passing around in school and this eckhard the teacher and coach what did he know reports of a car following her much of matthewss reconnaissance had been conducted around the school if the teacher had walked up to the car he might easily have gotten the license number of the mercedes matthews hadnt changed the license plates to the stolen ones until yesterday and even if eckhard didnt think hed seen much there were probably some prickly little facts locked away in the teachers subconscious matthews had done much hypnosis work and knew how many memories and observations were retained in the cobwebby recesses of the mind why the hell was collier doing this why hadnt the letters fooled him he was a fucking lawyer he was supposed to be logical he was supposed to be cold why didnt he believe the bald facts in front of him a dark mood began to settle on matthews but he struggled to throw it off no i have no lime for this now fight it fight it fight it he thought of how many patients hed wanted to grab by the lapels and shake as he shouted oh quit your fucking complaining you dont like her leave she left you find somebody else youre a drunk stop drinking and closing his eyes fiercely clenching his fists until a nail broke through the flesh of his palm he struggled to remain emotionally buoyant after a few minutes he forced the mood away he returned to the phone and called three walkers in fairfax before he got the household that included a teenage amy yes amys my daughter the womans cautious voice said whos this im william mccomb with the county ive gotten a call from child protective services my god whats wrong nothing to be alarmed at mrs walker this doesnt involve your daughter were investigating a case involving megan mccall oh no is megan all right she spent the night here thats what we understand it seems shes missing and weve been looking into some allegations about her father there was a moments pause tate collier matthews prompted oh right i dont know him you think hes involved you think he did something were just looking into a few things now but id appreciate it if youd tell your daughter she shouldnt have any contact with him why would she have any contact with him the edgy voice asked how easily shell cry matthews predicted we dont think thered be any reason for him to hurt or touch her oh god you dont think we just want to make sure amy stays safe until we get to the bottom of what happened to megan happened to megan please tell me whats going on i cant really say any more at this time tell me wheres your daughter now upstairs would you mind if i spoke to her no of course not a moment later a girls lazy voice hello hi amy this is mr mccomb im with the county how are you okay i guess like is megan okay im sure shes fine tell me has megans father talked to you recently urn the girl began you answer the mother said sternly from a second phone yeah like he said shes missing and asked me about her he was going to come by and get her book bag so hes interested in whats in her bag did you get the impression he was concerned with what might be inside like maybe the mother you were going to let him in here and not tell me the girl snapped mom just like cut it out okay its megans dad matthews said sternly amy dont talk to him and whatever you do dont go anywhere with him i if he suggests going away getting into his car going into his barn god his barn her mother gasped yep matthews could hear soft weeping he continued amy if he offers you something to drink another gasp oh my this was fun matthews continued calmly whatever he says tell him no if he comes over dont answer the door make sure its locked like why you dont ask why young lady you do what the man says mom like come on what about her book bag you just hold on to it until you hear from me or someone at child protective services okay i guess should we call the police mrs walker asked no its not a criminal charge yet oh god said amys mother the woman of the limited epithets then amy tell me did megans father ever touch you now tell the truth who megans father mom youre such a loser i never even met him mrs walker yes im here her voice cracked i really dont want to alarm you unnecessarily no no we appreciate your calling whats your number mr mccomb im going to be in the field for a while let me call you later when im back at the office all right matthews felt a cheerful little twinge as he heard her crying though amys silence on the other extension was louder he couldnt resist mrs walker yes do you have a gun a choked sob no we dont i dont ive never i wouldnt know how to use one i guess i could go to sports authority i mean thats all right matthews said soothingly im sure its not going to come to anything like that what if megans mother like calls the girl asked yes mrs walker echoed what if her mother calls a concerned pause id be careful were investigating her too it was a very troubled household it seems god mrs walker muttered matthews hung up what a mess this could become the kidnapping had been so simple in theory but in practice it was growing so complicated just like the art of psychiatry itself he reflected well there were other things to do to protect himself but first things first he had to get megan to her new homewith his son peterdeep in the mountains matthews returned to the mercedes he pulled back onto the highway noting that the white car was still sticking with him like a lamprey to a fish amy wasnt home oh brother tate sighed looked through a window saw nothing walked back to the front door pressed the bell again standing on the concrete stoop of the splitlevel house in suburban burke tate kept his hand on the doorbell for a full minute but neither the girl nor her mother came to the door whered she gone bett had said that theyd stop by soon why hadnt amy stayed home or at least put the book bag out on the front stoop didnt she care about megan was this adolescent friendship nowadays maybe the bells broken bett called from the car but tate pounded on the door with his open palm there was no response amy he called no answer go round back bett suggested tate pushed through two scratchy holly bushes and rapped on the back door still no answer he decided to slip inside and find the bag a missing teenager took precedence over a technical charge of trespass thinking i could make a good argument for an implied license to enter the premises but as he reached for the doorknob he believed he heard a click when he tried to open the latch he found the door was locked he peered through the window and thought he saw some motion but he couldnt be sure tate returned to the car not there he sighed well call later leesburg bett asked lets try that teacher first eckhard it was only a fiveminute drive to the school the rain had stopped and youngsters were gathering on the school yardboys for baseball girls for volleyball both sexes for soccer hacky sacks frisbees skateboards abounded after speaking with several parents and students they learned that robert eckhard the volleyball coach had put together a practice for three that afternoon it was now a quarter to two tate flopped down into the passenger seat of the lexus he stretched this police work i dont see how konnie does it bett kicked her shoes off and massaged her feet wish id worn comfy boots like you then she glanced toward the school look she said when theyd been married bett assumed that he knew exactly what she was thinking or talking about shed often communicate with a cryptic phrase a gesture of her finger an eyebrow raised like a witch casting a spell and tate would have no clue as to her meaning today though he turned his head toward where she was looking and saw the two blueuniformed security guards standing in one of the back doorways of the school good idea he said and they drove around to the door by the time they got there the guards had gone inside bett and tate parked and walked inside the school the halls had that smell of all high schoolssweat lab gas disinfectant paste tate laughed to himself at the instinctive uneasiness he felt being here class work had come easily to him but hed spent his hours and effort on debate club and the teachers were forever booting him into detention hall for skipped classes or missing homework that he would pause at the door on the way out of class and resonantly quote cicero or john calhoun to his teacher didnt help his academic record any of course the security offices in megans school were small cubicles of carpeted partitions near the gym one guard a crewcut boy with halfmast eyelids wearing a perfectly pressed uniform listened unemotionally to tates story he adjusted his glistening black billy club dont know your daughter he turned called out henry you know a megan mccall nope said his partner who resembled him to an eerie degree he stepped into the school proper and disappeared what were concerned about is this car a man seemed to be following her a car following her the young man was skeptical bett took over around the school yard this past week tate we were wondering if anybody mightve reported it the mans face eased into that putupon look security guards are very good at maybe theyre resentful that theyre not fullfledged cops and could carry guns and use them are the police involved the man asked somewhat hm trying to figure that one out what happens if somebody sees something unusual is there any procedure for that the buster book the guard said bett asked the uh buster hes a dog i mean a cartoon dog but its like bust as in get busted arrested then a dash then er if the kids see something suspicious they come tell us and we write it down in the buster book and then theres a record of it for the police if anything you know happens tate recalled what amyd said it was on tuesday out in the parking lot by the sports field could you take a look oh we cant let you see it the guard said im sorry parents dont have you know access to it only the administration and police thats the rule thats it right there the guard turned around and glanced at the blue binder with the words buster on the spine and a cartoon effigy of a dog wearing a sherlock holmes deerstalker hat yes sir if you dont mind see our daughters missing as i was saying could you take a look just have the police give us a call well shes not officially a missing person i dont have any leeway sir you understand the guards lean face crinkled his still eyes looked tate up and down and his muscular hand caressed his ebony billy club he was everything tate hated about northern virginia snide and sullen this young man would see nothing wrong with a tap on the wifes chin or a belt on his kids butts to keep the family in line he was master of the house everyone did as he commanded and never ask his opinion about the mideastern and asian immigrants settling in fairfax because hell tell you in no uncertain terms tate looked at bett her eyebrows were raised as if she were asking why was tate hesitating after all he was the silvertongued devil he could talk anybody into anything resolved the watergate breakin was justifiable as a means to a valid end lifelong democrat grandson of a lifelong democrat tate had leapt at the chance to take the pro side of the debate and argue that irreverent positionfor the pure joy of going up against overwhelming odds hed won to the judges shock and lasting amusement officer tate began thinking of the rhetorical tricks in his arsenal the logic the skills at persuasion ratiocination he paused then walked to the door and motioned the guard to follow the lean man walked slowly enough to let tate know that nobody on earth was going to make him do a single thing he didnt want to do tate standing in the doorway looked out over the school yard what do you see there the guard hesitated uncertainly hed be thinking what kinda questions that i see trees i see cars i see fences i see clouds tate waited just the right amount of time and said i see a lot of young people um well what the hell elsere you gonna see on a school yard and those young people rely on us adults for everything they rely on us for food for shelter for schooling and you know what else video games running shoes legos whats this clown up to they rely on us for their safety thats what youre doing here right its the reason they hired a big strong guy like you a man whos got balls whos not afraid to mix it up with somebody i dunno i guess well my daughters relying on me for her safety she needs me to find out where she is maybe shes in trouble maybe she isnt hey lets take an example you see some tough big kids talking to a little kid maybe theyre just buddies fooling around or maybe theyre trying to sell him some pot or steal his lunch money youd go and find out right i would sure thats all im doing with my daughter trying to find out if shes okay and going through that book would sure be a big help the guard nodded well tate asked expectantly rules is rules cant be done have a state trooper or a county officer stop by ill be happy to help tate sighed he glanced at bett who said icily lets go tate nothing more to be accomplished here as they walked toward the car the guard called sir tate turned that was a good try though kids and safety and everything i almost bought it he picked up a magazine on customized pickup trucks and sat down tate and bett continued to the car then climbed in and drove out of the lot neither of them could contain the laughter for long they both roared finally bett gasped and said that was the biggest load of hogwash i ever heard its the reason they hired a big strong guy like you you sounded like you were trying to pick him up wiping tears from his eyes tate controlled his laughing that was some pretty good doubleteaming bett reached under her blouse and pulled out the twenty or thirty sheets of notebook paper shed ripped from the buster book while tate had distracted the guard with his absurd argument i figured i better leave the notebook itself she muttered the buster book the buster book do people really take that stuff seriously tate drove about three blocks and pulled over to the curb okay she said tuesday tuesday flipping through the pages if the storm trooper back theres the one who keeps the book hes got handwriting like a sissy okay tuesday she nodded then read two students reported a gray car no school parking permit parked on sideburn road single driver drove off without picking up student a gray car not much to go on anything else not then but amy said megand been thinking shed been followed for a while bett flipped back through the pages her perfect eyebrow rose in a delicate arc listen a week ago m mccall green teamthats her class section at schoolreported gray car appeared to be following her security guard gibson took report did not personally witness incident checked but no car seen subject did not know tag or make of vehicle bett looked at her exhusband why didnt she tell me about it tate why tate shrugged he asked any description of the driver none no what kind of car did her boyfriend drive white i think a toyota he couldve borrowed one to follow her tate mused could have sure more questions than answers tate stared at the turbulent clouds overhead the sun tried to break through but a line of thick gray rolled over the sky heading eastward well come back and talk to eckhard later he said lets go to leesburg joshua lefevre glanced down at the odometer hed driven another twenty miles along i in his battered old toyota since the last time hed checked which put him about seventy miles from fairfax mr tibbs the unflappable police detective within him had finally figured out where megan and her therapist lover were going to the doctors mountain place it was now chic for professionals to have vacation homes in the blue ridge or in west virginia where you could buy a whole mountaintop for a song the rain had stopped and he cranked the sunroof open listening to the wind hissing through the yakima bike rack on the roof it was early afternoon when he broke through the shenandoahs and saw the hazy blue ridge in front of him the rolling hills were not evocative gunmetal today the literature major in him thought but were tinted with the green frost of spring growth recalling that he and megan had talked about a bike tour along skyline drive which crested the ridge later in the spring without the rain lefevre could see more clearly now and he realized that only the doctor was visible in the car where was megan taking a nap wait was her head resting in his lap he was considering this appalling thought distracted and angry when the mercedes got away from him never would have happened to sidney poitier damn the merce had pulled out to pass a semi and hed followed but as soon as the big gray car had cleared the cab of the truck the doctor had steered hard to the right and pulled onto the exit ramp as the truck driver laid on his air horn and braked lefevres toyota was caught in the left lane and he couldnt swerve back in time to make the exit his head swiveled and he saw the roof of the mercedes sink below the level of the highway as it slowed on the ramp lefevre slammed his fists on the wheel tantrums were definitely not poitiers style but he couldnt help it he thought about making an illegal u over the median but he was a black kid with knobby dreads driving through the crucible of the confederacy the fewer laws he broke the better the next exit was a mile down the highway and by the time hed followed the mobius strip of ramps and returned to the exit the mercedes had taken there was no sign of the big caronly an intersection of three different country roads any one of which they might have taken and now that he thought about it the doctor might just have stopped for gas and gotten back on to the interstate continuing west he closed his eyes in frustration and pressed back hard into the headrest metal snapped what the hellm i doing here the stuff love makes you do he thought hate it hate it hate it lefevre pulled into the gas station filled up at the selfservice island then walked up to the skinny sullen attendant with long hair sprouting from under a valvoline giveaway cap which was as greasy as his brown strands how you doing sidney poitier asked very politely okay yourself the man muttered not bad not bad the man stared at lefevres hair which was not exactly modeled on mr poitiers circa but was much closer to a rap stars helpya it occurred to lefevre that even officer tibbs in suit tie and polished oxfords wouldnt get a lot of cooperation from a guy like this by asking which way a seventythousanddollar automobile had just gone at least not without some incentive lefevre opened his wallet and extracted five twenties looked down at them so did the attendant thats cash yes it is you charged your gas i seen you i did well whatsitfor the grimy hair swung as he nodded at the money its for you lefevre said in his most carefully crafted queens english uhhuh uhhuh whys it for me the man seemed to sneer i have a little problem the stubbly face asked who cares i was driving down sixtysix and this mercedes cut me off ran me off the road nearly killed me this had happened to sidney poitier in in the heat of the night more or less did it on purpose the driver i mean dont say the man yawned front ends all screwed up now and see what kind of bodywork ill need thank goodness lefevre thought hed never fixed the damage after hed scraped the side of the car on a barricade when hed dropped his mother off at neiman marcus in tysons corner last month the attendant looked at the car without a splinter of interest so you want me to look at the front end no i want the license number of that mercedes he came by here five ten minutes ago i was hoping he stopped here for gas this had seemed like a good way to break the iceasking for the license number it made things officialas if the police were going to get involved lefevre believed this trick was definitely something that sidney poitier would do whyd he run you off the road the man asked abruptly which brought lefevre up cold well i dont know lefevre shrugged then he asked you know which car i mean he remained respectful but asked this firmly hed decided not to be too polite sidney poitier had glared at rod steiger quite a bit maybe so he stopped here for gas nope the scrawny guy looked at the money then he shook his head his slick grin gave lefevre an unpleasant glimpse of bad teeth fuck whyre you bullshittin me you dont want that tag number um i what you want is to find out where that sumvabitch lives am i right well an ill tell you why you want that why cause he was drivin his big old mercedes and he thunk thimself why heres a black manonly he was thinking the nworddriving a little shit jap car and i can cut him off cause he dont mean shit to me and he dont got the balls to complain to nobody bout it a faint laugh and you dont want no tag number for state farm insurance or the poleece fuck you wanna find him and you wanna beat the shiny crap outta him so end of story well it was a nice try lefevre was about to put the money away and return to his carbefore the man called some reallife rod steigerswhen the attendant shook his head and said god bless you im sorry that frosts me what he done truly does im sorry lefevre repeated i mean i got friendsre black couple of em and we have a good time together and one of ems wife cooks for me and my girlfriend nearly every week well is that right fuck yeah thats right the twenties were suddenly in the mans stained fingers i say more power to you find him and wail on him all you want i know that sumvabitch the man in the mercedes yeah dr hanson right i dont know his name but i seen him off and on for a spell he comes and goes never stops hereprobably thinks my gas aint good enoughbut i seen him pisses me off royal people like him moving everybody down the mountain what do you mean moving down the mountain sidney poitier asked politely smiling now and giving the man plenty of thinking room see what happened was when folk settled here they moved to the top of the ridge naturally where else thats the best part but they couldnt keep the land most of em money troubles you know taxes so they kept selling to the government for the park or to rich folks wanted a weekend place and families kept moving down the mountain now most everybodys in the valleymost of the honest folk i mean pretty soon there wont be no mountains left cept for the rich pricks and the government s what my dad says makes sense to me wheres his place the skinny young man nodded toward one narrow road thats the way he goes but i dont know where exactly his house is only place i know of up theres the hospital been for sale for years he probably bought it ands gonna put a big fancy house on the land what hospital loony bin closed a while ago how far is it five miles giver take at the end of palmer road yonder he pointed now you aint going to kill him are you id have some problems with that no i really do just want to talk uhhuh uhhuh the man squinted then offered his badtooth grin again you know you remind me of that actor i do yeah hes a good one dont exactly look like him but you sorta hold yourself the same whats his name whats his name lefevre grinning himself answered his question the man blinked and shook his head who the hells sidney poitier lefevre said maybe he was before your time whats that guys name i can picture him kicked the shit out of some ninjas in this movie with sean connery wait snipes wesley snipes thats it that man can act lefevre walked to the edge of the tarmac the smell of gasoline mixed with the scent of spring growth and clayish earth palmer road vanished into a dark shaft of pine and hemlock winding up into the mountains the young attendant stuffed a strand of slick hair up under his hat you stay away from that hospital i wouldnt go there for any money hear stories about it people sometimes get attacked by wild dogs or something or something kids find bloody bones sometimes probably deer or boar but maybe not lefevres anger was turning to concern megan whatve you gotten yourself into i just follow that road right five miles id guess keeps to the high ground then circles back on itself like a snake a snake lefevre said absently staring into the murky forest thinking of the quote from dantes divine comedy halfway through lifes journey i came to myself in a dark wood where the straight way was lost recalling the story too the authors guided tour of hell listen the attendant said startling him you stop on your way back okay let me know what happens lefevre nodded and shook the mans oily hand he climbed into his car and sped along palmer road in an instant civilization vanished behind him and the world became black bark shadows and the waving arms of tattered boughs the things we do for love lefevre thought the things we do for love aaron matthews pulled the mercedes into a grove of frees beside the asphalt and climbed out looking back over palmer road no sign of the white car he was sure hed tricked the boyfriend just fine when hed sped off the highway beside the truck the kid was probably in west virginia by now and even if he managed to figure out which exit theyd taken and backtracked hed have no way of knowing which way matthews had gone into the maze of back roads here although matthews had been coming to the deserted hospital for the past year ever since hed brought his son here hed made a point of never stopping for gas or food at the service station or grocery store near the exit ramp off i he was sure the local hicks knew nothing about him he climbed back in the car and continued on to the blue ridge mental health facility just past the cleft where the road passed between two steep vinecovered hills the ground opened into the shallow bowl of a valley through a picket line of scab by trees a sprawl of low decrepit buildings was visible brmhf had been the last destination for the hardcore crazies in the commonwealth of virginia schizophrenics uncontrollable bipolars borderline personalities delusionals souls lost forever security was highthe patients that is inmates were locked down at night in secure quarters padded cells the eightfoot chainlink fence enclosing the tenacre grounds was designed to provide comforting boundaries to patients and nearby residents alike it sported a live current of volts the hospital had served its purpose well until two years ago when it had been closed down by the state and the patients were shipped to other facilities and halfway houses brmhf was soon overgrown with foliage and the place was forgotten dr aaron matthews was intimately familiar with the hospital the patients here had found him a confidant confessor judge a virtual father over the course of nearly four years when he thought of home he thought first of this hospital and second of the colonial house in arlington virginia hed lived in with margaret and their son peter matthews now braked the mercedes to a halt and examined the place carefully for signs of intruders though a breakin would have been very unlikely the current to the fence had been shut off long ago but the chain link was intact and the grounds were patrolled by five knobheaded rottweilers as raw and brutal as dogs could be teeth sharp as obsidian they hunted in packs and once or twice a week killed one of the deer that often strolled through the gate when it was open he listened carefully againno sound of approaching carsand unlocked the two tempered steel locks securing the gate he drove inside and parked then he lifted megan from the trunk and carried her inside pushing through a door with his shoulder hed reversed the locks on the doorsyou could simply push in from the outside but couldnt get back out without a key he stepped into the lobby asylums smell far more visceral than do regular hospitals because even though their province is the mind the byproduct of mental pathology is piss shit sweat blood this was still true of the blue ridge facility years after its closing the air stank of bodily functions and decay through these murky halls matthews carried his prize in his arms feeling every ounce of her weightthough it wasnt the weight of a burden it was the weight of treasure a golden or platinum artifact solid and perfect matthews carried megan into the room hed fixed up for her he laid her on the bed and undressed her first the blouse and the bra then jeans and panties and socks his eyes coursed up and down her body yet he touched her only onceto make sure her pulse was regular taking her clothes he left the room locked her door with a heavy padlock he thought about stopping to see his son but the boy was in a different part of the hospital and matthews had no time for a visit now tate collier still troubled him he left the building got into his car and started through the gate hed driven only ten feet before he heard the thumpthumpthump of the flat tire oh not now his mood suddenly darkened and he fought once more to keep the blackness at bay he thought of megan it buoyed him just enough to keep him functional matthews climbed out and walked to the rear of the car he took one look at the slash mark in the michelin and leapt toward the drivers door to get to the pistol in his glove compartment too late dont move the young man held the rusty machete left over from the groundskeeping matthews had done when hed brought his son here he gripped the long knife awkwardly but with enough manic determination to make matthews freeze and raise his hands the boys muscles were huge he blurted ill give you my wallet and theres i want to know whats going on the young mans voice was astonishing what a beautiful patois carolinian and caribbean and some succulent english which tempered the two this man could fuck any woman he wanted simply by telling her she was beautiful dont hurt me matthews said desperately a flicker of uncertainty in the brown eyes whatve you done with megan matthews frowned who are you ah young man asked the silent therapist within matthews youre not a fighter at all are you youre out of your element brandishing that knife like a squash racket and why do you feel so guilty why do you feel so unsure the pistol was in the glove compartment only feet away but his assailant was riding on pure nerves with his strength it wouldnt take much for the boy to injure matthews seriously without even trying besides while he believed the young man wasnt dangerous matthews had learned that premature diagnoses can be very risky he smiled and lowered his hands he nodded knowingly wait wait youre not you must be joshua the boys face squirreled up into a frown you know me sure i know you matthews said smoothly i was hoping wed get a chance to talk you startled me said the soothing voice of aaron matthews i didnt mean to react the way i did he glanced at the tire laughed but then again you did attack my mercedes with a machete with his voice trembling love that voice love it the boy said i thought youd just brought her here on a date to show her some of your property or something then i saw you carry her inside what the hells going on tell me wait carry who inside matthews frowned show her some of your property megan i saw you two so hes thinking real estate development matthews shook his head glanced toward the hospital you mean just a few minutes ago well i carried in some bags of cleaning supplies and a tarp i bought this place and im turning it into condos a minuscule lessening of his suspicion not believing your own eyes are you how often we dont also in his face was a suspicion that the young man himself had made a stupid error here you dont do well with embarrassment do you a gift from the africanamerican executive mom id say the one with practiced elocution and the chanel scarf over her shoulder and the defensive eyes matthews noted however that the boy continued to hold the rusty blade firmly in his hand where is she what were you doing with her car joshua matthews said patiently i just dropped megan off at my weekend place up the road he pointed into the woods a couple miles from here she wanted to get a head start on making lunch whyd you switch cars at the metro megans got a friend amy he paused joshua said i know amy amys borrowing her car we left it at the metro for her and took the mercedes the boy frowned i didnt think amy had a license matthews laughed oh she didnt share that with us i wondered why she didnt want us to drop it off at her house good matthews told himself giving his performance high marks but wait i didnt see megan in your car when i was behind you you were following us now a frownat the boys odd behavior yes i was following you how did you think i found you i assumed that megan told you about me and that we come up here sometimes joshua blinked matthews studied the young man for a moment then tilted his head and said with sympathy look joshua dont do this to yourself do what oh the desperation matthews could see in the olive eyes was so sweet he nearly shivered with pleasure he whispered you should forget about her but i love her forget about her for your own good matthews realized hed been right the man had probably arrived at hansons office toward the end of the session planning to confront meganand presumably the doctor tooabout hansons advice on breaking up a little obsessivecompulsive are we or just too much testosterone in the blood if it werent for romance we poor psychiatrists would have nothing to do as freud said more or less loves a bitch aint it you talked her into breaking up with me so you could see her joshua said megan said that he snapped well its not true thats completely unethical and id never do it joshua blinked at the vehemence in matthewss voice the therapist had deduced that the boy would be a rulesandregulations victim thanks to the other parent of coursedad the soldier the therapist continued she decided to break up with you on her own joshua and then we started going out thats not what she said she said you told her to break up with me no joshua thats not the way it was at all but she told me well we cant blame her for not being completely honest all the time now can we blame her see megan has trouble taking responsibility for certain things not unusual not a serious problem we all suffer from it to varying degrees its hard for her to express her inner feelings given her parents you know tate and bett hearing the names the familiarity in matthewss voice the boys defenses slipped a bit more but he was still dangerous too confused too much in love riding on too much emotion matthews decided he couldnt win the boys confidence hed have to go in a different direction ive met her mother not her father joshua said well believe me theyre to thank for a lot of her problems her lying for instance and the way shed lose her temper sometimes it could be bad couldnt it a couple of times but who doesnt blow off steam the question told matthews that the boy was buying the argument he laughed joshua put that thing down and go home forget about megan this is only going to mean heartache for you i love her he was nearly in tears by now matthews had pegged the boy the way a geologist recognizes pyrite an underachiever terrified of his parents military dad supermother cutting a swath through america online or trw a couple who probably wereto use megans tired adjectivegreat people and so joshua wouldnt let himself be angry with them but the anger was there inside him it had to be but where lets find out joshua you dont understand you then tell me its not appropriate joshua persisted tell me what is going on matthewss eyes went wide as if he were losing his temper he said all right you want to know the truth yes matthews started to speak then shook his head as if he were struggling to control himself no no you dont yes i do the boy stepped forward menacingly all right but dont blame me the truth is megan didnt like you the young mans face froze into a glossy ebony mask thats not true matthewss mouth grew tight she told me that the first night we slept together joshua gasped youre lying you dont think were lovers matthews asked viciously as befit a man no longer fearful but angry no i dont well then how do i know about that birthmark just below her left nipple joshua couldnt hold matthewss cold eyes and he looked down at the moss covering a fallen tree his hands were shaking what do we think of her pubic hair a bit sparse and what does she like in bed she likes men to go down on her all night long and she loves to get fucked in the ass but not by you apparently matthews observed noting the young mans shocked face stop it during our first session she asked me how she could get rid of you no yes matthews spat out you know what she called you the white nigger the eyes glazed over in pain as the scalpel of these words incised the young mans soul shed never say that you were the big minority experiment she wanted a black man to fuck but somebody who wasnt too black of course she thought youd be a good compromise about as white as they come but then she decided shed got herself a clunker she told me she had to drink a half bottle of southern comfort just so she could kiss you no she and amyd stay up all night making fun of you megan does a great impression of you shes got you down cold go to hell joshua you asked for this matthews shouted you pushed me so youre going to hear the truth whether you want it or not she wanted your pathetic face out of her life white nigger you were a toy she told me again this morning when we were fucking on the desk in my office the boy erupted and while matthewss words might have driven someone else to act ruthlessly and efficiently it drove joshua manically forward toward matthews out of control he dropped the machete and flailed away with his fists she never said that he cried she never said that never said that never said that matthews fell to the ground covering his head with his left arm and when he rose a moment later he was holding the machete the young man froze matthews studied him for a momentthe boy suddenly realizing that something very bad was going on joshua lowered his arms what are you going to do to me he asked in a soft pathetic whisper matthews tasted the extraordinary voice one last time and stepped forward swinging the machete into joshuas throat the boy gave a gurgling scream and stumbled forward matthews leapt back away from the boys swinging fist and slashed his arm deeply then his leg joshua fell onto his back cradling the gash in his throat matthews plunged the rusty blade into the young mans abdomen but with astonishing strength joshua pushed matthews off twisted away and rose to his knees choking and coughing the blood flowed between the fingers clutching his torn neck as joshua crawled fast like an animal back through the gate toward the hospital matthews didnt bother to pursue him joshua got thirty feet into the field surrounding the hospital before collapsing in a stand of queen annes lace which turned a deep purple under the spray of his blood matthews slowly walked toward him then stopped he heard an animal snarling growing closer he backed quickly away from the quivering body the rottweilers appeared from behind the house they paused stood rigid for a moment then charged forward hungrily matthews stepped out of the gate and swung it closed as the dogs swarmed in a single muscular pack over the body which had looked so strong and impervious moments ago and was now just ragged meat matthews leaned against the bars of the gate enraptured watching the young man die joshua fought hardhe tried to rise and struggled to hit the dogs but it was useless the big male rottie closed his enormous jaws on the back of joshuas neck and began to shake after a moment the body went limp the animals dragged him into the ravine for the feast his body vanished under the mass of snarling bloody mouths matthews quickly changed the mercedess tire and climbed into the car then sped down the rough road hed bury what remained of the boys corpse later he didnt have time now too many things to do he was thinking that this was just like when he was a practicing therapist busy days busy days there were people to see people to talk to im here to change your life forever who is he who megan mccall floated on a dark ocean that one question the only thing in her thoughts she opened her eyes and gripped the thin filthy mattress she lay on the room swayed and bobbed she was dizzy and nauseated her mouth painfully dry her eyes swollen half closed she rolled onto her back and examined the small room there were flaking cushions mounted on all the walls bars on the windows a padded cell and the whole place stank so bad she thought she might puke she sat up briefly trying to find a light there was none the overhead lamp had been removed and the room was dark maybe she suddenly roaring filled her ears her vision dissolved into black grains and she collapsed back on the bed passed out sometime later she opened her eyes again managed to sit up then waited until the dizziness passed and she stumbled into the tiny bathroom the drug hed injected it was still in her system shed have to take it slow megan sat down on the toilet spread her legs and finally worked up the courage to examine herself no tenderness or pain no come he might have groped but he hadnt raped her she sighed in relief then urinated and washed her hands and face in the basin she drank a dozen handfuls of icy water as she stoodcareful careful take your timeshe caught sight of herself in the metal mirror bolted to the wall she gasped pale and haggard blond hair knotted and filthy eyes red and puffy and frightened megan stepped away from the mirror quickly she looked for her clothes nothing she couldnt find anything to wrap herself in no sheets or curtains this started a crying fit she huddled into a ball and sobbed wondering how long shed been unconscious a week a day she wasnt hungry so she guessed it was still saturday maybe sunday at the latest was anyone looking for her did anyone know she was missing her parents of course shed missed the lunch which shed been going to blow off anyway thank god she hadnt called her mother and told her she wasnt coming the way shed planned if that had happened they still wouldnt miss her and amy should have told her where i was going but no crazy megan wouldnt hear of that cm was embarrassed didnt want anybody to know shes been seeing a shrink fuck she shouldve gone to juvie detention after all ten days in jail and itd be over with but megan had to pick the nut doctor who is he she screamed to herself was he the man in that car thatd been following her near school shed started to believe that was her imagination guess not honey crazy megan offers with no sympathy whatsoever standing by the bed megan looked out the barred window into a huge field of tall grass and brush some trees many of them cut down and left to rot she gasped suddenly as a huge dog trotted past the window and stopped staring up at her a bit of bloody flesh dangled from its mouth red like a scrap of steak its eyes were spookytoo humanand it seemed to recognize her then suddenly the dog tensed wheeled and vanished she examined the window the iron bars were thick and the space between them was far too small for her to get through frustrated she pounded her palms against the wall who is he megan strode to the door gripped and pulled it hard it was of course locked tight the tears returned suddenly they fell on her breasts and her nipples contracted painfully from the sobbing and the dank cold of the dismal room who is he why did they make her go to see the doctor if they hadnt this never wouldve happened whatd i do to deserve this nothing i didnt do a thing if her mother was going to fuck nerds in baltimore then for christs sake why didnt she call me just a threeminute phone call sorry honey im going to be late call dominos and use the charge card have amy over and all right even brittany too but no boys if her father was going to waste his life chasing bimbettes why couldnt he at least spend more than one weekend a month with her this was their fault her parents i hate you so much i fucking hate you i a sound what was it a scuttling it came from the ceiling looking up she saw a number of dark clusters where the wall met the ceiling she moved closer spiders two huge black ones and one had just given birtha hundred hundred tiny dots of infants flowed down the wall like black water megan shivered overwhelmed with disgust her skin crawling at the sight she raced toward the door slamming into it with all her weight and collapsed onto the splintery floor she crawled along it pushing at the baseboards trying to find a weak spot nothing she pulled a wad of toilet paper off the roll hesitated then crushed the spiders with it megan flushed the messy shroud and curled up in a ball on the cold floor cried for five minutes whats that crazy megan asks her alter ego this stopped the tears squick squick that sound again in the ceiling and the walls squirrels she decided then stood and walked to the wall which was made of cinder block how could there be animals in the walls if they were made out of cement then she glanced into the bathroom and squinted those walls were just plasterboard and there was a rectangular plate about twelve by eighteen inches mounted on the wall beside the toilet where did it lead she walked inside crouched down and ran her finger across the edge of the metal which was covered with many layers of paint in the corners she felt one screw head but three holes from which the screws were missing if she could break through the thick paint she might be able to pull the plate up and bend the metal till it snapped but the enamel was thick like glue and with her short nails she couldnt get a grip she thought of her friend brittany with the killer fingernails a regular at a local vietnamese manicure parlor that was what she neededslut claws she searched the bedroom once more but couldnt find anything to use as a tool sighing she returned to the bathroom lay on the floor and slugged the metal plate it resounded hollowly tantalizing with the promise of an empty passageway on the other side but it didnt move a millimeter keep going crazy megan says megan slammed her fist into it again and again until her knuckles began to bruise and swell she turned around and kicked with her heel as the center pushed in slightly a hairline crack formed around the edge and she kicked harder her foot felt as if it were going to shatter go cm encourages go for it megan spun round and tried again to grab the side of the plate but her nails just werent long enough to get a purchase in the crack and she howled in frustration then lunged forward bared her teeth and shoved her face against the wall trying to dig her incisors into the crack her gum tore open on the rough paint and plaster her jaw exploded with cramping pain and she tasted blood then suddenly with a snap her front teeth slipped into the crack and pulled the plate away from the wall a fraction of an inch megan pressed her hands to her face to ease the pain then she spit blood grabbed the plate and yanked so furiously it gave way at once ripping the remaining screw from the wall she fell backward jesus crazy megan says respectfully good job with a gasp of joy she sat up seeing faint light through the hole she shoved her head into the opening looking into another room the plate had apparently covered an old heating vent there was a thin grille on the other side about a foot away on her back she guided her leg into the wail and kicked the grille fell clattering to the floor she froze quiet she reminded herself he could be nearby then she started crawling through the opening headfirst her shoulders were broad but she managed to ease them through she had to reach down cramping her arm and cradle her breasts to keep her nipples from scraping on the sharp bottom edge of the vent one inch at a time she forced her way through the vent as she eased through she examined the other room there were bars on these windows too but the door was open she could see a dim corridor beyond the doorway another ten or twelve inches then twelve more until her hips they stopped her cold those fucking hips crazy megan mutters hate em hate em hate em you just couldnt lose those ten pounds could you i dont need any of your crap now okay megan thinks to her alter ego the vent on the other side of the wall was it seemed slightly smaller than the one in her room megan tried wriggling tightening her muscles licking her fingers and swabbing her sides with spit but she still remained stuckhalfway between each room her butt dead center in the wall no way she thought to herself im not getting trapped here a terrible burst of claustrophobia shook through her she fought it down wriggled slightly and moved forward an inch or two before she froze again then she heard the noise squick squick the scuttling of claws in the wall above accompanied by a highpitched twitter oh my god no the squirrels her heart began to pound squick squick right above where she was stuck two of them it sounded like then more gathering where the wall met the ceiling then she looked into the corner of the roomat an animals nest it rustled and a creature appeared staring at her with tiny red eyes oh fuck theyre rats crazy megan blurts megan began to sob the noise of their little feet started coming down the wall she stifled a scream as somethinga bit of insulation or woodfell onto her skin squick squick squick squick walking along the ceiling several of them gathering above her curious maybe hungry hundreds of terrible creatures moving toward her stuck bodycautiously but unstoppably more rats squick twitters and scuttling growing closer still there seemed to be a dozen now two dozen she pictured needlesharp yellow teeth tiny gray tongues closer and closer curious attracted to her smell shed just finished her period a day ago theyd smell the blood theyd head right for it jesus more scuttling oh she closed her eyes and sobbed in terror it seemed that the whole wall was alive with them dozens hundreds of rats converging on her closer closer squick squick squick squicksquicksquick megan slapped her palms against the wall and pushed with all her strength kicking her feet madly then uttering a dentistsdrill squeal one rat dropped squarely onto her she gasped and felt her heart stutter in terror she pounded the wall wriggling furiously the startled animal climbed off and she felt the snaky tail slip in between her legs as he moved back up the wall oh she choked no as she struggled to free herself and scrabbled her feet on the bathroom floor another animal tentatively reached out with a claw and then stepped onto the small of her back the paws gripped softly and began to move a damp whiskered nose tapped on her skin as the creature sniffed along her body her arms cramping she shoved hard her foot caught the edge of the toilet in the bathroom behind her and she pushed herself forward two or three inches it was just enough she was able to wriggle her hips free the rat leapt off her and megan burst into the adjoining room she crawled frantically into the far corner as four rats escaped from the wall and vanished through the open door joined by their friend in the nest she sobbed gasping for breath brushing her palms over her skin frantically to make sure none of them clung to her after five minutes shed calmed slowly she stepped back to the vent and listened squick squick squick more scuttling more twitters she slammed the grille against the vent opening the rest of the rats vanished up the wall an angry hiss sounded from the hole god she found some stacks of newspapers removed the grille wadded up the papers and stuffed them inside the wall to keep the creatures trapped inside she collapsed back on the floor trying to push away the horrible memory of the probing little paws filthy and damp looking into the dim corridor cold and yellow windows barred filthy she happened to glance up at a sign on the wall patients shall be deloused once a week that signa few simple wordsbrought the hopelessness home to her dont worryabout it crazy megan tries to reassure but megan wasnt listening she shivered in fear and disgust and curled up clutching her knees hating this place hating her life her pointless life her stupid superficial friends her sick obsession with janis the grateful dead and all the rest of the cheerful lying fakeass past hating the man whod done this to her whoever he was but most of all hating her parents hating them beyond words the fortyminute drive to leesburg took tate and bett past a few mansions some redneck bungalows some new developments with names like windstone and the oaks cars on blocks vegetable stands sellingat this time of yearjars of putup preserves and relishes but mostly they passed farmland looking out over justplanted land like this some people see future homes or shopping malls or town houses and some see rows of money to be plucked from the ground at harvest time and some perhaps simply drive past seeing nothing but where their particular journey is taking them but tate collier saw in these fields what he felt in his own farmlanda quiet salvation something he did yet not of his doing something that would let him survive if not prosper graciously the silence of rooted growth and if at times that process betrayed himhail drought tumbling marketstate could still sleep content in the assurance that there was no malice in the earths heart and that the former criminal prosecutor within him figured was no small thing so even though tate claimed as any true advocate would that it made no never mind to him whether he was representing the plaintiffs or defendants in the liberty park case say his heart was in fact with the people who wanted to protect the farmland from the roller coasters and concession stands and traffic he felt this even more now seeing these rolling hills and he felt too guilt and a pang of impatience that he was distracted from his preparations for the liberty park hearing but a look at betts troubled face put this discomfort aside thered be time to hone his argument right now there were other priorities they passed the oatlands farm and as they did the sun came out and he sped on toward leesburg into old virginia confederate virginia there werent many towns like this in the northern part of the state most people in richmond and charlottesville didnt really consider most of northern virginia to be in the commonwealth at all tate and bert drove through the city limits and slowed to the posted thirty miles per hour examining the trim yards the white clapboard houses the incongruous biker bar in the middle of downtown the plentiful churches they followed the directions tate had been given to the hospital where dr hanson was visiting his mother can he tell us much bert wondered legally i mean shed be thinking he guessed of the patientdoctor privilege which allowed a doctor to keep secret the conversations between a patient and his physician years ago when theyd been married tate had explained this and other nuances of the law to her but she often grew offended at these arcane rules you mean if you dont read him his rights the arrest is no good even if he did it shed ask perplexed or excuse me but why should a mother go to jail if shes shoplifting food for her hungry child i dont get it he expected that same indignation now when he explained that hanson didnt have to say anything to them but bett just nodded accepting the rules she smiled coyly and said then i guess youll have to be extra persuasive they turned the corner and the whiteframe hospital loomed ahead of them well busy day bert said assessing the front of the hospital as she flipped up the cars mirror after refreshing her lipstick there were three police cars parked in front of the main entrance the red and white lights atop one of them flashed with urgent brilliance car wreck bett suggested route which led into town was posted fiftyfive but everybody drove it at seventy or eighty they parked and walked inside something was wrong tate noted something serious had happened several nurses and orderlies stood in the lobby looking down a corridor their faces were troubled a receptionist leaned over the main desk gazing down the same corridor what is it bett whispered not a clue tate answered look there he is somebody said god someone else muttered two policemen were leading a tall balding man down the corridor toward the main entrance his hands were cuffed behind him his face was red hed been crying as he passed tate heard him say i didnt do it i wouldnt do it i wasnt even there several of the nurses shook their heads eyeing him with cold expressions on their faces i didnt do it he shouted a moment later he was in a squad car it made a uturn in the driveway and sped off tate asked the receptionist whats that all about the whitehaired woman shook her head eyes wide cheeks pale speaking in tongues we nearly had an assisted suicide she was very shaken i dont believe it what happened we have a patientan elderly woman with a broken hip and it looks like heshe nodded toward where the police car had been comes in and talks to her for a while and next thing we know shes got a syringe in her hands ands trying to kill herself can you imagine can you just imagine but they saved her tate asked the lord was watching over her bett blinked im sorry the receptionist continued a nurse just happened by my goodness can you imagine bett shook her head very troubled tate recalled that she felt the same about euthanasia as she did about the death penalty he thought briefly of her sisters husbands death harris hed used a shotgun to kill himself like hemingway harris had been an artista bad one in tates estimationand hed shot himself in his studio his dark blood covering a canvas that hed been working on for months absently he asked the receptionist that man who is he somebody like kevorkian who is he the woman blurted why he was the poor womans son tate and bett looked at each other in shock she said in a whisper oh no it couldnt be tate asked the woman the patient was her name hanson yes thats the name shaking her head her own son tried to talk her into killing herself and i heard he was a therapist too a doctor can you imagine tate and bert sat in the hospital cafeteria brooding silence between them theyd ordered coffee that neither wanted they were waiting for a call from konnie konstantinatis whom tate had called ten minutes agothough the wait seemed like hours tates phone buzzed he answered it before it could chirp again lo okay counselor made some calls but this is all unofficial theres still no case got it are you comfortable with that got it konnie go ahead the detective explained that he had called the leesburg police and spoken to a detective there heres what happened this old lady greta hanson fell and broke her hip last week fell down her back stairs serious but not too serious shes eighty you know how it is right okay today shes tanked up on painkillers really out of it and she hears her sonyour dr hansonhears him telling her that it looks like the end of the road they found cancer she only has a few months left yadda yadda yadda the pains gonna be terrible tells her its best to just finish herself off its what everybody wants hes pretty persuasive sounds like leaves her a syringe of nembutal she says shell do it she sticks herself but a nurse finds her in time anyway shes pretty doped up but tells em what happened and the administrator calls the cops they find the son in the gift shop buying a box of candy supposedly for her they collar him he denies it all of course what else is he going to say so end of story and this all happens fifteen minutes before bert and i are going to talk to him about megan its no coincidence konnie come on silence from fairfax konnie you hear me im telling you the facts counselor i dont comment otherwise shes sure it was her son who talked to her she said but she was drugged up so maybe it was somebody else talking to her maybe but we can talk to hanson nope not till the arraignment on monday and hes probably not gonna be in any mood even then all right answer me one question can you look up what kind of car he drives who hanson yeah hold on tate heard typing as he filled bett in on what konnied said oh my she said hand rising to her mouth a moment later the detective came back on the line two cars a mazda nine twonine and a ford explorer both this years models what colors mazdas green the explorers black it was somebody else konnie somebody was following megan tate she took the train to new york shes going to see the statue of liberty and hang out in greenwich village and do whatever kids do in new york and you know the buster book what the hell is a buster book the detective grumbled kids at jefferson high are supposed to write down anybody who comes up and offers them drugs or candy or flashes them oh that shit right a friend of megans said thered been a car following her in the buster book some kids reported a gray car parked near the school in the afternoon and megan herself reported it last week gray car right a sigh tate lemme ask you just how many kids go to that school of hers im not saying its a good lead konnie and just how many parents in gray cars pick em up but it is a lead tag number make model year tate sighed nothing look counselor get me at least one of the above and well talk so whatre you thinking somebody snatched her the amtrak schedule is bogus i dont know its just fishy its not a case tate thats the watchword for today look i gotta go one last question konnie does she have cancer hansons mother the detective hesitated no at least its not what theyre treating her for so somebody talked her into believing shes dying talked her into trying to kill herself yeah and that somebody was her son he could have a hundred motives gotta go counselor click he relayed to bett the rest of his conversation with konnie megan was seeing a therapist who tried to kill his mother god i dont know bett he said you saw his face did he look guilty he looked caught she said tate glanced at his watch it was twothirty lets get back to fairfax and find that teacher eckhard crazy megan finally gets a chance to talk listen up girl listen here kiddo biznitch you listening good you need me this is serious youre not sneaking cigarettes in the fair oaks mall parking lot youre not flirting with a george mason junior

megan thought but gm wont have any of her attitude she snaps you hate the world okay what you want a family is what i want megan responded thats all i wanted oh well thats precious her crazy side

contempo casual around here of course i personally would say fuck the clothes find a door and run like hell but thats up to you megan rolled to her feet she stepped into the corridor cold painful her feet stung from kicking the wall she started walking looking around she saw it was a rambling place one story and built of concrete blocks all the windows had thick bars on them with the padded cell she figured it was a mental hospital but she couldnt imagine treating patients here it was totally depressing no one could have gotten better here she found a door leading outside and pushed it it was locked tight the same with two others she looked outside for a car didnt see one in the lot at least she was alone dr peters must have left keep going crazy megan insists but keep going she did the place was huge wing after wing dozens of corridors gloomy wards private rooms twobed rooms but all the doors leading outside were sealed tight and all the windows were barred every damn one of them two large interior doorways had been bricked off sloppily with cinder blocks and sakretemaybe because they led to less restricted wings dozens of the large concrete blocks that hadnt been needed lay scattered on the floor she picked up one and slammed it into a barred window it didnt even bend the metal rods for several hours she made a circuit of the hospital moving quietly she was careful in the dim light she could make out footprints hundreds of them she couldnt tell if theyd been left by dr peters alone or by him and someone else but she was all too aware that she might not be alone by the time shed made it back to her cell she hadnt found a single door or window that looked promising shit no way out okay crazy megan offers chipper as ever at least find something you can use to nail his ass with what do you mean a weapon bitch what do you think megan remembered seeing a kitchen and returned there she started going through drawers and cupboards but there wasnt anything she could use there were no metal knives or forks not even dinner knives only hundreds of packages of plastic utensils no glasses or ceramic cups everything was paper or styrofoam she pulled open a door it was a pantry full of food she started to close the door but stopped looked inside again there was enough food for a family to live on for a year cheerios condensed milk diet pepsi doritos lays potato chips tuna hostess cupcakes cupasoup chef boyardee whats funny here jesus crazy megan catches on first megans hand rose to her mouth as she too understood and she started to cry jesus crazy megan repeats these were exactly the same brands that megan liked this was what her mothers cupboards were stocked with here too were her shampoo conditioner and soap even the type of tampon that megan used hed been in her house he knew what she liked hed bought this all for her dont lose it babes dont but megan ignored her crazy side and gave in to the crying thinking if a family of four could live on this for a year just think how long it would last her by herself twenty minutes later megan rose from the floor wiped her face and continued her search it didnt take her long to find the source of the footprints in a far wing of the hospital were two rooms that had been homified as bett would say when shed dress up a coldlooking house to make it warmer and more comfortable one room was an office filled with thousands of books and files and papers an armchair and lamp and desk the other room was a bedroom it smelled stale turned her stomach she looked inside the bed was unmade and the sheets were stained offwhite splotches guysre so disgusting crazy megan offers megan agreed who could argue with that this meant that someone else probably lived heresomeone young she supposed older guys jerked off too but tried to imagine say her father doing it and couldnt way gross thought from cm then she saw the closet oh please she mentally crossed her fingers as she pulled the door open yes it was filled with clothes she pulled on some jeans which were tight around her hips and too long she rolled the cuffs up she found a work shirtwhich was tight too but that didnt matter she felt a hundred percent better there were no shoes but she found a pair of thick black socks for some reason covering her feet gave her more confidence than covering the rest of her body she looked through the closet for a knife or gun but found nothing she returned to the other room rummaged through the desk nothing to use as a weapon except a bic pen she took it anyway then she looked through the rest of the room focusing at first on the bookshelves some books were about psychiatry but most were fantasy novels and science fiction some were pretty weird stacks of comic books too japanese a lot of them megan flipped through several totally icky girls being raped by monsters and gargoyles and aliens xrated she shivered in disgust the name inside the books and on the front of the comic books was pete matthews sometimes hed written peter m it was written very carefully but in big block letters as if he was a young kid megan looked through the files most of them filled with psychological mumbo jumbo she couldnt understand there were also stacks of the american psychiatric association journal articles were marked with yellow postits she noticed theyd been written by a doctor named aaron matthews the boys father she wondered his bio gave long lists of credentials dozens of awards and honorary degrees one newspaper clipping called him the einstein of therapists and reported he can detect and categorize a psychosis from listening to a patients words for three or four minutes a master diagnostician in between two file folders was another clipping megan lifted it to the light it showed dr peters and a young man in his late teens but wait the doctors last name wasnt peters the caption read dr aaron matthews leaves the funeral home after the memorial service for his wife he is accompanied by his son peter matthews the one who wrote those articles so he must have been a doctor here thats how he knew about the hospitaland that it would make a perfect prison megan studied the picture again feeling crawly and scared the doctors son was well just plain weird he was a tall boy lanky with long arms and huge hands he had thick floppy hair that looked dirty and his forehead jutted over his dark eye sockets he had a sick smile on his face leaving his mothers funeral and hes smiling so this was his roomthe sons maybe peterswell matthews kept the boy locked up here a prisoner too her eyes fell to an officiallooking report she read the top page emergency intake evaluation patient peter t matthews presents with symptoms typical of an antisocial and paranoid personality he is not schizophrenic under dsmiii criteria but he has or claims to have delusions more likely these are merely fantasies which in his case are so overpowering that he chooses not to recognize the borderline between his roleplaying and reality these fantasies are generally of a sadoerotic nature with him playing a nonhuman entitystalking and raping females during our sessions peter would sometimes portray these entitiesright down to odd mannerisms and garbled language he was often in character and quite consistent in his roleplaying however there was no evidence of fugue states or multiple personalities he changed personas at his convenience to achieve the greatest stimulation from his fantasies peter is extremely dangerous he must be hospitalized in a secure facility until the determination is made for a course of treatment recommend immediate psychopharmacological intervention stalking rape megan put the report back on the desk she found a notebook peters name was written on this too she read through it in elaborate passages peter described himself as a spaceman oran alien stalking women tying them up raping them she dropped the book tears again then another thought her cell this dr matthews her kidnapper had locked her up not only to keep her from getting out but to keep his son from getting in he was a creak a faint squeal a door closed softly in a far part of the hospital megan shivered in terror move it girl crazy megan cries in a silent voice as panicked as uncrazy megans its him its the son she grabbed a pile of things to take with herseveral of the magazines file folders about the hospital letters anything that might help her figure out who this dr matthews was why hed taken her how she might get out footsteps hes coming hes coming here move it now holding the files and clippings under her arm megan fled out the door she ran down the corridors getting lost once pausing often to listen for footsteps he seemed to be circling her finally she found her way and raced into the room that adjoined hers the rat room she rubbed the grate along the edges of the hole in the wall to widen it she started through and whimpering clawed her way forward five inches six a foot two feet finally she grabbed the toilet in her room and wrenched herself through the hole she replaced the grate on the far side of the wall and then slammed the metal plate into place in her bathroom she ran to the door and pressed her ear against it the footsteps grew closer and closer but peter didnt stop at her door he kept moving maybe he didnt know she was here megan sat on the icy floor with her hands pressing furiously against the plate until they cramped listen c m starts to say maybe you can shut up megan thought furiously and for once crazy megan does what shes told the eyes the eyes tell it all when aaron matthews was practicing psychotherapy he learned to read the eyes they told him so much more than words words are tools and weapons and camouflage and shields but the eyes tell you the truth an hour ago in leesburg hed looked into the glassy groggy eyes of a drugged greta hanson and knew she was a woman with no reserves of strength and so hed leaned close become her son and spun a tale guaranteed to send her to the very angels that she was babbling on and on about its quite a challenge to talk someone into killing herself and hed thoroughly enjoyed playing the game he doubted shed die from the dosage of nembutal hed given her and he doubted that she could find a vein anyway besides it was important for her to remain aliveto blame her son for the kevorkian number poor doe hanson now either in jail or on the run in any case hed be no help as a witness to tate collier now as he strolled along the sidewalk near jefferson high school aaron matthews was looking at another set of eyes robert eckhardsthe teacher whod seen his car as he stalked megan studying the mans eyes matthews was concluding that eckhard might or might not have been a good english teacher but he didnt doubt that he was one hell of a girls volleyball coach the diminutive tweedy man sat with a sports roster on his lap outside the sports field between the grade and high schools wearing a baseball cap and thickframed reading glasses hed bought at safewayhe remembered that eckhard might have seen him near the school in the mercedesmatthews walked slowly past he studied his subject carefully the teacher was a middleaged man in dockers and a loose tan shirt matthews took in all these observations and filed them away but it was the eyes that were most helpful they told him everything he needed to know about mr eckhard continuing down the sidewalk matthews walked into a drugstore and made several purchases he slipped into the rest room of the store and five minutes later returned to the school yard he sat down on the bench next to eckhards and rested the washington post in his lap he gazed out at the young girls playing informal games of soccer or jump rope in the school yard once then twice eckhard glanced at him the second time matthews happened to turn his way and saw the teacher looking at him with a hint of curiosity in his tellall eyes matthewss face went still with uneasy alarm he waited a judicious moment then stood quickly and walked past eckhard but as he did the disposable camera fell from the folds of his newspaper matthews blinked then stepped forward suddenly to pick it up but his foot struck the yellowandblack box it went skidding along the sidewalk and stopped in front of eckhard matthews froze the teacher his eyes on matthewss smiled again he reached down and picked up the camera looked at it turned it over i matthews began horrified its okay eckhard said okay matthewss voice faltered he looked up and down the sidewalk uneasy i mean the cameras okay eckhard said rattling it it doesnt seem to be broken matthews began speaking breathlessly over explainingas his script required see what it was i was going to dc later today i was going to the zoo take some pictures of the animals the zoo eckhard examined the camera matthews again looked up and down the sidewalk you like photography the teacher asked after a moment matthews said yes i do a hobby smiled awkwardly summoning a blush everybody should have a hobby thats what my father said he fell silent its my hobby too really been doing it for about fifteen years eckhard said me too little less i guess you live around here the teacher asked fairfax long time a couple of years silence grew between them eckhard still held the camera matthews crossed his arms rocked on his feet looking out over the school yard finally he asked you do your own developing and printing of course eckhard said of course the expected answer matthewss eyes narrowed and he appeared to relax harder with color he offered but they dont make the throwaways in black and white im getting a digital camera eckhard said i can just feed the pictures into my computer at home ive heard about those theyre expensive arent they they are but you know hobbies if theyre important to you youre willing to spend the money thats my philosophy matthews admitted he sat down next to eckhard they looked out on the playing field at a cluster of girls who were around ten or eleven years old eckhard looked through the eyepiece of the camera lens isnt telephoto no matthews said then after a moment shes cute that brunette there angela you know her im a teacher at the high school im also a grade school counselor matthewss eyes flashed enviously teacher i work for an insurance company actuarial work boring but summers i volunteer at camp henry maryland ages eight through fourteen you know it eckhard shook his head i also coach girls sports thats a good job too matthews clicked his tongue sure is eckhard looked out over the field i know most of these girls you do portraits some you ever photograph her that girl by the goal post but eckhard wouldnt answer so you take pictures just around the area here matthews said here california europe some i was in amsterdam a little while ago amsterdam i was there a few years ago not as interesting as it used to be thats what i found bangkok s nice though eckhard volunteered im planning on going next year matthews said in a whisper oh you have to eckhard encouraged kneading the yellow box of the camera in his hands its quite a place matthews could practically see the synapses firing in eckhards mind wondering furiously if matthews was a cop with the child welfare unit of the fairfax county police or an fbi agent matthews had treated several pedophiles during his days as a practicing therapist he recognized the classic characteristics in eckhard he was intelligent an organized offenderand hed know all about the laws of child molestation and pornography he could probably just keep the testosterone under control to avoid actually molesting a child but photographing young girls was a compulsion that ruled his life matthews offered another conspiratorial smile then glanced at a girl bending down to pick up a ball gave a faint sigh eckhard followed his gaze and nodded the girl stood up eckhard said nancy shes nine fifth grade pretty you wouldnt happen to have any pictures of her would you i do eckhard paused in a nice skirt and blouse i seem to recall matthews wrinkled his nose shrugged he wondered if the man would take the bait snap eckhard whispered well not the blouse in all of them matthews exhaled hard you wouldnt happen to have any with you no you have any of yours matthews said i keep all of mine on my computer one of matthewss patients had seven thousand images of child pornography on computer hed traded them with other pedophiles while hed been serving time for a molestation charge the computer they resided on was the wardens at hammond falls state penitentiary in maryland the prisoner had written an encryption program to keep the files secret the fbi cracked it anyway and despite his willingness to go through therapy the offense earned him another ten years in prison matthews said i dont have too many in my collection only about four thousand eckhards eyes turned to matthews and they were vacuums he whispered a long envious well matthews added ive got some videos too but only about a hundred of them a hundred eckhard shifted on the bench matthews knew the teacher was lost completely hed be thinking at worst its entrapment and i can beat it in court at worst i can talk my way out of it at worst ill flee the country and move to thailand as a therapist matthews was continually astonished at how easily people won completely unwinnable arguments with themselves still you land a fish with as much care as you hook it you seem worried matthews started and i have to say i dont know you and im a little nervous myself but ive just got a feeling about you maybe we could help each other out let me show you a couple of samples of what ive got the teachers eyes flickered with lust always the eyes thatd be fine thatd be good please eckhard cleared his excited throat oh you pathetic thing i could give you a computer disk matthews suggested sure thatd be great i only live about three blocks from here let me run up to my house and get some samples good oh matthews said pausing a frown i only have girls yes yes thats fine eckhard said breathlessly a bead of spit rested in the corner of the mouth desperately he asked can you go now sure be right back matthews started up the street he turned and saw the teacher a stupid smile on his face grinning from ear to ear looking out over the field of his sad desire rubbing his thumb over the disposable camera in the drugstore once again matthews walked up to the pay phone and called when dispatch answered he said urgently oh you need somebody down to markus avenue right away the sports field behind jefferson school he described eckhard and said he took a little girl into the alley and pulled his you know penis out then took some pictures and i heard him ask her to his house he said hes got lots of pictures of little girls like her on his computer pictures of little girls you know doing it oh its disgusting hurry up im going back and watch him to make sure he doesnt get away he hung up before the dispatcher could ask for his identity matthews didnt know if snapshots of a fully dressed little girl in a school yard next to frames of a mans erect dick matthewss own penis taken in the drugstore rest room twenty minutes ago were an offense but once the cops got a search warrant for the mans house eckhard would be out of commissionand a completely unreliable witness about a gray mercedes or anything elsefor a long long time by the time he was back on the street walking toward his car matthews heard the sirens fairfax county apparently took childrens wellbeing very seriously tate and bett arrived at the school yard taking care to avoid the main building just in case the cleancut young fascist of a security guard had happened to glance inside the buster book after tate and bett had left and found twenty pages missing but volleyball practice had been canceled for today it seemed nobody quite knew why in fact the yard was almost deserted despite the clear skies they found two students and asked if theyd seen eckhard they said they hadnt one teenage girl said we were coming here for the practice volleyball right and what it was was somebody said its been canceled and we should all go home and stay away from here totally weird and you havent seen mr eckhard somebody said he had to go someplace but they didnt tell us where i dont know he was here earlier i dont get it hes always here i mean always do you know where he lives fairfax someplace i think whats his first name robert tate called directory assistance and got his number then called there was no answer he left a message he looked out over the school yard for a moment and had a thought tate asked his exwife where did she hang out hang out bett asked absently he saw her looking into her purse eyes on the letter containing her daughters searing words yeah with her friends after school she looked up just around you know but where well go there ask if anybodys seen her there was a long hesitation finally she said im not sure youre not tate asked surprised you dont know where she goes no bett answered testily not all the time shes a seventeenyearold girl with a drivers license oh so you dont know where shed spend her afternoons not always no she glanced at him angrily it is not like she hangs out in southeast dc tate i just megans a responsible girl she knows where to go and where not to go i trust her they walked in silence back to the car bett grabbed her phone again and her address book she began making callsto megans friends he gathered at least she had their numbers if not megans boyfriends still it irked him that she didnt seem to know much basic informationimportant informationabout the girl when they arrived at the car she folded up the phone her favorite place was called the coffee shop up near route fifty bett sounded victorious like starbucks all right happy she dropped into the seat and crossed her arms they drove in silence north along the parkway braking to five miles an hour tate surveyed the crowded parking lot he found a space between a chopped harleydavidson and a pickup bumperstickered with the reb stars n bars he navigated the glistening lexus into this narrow spot he and bett surveyed the cycles the tough young men and women all in denim defiantly holding open bottles the tattoos the boots at the other end of the parking lot was a very different crowd younger boys with long hair girls with crew cuts layers of baggy clothes plenty of body piercing bleary eyes welcome to the coffee shop here bett asked she came here starbucks tate thought i dont think so she glanced at the notes shed jotted off fifty near walney thiss it oh my tate glanced at his exwife her horrified expression didnt diminish his anger how could she have let megan come to a place like this didnt she check up on her her own daughter for christs sake tate pushed the door open and started to get out bett popped her seat belt but he said abruptly wait here he walked up to the closest clusterthe bikers they seemed less comatose than the slacker gang at the other end of the lot but no one he queried had heard of megan he was vastly relieved maybe it was a misunderstanding maybe her friend meant a generic coffee shop someplace at the far end of the lot he waded into a grungy sea of plaid shirts doe marten boots jnco jeans and bellbottom levis the girls wore tight tank tops over bras in contrasting colors their hair was long parted in the middle like megans peace symbols bounced on breasts and there was a lot of tiedyed couture the images reminded tate of his own comingofage era the early seventies megan sure like i know her said a slim girl smoking a cigarette she was too young to buy have you seen her lately shes here a lotta nights but not in the last week you know like whore

spoken to its like not a big deal it was a couple years ago couple years ago shes only seventeen now for christs sake tate lowered his hand he stood up brushed the dust off he looked at the people in front of the bar staring at him the huge bearded bouncer was amused bett was half out of the car looking at her exhusband with alarm he motioned her to stay where she was sammy said fuck man whatd you

his beeper which had fallen off his belt in the struggle fuck you man fuck you whore you anyway turning back tate snapped im her father father the boy asked frowning yeah her father sammy looked at the girl who shrugged the boy said megan said she didnt have a father tate frowned and sammy continued she said he was a lawyer or something but he ran off and left her when she was six she hasnt heard from him since in the car tate asked angrily you didnt know she went there i told you i didnt you think id let her go to a place like that i just think you might want to know where she was hanging out from time to time you just think you know when people say that what are you he began they say that when they mean you damn well ought to know where she was i didnt mean that at all tate snapped though of course he had he sped out onto the highway tires squealing gravel flying from beneath the tires putting the coffee shop far behind them she finally asked what was that all about he didnt answer tate what were you fighting with that boy about you dont want to know he said darkly tell me he hesitated but then he had to say it he said he thought the guy in the gray car mightve been a customer customer of megans what oh god you dont mean thats exactly what i mean thats what the boy said and that girl too vile youre disgusting me im just telling you what he said tears coming down her face she wouldnt theres no way its impossible they didnt seem to think it was impossible they seemed to think she did it pretty often tate how can you say that and he said it was a couple years ago when she was fifteen she didnt im certain a wave of fury consumed him his hands cramped on the steering wheel how could you not know what were you so busy doing that you didnt notice any condoms in your daughters purse didnt you check who called her didnt you notice what time she got home maybe at midnight at one two stop it bett cried dont attack me its not true its a misunderstanding well find her and shell explain it they seemed to think she screamed its a lie its just gossip thats all it is gossip or theyre talking about somebody else not megan yes megan and you should have oh youre blaming me it isnt my fault you know you might have been more involved with her life me he snapped okaysure your happy family didnt turn out the way you wanted well im sorry about that tate but you could have checked on her once in a while i did i paid support every month oh for christs sake i dont mean money you know how often shed ask me why doesnt daddy like me and id say he does hes just busy with all his cases and id say its hard to be a real daddy when he and mommy are divorced and id say i spent easters with her and the fourth of july yeah and you shouldve heard the debriefings on those joyous holidays bett laughed coldly what do you mean she never complained you have to know somebody before you complain to them i took her shopping he said i always asked her about school i you couldve done more we mightve made some accommodation mightve been a little more of a family like hell he spat out peopleve done it in worse situations what was i supposed to do take up your slack this isnt about me she snapped well apparently it is youre her mother you want somebody else to fix what youve done or havent done ive done the best i could bett sobbed by myself but it wasnt you yourself it was you and the boyfriends oh i was supposed to be celibate no but you were supposed to be a mother first you shouldve noticed that she had problems tate couldnt help but think of betts sister susan the woman had desperately wanted children while bell had always been indifferent to the idea after her husband harriss death susan had moved in with a man very brieflyhe was abusive and from what tate heard half crazy but he was a single mandivorced or widowedwith a child and susan put up with a lot of crap from him just to have the young boy around she desperately wanted someone to mother after theyd broken up the lover had turned dangerous and stalked her but even at the worst moments susan still seemed to regret the loss of that child in her life tate now wished bett had shown some of that desire for megan i saw she was unhappy bett said but who the hell isnt what was i supposed to do wave a magic wand his anger wouldnt release the death grip it had on his heart hell thats probably exactly your idea of mothering sure or cast a spell look up something in the i ching read her tarot oh stop it i gave up all that shit years ago i tried to be a good mother i tried did you he was astonished to find himself saying you sure you werent out looking for your king arthur easier than changing diapers or helping her with homework or making sure when she was home after school making sure she wasnt fucking i tried i tried bett was sobbing shaking tate realized the car was nudging eighty he slowed a deep breath another long long silence his eyes too welled up with tears listen im sorry i tried i wanted i wanted bett please im sorry i wanted a family too you know she whispered wiping her face on the sleeve of her blouse i saw the judge and his wife and you and the rest of the colliers i didnt talk about it the way you did but i wanted a family too but then things happened you know i lost my temper i dont youre right those kids back there it was probably just gossip but his words were flaccid and of course they came far too late the damage had been done he wondered if theyd separate now and never speak to each other again he supposed that would happen he supposed that it would have to and oddly he realized how much the idea upset him no it terrified him he had no idea why a long moment passed bett spoke first he was surprised to hear her say in a calm reasoned voice maybe its true tatewhat you heard about her maybe it is and maybe part of its my fault but you know people change they can they really can they continued on in silence bett closed her eyes and leaned her head back on the headrest what a man hears he may doubt what he sees he may possibly doubt bett i am sorry what he does bett but she didnt answer she decided she was safest here in her cell if the fatheraaron matthewshad wanted to kill her he could have done so easily he didnt have to stash her away here he didnt have to buy all the food no no she had this funny sense that though he kidnapped her he didnt want to hurt her but the son he was the threat she needed protection from him shed stay here locked in crazy megans padded cell until she figured out how to escape she opened one of the files shed taken from peters room in the dim light she scanned the pages trying to find something that might help her maybe the hospital was near a town were there photos or brochures of the hospital and grounds maybe she could find a map if she started a fire people might see the smoke or maybe shed find ventilation shafts or emergency exits she remembered a padlocked door marked basement down one of the corridors nearby if she could break the lock on the door were there exits down there she might get through she flipped through the documents looking for a picture or photo of the hospitaltrying to find basement windows or doors she might climb out of damn thats smart says an impressed crazy megan shhhh megan happened to glance at the papers on the top of the pile patient victoria skelling paranoid schizophrenic was found dead in her room at hours april cod was asphyxia from inhalation of mattress fibers county police see annexed report investigated and declared the death suicide it appeared patient skelling gnawed through the canvas ducking of her mattress and pulled out wads of stuffing she inhaled approximately ten ounces of this material which lodged in her throat the patient had been on thorazine and haldol delusions were minimal orderlies described her in good spirits for much of the morning of her death but after spending the day on the grounds with a group of other patients she grew increasingly depressed and agitated she complained that rats were coming to get her they were going to chew her breasts off earlier delusions and certain dreams centered around poisoned breast milk and suckling she calmed again at dinnertime and spent the evening in the tv room she was extremely upset when she went to bed and orderlies considered using restraints she was given an extra dose of haldol and locked into her room at hours she said its time to take care of the rats they win they win she was found the next morning dead gross both megan and cm think simultaneously she flipped through more pages patient matthews no was the last person to see her alive and he reported that she seemed all spooky so aaron matthewss son peter had been hospitalized here and after the hospital was closed his father brought him back why she couldnt guess maybe he felt at home here maybe his father broke him out of the hospital for the criminally insane to have him nearby she flipped through another report and learned that someone else had committed suicide the body of patient garber no was found behind the main building the police and coroner had determined that he had swallowed a garden hose and turned the water on full force the pressure from the water ruptured his stomach and several feet of intestine he died from internal hemorrhaging and shock although several patients were nearby when this happened matthews no and ketter no h they could offer no further information the death was ruled suicide by the medical examiner megan read through several other files they were all similarreports of patients killing themselves one victim was found in the library hed apparently spent hours tearing apart books and magazines looking for a sheet of paper sturdy enough to slice through the artery in his neck he finally succeeded she shivered at the thought someone else had leapt out of a tree and broken his neck he didnt die but was paralyzed for life when asked about why hed done it he said hed been talking to some patients and he realized how pointless life was how he was never going to get better death would bring some peace yet another report stated patient matthews was the last person to see victim alive the administrator wondered if hed been involved and the boy had been interviewed and evaluated but no charges were brought reading more she found that not long after the last suicide a reporter from the washington times heard of the deaths and filed an investigative report the state board of examiners looked into the matter and closed the hospital but megan understood that the deaths werent suicides at all how could they have missed it peter matthews had killed the other patients and somehow covered up the evidence to make the deaths look like suicide she flipped through the rest of the files and clippings nothing she found told her anything helpful she shoved them under the bed what can i do there has to then she heard the footsteps faint at first oh no peter was coming back up the hall well hed missed her before closer closer very soft now as if he was trying not to make any noise but she heard his breathing and remembered the picture of the eerielooking boyhis twisted mouth the tip of his pale tongue in the corner of his lips she remembered the stained sheets and wondered if he was walking around looking for her masturbating megan shivered violently started to cry she eased up to the door put her head against it listened no sounds from the other side had he a fierce pounding on the door the recoil knocked her to her knees another crash a whispered voice megan and in that faint word she heard lust and desperation and hunger megan he knows im here he knows who i am peter was rattling the lock a few loud slams of a brick or baseball bat on the padlock no please whyd matthews leave her alone with him as much as she hated the doctor megan prayed hed return megannnnnnn it now sounded as if the boy was laughing a sudden crash into the door itself then another and another suddenly a rusty metal rodlike the spears in his horrible comic bookscracked the wood and poked through a few inches just as peter pulled the metal back out megan leapt into the bathroom plastered herself against the wall she heard his breath on the door and she knew he was looking through the hole hed made looking for her megan but from that angle he couldnt see that there was a bathroom the door was to the side for an eternity she listened to his lecherous breathing finally he walked off she started back into the room but stopped had he really gone she wondered she decided shed wait until dark peter might be outside and hed see her and if she plugged up the hole hed know for certain she was there she sat on the toilet lowered her head to her hands and cried come on girl get up i cant no i cant im scared of course youre scared crazy megan chides but whats that got to do with anything lookit that lookit the bathroom window megan looked at the bathroom window no its nuts to think about it you know what youve got to do i cant do it megan thought i just cant yeah what choiceve you got megan stood and walked to the window reached through the bars and touched the filthy glass i cant yes you can megan crawled back into the room praying that peter wasnt outside the door and looking through the peephole hed made she reached under the bed sure shed come up with a handful of rat but no she found only the manila file folder shed been looking for she returned to the bathroom and eased up to the window pressed the folder against the glass she drew back her fist and slugged the pane the punch was hard but the glass held she hit it again and this time a long crack spread from the top to the bottom of the window finally another slug and the glass shattered she pulled her fist back just as the sharp shards fell to the windowsill she picked a triangular piece of glass about eight inches long narrow as a knife taking her cue from patient victoria skellings sad end megan using her teeth ripped a strip off one of the mattress pads on the wall she wound this around the base of the splinter to make a handle good cm says with approval proud of her other self no better than good megan reflected great fuck you dr matthews i feel great it reminded her of how shed felt when shed written those letters to her parents in dr hansons office it was scary it hurt but it was completely honest great crazy megan wonders so whats next fuck the kid up with the knife megan responded out loud then get his keys and book on out of here atta girl cm offers but what about the dogs theyve got claws ive got claws megan dramatically held up the glass crazy megan is impressed as hell theres a van a van bett asked following us tate continued as they drove past the ski chalet in chantilly bett started to turn no dont he said she turned back looked at her hands fingers tipped in faint purple polish are you sure pretty sure a white van tate made a slow circle through the shopping center then exited on route and sped east he pulled into the greenbriar strip mall stopped at the starbucks and climbed out he bought two teas topped with foamed milk and returned to the car they sipped them for a moment and when a red ford explorer cut between his lexus and the van he hit the gas and took off past a bookstore streaking onto majestic lane and just catching the tail end of the light that put him back on route heading west this time when he settled into the right lane he noticed the white van was still with him howd he do that tate wondered aloud hes still there yep hell hes good they continued west passing under route which was the dividing line between civilization here and the farmland that led eventually to the mountains whatre we going to do but tate didnt answer hardly even heard the question he was looking at a large sign that said future home of liberty park he laughed out loud this was one of those odd things noticing the sign at the same time the van was following them a highgrade coincidence he would have said bettwell the old bettwould of course have attributed it to the stars or the spirits or past lives or something didnt matter hed made the connection and at last he had a solid lead what she cried alarmed responding both to his outrageous uturn skidding degrees over the grassy median and the harsh laugh coming from his throat i just figured something out were going to my place for a minute i have to get something oh what a gun betts head turned toward him then away youre serious arent you oh yep very serious some years ago when tate had been prosecuting the improbable case of the murder of a jamaican drug dealer at a wendys restaurant in suburban burke konnie konstantinatis had poked his head into tates office time you got yourself a piece of what ha youll want a revolver cause all you do is point n shoot youre not a boy to mess with clips and safeties and stuff like that whats a clip tate had been joking of courseevery commonwealths attorney in virginia was well versed in the lore of firearmsbut the fact was he re ally didnt know guns well the judge didnt hold with weapons didnt see any need for them and believed the countryside would be much more highly populated without weaponry but konnie wouldnt take no for an answer and within a week tate found himself the owner of a very unglamorous smith wesson special sporting six chambers only five loaded the one under the hammer being forever empty as konnie always preached this gun was locked away where itd been for the past three or four yearsin a trunk in tates barn he now sped up his driveway and leapt out observing that with his manic driving hed lost the white van without intending to he ran into the barn found the key on his chain and after much jiggling managed to open the trunk the gun still coated with oil as hed left it was in a ziploc bag he took it out wiped it clean and slipped it into his pocket in the car belt asked him timidly you have it the way a college girl might ask her boyfriend if hed brought a condom on a date he nodded is it loaded oh hed forgotten to look he took it out and fiddled with the gun until he remembered how to open it five silver eyes of bullets stared back from the cylinder he clicked it shut and put the heavy gun in his pocket its not going to just go off is it i mean by itself no he noticed belt staring at him what he asked starting the engine of the lexus youre you look scary he laughed coldly i feel scary lets go manassas virginia is this bigwheeled trucks sullen pickafight teenagers the description filling both the boys and the girls cars on the street and cars on blocks confederate stars n bars strip malls pcp labs tucked away in the woods concrete postwar bungalows quiet mothers and skinny fathers struggling struggling struggling its domestic fights its women sobbing at garths concerts and teens puking at aerosmiths and a little of it very little is grant avenue this is doctors and lawyers row little taras civil war mansions complete with columns and detached barns for garages surrounded by expansive landscaped yards it was to the biggest of these housesa rambling white colonial on four acresthat tate collier now drove who lives here bett asked cautiously eyeing the house the man who knows where megan is call konnie she said no time he muttered and he rolled up the drive past the two mercedesesneither of them gray he noticedand skidded to a stop about five feet from the front door nearly knocking a limestone lion off its perch beside the walk tate but he ignored her and leapt from the car wait here the anger swelled inside him even more powerfully boiling and he found himself pounding fiercely on the door with his left hand his right gripped around the handle of the pistol a large man opened the door he was in his thirties muscular wearing chinos and an izod shirt i want to see him tate growled who are you i want to see sharpe and i want to see him now pull the gun now or wait for a more dramatic moment mr sharpes busy right at the tate lifted the gun out of his pocket he displayed it more than brandished it to the assistant or bodyguard or whatever he was the man lifted his hands and backed up alarm on his face jesus christ where is he hold on there mister i dont bow who you are or what youre doing here but jimmy whats going on a voice called from the top of the stairs cot a problem here mr sharpe tate collier come acalling jack sharpe sang out he glanced at the gun as if tate were holding a butterfly net collier whatcha got yourself there he laughed cautious sure but it was still a laugh was he driving the white van tate pointed the gun at the man in the chinos who lifted his hands careful sir please he implored its okay jimmy sharpe called just let him be hell calm down what van collier you know what van tate said turning back to sharpe was he the asshole driving whynt you put that thing away sos nobody gets hurt and well talk no jimmy its okay really i can shoot him if you want mr sharpe tate glanced back and found himself looking into the muzzle of a very large pistol chrome plated held steadily in jimmys hand it was an automatic he noticedwith clips and safeties and all the rest of that stuff no dont do that sharpe said hes not going to hurt anybody collier put it away be better for everybody jimmy kept the gun pointed steadily at tates head tate put his own pistol back into his pocket with a shaking hand come on upstairs should i come too mr sharpe no i dont think well needya jimmy will we collier i dont think so tate said no come on up tate breathless after the adrenaline rush climbed the stairs he followed jack sharpe into a sunlit den he glanced back and saw that jimmy was still holding the shiny pistol pointed vaguely in tates direction sharpewearing navyblue polyester slacks and a red golfing shirt was now all business no longer jokey what the fucks this all about collier wheres my daughter your daughter how should i know whos driving the white van i assume youre saying that somebodys been following you yeah somebodys been following me when tate had seen the liberty park sign hed remembered that his clients in that case had complained to him last week that private eyes had been following them tated told them not to worryit was standard practice in big cases though he added that they shouldnt do anything they wouldnt want committed to videotape same as somebodys been following my clients and probably my wife thought you were divorced sharpe noted howd you know that seem to remember something so if you were following us me sharpe tried for innocence it didnt take youve been following my daughter too who just happened to disappear today sharpe slowly lifted a puller from a bag of golf clubs sitting in the corner of his study addressed one of the dozen balls lying on the floor and sent it across the room it missed the cup i hire lawyers to fight my battles for me as you well know having decorated the walls of the courtroom with their hides recently thats all i hire tate asked no security consultants ha security consultants thats good yeah thats good well no collier there aint no private eyes and no seecurity consultants on my payroll now whats this about your daughter shes missing and i think youre behind it another putt he missed the cup again me why oh i get it to take you outta the running at the oral argument next thursday down in richmond right makes sense to me well it dont make sense to me i dont need to do that to beat you you know i fired those halfassed shysters you reamed at the trial i got the big boys involved now lambert stone and bums theyre gonna run right over you dont flatter yourself theyll bum you up like atlanta liberty park sharpe tell me how muchll you lose if it doesnt get built the park it dont go through i dont lose a penny then he smiled but the amount i wont make is to the tune of eighteen million say aint it unethical for you to be here without my lawyer being present tate said where is she tell me i dont know what youre talking about come on jack you think i dont know about defendants harassing clients and lawyers so theyll drop cases sharpe ran his hand through his white hair he sat down beneath a picture of himself on the eighteenth tee of the bull run country club a place that proudly had not a single member who wasnt white and protestant male toothough that went without saying collier i dont kidnap people but how about some of those little roosters that work for you i wouldnt put it past a couple or three of them that project manager of yours wilkins he was in lorton for eighteen months for passing bad paper collier not kidnapping girls who knows who they mightve hired some psycho who does kidnap girls and maybe likes it nobody hired nobody sharpe said though tate could see in his eyes that he was considering the possibility that one of his thugs had snatched megan but five seconds on the defensive was too much for jack sharpe running outta patience here collier and whatta i knowim just a country boybut if im not mistaken isnt that slander or libel or some such youre spouting so file suit jack but tell me where she is youre barking up the wrong tree collier youre gonna have to look elsewhere youre not thinking clear you bow prince william as good as your grandfather did before you if you do a deal like liberty park you play hardball thats the way business works in these parts but for christs sake this aint southeast dc im not gonna hurt a seventeenyearold girl now its time for you to leave i got work to do he sank the next putt into the small cup which spit the ball back to him tate chin quivering with rage stared back at the much calmer face of his opponent from the doorway jimmy asked calmly you want me to help him outside sharpe said naw just show him to the door hey so long counselor see you in richmond next thursday hope youre rested and comfy theyre going to rub every inch of your skin off its gonna be pretty to watch rhetoric plato wrote is the universal art of winning the mind by argument tate collier at eleven years of age listened to the judge recite that definition as the old man rasped a match to light his fragrant pipe and decided that one day he would do rhetoric whatever that meant he had to wait three years for the chance but finally as a high school freshman he argued what else his way into debate club even though it was open only to upperclassmen tournament debating started in colonial america with the spy club at harvard in the early s and opened up to women a hundred years later with the young lathes association at oberlin though hundreds of less formal societies lyceums and bees had always been popular throughout the colonies by the time tate was in school intercollegiate debate had become a practiced institution he argued in hundreds of national debate tournament bouts as well as the alternativeformatcross examination debate associationtournaments he was a member of the forensic honorary fraternitiesdelta sigma rho phi rho pi and pi kappa deltaand was now as active in the american forensics association as he was in the american bar association in collegewhen it was fashionable to be antimilitary antifrat antirotctate shunned bellbottoms and liedye for suits with narrow lies and white shirts there he honed his technique his logic his reasoning ifthenmajor premise minor premise conclusion knocking down straw men circular logic and ad hominem tactics by his opponents he fought debaters from georgetown and george washington from duke and north carolina and penn and johns hopkins and he beat them all with this talent and of course with the judge for a grandfather law school was inevitable at uva hed been the state moot court champion his senior year at the federal bar moot court open in the district now he frequently taught wellattended appellate advocate continuinged courses and his american trial lawyers association tape was a bestseller in the aba catalogue when hed been a senior at uva and the champion debater on campus the judge had traveled down to charlottesville to see him as predicted hed won the debate it was the infamous prowatergate contest the judge told him that hed heard someone in the audience say hows that collier boy do it he looks like a farm boy but when he starts to talk hes somebody else its like hes speaking in tongues no there was no one tate collier would not match words with yet the incident with sharpe had left him unnerved hed let emotions dictate what hed said what was happening to him he was losing his orators touch i blew it he muttered and told bell what had happened did he have anything to do with it i think he did yeah he was slick too slick he was expecting me but he was also surprised about something what i think something happened he hadnt planned on its true i dont think his boys would kidnap megan themselves but i think they hired somebody to do it oh and he knew we were divorced and that megan was seventeen why would he how that if he hadnt looked into our lives are you going to tell konnie oh sure i am but people like sharpe are good they dont leave loose ends you follow the trails and they vanish she picked up the pistol which hed set on the dashboard she slipped it in the glove compartment distastefully arent we a pair tate guns private eyes he said bett im sorry about before she shook her head no she said firmly there was truth in what you said they drove in silence for several moments she sighed then asked reflectively do you like your life he glanced at her responded sure just sure how much more can you be than sure you can be convincing she said whats life he asked but ups and downs you ever get lonely ah theres a question for you sometimes the women would stay the night sometimes theyd leave sometimes they decided to return to their husbands or lovers or leave him for other men sometimes theyd talk about getting divorced and sometimes they were single unattached and waiting for a ring sometimes theyd introduce tate to their parents or their cautiouseyed children or if they had none talk about how much they wanted youngsters a boy first theyd invariably say and then a girl they all faded from his life and yes most nights he was lonely i keep pretty busy he said you she said quickly im busy too everybody needs interior design sure he agreed things working out well with brad oh brads a dear hes a real gentleman you dont see many of them you were one i mean you still are she laughed you know i keep expecting to see you on court tv she said prosecuting serial killers or terrorists or something channel nine loved you you gave great interviews those were the days whyd you quit practice he kept his hands at ten to two on the wheel and his eyes straight ahead tate she repeated prosecutings a young mans game he said thinking he was the epitome of credibility but bell said thats an answer but not the answer i didnt quit practice you know what i mean you were the best in the state remember those rumors that youd get that job you wanted solicitor generalthe lawyer who represented the government in cases before the supreme courtthe most important forensic orator in the country tates grandfather had always hoped his grandson might get that job and tate himself had for years had his sights on that job i wanted to spend more time on the farm bullshit well this was definitely a new bell mccall the ethereal angel had come to earth with muddy cheeks why wont you tell me okay i lost my taste for blood he explained i prosecuted a capital case i won and i wished i hadnt bett had been deeply ashamed that while they were married tate had sent six men to death row in jarratt virginia her horror at this achievement had always seemed ironic to him for she believed in the immortality of souls and tate did not he was innocent she asked no no it was more complicated than that he killed the victim there was no question about that but he was probably only guilty of manslaughter at best criminally negligent homicide most likely the defense offered a pleaprobation and counseling i rejected it and went for lethal injection the jury gave him life imprisonment the first week he was in prison he was killed by other inmates actuallyhis voice caughthe was tortured and then he died god tate what a man hears he may doubt i talked him to death bett i conjured the jurors i had the gift on my side not the law and hes dead when he shouldnt be if hed been out of prison had some help hed be alive now and probably a fine person but what he does he cannot doubt he waited for her disgust or anger but she said only im sorry he looked at her and saw not pity or remorse but simple regret at his pain they fired you the commonwealths attorneys office oh no no i just quit i never heard about it small case not really newsworthy the story died on the metro page staring at the road tate confessed you know something he felt betts head turn toward him he continued i wanted to tell you about what happened when i heard that hed died i reached for the phone to call youbefore anybody else even before konnie i hadnt seen you in over a year two years maybe but you were the one i wanted to tell i wish you had he chuckled but you hated me taking capital cases there was a long pause she said seems to me youve served enough time over that one most everybody gets a parole hearing dont they as tate signaled to make the turn for betts exit she said could we just drive a bit i dont feel like going home his hand wavered over the signal stem he clicked it off tate piloted his lexus back through centreville which some of the redder of the rednecks around these parts disparagingly called new calcutta and new seoulbecause of the immigrants settling here he made a long loop around route and turned down a deserted country road the sun was low now but the heat seemed worse the sour sickly aroma of rotting leaves from last years autumn was in the air tate bett asked slowly what if nothing happened nothing happened what if nobody kidnapped her what if she really did run off because she hates us he glanced at her she continued if we find her when we find her he corrected what if shes so mad at us that she wont come home well convince her to he told her could you do it do you think talk her into coming back home can i he wondered theres a transcendent moment in debate when your opponent has the overwhelming weight of logic and facts on his side and yet still you can win by leading him in a certain direction you get him to build his entire argument on what appears to be an irrefutable foundation the logic of which is flawless but which you nonetheless destroy at the same time as you accept the perfection of his argument its a moment tate tells his classes just like in fencing when the red target of a heart is touched lightly with the button of the foil while the fencers attention is elsewhere no flailing away no chops or heavy strokes but a simple deadly tap the opponent never sees coming all cats see in the dark midnight is a cat therefore midnight can see in the dark irrefutable the purest of logic unless midnight is blind but what kind of argument could he make to convince megan to return home he thought about the two letters shed written and he didnt have any thoughts at all he saw only her perfect anger well get her back he told bett ill do that dont worry bett pulled down the makeup mirror in the sun visor to apply lipstick tate was suddenly taken back to the night they metat that party in charlottesville hed driven her home afterward and had spent a passionate half hour in the front seat of the car removing every trace of her pink revlon five weeks later hed suggested they move in together a twoyear romance on campus hed graduated from law school the year bell got her undergraduate degree they left idyllic charlottesville for the district of columbia and his clerkship at federal district court bell got a job managing a new age bookstore they lived the bland easy life that washington offered a young couple just starting out tates consolation was his job and bells that she finally was close to her twin sister who lived in baltimore and had been too ill to travel to charlottesville married in may his antebellum plantation built the next spring megan born two years later and three years after that he and bett were divorced when he looked back on their relationship his perfect memory was no longer so perfect what he recalled seemed to be merely sharp peaks of an island that was the tip of a huge undersea mountain range the wispy ethereal woman hed seen at the party singing a sailors mournful song of farewell walks in the country driving through the blue ridge toward massanutten mountain making love in a forest near the luray caverns tate had always enjoyed being out of doors the cornfields the beach backyard barbecues but betts interest in the outside arose only at dusk when the line between the worlds is at its thinnest shed told him once sitting on the porch of an inn deep in the appalachians what worlds he asked shhh listen shed said enchanting him even while he knew it was an illusion which was he supposed irrefutable proof of her ability to cast a spell betty sue mccall devoted to her twin sister with whom she had some mystical link that unnerved even rationalist tate reedy folk singer collector of the unexplained the arcane the invisible tate had never figured out if her sublime mystique magnified their love falsely or obscured it or indeed if it was the essence of their love magic in the end of course it didnt matter for they separated completely moved far away from each other emotionally she became for him what shed been when he was first captivated by her the dark woman of his imagination today she prodded her face in the mirror rubbed at some invisible blemish as he remembered her doing many times shed always been terribly vain she flipped the mirror back pull over tate he glanced at her no it was not an imperfection shed been examining shed been crying again what is it just pull over he did into the park service entrance to the bull run bafflefield bett climbed from the car and walked up the gentle slope tate followed and when they were on level ground they stopped and simultaneously lifted their eyes toward the tumultuous clouds overhead what is it bett he watched her stare at the night sky looking for an angel to help you decide something suddenly he was worried that shed take offense at thisan implicit reference to her flighty sidethough he hadnt meant it sardonically but she only smiled and lowered her eyes from the sky i was never into that angel stuff too hallmark card you know but i wouldnt mind a spirit or two well he said thisd be the place general jackson came charging out of those trees right over there and stopped the union boys cold in their tracks right heres where he earned himself the name stonewall the low sun glistened off the union cannons black barrels in the distance bett turned took his hands and pulled him to her hold me tate please he put his arms around herfor the first time in years they stood this way for a long moment then found a bench and sat he kept his arm around her she took his other hand and tate wished suddenly painfully that megan were here with them the three of them together and all the hard events of the past dead and buried like the poor bodies of the troops whod died bloody and broken on this very spot wind in the trees billowing clouds overhead suddenly a streak of yellow flashed past them oh whats that bett said look he glanced at the bird that alighted near them thatd be let me see a common yellowthroat nests on the ground and feeds in the tree canopy her laugh scared it away you know all these facts where do you learn them a girlfriend age twentythree had been a birdwatcher i read a lot he said more silence what are you thinking she wondered after a moment a question women often ask when they find themselves in close contact with a man and silence descends unfinished business he suggested you and me she considered this i used to think things were finished between us but then i started to look at it like doing your will before you get on a plane hows that if you crash well maybe all the loose endsre tied up but wouldnt you still rather hang around for a little while longer theres a metaphor for you he laughed she spent a moment examining the sky again when you argued before the supreme court five or six years ago that big civil rights case and the post did that writeup on you i told everybody you were my exhusband i was proud of you really he was surprised you know what occurred to me then reading about you it seemed that when we were married you were my voice i didnt have one of my own you were quiet thats true he said thats what happened to us i think part of it anyway i had to find mine and when you went looking so long no half measures for you no compromises no bargaining the old bett would have grown angry or dipped into her enigmatic silence at these critical words but she merely nodded in agreement that was me all right i was so rigid i had all the right answers if something wasnt just perfect i was gone jobs classes husband oh tate im not proud of it but i felt so young when you have a child things do change you become more enduring thats it yes you always know the right word he said i never had any idea what you were thinking about back then betts thoughts might have been on what to make for dinner or king arthur or a footnote in a term paper she might have been thinking of a recent tarot card reading she might even have been thinking about him i was always afraid to say anything around you tate i always felt tonguetied like i had nothing to say that interested you i dont love you for your oratorical abilities he paused noting the tense of the verb i mean thats not what attracted me to you then reflected oh shes so rightwhat shed said earlier we humans have this terrible curse we alone among the animals believe in the possibility of changein ourselves and those we love it can kill us and maybe just maybe it can save our doomed hearts the problem is we never know until its too late which you know when i missed you the most she said finally not on holidays or picnics but when i was in belize what tate asked suddenly she waved lethargically at a yellow jacket you know you and i always talked about going there theyd read a book about the mayan language and the linguists who trooped through the jungles in belize on the yucatan to examine the ruins and decipher the indian code the area had fascinated them both and they planned a trip but theyd never made the journey at first they couldnt afford it tate had just graduated from law school and started working as a judges clerk for less money than a good legal secretary could make then came the long long hours in the commonwealths attorneys office after that when they had the money saved up betts sister had a serious relapse and nearly died bett couldnt leave home then megan came along and three years after that they were divorced when did you go he asked three years ago january didnt megan tell you no i went with bill the lobbyist tate shook his head not remembering who he was he asked have a good time oh yeah she said haltingly very nice it was hotter than hades really hot but you like the heat he remembered did you see the ruins well bill wasnt into ruins so much we did see one we took a day trip i well i was going to sayi wished youd been with me two years ago february tate said what i was there too no are you serious she laughed hard whod you go with her face grew wry when it took him a moment to remember the name of his companion cathy he believed it was cathy did you get to the ruins well we didnt exactly it was more of a sail boarding trip i dont believe it damn how bout that we finally got down there we talked about that vacation for years our pilgrimage great place he said wondering how dubious his voice sounded our hotel had a really good restaurant it was fun she said enthusiastically and pretty very pretty he confirmed the trip had been agonizingly dull her face was turned toward a distant line of trees she was thinking probably of megan now and the yucatan had slipped far from her thoughts let me take you home he said theres nothing more we can do tonight we should get some rest ill call konnie tell him about sharpe she nodded they drove to fairfax and he pulled up in front of her house she sat in the front seat in silence for a while you want to come in she asked suddenly his answer was balanced on the head of a pin and for a long moment he didnt have a clue which way it was going to tilt tate pulled her to him hugged her smelled the scent of opium perfume in her hair he said better not crazy megan reveals her true self she isnt crazy at all and never has been what cm is is furious hes going down she mutters this asshole peter is going down hard megan mccall was angry too but she was much less optimistic than her counterpart as she moved cautiously through the corridors of the hospital clutching three boxes of plastic dining utensils under her arm and her glass knife in the other though she was feeling better physically having eaten half a box of her favorite cerealraisin branand drunk two pepsis listening there she heard a shuffle a few steps of peters feet maybe a whisper of breath another shuffle a voice was he muttering her name yes no she couldnt tell this could be it got a good grip on the knife be quiet megan thought she shivered and felt a burst of nausea from the fear wished she hadnt eaten so fast if i puke hell hear and thatll be it she inhaled slowly a clunk nearby more footsteps these were close megan gasped and closed her eyes remaining completely still huddling behind an orange fiberglass chair she pressed into the wall and began mentally working her way through janis joplins greatest hits album line by line she cried noiselessly throughout me and bobby mcgee then grew defiant once more when she mindsang down on me peter matthews wandered away back toward his room and she continued on ten endless minutes later she made it to the end of the corridor shed decided to use it was here that she was going to lay the trap she needed a dead endshe had to be sure of which direction hed come from crazy megan points out though that it also means shell have no escape route if the trap doesnt work whos the pussy now megan asked like excuse me cm snaps in response just letting you know she rubbed her hand over the wall sheetrock megan had recalled one time shed been at her fathers house a few years ago hed been dating a woman with three children as usual hed been thinking about marrying herhe always did that it was so weirdandd gone so far as to actually hire a contractor to divide the downstairs bedroom into two smaller ones for her young twins halfway through the project theyd broken up the construction went unfinished but megan recalled watching the contractors easily slice through the sheetrock with small saws the material had seemed as insubstantial as cardboard she took a plastic dinner knife from the box it was like a toy tool and for a moment the hopelessness of her plan overwhelmed her but then she started to cut yes in five minutes shed sliced a goodsized slit into the wall the blades were sharper than shed expected for about fifteen minutes the cutting went well then almost all at once the serrated edge of the knife wore smooth and dull she tossed it aside and took a new one started cutting again she lowered her head to the plasterboard and inhaled its stony moist smell it brought back a memory of joshua shed helped him move into his cheap apartment near george mason university the workmen were fixing holes in the walls with plasterboard and this smell reminded her of his studio tears flooded into her eyes whatre you doing an impatient crazy megan asks i miss him megan answered silently shut up and saw time for that later cutting cutting blisters formed on the palm of her right hand she ignored them and kept up the hypnotic motion resting her forehead against the sheetrock smelling mold and wet plaster hand moving back and forth by itself thoughts tumbling thinking about her parents thinking about bears no bears cant talk but that didnt mean you couldnt learn something from them she thought of the whispering bears story the illustration in the book of the two big animals watching the town burn to the ground megan thought about the point of the story she liked her version better than dr matthewss the moral to her was people fuck up but it didnt have to be that way somebody in the village could have said right up front bears cant talk forget about em then the story would have ended and they lived happily ever after working with her left hand now which was growing a crop of its own blisters her knees were on fire and her forehead too which shed pressed into the wall for leverage her back also was in agony but megan mccall felt curiously buoyant from the food and caffeine inside her from the simple satisfaction of cutting through the wall from the fact that she was doing something to get out of this shithole megan was thinking too about what shed do when she got out dr matthews had tricked herto get her to write those letters but the awesome thing was that what shed written had been true oh she was pissed at her parents and those bad feelings had been bottled up in her forever it seemed but now they were out they werent gone no but they were buzzing around her head getting smaller like a blownup balloon you let go of and she had a thought the anger goes away the love doesnt not if its real and she thought maybe just maybewith tate and bettthe love might be real or at least she might unearth a patch of real love and once she understood that she could recall other memories thinking of the time she and her father went to pentagon city on a spurofthemoment shopping spree and hed let her drive the lexus back home saying only the speedometer stops at one forty and you pay any tickets yourself theyd opened the sunroof and laughed all the way home or the time she and her mother went to some boring new age lecture after fifteen minutes bett had whispered lets blow this joint theyd snuck out the back door of the school found a snow saucer in the playground and huddled together on it whooping and screaming all the way to the bottom of the hill then theyd raced each other to starbucks for hot chocolate arid brownies and she even thought of her sweet sixteen party the only time in how longfive six years shed seen her parents together for a moment theyd stood close to each other near the buffet table while her father gave this awesome speech about her shed cried like crazy hearing his words for a few minutes they seemed like a perfectly normal family if i get home she now thought no when i get home ill talk to them ill sit down with them oh ill give em flicking hell but then ill talk ill do what i shouldve done a long lime ago the anger goes away the love doesnt a blister burst oh that hurt oh jesus she closed her eyes and slipped her hand under her arm and pressed hard the sting subsided and she continued to cut after a half hour megan had cut a sixbythreefoot hole in the sheetrock she worked the piece out and rested it against the floor then leaned against the wall for a few minutes catching her breath she was sweating furiously the hole was ragged and there was plaster dust all over the floor she was worried that peter would see it and guess shed set a trap for him but the window at this end of the corridor was small and covered with grease and dirt very little light made it through she doubted that the boy would ever see the trap until it was too late she snuck back to where his fatheror someonehad bricked up the entrance to the administration area of the hospital and quietly started carting cinder blocks back to the trap struggling under their weight when shed lugged eight bricks back to the corridor she began stacking them in the hole shed cut balancing them on top of one another slightly off center megan then used her glass knife and sliced strips off the tail of her shirt she knotted them into a tenfoot length of rope and tied one end to one of the blocks in the stack finally she placed the piece of sheetrock back in the opening and examined her work shed lead peter back here and when he walked past the trap shed pull the rope a hundred pounds of concrete would crash down on top of him shed leap on him with the knife and stab himshe decided she couldnt kill him but would slash his hands and feetto make sure he couldnt attack or chase her then shed demand the keys and run like hell megan walked softly down to the main corridor and looked back couldnt see anything except the tail of rope now she just needed some bait guess thats gonna be us right she asked speaking out loud though in a whisper who else crazy megan answers bett mccall poured herself a glass of chardonnay and kicked her shoes off she was so accustomed to the dull thud of the bass and drums leaching through the floor from megans room upstairs that the absence of the sound of stone temple pilots or santana brought her to tears its so frustrating she thought people can deal with almost anything if they can talk about it you argue you make up and live more or less comfortably for the rest of your lives or you discover irreconcilable differences and you slowly separate into different worlds or you find that youre soul mates but if the person you love is physically goneif you cant talkthen you have less than nothing its the worst kind of pain the house hummed and tapped silently a motor somewhere clicked the computer in the next room emitted a pitch slightly higher than the refrigerators the sounds of alone maybe shed fake a bath bett thought no that would remind her of the soap dish megan was going to give her maybe the phone rang heart racing she leapt for it praying that it was megan please please let it be her i want to hear her voice so badly or at least tate but it was neither disappointed at first she listened to the caller nodding growing more and more interested in what she heard all right she said sure no a half hour would be finethank you really thank you after she hung up she dropped heavily into the couch and sipped her wine wonderful she thought feeling greatly relieved after talking to him for only three minutes the caller was megans other therapista colleague of dr hansons a doctor named bill peters and he was coming over to speak to her about the girl he didnt have any specific news but he wanted to talk to her about her daughters disappearance hed sounded so reassuring so comforting she was curious only about one thing that the doctor had said during his call why did he want to see her alone without tate there iii the devils advocate when you called bett mccall confessed i was a little uneasy of course the man said walking into the room dr bill peters seemed confident comfortable with himself he had a handsome face his eyes latched onto betts and radiated sympathy what a terrible terrible time for you its a nightmare im so sorry he was a tall man but walked slightly stooped his arms hung at his side a benign smile on his face bett mccall short and slight was continually aware of the power of body stature and posture though she was a foot shorter and much lighter she feltfrom his withdrawing stance alonethat he was one of the least threatening men shed ever met he looked approvingly at the house megan said you were a talented interior designer i didnt know quite how talented though bett felt a double burst of pleasure that he liked her painstaking efforts to make her house nice but much more significant to her that megan had actually complimented her to a stranger then the memory of the letter came back and her mood darkened she asked have you heard about dr hanson that terrible thing with his mother dr peters face clouded its got to be a mixup ive known him for years he glanced at a crystal ball on her bookshelf hes been an advocate for assisted suicide and i think he did talk about it with his mother you do but i think she misinterpreted what he said you know that a nurse said his mother lifted the hypodermic off a medicine cart bett considered this maybe tate had been wrong about somebody framing dr hanson to get him into jail and unavailable to speak to them doctor oh call me bill please is he a good therapist dr hanson the therapist examined a framed tapestry from france mounted above the couch why was he hesitating to answer hes very good yes dr peters said after a moment in certain areas what was your impression of him well she said weve never met you havent he seemed surprised he hasnt talked to you about megan no should he have well maybe with his mothers accident hes had a lot on his mind but that just happened this week bell pointed out megans been seeing him for nearly two months in his face she could see that he couldnt really defend his friend well frankly i think he should have talked to you i would have but he and i have very different styles mrs mccall bett please betty betty sue she smiled and then blushed hoped he couldnt see it thankful for the dimmed lighting all right deep dark secret the names beatrice susan mccall my sister your twin megan told me thats right shes susan beatrice we were named dyslexically i cant tell you how many years we plotted revenge against mom and dad for that little trick he laughed say could i trouble you for a glass of water of course she noticed that he examined her brieflythe light black jeans and black blouse wild earrings dangled crescent moons and shooting stars she started toward the kitchen come on in here would you rather have a soda or wine no thanks oh look he picked up a bottle of mietz merlot which brad had bought for them last week and they hadnt gotten around to drinking yet he glanced at the eighteendollar price tag funny i just bought a case of this its a wonderful wine eighteens a great price i paid twentyone a bottleand that was supposed to be a discount you know the vineyard brad said its real hard to find it is she said lets open it youre sure yep bett was happy to impress him she opened and poured the wine they touched glasses do you live in the area she asked in fairfax near the courthouse its a nice place only therere a lot of law offices around there and i get these lawyers coming and going at all hours drives me crazy sometimes she gave a brief laugh he lifted an eyebrow shed been thinking of all the nights tate had spent in that very neighborhood interviewing prisoners and police and getting home at ten or eleven tate your ex right im afraid hes one of them working late i mean oh thats right megan told me he was an attorney but he doesnt live in fairfax does he didnt she tell me hes got a farm somewhere prince william but his office is here dr peters smiled and examined the collection of refrigerator magnets that she and megan had collected it pinched her heart to see them and she had to look away before the tears started he asked her some questions about the interior design business in virginia it turned out his mother had been a decorator where she asked boston no kidding thats where the mccalls are from she pointed to some pictures of her family in front of old ironsides and in their front yard the prudential building towering over the skyline in the background sure he said i thought i detected a bit of accent im driving the car to the party she laughed you miss it he asked no we moved here when i was ten the south definitely appeals to me more than new england to the extent this is the south he offered thats true he took her glass and refilled it he handed it back and leaned against the island glanced at the expensive stainlesssteel utensils i love to cook he said its a hobby of mine me too its relaxing to open some wine come out to the kitchen and start slicing and dicing he lifted the heavy sabatier butcher knife and tested the edge carefully with his thumb nodded sharp knives are safer than dull ones she said my mother taught me that mine too he said weighing the knife in his hand for a moment studying the blade carefully then he set it on the table should we go back in the other room sure he nodded toward the door she preceded him into the living room bett sat on the couch and he walked over to the bookshelves looked at her collection of crystals and several boxes of tarot cards he chided didnt you know youre supposed to keep your tarot cards wrapped in silk you know about that she laughed sure do i was really into the occult a long time ago she smiled and realized that she was relaxing for the first time all day i was kind of crazy when i was young you look embarrassed you shouldnt be i think our spiritual sides as important as our physical and our psychic sides i use a holistic approach in my treatment a lot of times ill prescribe herbsthey have both organic and psychosomatic effects i try to use them whenever i can bett said if my patients need something id rather it was saintjohnswort instead of prozac he was a doctor who felt this way how often had she explained these things to doctors or to friends or to tate only to be met with a politely wary gazeat best dr peters continued it makes a lot of sense to me take tarot cards do they predict the future well in a way they do they make us look at who we are where we fit in with the godhead or the oversoul oh you know emerson she asked pointing to a book of his writings dr peters walked to it and pulled the volume off the shelf he flipped through it held up the book and showed her the title of an essay the oversoul ive been reading him since college i think fortunetelling makes us look at where we fit in with the life force what our relationships are like makes us question where were going that has to affect our future thats true she said feeling warm and comfortable she sipped more wine thats what ive always felt most people dont get it they just make fun of the madame zostras fortunetelling stuff its not fair my ex but she decided to let the thought die and dr peters didnt push her to finish the doctor was looking at her bookshelf head cocked sideways pointing out volumes ah joseph campbell thats very good sure sureyou know jung sort of not really about the archetypes there are certain persistent myths we see surfacing in peoples lives the arthurian legendyou know it know it she thought laughing to herself i lived it t h white camelot the whole thing she pointed out an old copy of the once and future king what a book that is he said oh and the mists of avalon nodding at the book the best she said enthusiastically remembering how tate didnt have time for any of this she found the old angers and resentments churning up again and recalled how much comfort shed found in the new age world here was a man who truly understood her it was so refreshing dr peters tapped his glass to hers and they sipped her glass was nearly empty yet she didnt feel drunk she felt elated he sat down close to her um bert i dont know how much megan told you about me nothing really but she didnt want to talk about her therapy sessions thats what we were going to do today tate and i meet her for lunch and find out how it was going he nodded he was really quite a handsome man well built interior designer bett mccall thought proportions are everything dr hanson saw her more frequently than i did but i wanted to come over tonight and just talk to you about her a little try to reassure you oh ill take that anything you want to give me in the reassurance department ill take have you heard anything from her he asked not a word but there are some funny things going on what sort of things we think maybe somebody was following her my husband my exhusband thinks it might have to do with a case hes working on he thinks the man hes suing is trying to distract him or something i dont know any what would they say on nypd blue any concrete leads not really but tates been in touch with a friend of his at the police oh is that the detective who called me he asked me a few questions about megan um whats his name again konstantinatis right well he continued pouring more wine i think you should know what i told him whats that that i dont think shes in any danger oh did she say something to you about running away bett asked quickly youd tell me if she did ordinarily thatd be confidential but yes i would tell you and she didnt say anything specific about it though she was always talking about going to a big city like san francisco or new york they found an amtrak timetable in her car shed marked trains to new york he nodded as if a mystery had been explained id guess thats what happened no id say im positive thats what happened i really doubt there are stalkers or bogeymen out to get her whyre you so sure he didnt answer her instead he said i think we need more wine ill get it okay sure dr peters vanished into the kitchen he returned a moment later sat down and poured after a moment he asked how does your husband feel about his daughter tates she groped for words he supplied one indifferent yes hes never been very involved with megan i understand that but why she now looked at the crystal ball in it was captured the orange glow from a wall lamp she stared at the distorted trapezoid of light and said tate wanted to be his grandfather he was a famous lawyer and judge in the area he had a big family a traditional lifestyle well tate wanted thatand a good dependable farmwife she lifted her hands and slapped her thighs he got me instead big disappointment no thats not you the doctor smiled wryly i can see that that was very unfair to you for him to expect that to me she asked unfair of course he offered as if it were obvious your husband had a distorted level of expectationsbased on a childs view of the past and he tried to project that onto you ill bet he worked a lot spent time away from home he did yes but i was busy too my sister was sick her heart condition oh she could talk to this man for hours shed met him only thirty minutes ago and yet he knew her knew her better than tate dideven after all those years of marriage thats right but why are you taking the blame youre attractive intelligent have a mind of your own if you wanted an independent life why should you feel bad about that it seems to me that hes the one to blame for all this he went into the marriage knowing who you were and tried to change you and probably in some lessthanhonest ways less than honest he appeared supportive ill bet he probably said honey do whatever you want to do ill be behind it she was stunned it was as if dr peters were looking directly into her memories yes thats exactly what hed say but in fact what he was doing was the opposite little comments even body language thatd whittle away at your spirit he wanted you barefoot and pregnant and wanted you to give up your life have dinner on the table for him give him a brood of kids ignore your ill sister and he was going to make a name for himself as a prosecutor and to hell with everybody else his eyes flickered with painher pain it was horrible what he did to you inexcusable but i suppose its understandable his character you know character you know the old expression a mans character is his fate thats your exhusband hes reaping now what he sowed with megan running away i wish i could believe that bett thought please tears now from the wine from the astonishing comfort she felt years and years of pain and confusion and loneliness being stripped away i she caught her breath hed sit down and talk to me and say that he loved me and what could he do for me tricks dr peters said quickly all tricks i couldnt argue with him he had an answer for everything hes smooth isnt he a slick talker megan told me that oh you better believe it i couldnt win against him not at words never i always came away feeling i dont know violated i guess bett most women wouldve put up with that they wouldve stayed and stayed and destroyed themselves and their children but you had the courage to do something about it to strike out on your own but megan shes suffered suffered he laughed because of him yes not because of you youve done a miraculous job with her heres to you he tapped her glass and they drank the room was swimming she realized hed moved very close to her and she enjoyed the proximity a miraculous job bett shook her head felt her eyes swimming with tears oh i dont think so dr peters said firmly why if every mother cared for her children the way you care for megan id be out of business do you really think that she asked in a choked voice the tears were coming fast now but she wasnt the least embarrassed not in front of this man she could tell him anything she could do anything hed understand hed forgive hed comfort she said wistfully too bad megan doesnt think so oh but she does he frowned in confusion no no theres a letter she glanced toward her purse where the girls horrible note sat like a puddle of cold blood the detective told me about it thats the main reason why i wanted to see you alone without your husband here he took the wineglass from her and set it on the table then he sat forward took her hands in his looked at her until she was gazing into his dark eyes nearly hypnotized listen to me listen carefully she didnt mean what she wrote you she she didnt mean it do you hear what im saying bett was shaking with sobs but what she wrote it was so terrible no he said in a firm whisper no he was completely focused on her she thought of the other men in her life with whom shed had serious talks tate was often elsewherethinking of cases or trying to dissect what she was saying brad would smother her with an adoring gaze but dr peters was looking at her as a person heres what you have to understand your letter doesnt mean anything oh please she thought please explain how this happened please explain to me why im not a witch please explain how my daughter still loves me she thought of an expression shed heard once and believed was true youd kill for your mate but youd die for your child well i would she thought if only megan knew that she felt that way he squeezed her hands your daughter hates your husband i dont know what the genesis of that is but its a very deeply ingrained feeling bett felt the impossibility of compressing seventeen years into a few minutes her eye went to a board game monopoly sitting dusty on the shelf there were so many things she wanted from tate megan wanted us to play games together tate her and me but he never would and then it doesnt matter the doctor interrupted the fact is that she was the child and he was the parent and he failed her megan knows it and she hates him the anger inside her is astonishing but its only directed at himi guarantee you that she loves you so much shaking with tears but the letter you know the oedipus and electra principles the attractions of sons and mothers and daughters and fathers a little i guess in megans subconscious her anger at your exhusband makes her feel terribly guilty and directing it only at him is intolerable with the natural attraction between fathers and daughters she either had to write no letter at all or write you both she was psychically unable to point her anger only at its true source oh if i could believe that during our sessions she was always telling me how proud she was of you how she wants to be like you how hard a life youve had i promise you without a doubt she regrets writing that letter to you she doesnt mean it shed give anything to take it back bett lowered her head and put her face in her hands why was the room swimming so badly his arm went around her shoulders you okay she nodded will she be coming back bett asked i dont doubt it for a minute it might be awhileyour husbands caused some serious damage but nothing thats irreparable megan knows that she couldnt ask for a better mother in the world youve done everything right she loves you and misses you bett sagged against his chest felt the muscles in his arms tighten as he held her oh when was the last time shed felt this good this easy this comforted years she felt his hot breath on the top of her head she smelled a faint aftershave i feel so lightheaded did she say that or think it she wept and she laughed the doctors hand went to her forehead youre so hot he hugged her harder and his hand slid downward fingers encircling her neck an electric chill went through her and then her arms were snaking around him pulling him to her her head was up and she pressed her cheek against his no no she thought i cant be doing this but she was thinking these words from a very different place very remote and it was impossible for her to release her grip on the man whod repaired her bleeding soul he thinks im a good mother he thinks im a good mother he thinks he leaned down and kissed her tears the light touch of his lips felt so good she was so giddy so happy stretching out getting comfortable the room was hot the room was wonderful and what was this she thought like an excited high school girl he was kissing her on the mouth or am i kissing him bert didnt know all she knew was that she wanted to be close to him to the man whod found her single worst fear and killed it dead no he protested but his voice was a whisper but she was not letting him go she knew she should stop but she couldnt she pulled him down next to her on the couch refusing to let go arms fixed forever around his neck the room filling with heat spinning orange lights yellow eights kissing harder now hands on her belly then her chest she glanced down and wasnt surprised to see her blouse was undone her bra up his fingers cupping her breast this seemed completely natural a pop the snap of her jeans opened had he done that or had she it didnt matter getting close to him was all that mattered hearing him whisper whatever he would whisper in her ear as he lay on top of her that was what she wanted hearing him speak to her the sex wasnt important but shed gladly give him that if only hed keep reassuring her keep speaking to her she opened her mouth and kissed him hard and then the world ended the front door was swinging open and a familiar voice was crying bettwhy bett gasping she sat up dr peters backing away a shocked look on his face brad markham stood in the doorway his face a horrified mask his key to her house dropped to the floor with a loud ring what he was breathless what brad i thought i was in baltimore he spat out he shook his head i was a policeman called and told me about megan i drove down to be with youyour daughters missing and youre fucking somebody youre cheating on me no she said feeling faint and nauseous from the wine and shock tears coming again tears of horror you dont understand i didnt mean it i didnt know what i was doing im sorry dr peters looked horrified i didnt know you had a boyfriend you never said anything boyfriend brad spat out were engaged youre what the doctor stared at brad im so sorry she never said anything how could you brad spat out raging at her after everything ive done for you and megan how could you i dont know what happened brad stalked outside leaving the door open no bett cried sobbing pulling her bra down and buttoning her blouse as she stumbled toward the door wait through her tears she saw brads car squeal off down the street leaning against the doorjamb sobbing sinking to the floor close to fainting wishing to die no no no then the doctor was standing next to her crouching down his mouth close to her ear when he spoke the voice was so different from the soothing drone of ten minutes ago it was flint it was ice water what i told you megan said about you that wasnt true i only said it to make you feel better all she told me was that you were a selfish whore i didnt believe her but i guess she was right he took a final sip of wine what a pitiful excuse for a mother you are the doctor rose set the glass on the table and stepped over her out the door it seemed he was smiling though bett was blinded by the tears and couldnt say for certain tate collier hung up the phone sighed no man josh still isnt home i dont know where he is you called like three times already maybe well give it a rest now okay well where the hell was megans boyfriend konnie too was still out of the office and it irked tate that the detective hadnt returned his page he fed the dalmatian and paced up and down his front porch looking at the clear early evening skies and the dusting of april growth over his fields no more dead rebs that he could see again his eye settled on the dilapidated picnic bench in the backyard remembering bett unhooking the japanese lanterns feeling the odd heat of that fall so many years ago feeling the residual exhaustion from the funeral sweating in november the hot wind pushing crisp curled leaves over the shaggy grass he remembered bett looking down at him asking what is it alarmed as she gazed at the expression on his face what is it what is it what is it a simple question yet simple words cant convey the answerthat two people who were once in love no longer are hed closed his eyes i dont want to be married to you anymore hed said goodbye tate now looked away from the bench and glanced impatiently at the cordless phone sitting on the porch swing why wasnt it rang he blinked and snagged it from the cradle hello silence for a moment then tate im here bett whats wrong his heart went cold at the sound in her voice im on my way to baltimore you are why more silence brad left me what at a time like this its not his fault i did something stupid i dont know i dont want to go into it its oh jesus its a mess bett you sound terrible are you crying i cant talk about it not now whenll you be back what about megan i dont care he heard utter defeat in her voice what do you mean oh tate weve blown it theres nothing we can do weve ruined her life shes ruined ours maybe shell come back maybe she wont lets just let her go and hope for the best i dont care anymore this doesnt sound like you well it is me all right it was stupid looking for her it was stupid getting together like this you and me we should have kept our lives on different sides of the universe tate whatve we got to show for it just pain were going to find her she doesnt want to be found dont you get that let her go and dont worry about it shes part of the past tate let her go the phones breaking up im coming to a tunnel goodbye tate goodbye bait thats me yes sir thats me hes on to you crazy megan says move move move she went to the right and peter matthews went to the right left and left straight and straight getting closer all the time whispering megan megan megan other words too she wasnt sure but she thought he was muttering i want to fuck you i want to fuck you or maybe cut you megan was part of his fantasy now she was a victim from those disgusting comic books the tentacles the monsters the purple dicks the claws and pincers and was nothing more than a game to the boyif you can call a sixfoot twohundredpound thing a boy as she moved up and down the corridors gripping the handle of her glass knife in her right hand which stung fiercely from the blisters she had all sorts of terrible thoughts why the father had brought her here for instance as a bride for his son jesus maybe aaron matthews had wanted grandchildren maybe peterd been at jefferson high they had a special ed departmentand hed gotten obsessed with her that might be it and his father had kidnapped her to be a present for his son down the corridor toward the kitchen scuffling muttering but no sight of him down the corridor that led past the door to the basement the lock looked flimsy but not that flimsy breaking it open would make a hell of a noise and what was down there anyway no crazy megan tells her stick to your plan hes gotta go down well one of us does thought the less confident half of the duo keep going keep looking for him up and down the dim halls it didnt seem that late but the hospital was in a valley and the sun was behind a mountain to the west the whole place was bathed in cold blue light and she was having trouble seeing she stopped the boys footsteps were getting closer this is it crazy megan says just stab the flicker in the back and get it over with but megan reminded her that she couldnt do that as much as she hated him she couldnt kill he wants to fuck you he wants to pretend hes one of those insect monsters and fuck you till you bleed you have to be quiet im doing the best i can closer the steps got closer the sound coming from around the corner she didnt have time to get into the main corridorhe was too close she stepped into a little nook trapped he moved closer paused maybe hearing her maybe smelling her hed stopped whispering her name which scared her more because he knew he was close to his prey and didnt want to be heard he was sneaking rip on her he was playing the invisible monster shed seen that story in one of the comic books some creature you couldnt see snuck into girls locker rooms and raped stragglers after gym class the comic had been limp as if peterd read that one a thousand times he moved forward another few cautious steps her hand started to shake should she jump out into the corridor and just run like hell but he couldnt be more than ten feet away and hed looked so big in the photographs he could lunge like a snake and grab her by the throat in two steps suddenly a flash of pain went through her handfrom one of the blistersand she dropped the knife gasped involuntarily megan froze watching the knife tumble to the floor it cant break no just before the icy glass hit the floor she shoved her foot under it waiting for the pain as the tip of the blade sliced into the top of her foot thunk the knife hit her right foot flat and rolled unbroken to the floor thank you thank you she bent down and picked it up another two footsteps closer closer no choice she had to run he was only three or four feet away megan took a deep breath another jump out slash with the knife and run like hell toward the trap now she leapt out turned to the right froze gasping her ears had played tricks on her no one was there then she looked down the rata large one big as a catstanding on his haunches sniffing the air blinked at her cowering then indignantly it turned away as if angry at being startled megan sagged against the wall tears welling as the fear dissipated but she didnt have much time for recovery at the far end of the dim corridor a shadow materialized into the loping form of peter matthews hunched over and moving slowly he didnt see her and disappeared from view megan paused for only a few seconds before she started after him the shenandoahs and blue ridge keep the air in northwest virginia clean as glass in the spring and when the sun sets its a fierce disk bright as an orange spotlight newscasters report on sun delays from the glare at various places on the highway this radiant light behind tate lit every detail in the trees and buildings and oncoming cars as he sped down i at eighty miles an hour he skidded north on the parkway then east on route pulled into the county police station house and climbed out of the car he practically ran into dimitri konstantinatis as he too happened to arrive carrying two large kentucky fried chicken bags ohoh the detective muttered what ohoh that look on your face i dont have a look tate protested you had it comin into my office when you were prosecutor and you needed that little bit of extra evidencewhichd mean id lose a weekend and youve got it now that ohoh they walked inside the building and into konnies small office you didnt call me back tate said did so ten minutes ago you musta left whats that tate set the letter megan had written him and the knucklebone hed found in his house that morning both in baggies on the cops desk prints tate said a prince among menyes i am so whats going on i want you to run the letter through identification somethings up betts acting funny you complained about that when you were married konnie pointed out crystals mumbo jumbo long distance calls to peopled been dead a hundred years that was cute funny thiss weird funny witnessesve been disappearing and not calling back and its just too much of a coincidence and i think i know whos behind it he also told konnie about his runin with jack sharpe ooo that was bright counselor and you were packing your gun to boot tate shrugged was your idea for me to get one but it wasnt my idea to threaten an upstanding member of the prince william mafia with it grant me that at least ive been on his bad side since i routed his lawyers at the injunction hearing last week whats wrong with a nice theme park round here tate youd rather have what we got now in manassas a track fulla big wheels slugging it out in a mud pit id vote for disneyland with them fun rides and cotton candy and knocktheclowninthewater shit im just telling you that jack sharpe would love for me to be out of commission come that argument at the supreme court in richmond next week and i think hes had somebody in a van following me sorry no tag no model konnie nodded slowly then added but hes got boys hed hire for that and they could hire other boys no way could you trace it back to him and you think anybodyd snitch on jack sharpe im not a prosecutor anymore konnie i dont want to make a case i want to find megan period end of story and kneecap the prick who did it tate pushed the bags containing the letter and the bone toward konnie again please another mournful glance at his cooling dinner be right back wait tate handed him another baggie exemplars of megans prints on the keys and mine on that glass and remember you handled the note too konnie nodded the prosecutor in you aint dead i see carrying the bags he walked down the hail toward the forensic lab he returned a moment later wont be long i was looking forward to supper tate ignored the redandwhite keg bag and continued now there was a gray mercedes following her can you check that out check what out registered owners of gray mercedeses i was asking before year model tag still none konnie laughed he typed heavily on his computer keyboard thisll be worth it just to see your expression as he waited for the results konnie peeked into the tallest kentucky fried bag kneaded his ample stomach absently you know what the worst is the worst is when the mashed potatoes get cold you can eat the chicken when its cold because everybody does that on a picnic say same with the beans but when mashed potatoes get cold you have to throw them out which is bad enough but then you think about them all nighthow good they wouldve been thats what i mean by the worst the screen fluttered konnie leaned forward heres what we got i did fairfax arlington alexandria prince william and loudoun mercedes all types all years gray tate leaned forward and read your request has resulted in responses two thousand tate muttered man in two thousand six hundred tate knew from his prosecuting days that too much evidence was as useless as too little if youre just not buying the runaway stuffkonnie sighed were gonna have to do more thinking all right you think sharpes a possibility and i dont think hes above snatching a girl but there anybody else think hard now tate anybody hassling her recently like last years weirdoes dont count konnie snorted whenever not that i know of i have to say there was a rumor it was just a rumor she mightve been seeing well having sex with some older men and maybe there was some money involved i mean they were paying her if konnie felt anything about this he didnt show it you have any idea who where some kids at this place called the coffee shop they been trying to close that piss hole down for a year well i can poke around there ask some questions now was she in any cults or anything no dont think so you or bell in anything like that me all right your wife ex tate corrected whatever she did that sort of stuff it was strictly softball with her no heavens gate or jonestown or anything like that bett wouldnt even put up these indian posters because they had reverse swastikas on them nothing to do with nazis she just thought it was bad karma karma konnie scoffed any relationships of yours go south in a big way recently i fore you answer think back to every one of them twentyoneyearolds you promised diamonds to and then ran for the hills i never proposed to a single one tate said never proposed to marry em maybe you dont get fatal attraction after three dates thats about the longest term i went sad tate sad how bout bett i dont know but i dont think so any relatives acting squirrelly mightve wanted to take the girl and run only relative nearbys betts sister susan outside of baltimore shed never do anything to hurt her hell she was always joking about adopting megan this got konnies attention adopting her you sure shes not involved in this maybe she went over the edge decided to get herself a daughter imagine bett but fifteen pounds lighter she couldnt kidnap a bird but she couldve hired somebody to she could have a wacko boyfriend i just cant see it konnie gimme her name anyway tate wrote it down okay how bout any business associates of either of yall clients or the bad guys other than sharpe betts got this interior design business i dont think her clientsre the sort for this kind of thing me all ive been doing are wills trusts and house closingsexcept for the liberty park case konnie grunted the detective got a call grabbed the phone nodded slammed it down interesting that was the lab only her prints and yours on the bone and mine yours and hers on the letter but there were some smudges on the bone that mightve been from latex gloves cant say for certain but that starts rue wondering think its about time to do a title three a wiretap yours and your wifes phones both ex you keep saying that broken record thats in case you get a ransom call i thought this wasnt a case its becoming one tell me again what happened this morning at your place i mean exact tate remembered this about konnie he was a working dog when it came to dredging for evidence and hammering on suspects and witnesses only exhaustion would slow him downand even then it never stopped him tate gave another recap of the events so you never actually saw her at your house no tate said i got back home about ten am from the office then got suited up and went to check on a busted pipe the sharecroppers there no not on saturday i never saw anybody at all just the lights go out around tentwenty all of em yeah didnt you think that was funny no megan doesnt like bright lights she likes candlelight and dimmers this gave tate a burst of pleasureproving to konnie that he knew something about the girl after all it was dark as pitch this morning the detective mused with all that rain most peopled want some light youd think less they didnt want to be seen from the outside true and shit tate wait a minute whyd she go to your place at all to leave the letters and get the backpack well doesnt she have any suitcases or book bags at your wifes sorry your exs your deevorced spouses sure she does youre right most of them are there as a matter of fact and she had her book bag with her at amys and a lot more clothes and makeup at betts place than mine the cop continued you and megan hardly ever saw each other true again so you wouldnt go into her room much would you once a month maybe so whyd she leave the letters there why not at her mothers that wouldve made more sense true the detective added and hell why go to the house and leave some letters this morning around the time you were going to meet her i tell you if i was going to leave a note to diss my folks and run id leave it someplace they werent going to be dontcha think so he made her write em and planted them himself whoever he is thats what i think counselor heres what im gonna do order some serious forensic work and then have a chat with the captain guess what thiss just become a case and in a big way konnie pulled a drumstick from the bag and charged down the hall tate returned home no messages and no one had called the caller id box was blank twelve hours ago he had wanted megan and bett out of his life again hed gotten his wish and he didnt like it one bit so brad had left bett he didnt know what to make of that why and why now he had a feeling that whoever was behind megans disappearance was behind this too then his thoughts segued to belize the trip he and bett had planned to take a second honeymoon well a first honeymoon technicallysince theyd never taken one after their wedding he looked out over the dark sky at the spattering of a million stars tate laughed to himself what a kick if theyd run into each other he wondered how bell would have reacted to karen no cathy probably not well not a jealousy thing so much as a matter of approval shed never liked his taste in women well tate didnt either now that he looked back at his lovers over the past ten years belize was there actually a possibility that he and bett might take that trip together stillafter they found megan whatever happened with brad the presence of a fiancé didnt seem as insurmountable as simply the concept of tate and bett taking a trip together at one time their joined names had been a common phrase among their friends but that was a long long time ago yetthis was feelings again not cartesian logicyet somehow he believed that theyd get along just fine the fight today had been as bad as any theyd had fifteen years ago and yet thered been a reconciliation this astonished him that never would have happened in the past he sighed sipped his wine looked out at the dalmatian nosing about in the tall grass thinking now of megan but even if husband and wife were to get together again what would the girl come home to and more important who was the person coming home was the girls drinking and the water tower incident more than just a onetime fluke was that the real megan mccall a bitter young woman who slept with men for money or was there another person within her one tate didnt know wellor maybe one he hadnt even yet met tate collier felt a sudden desperation to know the girl to know who she was what excited her what she hated what she feared what foods she liked what clothes shed pick and which shed shun what bad tv shows shed want to watch what made her laugh and what weep and he was suddenly stung by a terrible thought that if megan had died this morning the victim of a deranged killer or an accident hed have been distraught yes terribly sad but now if that happened or the most horrifyingif she simply vanished forever never to be found at all hed be destroyed it would be one of those tragedies that breaks you forever he remembered something hed told bett when theyd been married a case he was working onprosecuting an arson murder the victim had run into a burning building to save her child whod survived though the mother had perished hed read the facts looked up to bett and said youll kill for your spouse but youll die for your child in rhetoric lawyers use the trick of personificationpicking words to make their own clients seem human and sympathetic and their opponents less so mary jones instead of the witness or the victim juries find it far easier to be harsh to abstractions the defendant the man sitting at that table there its a very effective trick and a very dangerous one and its just how ive treated megan over the years tate now thought he rose walked into the den and spent a long time looking for another picture of her he was terribly disappointed he couldnt find one hed given his only snapshot to konnie and beauridge that afternoon he sat down in his chair closed his eyes and tried to create some images now images of the girl smiling looking perplexed exasperated a few came to mind he tried harder and harder still which was why he hadnt heard the man come up behind him the cold finger of a pistol touched his temple dont move mr collier no no i really mean that for your sake dont move jimmy tate recalled his name was jimmy and he was the man whod been far more willing than tate to engage in some gunplay in jack sharpes immaculate foyer tate glanced at the phone jimmy shook his head no what do you want mr sharpe sent me figured that the gun was really very large the mans finger wasnt on the trigger it was outside of the guard this didnt reassure tate at all i have something for you to look at look at im going to give it to you to look at then im going to take it back and neither me or mr sharpell ever admit we know what youre talking about if you ever mention it you understand tate didnt understand a thing but he said sure say is that loaded jimmy didnt respond from the pocket of his leather jacket he took a videocassette set it on the table backed up nodded toward it tate walked over picked it up i should play it jimmys face scrunched up impatiently tate put the cassette in the player and fiddled with the controls until the tape started to play the scene on the tv showed a building some bushes the date and time stamp revealed that it had been made that morning at nine fortytwo he didnt recognize where the tape jumped ahead four minutes now whoever was making the tape was driving following another car down a suburban street tate recognized the car being followed it was megans tempo because of the rain he couldnt make out who was driving where did you get this tate demanded watch dont talk jimmy muttered the gun was pointed directly at tates back another jump on the tape to ninefifty that morning tate recognized the vienna metro station the man tapingof course one of the private eyes hired by sharpe despite his protests to the contrary must have been afraid of getting too close to his subject he was about fifty yards away and shooting through the mist and rain megans car stopped at a row filled with other cars there was a pause and then motion after a moment he caught a glimpse of someone a white man it seemed wearing a dark jacket though he couldnt be sure tate could see no distinguishing features then there was more motion finally a gray mercedes pulled out of a space and a moment later megans car eased into where the merce had been at the mercedes sped out of the lot the tape went fuzzy then black tate stared his heart pounding thinking of the vague motion hed seenpixels of light on the screen distorted to start with more distorted in the rain and fog but he believed it might have been the man lifting a heavy object from the trunk of megans car and putting it into the mercedes an object about the size of a human body thats all jimmy said could you eject it tate did did he see anything else he asked who jimmy asked you know who the private eye can i talk to him please jimmy nodded at the table if you could just set the tape there and backup tate did he knew he wouldnt get an answer this was as far as sharpe was willing to go but he asked one more question why did he show this to me he didnt have to jimmy pocketed the cassette gun still held steadily at tate he backed to the door mr sharpe asked me just to mention the old adage that one good deed deserves another he hopes youll remember that next thursday at the argument down in richmond look he said he didnt think youd agree he just asked me to mention it jimmy walked to the sliding door through which hed apparently entered he paused the answer to your question i myself would guess its because hes got two daughters of his own good night after hed gone tate drained his wineglass with a shaking hand and picked up the phone and dialed a number when konnie answered tate said got a lead asking or telling telling go on long story that case with sharpe right tate said it wasnt just me he had a pi tailing it was megan too why dig up dirt thats my guess lawyers daughter scores drugs sleeps around something like that anyway a friend of his just showed me a tape tate described it hot damn get it over here forget it its been atomized but i think it was megan the perp was moving from one trunk to another she was probably drugged tate prayed the girl had merely been unconscious tags nope sony damn tate whyd you think they put those cute little signs on cars after a pause konnie continued okay soyou dont think its sharpe he didnt have to show me diddly he didnt even bargainwell not too hard you know throw the case and ill tell you what the pi saw he couldve done that would youve agreed tate didnt hesitate for an instant yes i would have okay so its not sharpe then lets think shes got a stalker after her hes checking out her routine following her when she goes to school when she goes to pompom practice tate tried to picture megan as a cheerleader as if he knows where shes going to be this morning he gets her drugs her drives her to vienna where hes left his own car hes got to switch wheels the mercedes right leaves her car with the timetable so it looks like shes headed off on amtrak he took off to wherever he was going to stash her which means what counselor tate couldnt think when he said nothing konnie gave a harsh laugh damn id forgot how i had to hold your hand when we were putting all those bad guys away whats sitting right under her car at the moment tread marks the mercedess tread marks theres hope for you after all boyif you apply yourself and work real hard okay counselor thiss gonna take some time listen you sit tight and have some nice hot mashed potatoes and think of me when you eat em konnie konstantinatiss first lesson in police work was to watch his father fool the tax men like coons tricking hounds the old greek immigrant was petty weak dangerous a cross between a squirrel and a ferret he was a born liar and had an instinct for knowing human nature cold he put stills next to smokehouses stills next to factories stills in boats disguised them like henhouses hid his income in a hundred small businesses once he smoothtalked a revenuer into arresting konnies fathers own innocent brotherinlaw instead of him and swore an oath at the trial that cost the bewildered man two years of his life so from the age of five or six konnie had observed his father and had learned the art of evasion and deception and therefore hed learned the art of seeing through deceit this was a skill to be practiced slowly and tediously and this was how he was going to find the man whod kidnapped tate colliers daughter konnie arranged for a small crane to lift megans car out of its spot rather than drive it out and risk obliterating the merces tread marks he then spent the next two hours taking electrostatic prints of the twelve tire treads that he could isolate and differentiateones he determined werent from megans car he then identified the matching left and right tires and measured wheelbases and lengths of the cars theyd come from he jotted all this in lyrical handwriting into a battered leather notebook he then went over the entire parking space with a dust buster and hunched in the front seat of his carlooked over all the trace evidence picked up in the paper filter most of it was nothing more than dust and meaningless without laboratory analysis but konnie found one obvious clue a single fiber that came from cheap rope he recognized it because in one of the three kidnapping cases hed worked over the past ten years the victims hands had been bound with rope that shed fibers just like this speeding back to the office the detective sat down at his computer and ran the wheel dimensions through the motor vehicle specification database one set of numbers perfectly fit the dimensions for a mercedes sedan he examined the electrostatic prints carefully flipping through burnes tire identifier he concluded that they were a rare model of michelin and because they showed virtually no wear he guessed the tires were no more than three or four months old encouraging on the one hand because they were unusual tires and it would be easier to track down the purchaser but troubling too because they were expensive as was the model of the car the man was driving it was therefore likely that the perp was intelligent which suggested he was an organized offenderthe hardest to find and the sort of criminal that presented the most danger konnie then started canvassing it was saturday evening and although most of the tire outlets were still opengeneral tire sears merchants mercedes dealershipsthe managers had gone home but nothing as trivial as this stopped konnie he blustered and bullied until he had the names and home phone numbers of night staff managers of the stores recordkeeping and dataprocessing departments he made thirtyeight phone calls and by the time he hung up from speaking with the last parts department manager on his list faxes of bills of sale were starting to roll into police headquarters but the information wasnt as helpful as hed hoped most of the sales receipts included the manufacturer of the customers car and the tag number some had the model number but virtually none had the color the list kept growing after an hour he had copies of records of the sales of that model of michelin in the past twelve months to people who owned mercedeses he looked over the discouragingly lengthy list of names standard procedure was to run the names through the outstanding warrantsprior arrests database but a net like that didnt seem to be the sort that would catch this perphe wasnt a chronic jacker or a shooter with a long history of crime still konnie was a cop who dotted his isand he handed the stack to genie you know what to do darling its seven fortytwo on a saturday night boss the assistant pointed out you had dinner at least lemme tell you something konnie the huge woman said nodding at the kfc bags throw those out theyre starting to stink dutifully he did as he returned to his desk he grabbed his ringing phone detective konstantinatis please yeah this is special agent mccomb with the fbi child exploitation and kidnapping unit sure how you doin konnied worked with the unit occasionally they were tireless and dedicated and topnotch im doing a favor for my boss in quantico he asked me to take a look at the megan mccall case youre involved in that right yup its not an active case for us but you know tate colliers the girls father right know that well he did some pretty good work for us when he was a commonwealths attorney so i said id look into her disappearance as a favor just what im doing more or less but im gonna present it as an active case to my captain tonight are you really found some interesting forensics konnie was thinking man if i could turn the tire data over to the feds the fbi has a whole staff of people who specialize in tires thats good to know we ought to coordinate our approaches do some proactive thinking sure konnies thinking was they might be the best cops in the world but feebies talk like assholes the agent said im up at ernies near the parkway you know it sure its a half mile from me i was about to order dinner and was reading the file when i saw your name maybe i could come by in an hour or so or maybethis might appeal to you officeryou might want to join me let uncle sam pick up the dinner tab he paused for a moment why not be there in ten minutes good bring whatever youve got will do they hung up konnie stuck his head in genies office where she was looking over the warrants and arrests request results everythings negative konnie dont worry we got the feds on the case now my he took the stack of faxed receipts from her desk shoved them into his briefcase and headed out the door konnie was feeling pretty good ernies served some great mashed potatoes aaron matthews sat at a booth in a dark corner of the restaurant looking out the window at a tableau of heavy equipment bright yellow in the dusk squatting on a dirt hillside nearby this was an area that five years ago had been fields and was now rampantly overgrown with town houses and apartments and strip malls starbucks chesapeake bagels linens n things ernies restaurant fit in perfectly an upscale franchise looked nice on the surface but beneath the veneer it was all formula matthews stirred as the waddling form of detective konstantinatis entered the restaurant and maneuvered through the tables watching the mans eyes seeing where they slidfurtively guiltily always the eyes matthews waved and konstantinatis nodded and steered toward him matthews had no idea what official fbi identification looked like and wouldnt have known how to fake some if he had but hed dressed in a suit and white shirtwhat he always wore when seeing patientsand had brought several dogeared file folders on which hed printed fbi privileged and confidential with stencils hed made from office materials bought at staples these sat prominently in front of him he hoped for the best but after glancing at the files the detective merely scooted into the seat across from matthews and shook his hand they made small talk for a few momentsmatthews using his best governmentspeak stiff awkward if the fake files hadnt fooled the cop the stilted language surely would have the waitress came and they ordered matthews wasnt surprised when the detective ordered milk with dinner matthews himself ordered a beer he said im afraid we dont have many leads but from what you were telling me you think theres a chance she was kidnapped first i just thought she ran off but theres apparently a tape that shows somebody switching her car with this gray mercedes around the time she vanished and maybe hustling the girl into the trunk unconscious i see said aaron matthews who felt fire burn right through him his battleship gray sat in the parking lot fifty feet from them resplendent with its stolen license plates a tape whod taken it he was furious for a moment but anger was a luxury he had no time for youve got this tape vanished into thin air long story oh dont envy you that job the detective said looking for missing kids all day long must be hard revealing a sentimental side matthews wouldnt have guessed he had matthews said in a soft voice its where i feel i can make the most difference their drinks came they clinked glasses matthews spilled some beer on the table wiped it up sloppily with a cocktail napkin detective call me konnie everybody else does okay konnie i hate to ask but i dont know this collier and the questions come up do you think there was anything between him and the girl naw not tate if anything just the opposite hows that hell i didnt even know he had a daughter until wed been working together awhile its not that i do think somebody napped her no motive yet though might be a case tates working on hes decided this local real estate guy didnt do it but im not so sure i also have some thoughts about the girls auntapparently shes pretty jealous of her sister having a child betts sister how did konnie know about her i statted some tire treads and got a list of a hundred and a half people bought that brand of tire in the past year could i give you the receiptshe patted the briefcasehave your people check em out be happy to have you done anything with them yet just run em through the outstanding warrants and arrests nothing showed up planning for the kidnapping matthews had bought new tires for the car two months ago he couldnt afford to be slowed up by a flat at least when hed taken the car into general tire hed given a fake name and paid cash but then i got to thinking konnie continued on the way over here what i shoulda donei shoulda looked at the receipts and found out who paid cash anybody who did i figure itd be a fake name i mean those tires cost big money nobody pays cash for something like that so what your folks could do is check the tags and see if the name matcheson all the cash receipts if they dont then thats our prime suspect jesus in heaven matthews hadnt swapped plates when hed taken the car in to have the new tires mounted the tag would reveal his real name and the address of his rental house in prince william county which didnt match the fake information hed given the clerk at the tire store thats a good idea matthews said a proactive idea he sounded casual but he wanted to scream a dark mood hovered over him the food came and konnie ate hungrily hunched over his meal matthews picked at his hed have to act soon he flagged the waitress down and ordered another beer you want to give me those receipts matthews nodded at the briefcase sure but lets go back to headquarters after its right up the street here you can fax em to your office okay the second beer came konnie glanced at it for a second returned to his food this tate collier matthews said slowly savoring his microbrew sounds like a good man none better best fucking lawyer in the commonwealth i get sick of these shits getting off on technicalities when collier was arguing the case they went to jail and stayed there matthews held up the beer to your theory of tires the detective hesitated then they tapped glasses matthews drank half the beer exhaled with satisfaction and set it down hot for april dont you think is the detective grunted matthews asked you on duty now naw i been off for three hours then hell chug down that milk and let me buy you a real drink he tapped the beer no thanks come on nothing like a nice beer on a hot day fact is i gave up drinking a few years back matthews looked mortified oh im son not at all i wasnt thinking a man drinking milk shouldnt have ordered this i am sorry the cop held up a calm hand s no problem at all i dont hold with making other folk change their way of life cause of me matthews lifted the glass of beer you want me to get rid of it or anything as the cop glanced at the beer his eyes flashedthe same as they had when hed walked through the bar looking longingly at the row of bottles limed up like prostitutes on a street corner nope the detective said you cant go hiding from it he ate some more mashed potatoes then said where you find most of the runaways go matthews enjoyed each small sip of the beer the detective eyed him every third or fourth the aroma from the liquid hed spilledon purposefilled the booth with a sour malty scent always the big city what a lure new york is they think about getting jobs becoming madonna or whoever the girls want to become nowadays the boys think theyll get laid every night matthews sipped the beer again and looked outside damn hot imagine that battle bull run yep well i call it first manassas but thats because im from pennsylvania matthews enjoyed another sip you married or did the wife leave the drunk was divorced now kids or did they cut daddy off cold when they got tired of him passing out during jeopardy on weeknights and puking to die every sunday morning two wifes got em see em some holidays matthews poured down another mouthful must be tough can be the fat cop took refuge in his potatoes after a minute matthews asked so you a graduate hows that twelve steps aa sure the cop glanced down at his beefy hands been four years four months eight years for me another flicker in the eyes the cop glanced at the beer matthews laughed youre where you are konnie and im where i am i was drinking a fifth of fucking bad whiskey every day hell at least that sometimes id crack the revenue of a second bottle just after dinner konnie didnt notice how fbispeak had turned into buddy talk with syntax and vocabulary very similar to his crack the revenue konnie laughed my daddy used to say that so had some of matthewss patients bottle and a half thats a hell of a lot of drinking oh yes it was yes sir knew i was going to die so i gave it up how bad was it for you the cop shrugged and shoveled peas and potatoes into his mouth hurt my marriage bad he offered reluctantly the cop added i guess it killed my marriage sorry to hear that matthews said thrilling at the sorrow in the mans eyes and it was probably gonna kill me someday what was your drink matthews asked scotch and beer ha mine too dewars and bud konnies eyes grew troubled so you hat the cop nodded at the tallneck hot tie what happened you fell off huh matthewss face turned reverential ill tell you the gods truth konnie he took a delicious sip of beer i believe in meeting your weaknesses headon i wont run from them the cop grunted affirmatively see it seemed too easy to give up drinking completely you understand me not exactly it was the cowards way a lot of people just stop drinking altogether but thats as much a failure to me sorry dont take this personal not at all keep going im interested thats as much a failure to me as somebody who drinks all the time guess that makes some sense the cop said slowly matthews swirled the beer seductively in his glass take a man addicted to sex you know that can be a problem ive heard they got a twelvestep for that too you know right but he can hardly give up sex altogether right thatd be unnatural konnie nodded oh hes with me matthews thought hell this is like sex talking your way into a mans soul he felt so high so he continued i just got back to the point where i could control it and that worked konnie asked the toady little man seemed awestruck you betcha i stopped cold for two years just like i told myself id do this was all planned out sometimes it was tough as hell im not gonna sugarcoat it but god helped me as soon as i had it under control two years to the day i stopped i took my first drink one shot of dewars drank it down like medicine what happened nothing felt good enjoyed it didnt have another didnt have anything for a week then i had another shot and a bud i let a month go by a month konnie whispered right then i poured a glass of scotch let it sit in front of me looked at it smelled it poured it down the drain let another month go by the cop shook his head in wonder sounds like youre one of them masochists or whatever you call em but there was a desperation in his laugh sometimes we have to find the one thing thats hardest for us and turn around and stare right at it go deep as deep as we can go thats what courage is thats what makes men out of us i can respect what youre saying ive been drinking off and on for the past six years never been drunk once he leaned forward and rested his hand on the cops hammy forearm remember that feeling when you were first drinking i think it made you relaxed peaceful happy brought out your good side thats the way it is now matthews leaned back im proud of myself to you the cop swallowed and tipped his milk against the beer glass his eyes slid over the golden surface of the brew oh you poor fool thought aaron matthews you dont have a soul in the world to talk to do you sometimes he continued pensively when i have a real problem something eating at me something making me feel so guilty its like a fire inside well ill have a shot that numbs it it helps me get through no foolin the fork probed the diminished pile of potatoes lets go deep touch the most painful part if i found myself in a situation where there was somebody i loved and she was drifting away because of the way id becomewell id want to be able to face whatever had driven her away i could show her i was in control again andwho knowsmaybe i could just get her back the cops face was flushed and it seemed that his throat had swollen closed matthews sipped more beer looked out the window at the dusk sky yes sir i hated living alone waking up on those sunday mornings those march sunday mornings the sky all gray the holidays by myself god i hated that my wife gone the one person in the world i needed the one person i was willing to do anything for the detective was paralyzed now matthews thought now let me show you something matthews leaned forward winking watch this he waved to the waitress shot of dewars one she called just one yeah numb the cop watched the glass arrive matthews made a show of reaching down and picking up the brimming glass he leaned forward smelled the glass then took the tiniest sip he set the glass down on the table and lifted his hands palms up thats it the only hard liquor ill have for two three weeks you can do that the cop was dumbfounded easiest thing in the world without a single problem he returned to his beer and called the waitress over im sorry honey ill pay you for it but i changed my mind i think i better keep a clear head tonight you can take it sure thing sir the cops hand made it to the glass before hers she blinked in surprise at the vehemence of the big mans gesture oh you want me to leave that after all the cop looked at matthews but then turned his dog eyes to the waitress yeah and bring my friend here another beer a fraction of a pause their eyes met matthews said make it two sure thing gentlemen put it on your tab oh no matthews insisted thiss on me matthews wearing his surgical gloves drove konnies car out of the parking lot of the strip mall and toward the interstate the cop was in the passenger seat clutching a bottle of scotch between his legs like it was the joystick in a biplane his head rocked against the tauruss window spit and liquor ran down his chin matthews parked on a side road not far from ernies lifted the bottle away from konnie and splashed some on the dashboard and seat of the car handed it back konnie didnt notice how you doing matthews asked him the big man gazed morosely at the open mouth of the bottle and said nothing at the strip mall where theyd bought the scotch matthews had pitched out a trash bag containing the tire receipts and all the rest of the notes on the megan mccall investigation the doctor now climbed out of the car pulled konnie into the drivers seat konnie gulped down two large slugs of liquor he wiped his sweating pasty face wherem i going youre going home konnie okay you go on home now okay im going home is carol there your wife yeah shes there konnie shes waiting for you to come home you better hurry i really miss her you know where to go dont you matthews asked i think his bleary eyes looked around i dont know that road right there see it sure there right there matthews said just drive down there thatll get you home thatll get you home to carol okay goodbye konnie goodbye that road there thats right hey konnie matthews looked at the rheumy eyes wet lips you say hi to carol for me wont you the cop nodded matthews flicked the gearshift into drive and stepped back as konnie accelerated he was driving more or less down the middle of the road matthews was walking back to ernies to pick up the mercedes when he heard the sudden squealing of brakes and the blares of a dozen horns signaling to konnie that hed turned his dark blue taurus onto the exit not entrance ramp of i and was driving the wrong way down the interstate it was no more than thirty seconds later that he heard the pounding crash of what was probably a headon collision andthough perhaps only in his imaginationa faint scream night now the corridors of the asylum were murky illuminated only by the light from two outdoor security lamps bleeding in through the greasy windows megan mccall gripping her glass sword moved silently through the main wing she couldnt get the comic books out of her mind the tentacles gripping screaming women the monsters raping them moving toward the boys room closer closer she stepped into the large lobby in the dim light shadows filled the space she believed he was back in his room but he could have been anywhere megan felt a breath on her neck and spun around practically feeling the metal rod he carried swinging toward her head gasping nothing but a faint breeze was he asleep in there reading jerking off fantasizing about her about what he was going to do to her the hospital corridors were like a maze she lost her way and was no longer sure where his rooms were made several false turns and found herself back where shed started feeling desperate now megan was afraid that hed find the trapher only advantage against the boy she walked more quickly listening carefully but she heard no obscene breathing no lewd whispering of her name in a way the silence was more frightening than his mutterings not having the least indication where he was then she turned a corner and found his room she saw light spilling into the corridor from the open door it flickered and darkened for a moment he was inside megan sweating megan scared scared of dying scared of the monster who lives up the hail scared of the whispering bears well you wanted him crazy megan whispers whatre you waiting for go get him megan started to tell cm to be quiet but suddenly she stopped because a thought hit her with the strength of the cinder blocks piled up in her trap it was this that crazy megan not only isnt crazy shes completely sane and more than that cm is the only one of them whos real crazy megan is the genuine meganthe megan who danced on the scaffolding of the water tower on a dare just to get bett or tate or somebody to notice her the megan who secretly dreamed of going to san francisco for a year after high school and then to college in paris the megan who made fierce love with a sexy black boyfriend who fuck you dr hansoni do love after all the megan who wanted to poke her finger into her fathers face and scream at him the inconvenient childs back and youve got her whether you like it or not oh yeah crazy megans the sane one and the other ones just a loser okay she said out loud okay prick come and get me the shadow of peter matthews froze on the wall the light clicked out and the corridor filled with darkness come on you fucker she shouted there was a ring of metalhe must have picked up the rod she couldnt see clearly but she could just make out his form lumbering slowly from the doorway he looked up and down the hail and then turned toward her megan god hes big megan he rasped he started toward her moving much faster than shed expected from the shuffling lope shed heard earlier her courage dissolved what a fucking stupid idea this is hell its not going to work of course it isnt hell get her no she screamed in panic get going crazy megan shouts run she backed up fast knowing that she should be watching where she was going but afraid to take her eyes off him for an instant feeling the wall behind her nearly tripped on a table she spun around pushed it aside and when she looked back he was gone were fucked crazy megan whispers hopelessly he could be anywhere now coming up around her from the left or the right and of course she remembered hed have keys to the place he could hide in one of the locked rooms arid wait for her to pass by and then move from room to room and come up behind her there was nothing she could do now except return to the dead end corridor where shed set up the trap get there as fast as she could and wait but in her panic she was turned around was it back that way or down this corridor she gazed down two hallways which he could be down either of them she could hardly see a thing in the darkness there she thought its got to be that one im sure almost sure she sprinted she slammed into a fiberglass chair sending it flying she stayed upright but the noise of the furniture hitting the wall was very loud megan froze had he heard had suddenly a huge form stepped from the corridor about two feet away lunging toward her megan megan screamed couldnt get the knife up in time she closed her eyes swinging her left fist toward where his face was she connected hard and must have broken his nose because he wailed in pain and dropped back around the corner she ran turned one corner and paused at the entrance to the hallway that led to the trap he followed moving toward her she made sure he got a good look at her to see which way she was going then started toward the trap but she stopped wait was it this corridor no the next wait was it she glanced into the murky shadows and couldnt see peter was getting closer which fucking corridor crazy megan shouts i dont know i dont know they all look alike he was twenty feet away come on snaps cm get it together no choice it better be this one megan ran to the end of the corridor yes shed been right there was the trap she crouched down and picked up the end of the rope at the far end of the corridor peter paused and glanced toward her more muttering like an animal she remembered the newspaper picture his odd mouth probing tongue the crazy eves the grin at his mothers funeral im so fucking scared youre gonna nail him crazy megan says in the darkness he didnt even seem to be walking he just floated closer to her growing larger and larger filling the corridor he stopped right before the trap she couldnt see his eves or face in the shadow hut she knew he was leering at her more muttering he stepped closer now she pulled the rope the denim snapped neatly in half the cinder blocks shifted slightly but stayed where they were oh no oh christ no thats it crazy megan cries its over with he moved forward another two steps she swept the knife from her pocket looked at his shadowy form im going to die this is it im dead hell break my arm take the knife away from me and fuck me till i die megans by herself now crazy megan has gone away crazy megan is dead already he stepped forward one more foot the dim light from outside fell on his face no she was hallucinating megan gasped josh megan he mumbled again joshua lefevres face and neck were bloody messes his hands arms and legs too large patches of skin were missing from his arms and legs he dropped to his knees just as the cinder blocks started to tumble toward him he glanced hopelessly at the hundreds of pounds of concrete and didnt even try to get out of the way no megan cried she leapt forward and pushed him aside the blocks just missed them both and crashed into the floor firing splinters of stone through the air megan he said the name stuttering out from his torn throat blood sprayed her face as he spoke then he passed out tate colliers lexus skidded up to the pay phone on route he leapt out looking around desperately he saw no one hello he called in a harsh whisper hello he glanced at the old dineror what was left of it after an arson fire some years agoand piles of trash deserted then he heard a moan followed by some violent retching tate ran into the bushes there konnie sat bloody and drenched in sweat vomit on his chin eyes unfocused hed been crying jesus what happened tate bent down put his arm around the man when konnied called him twenty minutes ago hed said only to meet him here as soon as possible tate knew he was drunk only half conscious but had no other clue as to what was going on im going down tate i fucked up bad oh christ bett now konnie what a day tate thought what a day youre hurt im okay but i mayve killed people tate there was an accident i left the scene he gasped and retched for a minute theyre looking for me my own peoplere looking for me he coughed violently ill call an ambulance no im turning myself in but he rolled over on his side and retched for a few minutes then caught his breath and sat up a squad car with flashing lights cruised past slowly the searchlight came on but it missed the bushes where tate crouched beside the detective listen to me konnie said you have to get to the office you need to look at the receipts receipts for the tires go to the office tate genie shouldve made a copy of them im praying she did ask her for them but move fast cause theyre going to impound my desk genie thats your assistant you remember her the list of receipts okay all right then look for whoever paid cash for the tires cash for the tires all right she ran warrants but thats not thats not what i shoulda been

thats our boy the one took your daughter i got a look at he caught his breath i got a look at him you saw him oh yeah the prick suckered me good hes white forties dark hair six feet about one seventy

fucking minute youre going do what the hell i told you and be there for my arraignment i cant believe what i did i cant believe it his voice disappeared in a cascade of retching tate found his old commonwealths attorney id badge at home and ran back to his car hanging the beaded chain around his neck the date was four years old but was in small type he doubted anyone would notice in twenty minutes he was walking into the police station no one paid him any attention he signed the login book and walked into konnies office a heavyset woman red eyed and crying looked up oh mr collier did you hear hes going to be all right genie thiss so terrible she said wiping her face so terrible i cant imagine hed take to drinking again i dont know why i dont know whats going on im going to help him but ive got to do something first its very important he said i should help you when he called oh he sounded so drunk on the phone i remember he used to call me up and say he wouldnt be coming in today because he had the flu but it wasnt the flu he sounded the way he was tonight just plain drunk tate rested his hand on the womans broad shoulder hes going to be all right well all help him did you make a copy of the receipts i did yes he always tells me make a copy of everything i give you always always always make a copy thats konnie here they are he took the stack of receipts owners of mercedeses whod bought new michelins on four receipts the cashcheck box was marked he didnt recognize any of the names could you run these tag numbers through dmv and get me the names and addresses of the registered owners sure she sniffed and waddled to her chair sat heavily then she typed furiously a moment later she motioned him over the first three names matched those on the receipts the fourth didnt oh my god tate muttered what is it mr collier he didnt answer he stood numb staring at the name aaron matthews sully fields drive manassas the letters glowing in jaundice yellow type on the black screen the court the prosecution may now present its summation mr collier mr collier my friends the task of the jury is a difficult and thankless one youre called on to sift through a haystack of evidence looking for that single needle of truth in many cases that needle is elusive practically impossible to find but in the case before you the commonwealth versus peter matthews the needle is lying out in the open evident for everyone to see there is no question that the defendant killed joan keller he was seen walking with the victim a sixteenyearold girl by bull run marina he was seen leading her into the woods he was later seen running from the park five minutes before joans body was found strangled to death the mud in which her cold corpse lay matched the mud found on the knees of the defendants jeans when he was arrested as you heard from the testimony he blurted out to the officers she had to die and in the trailer where he lived the police found hundreds of comic books and horror novels depicting big hulking men doing unspeakable things to helpless women victimsvictims just like joan keller the defense can see that shiny needle of truth as clearly as you and i can theres no doubt in their minds either that the defendant killed that poor girl and so what do they do they try to distract us they raise doubts about joans character they suggest that she had loose morals that shed had sex with local boys sometimes for money or for liquor or cigarettes a sixteenyearold girl these are nothing more than vile attempts to distract you from finding the needle oh they talk about accidental death just playing around they say the killer was a troubled young man they say but harmless well id say the facts of the case prove that he wasnt harmless at all dont you think harmless men dont strangle innocent young women seventy pounds lighter than they are harmless men dont act out their sick and twisted fantasies on helpless youngsters like joanie sue keller ladies and gentlemen dont let the defense hide that needle of truth from you dont let them cover it up this case is simple extremely simple the defendant through his premeditation his calculation his knowing purposeful intent has taken a life the life of a young girl someones friend someones sister someones daughter there is no worse crime than that and he must be held full y responsible for it the great poet dante said that the most righteous requests are answered in the silence of the deed im not asking for hollow words ladies and gentlemen no im asking for your courageous deedfinding this dangerous killer sane finding him guilty and recommending to the court that he pay for young joan kellers life with his own thank you orator tate collier had done everything right in the closing statement it was short colloquial filled with concrete imagery hed referred to peter matthews as the defendant and to the girl as joandepersonalizing the criminal humanizing the victim the reference to the needlegetting the jury used to the thought of the needle used in lethal injectionswas a particularly good touch hed thought hed even added the request for the death penalty because that was something they could bargain with in their mindstrading the boys life for a finding of sanity and a long prison sentence and that was exactly what happened he won the boy was found sane and guilty and was sentenced to life without parole which had been tates goal all along and a week later the young man whod beaten capital punishment was executed by a far more informal means than lethal injectiona dozen prison inmates identities unknown had used broomsticks and sharpened spoons to carry out the sentence and it took them three hours to do so justice after hed heard of peters death tate had sat at his desk for a long moment wondering why he felt so troubled at the news then he walked into the commonwealths attorneys file room and read through evidence in the case once again they were the same files and documents hed read before the trial of course but he examined them now untainted by the passionate drive to convict the young man he looked more carefully at the picture they painted of the boynot the defendant but peter thomas matthews a seventeenyearold boy a resident of fairfax virginia yes peter had a collection of eerie comics and japanimation tapes but many of them tate had learned in preparing for trial were bestsellers in japan where theyd taken on an artsy cult status and were reviewed seriously and collected by young people and adults alike what was more the boy also had a collection of serious science fiction and fantasy writers like ray bradbury isaac asimov william gibson c s lewis j r r tolkien jules verne edgar rice burroughs peter had spent hours copying long poetic passages from these books and had tried his hand at illustrating scenes from them hed also written scifi and fantasy short stories of his own which werent bad for someone his age yes some psychiatric evaluations called the boy dangerous but others said he merely had a paranoid personality and was given to panic in stressful situations he had no history of violence in getting ready for the case tate had also learned about joan kellerthe victim the girl had been sexually active since age twelve shed experimented with weird things possibly erotic asphyxia shed seduced older men on several other occasions and would have been the complaining witness in at least one statutory rape case except that shed refused to cooperate shed been treated for being a borderline personality and had been suspended twice for assaultsagainst both girls and boys at her school including one involving a knife peter had abrasions on his face and neck when he was brought to the lockup he claimed that joan had struck him with a rock when she got tired of his awkward gropingafter shed taken his hand and slipped it into her panties and the statement the boy had madeabout how joan had to diewas disputed by a local fisherman near the scene of the arrest he claimed the boy might have said she never had to die she shouldnt have hit me but silvertongued tate collier had managed to keep all of this damning evidence out of the trial or had shattered the credibility of the witnesses presenting it your honor we will not try the victim in this case your honor a well written short story has no probative value in this case whatsoever your honor that fact is immaterial and has to be stricken please instruct the witness the defense lawyers had come to him with a plea bargain request criminally negligent homicide suspended sentence three years probation and two years mandatory counseling but no peter matthews had laid his hands upon the neck of a sixteenyearold girl and had pressed pressed pressed until she was lifeless and so a plea bargain wouldnt do the court the defendant will rise you have heard the verdict of the jury and have been adjudged guilty of murder in the first degree the jury has not recommended the death penalty and accordingly i hereby sentence you to life in prison he went to prison and the last thing anyone remembered about peter was his telling a guard he was going to play with his new friends wont that be way cool peter asked were going to play ball a bunch of us they want me to play ball awesome then he disappeared into the laundry room and was found in several pieces five hours later why tate had wondered back then as he sat alone in the musty file room had he been so vehement about prosecuting the boy why the question hed asked himself often in the past few years the question he asked himself now what would have been so bad if the defendant if peter had been put on probation and gone into a hospital for treatment wasnt that reasonable of course it was but it hadnt been then not to the tate collier of five years ago not to tate collier the whizkid commonwealths attorney the man who spoke in tongues the judges grandson why because the thought of a killer depriving parents of their child was unbearable to him that was the answer that was all he thought someone stole away a girl just like megan and he had to die to hell with justice tate had never seen peters father aaron matthews at the trial or hadnt paid any attention to him if hed been there the man was a therapist tate remembered from reading the boys history and evaluations lived alone his wifea therapist as well and reportedly more successful than her husbandhad committed suicide some years before aaron matthews well he could give the police a name and address now theyd find him he only prayed megan was still alive now in konnies office he dialed betts home phone her voice mail gave her cell phone number and he dialed that she didnt answer he left a message about what hed learned and told her that he was at the county police station he started down the hall striding the way hed walked when hed been a commonwealths attorney and cut up these offices as if he owned them playing inquisitor to the young officers as he grilled them about their cases and the evidence theyd collected he pushed through the door to the homicide division and was surprised to see three startled detectives stop in the tracks of their conversations he smiled ruefully remembering only then that he was a trespasser one detective looked at another an astonished gaze on his face im sorry to barge in tate began im tate collier its about my daughter i dont know if you heard but shes disappeared and in less than twenty seconds he was facedown on a convenient desk the handcuffs ratcheting onto his wrists with metallic efficiency his miranda rights floating down upon him from a gruff voice several feet above his head what the hells going on he barked youre under arrest mr collier do you understand these rights as ive read them to you for what whatre you arresting me for do you understand your rights yes i understand my fucking rights what for for murder mr collier the murder of amy walker if youll come this way please she cradled him sobbing megan had eased joshua lefevre into the pale light from the outside lamp he was even more badly injured than shed thought at firstterribly batteredriddled with slashes and bite marks the wounds crusted with dirt and dried blood one eye was swollen completely closed most of his dreads had been torn off his scalp which was covered with mud and scabs he could speak only in a ghostly snapping wail no it hadnt been peter matthewss leering voice shed heard it was joshs his throat was split open and his vocal cords had apparently been cut when he breathed air hissed in through both his mouth and the slash the bleeding seemed to have stopped but she bound the denim rope around his throat anyway she could think of nothing else to do thought it was you he gasped i couldnt see my eyes my eyes i thought it was you but you didnt answer megan lowered her head to his chest i thought you were his son i thought you were going to kill me oh josh what happened was it the dogs outside he nodded shiveredfrom the pain she guessed as much as the cold that man he struggled to ask he kidn she nodded did you call the police no he gasped i didnt know what was going on i stopped him but he tricked me he coughed for a moment thought you thought you were going with him what happened she asked tearfully the stuttering explanation hed followed her and matthews here then the doctor had attacked him and left him for the dogs but before they could finish him off a young deer had trotted past and they left josh to pull her down his beautiful voice megan thought crying its gone she had to look away from his face hed found a metal rod to use as a cane he continued and made his way into the hospital to find a phone but there werent any then he learned that the doors didnt open outward that the place was a prison she gently touched a terrible wound on his face even if they managed to get him to a doctor soon would he survive hed lost so much blood were you you werent his lover were you what she blurted he said you were he said he said you wanted to get rid of me oh josh no it was whatever he said it was a lie who is he lefevre rasped we dont have time now can you walk no he breathed heavily and winced cant do anything ive about had it she pulled him farther into the alcove hid him from view wait here where you going lie still josh be quiet ill get something to use for bandages she said rising but he might be there she showed him the glass knife i hope he is ill tell you whatever you want to know but for gods sake send somebody after my daughter once more from the top please sir tate was still stunned from the news that amy had been found naked and stabbed to death on tates farm theres a man named aaron matthews he drives a gray mercedes he lives on sully field off route twentynine near manassas hes been following my daughter for the past couple weeks or months i dont know and weve got our own agenda here collier the young homicide detectivea dead ringer for the security guard at megans high school said gruffly his patience gone you dont mind we got a lotta ground to cover is ted beauridge around no one more time sir from the top he was in an interrogation cubicle and he was perched on an uncomfortable metal chair at least the cuffs were off matthews killed amy megan had told her about being followed he thought she might have some informationmaybe he just killed her to get me out of the picture and i gave him her name tate thought he was sure the man who called from the fbispecial agent mccombwas aaron matthews probing to get information to stop their search for the girl he forced or tricked megan into writing those notes and when they kept looking for her anyway he turned on them howd you find out about the body tate asked an anonymous call right the detectives looked at each other they were slim and in perfect shape shoes polished guns tucked neatly away law enforcement machines it was matthews who called dont you get it her mother said youd been stalking amy that child protective services has been investigating you what thats bullshit call them on saturday night sir well call on monday we dont have until monday the cop continued lethargically mrs walker also said you tried to break into her house today amy was going to give us megans book bag i knocked on the door and tried to open it when no one answered uhhuh there is no child protective services investigation its him its matthews hes trying to stop me from finding megan cant you see not exactly sir no okay when did this anonymous call come in within the last half hour believe me matthews killed amy and dumped the body on my land i saw somebody watching the house this morning did you report it well no i didnt why not tate remembered thinking as he stood in the rainswept field that morning hey looks like the dead reb but it wasnt it was aaron matthews waiting until i left the house then tossing the dog a bone planting megans letters leaving fast i just didnt look he knows im after himkonnie was running a check on the mercedes it turned out to be his thats not a coincidence how do you account for the fact that this girl was murdered with a kitchen knife that had your fingerprints on it because it was probably from my kitchen talk to konnie about this morning he detective konstantinatis is in custody and hes also in no shape to talk to anybody as im sure you know beauridge then they were out to my house matthews broke in planted some fake letters that megan supposedly wrote and he mustve stolen the knife at the same time or stolen it tonight its an easy house to break into the cause of death was shock due to blood loss after her throat was slashed and her chest and abdomen punctured thirtytwo times there was some mutilation too fuck of a way to kill someone the other detective added tates face grew hot megans terrified eyes were the most prominent image in his thoughts weve checked out your house and found youd packed most of your girls stuff away her bedroom looked about as personal as a storeroom she lives with her mother no pictures of her no clothes nothing personal the impression we got was youd been planning to say adios to megan for some time thats making us wonder about this whole kidnapping story there were some witnesses theres a teacher robert eckhard he saw but he stopped talking when he saw the expression on their faces you a friend of eckhard i dont know him tate said cautiously i just heard that hed seen the car that was following megan have you ever talked to him no i just told youwhy robert eckhard was arrested today on numerous counts of child pornography and endangering the welfare of minors what could you describe your relationship with him with eekhard there is no relationship jesus christ i dont know him please just send somebody out to check out this matthews a rhetorician never pleads tates talents were deserting him in droves think smarter he raged at himself he could talk his way out of this he knew he could there must be some way what would his grandfather the judge have done all cats see in the dark midnight is a cat officer tate said calmly offering a casual smile youve got nothing to lose absolutely nothing im not going anywhere if you check him out if you send a couple officers out to his house then ill tell you whatever you want to know anything no hassle we have a deal one of the detectives sighed he shrugged and stepped out the door therefore midnight sees in the dark tate pictured megan bound and gagged lying somewhere in a basement matthews standing over her undressing it was a terrible image and once thought wouldnt go away have you ever had sexual relations with amy walker he tamped down his anger ive never met her he answered did you send your daughter off somewhere because she knew you were stalking amy walker and did you fabricate a kidnapping charge no i didnt do that struggling now to stay calm to stay helpful really struggling he looked at the doorway through which the other cop had disappeared were they sending a hostage rescue team to matthewss house or just patrol officers matthews could trick them he could lull them into complacencyoh yes he had the gift too tate now understood you cant negotiate with someone like matthews you need to act immediately the silence of the deed did you kill amy walker no i did not when was the last time you drove your daughters car a month or so ago i think is that how your fingerprints got on the door handle of her car it would have to be could we run through the events just prior to her disappearance once more prior say for the week before tate glanced out the door squinted looked again the second detective came back into the cubicle tate asked did you send a team to his house i should have told you to send hostage rescue not regular officers and dont listen to him whatever he says megans there in the house tell whoevers on their way not to listen to him he wasnt home what tate asked he didnt understand the officers couldnt have gotten there so quickly i called him he wasnt home you called him tates heart stuttered relax sir i didnt tell him anything just asked him to give us a call about some parking tickets the slick young cop seemed proud of his cleverness jesus christ you dont have to tell him anything are you crazy sir we dont have to pay any attention to your story at all you know were doing you a favor tate sat back glanced into the hail again after a moment he looked back at the officers again closed his eyes and sighed you win okay you win hows that sir ill waive my rights and tell you everything i can think of no confession but a full statement about my daughter and amy walker but i want some coffee and ive got to use the john they looked at each other and nodded im coming with you the first detective muttered tate laughed i was a commonwealths attorney for ten years im not going to escape im coming with you tate gave a disgusted sigh and walked into the scuffed halls which resembled a suburban grade school he ambled to the mens room and pushed inside the detective was directly behind him he stood at the urinal for an inordinately long time when hed finished and washed his hands he stepped to the door and pushed it open bumping into the woman who was juggling three large law books and several pads of foolscap which tumbled to the floor sorry tate said bending down to pick up the books bett mccall glanced at him said no problem and slipped the pistol out of her purse and into his hand tate didnt even pause to thinkhe simply spun around shoved the smith wesson into the belly of the shocked detective and pushed him back into the mens room as bett calmly retrieved the books in one minute tate had gagged and cuffed the furious cop and relieved him of his gun he tossed it in the wastebasket the cuffs too tight he asked the detective stared angrily are they too tight a nod tate snapped good and stepped out into the corridor as a faint rumble arose in the john like a lowrichter earthquake the detective was trying to pull down the stall when hed looked into the hallway from the interrogation room he couldnt believe that hed seen her standing there motioning with her head down the hall how did you get in here he asked as they walked briskly toward the exit told them i was a lawyer you cite a case or two i could have she smiled i memorized the names of a couple on your desk i was going to tell the desk sergeant i had to see my client because these new cases had just been put down its handed down tate corrected oh glad he didnt ask i dont know if we can get out that way i came in under my own steam but the desk officer might know ive been arrested he looked back down the corridor five minutes tops till they come looking she rearranged the books she was carrying so the cover showed a school hornbook williston on contracts he laughed thatll fool em then asked you got my message she nodded i called konnie and his assistant told me youd been arrested i couldnt decide whether to get a lawyer or the gun i figured we didnt have time to wait for public defenders my cars outside the old bett mccall might have meditated for days hoping for guidance the new one went right for the smith wesson they paused just before they turned the corner beside the guard station he took a breath ready i guess lets go tate started forward bett at his side the guard glanced at them but out they strolled without a hitch signing the time departed line in the logbook scrupulouslyone a phony prosecutor and one a phony defense lawyer and both of them now felons aaron matthews was driving seventy then eighty miles an hour anger had given way to sorrow to the same piercing hollowness hed felt in the months after peter had died in prison sorrow at plans gone wrong terribly wrong matthews had been at his rental house off route waiting to see if hed finally stopped tate collier he believed he had hed given up on the subtlety given up on the words given up on the delicious art of persuasion stiff with anger hed dragged the walker girl screaming from the trunk of his car said nothing convinced her of nothinghed just slashed and slashed and slashed all of his anger flowing from him as hot and sudden as the blood from her body hed called from a pay phone to report seeing a body then had sped home there the phone had rung he hadnt answered but listened to the message as the officer left it some bullshit about traffic tickets give us a call when you get home thank you it meant of course that they knew about him or suspected at least how had it happened why hadnt they just tossed collier into the lockup and ignored him maybe he had actually convinced them that he was innocent and that matthews had kidnapped the girl the fucking silvertongued devil an angry sorrowful mood exploded within matthews like napalm it was only a matter of time now before they found blue ridge facility they knew his name theyd find out his connection there and theyd find megan he stared out the window for a moment then closed his eyes in a perfect world moods dont burn you like torches juries work pure justice and revenge befalls sinners in exact proportion to their crimes in a perfect world matthews would have kept megan mccall as his child forever a replacement for peter and tate collier would have lived in despair all his life never knowing where she wasknowing only that shed fled from him propelled by undiluted hate but there was no chance for such symmetry now all his hopes had unraveled and there was only one answer left to kill the girl and leave flee to the west coast new england maybe overseas hed lost his son tate collier would lose his daughter a kind of cure a kind of justice a kind of revenge he spent a few minutes preparing some things in his house then hurried to his car he sped out onto the highway toward the distant humps of mountains a sensuous dark line above which no stars became stars and the moon showed as a faint white crescent of frown cleaning the deep wounds was the hardest part shed found a cheap sewing kit in the bedroom and a bottle of rubbing alcohol in the medicine cabinet he took the stitches bravely even though she cringed every time the needle pierced his skin but when megan poured a capful of alcohol on the wounds he shivered frantically at the pain oh im sorry no no came his garbled voice keep at it ms beautiful her eyes teared when she heard the nickname hed used the night he picked her up even if you get out youll never get past em the dogs hes got four or five of the big flickers youre sure you cant walk i dont think so he gurgled no okay you stay here i saw a door going to the basement i think i can break it open im going to see if theres a door or window down there maybe itll lead outside he nodded breathed i love and passed out she stacked the cinder blocks around him so that if matthews glanced this way he wouldnt see the young man she listened for a moment to his low uneven breathing then knife in one hand she started down the corridor megan was almost to the intersection of the corridors when she heard the creak of a door opening then it slammed aaron matthews had returned they drove in silence through destitute parts of prince william county they passed tilled fields where the taproots of corn were reaching silently down into the dark redtinted earth barns long ago abandoned decaying tract bungalows where postwar dreams had withered fasttiny cubes of vinyland aluminumsided homes shacks and cars on blocks through manassas where the fearsome rebel yell was first heard then through the outlying farms and past the confederate cemetery it was him tate bett said breaking a long silence who a man came to see me he said he was her therapist but he wasnt it was matthews he called himself peters his sons name was peter tate mused that must be why he picked it glanced at her what happened she shook her head he seduced me nothing really happened but it was enoughoh tate he looked right into my soul he knew what i wanted to hear he said exactly the right things you can talk your way into somebodys heart and get them to do whatever you want judge or jury youre got that skill words tate words you cant see them but theyre the most dangerous weapons on earth remember that be careful son she continued hed called brad i think he pretended he was a cop and told him to get to my house we were together on the couch i was drunk oh tate tate put his hand on her knee squeezed lightly there was nothing you couldve done bett hes too good somehow hes done all of this dr hanson konnie probably eckhard too the teacher just to get even with me they drove on in silence then tate realized something you got here too quickly what you couldnt have been in baltimore when you got my message no i got as far as takoma park and turned back why a long pause because i decided it had to stop instinctively she flipped the mirror down and examined her face poked at a wrinkle or two i was running after brad and i should have been going after megan she continued i realized something tate how mad ive been at her at megan because of what we heard at the coffee shop oh lord no thats my fault not hers she took a deep breath flipped the mirror back up no tate ive been mad at her for years and i shouldntve been it wasnt her fault she was born at the wrong time and the wrong place yes she sure was i neglected her and didnt do the things i should have i dated i left her alone i did the basics sure but kids know they know where your heart is here i was running after joe or dave or brad and leaving my daughter time for that to stop im just praying its not too late well find her the roads were deserted here and the air aromatic with smoke from wood cooking fires common in this poor part of the county the volvo streaked through a stop sign tate skidded into a turn and then headed down a bad road were in trouble arent we she asked we sure are they dont put out allpoints bulletins anymore but if they did wed be the main attraction in one they dont know my car bett pointed out he laughed oh that took all of thirty seconds for em to track down look there thats his place matthewss small bungalow was visible through a stand of trees some distance away a rusting heatingoil tank sat in the side yard and the stands of uncut grass were outnumbered by patches of red mud the house was only two miles away from tates farm a convenient staging point for a breakin and kidnapping he noted what are we going to do bett asked tate didnt answer her instead he took the gun out of his pocket were going to get our daughter he said thirty yards twenty fifteen tate paused and listened silence from inside matthewss house he smelled the scent of wood smoke and pictured the kidnapper sitting beside the fireplace with megan bound and gagged at his feet the shabby house chilled his heart hed seen places like it often too often when he was a commonwealths attorney hed always unlike most bigcity prosecutorsvisited the crime scenes himself this was what detectives dubbed a sectionsixty cottage referring to the virginia penal code provision for murder shotgun killings domestics love gone cruel then violent there were common elements among such houses they were small filthy silent brimming with unspoken hate the mercedes wasnt in the drive so it was possible that matthews hadnt heard the message from the police maybe megan was here now lying in the bedroom or the basement maybe this would be the end of it but he moved as silently as he could taking no chances he glanced through the window the living room was empty lit only by the glow of embers in the fireplace he listened for a long moment nothing the windows were locked but he tested the handle on the door and found it was open he pushed inside thinking only as he did so why a fire on a warm night oh no he lunged for the doorknob but it was too late the door knocked over the large pail of gasoline god instinctively tate grabbed for the bucket as the pink wave of gas flowed onto the floor and into the fireplace what bett cried the gas ignited and with a whoosh a huge ball of flame exploded through the living room megan tate cried turning away from the flames and falling onto the porch his sleeve was on fire he slapped out the flames shes in there shes in there bett shouted in panic and ran to the window scrabbling away from the flowing gasoline tate grabbed bett and pulled her back he covered his face with his hand felt the searing heat take the hairs off the back of his fingers megan bett cried she broke the window in with her elbow she peered inside for a moment but then leapt back as a plume of flame burst through the window at her if she hadnt leapt aside the fire would have consumed her face and hair tate ran around the back of the cottage broke in the window in one of the bedrooms which was already filling with dense smoke no sign of the girl he ran to the other bedroomthe cottage had only twoand saw that she wasnt there either the flames were already burning through the bedroom door which with a sudden burst exploded inward in the light from the fire tate could see that this wasnt a bedroom but an office there were stacks of newspaper clippings magazines books and folders maps charts and diagrams sirens sounded in the distance bett came up behind him there was a burn on her arm but she was otherwise okay tate i cant find her she screamed i dont think shes here shes not in either of these rooms and theres no basement where is she the answers in there he shouted he only set the trap so nobody could find any clues to where hes got her he picked up several bricks and shattered the glassandwooden grid in the window oh brother he muttered and climbed inside feeling the unnerving pain as a shard of glass sliced through his palm the heat inside was astonishing smoke and embers and flecks of burning paper swirling around him and he realized that the flames werent the worst problemthe heated air and lack of oxygen were going to knock him out in minutes he raced to the desk and grabbed all the papers and notebooks he could ran to the window and flung them outside crying to bett get it all away from the house he went back for more he got two more armfuls before the heat grew too much he dove out the window and rolled to the ground heavily as the ceiling collapsed and a swell of flame puffed out the window he lay exhausted gasping on the ground dizzy and hurt wondering why on earth bett was doing a funny little dance around his arm then he understood the file folder he held had been burning and she was stamping out the flames the sirens were getting closer great he muttered now theyre gonna add arson to our rap sheets bett helped him up and they gathered all the notebooks and files hed flung into the backyard they ran to the car tate started it and skidded out of the drive passing the first of the fluorescent green fire trucks that were speeding toward the house they turned north and drove for ten minutes until tate figured there was no chance of being spotted he parked near a quarry in manassas a grim eerie place that looked like it should have been a serial killers stalking ground though to tates knowledge thered never been any crime committed here worse than pot smoking and drinking beer and sloe gin from open containers tate and bett pored over the singed files and papers looking for some due as to where matthews might have taken megan the files were mostly articles psychiatric diagnostic reports medical evaluations he also found surveillance photos of megan dozens of them and of tates house and betts matthews had been planning this for months some of the pictures had been taken during the winter in one notebook megans daily routine was described in obsessive detail more patient notes more articles more diaries with shaking hands tate and bett read through them all but there was no clue as to any other buildings apartments or houses where he might have taken the girl theres nothing bell barked in frustration weve looked at everything tears on her face tate gazed at the mess of scorched papers and files on their laps his eye fell on a patient diagnostic report then another he flipped through them quickly then read the name and address of the hospital where the patients had been evaluated he snatched up his cell phone and eyes on one of the reports made a call to directory assistance for calvert virginia he asked for the number for the blue ridge mental health facility please be out of order he whispered why on earth bell asked please were sorry the electronic voice reported there is no listing for that name do you have another request he clicked the phone off thats where she is an old mental hospital in the shenandoahs he tapped the reports matthews was a shrink id guess he was on the staff there a few years ago its probably closed and thats where hes taken her you sure no but its all weve got go tate he pulled onto the highway and steered toward the interstate thinking with frustration that theyd have to drive the entire way right on the speed limit they could hardly afford to be stopped now glass knife in front of her megan walked through the hallways there was silence then the shuffling of footsteps more silence i hate the quiet worse than his footsteps im with you there crazy megan shares then the steps again but from a different place as if the intruder were a ghost materializing at will five minutes passed another noise nearby behind her a sharp inhalation of breath megan gasped and turned quickly aaron matthews was twenty feet away his eyes widened in surprise she stumbled backward and fell over a table went down hard grunted in pain as the edge of the table dug into her kidney despite the pain though she leapt to her feet lifting the knife threateningly she assumed hed charge at her but he didnt he merely frowned and said oh my god megan are you all right crouching eyes fiery breath hard gripping the cloth handle of her wicked knife staring at his dark eyes his large shoulders and long arms why wasnt he coming at her she glanced behind her wait he said with a hearttugging plea in his voice please dont run please she hesitated he sighed oh i know youre upset megan honey i know youre scared you hate me and you have every right to but please just listen to me he held his hands up i dont have a knife or gun or anything please will you listen his eyes were so sincere radiating sympathy and his voice so imploring please megan kept her tight grip on the knife but she straightened up go ahead she whispered im listening good he said and offered her a smile i didnt know youd gotten out of your room aaron matthews said cell she corrected bluntly cell he conceded watching her eyes carefully but i shouldve guessed he laughed youre the independent sort nobody was going to lock you away its one of the things i love about you matthews noted how she fixed her gaze on his eyes how her pale lashes stuttered when hed said the word love how had she done it he wondered hed been over the cell so carefullyand the lock was still on the door had she gotten through the ceiling the wall and she was wearing some of his clothes so shed found his living area what else did she know however it had happened matthews was surprised it showed more mettle than hed expected from the spoiled little whiner are you all right just tell me that he looked her up and down no answer he continued im sorry about your clothes when you passed out from the medicine i gave you well you had an accident im sorry i didnt think it would happen im washing your clothes in the laundry room here theyre drying now they should be reads soon i didnt touch you i swear he glanced at the knife in her hand a long shard he thought at first that there was something about the glass itself that was particularly unnerving the sharp green edge of the triangle but then he decided that no it was her face that scared him she was preparedno eagerto use the weapon and so much in control shed be a hard one to crack harder than in hansons office where her defenses were down and her selfesteem bubbling near empty he eased forward oh megan im so sorry the point of the knife tilted toward him and matthews froze he said in his best therapists tone i didnt want it to happen this way he fell silent and to fill the intolerable gap of silence she asked what way this he lifted his arms to the hallways if thered been anything else i could have done i would have i promise you what do you mean he leaned against the wall closed his eyes you dont really know me but i know you ive known you for a long time she shook her head frowning confused the tip of the knife was pointed lower my names aaron matthews shedve learned his real name of coursefrom looking through the desk in his rooms here but tell someone the truthno matter how much youve lied to them in the pastand you nudge them closer toward you if ever so slightly he continued right awaymatthews had a spell to weave and spells work best when cast quickly i worked with your father on a case last year he hired me as an expert witness to evaluate a suspect we were talking before the trial just making conversation and i asked about children if he had any and he said matthews paused and his face grew somber he continued im sorry honey but he said no he didnt megans beautiful light eyes widened shocked for a moment then they grew deeply sad as they had in hansons office a child betrayed a child alone what are the bears whispering to you but id heard somebody mention his daughter and i asked him about you he looked embarrassed and said that well yes he did have a daughter but she lived with her mother he said you were technically his child but that was all i told him about my son peter see he had some problems at birth serious mental problems another flicker of lash so she knew about him too he said looking down but ive always felt that despite all that i loved my boy and wanted him to be with me i mentioned that to your father but he didnt say anything i asked him how often he saw you he said virtually never i asked him about you and he didnt seem to know much at all and then matthews stopped abruptly like a man finding himself in a minefield what nothing no tell me she said with faint desperation in her voice he said some things about you please the knife was pointed straight down her face was no longer fierce i want to know he said being more involved with you would be awkward no he didnt she whispered he didnt say that at all did he im not sure matthews stammered putting a vulnerable look on his face she muttered he said being involved with a child would be inconvenient right yes matthews conceded sighing im so sorry megan but thats what he said and when i heard it all i could think of was how i hoped you had a good relationship with your mother i hoped someone cared i felt so bad for you a faint laugh then her face went still my mother yeah right he cocked his head offering her another sympathetic glance and continued well i went to see her when you were in school one day you did matthews eased a few inches closer he decided that anger wouldnt work with megan unlike with her boyfriend josh the madder she got the more dangerous shed be no the way to get inside her defenses was to tap into her sorrow and loneliness i lied megan ill admit it i told bett i was a counselor with your school and i wanted to know how you were doing i was shocked to find that she didnt have much time for you either she told me she was engaged trying to make that relationship work was totally absorbed with brad didnt have much time for well she said for babysitting she said that megan gasped in fairness she said you were very mature and didnt need a lot of handholding how would she know megan muttered matthews swayed toward her but the coldness returned to her eyes and she asked but why the fuck did you kidnap me because i wanted to give you a second chance megan kidnapping me what kind of chance is that he looked down and rocked back and forth on his feet moving a good six inches closer to her oh megan yes i kidnapped you but id never hurt you that was the last thing on my mind if shed seen the room shed probably also seen the kitchen he said i can prove it ill show you the kitchen its filled with food that you like i found out what you liked and i bought a lot of it she nodded her defenses slipped a bit more you were the one following me for the past couple weeks thats right i followed you and i talked to people about you too teachers students and the more i learned about you the more i couldnt understand your parents youre creative youre funny youre pretty you have a sense of humor you were artistic you were everything a teenage girl ought to be why didnt they want you your parents i mean her lip began to tremble she wiped tears it was so unfair he whispered i wanted to give you the love that they never did parental love im speaking oh i hope you know that i think youre beautiful but i dont desire you physically he nodded toward her padded cell i could have done that when you were unconscious if id wanted to her eyes told him that she understood it that shed checked her body for tenderness for moisture but the eyes hardened again she asked but theres more isnt there theres another side to it he smiled oh youre smart megan youre very smart yes theres another side i wanted another chance too i told you about my son the problems i mentioned they were pretty serious my wife she drank and had a valium habit when she was pregnant i tried to get her to stop but she wouldnt my son had permanent brain damage oh i wanted a normal child someone i could spend time with have fun with someone i could spoil he remembered something bett had told him earlier that evening i wanted someone to play games with to spend christmas and easter with thanksgiving to make oatmeal and pancakes for to hang out with on sunday in sweats and sneakers and read the paper and rake leaves from somewhere he summoned a tear you wanted me to be your daughter megan said softly yes but there was no way you wouldve agreed on your own or even listened to me you wouldve thought i was some kind of crank and called the police so i did what i had to i waited until i had a chancedr hansons mother getting sickand i arranged with him to see you that part was true oh yes of course its true were friends hanson and me he smiled indulgently though i think im a better therapist than he is i get right to the core of the problem yeah you sure as hell do she offered a faint smile in return you didnt like those letters i know but i had to make you see how angry you were with your parents i had to make you see the truth thats why you made me write them yes what did you do with them did you send them he frowned the letters no i threw them out writing them was for you megan i thought maybe here we could get to know each other for a while id hoped youd stay for a few weeks a month if it worked out fine we could move to san francisco you could start college there in the fall hed moved another few feet closer to her he was slumped diminished looking mournfully at the floor matthews had decided how shed die hed strangle her her eyes would grow wide and hed stare at them drink them in as she died pull the glass knife from her hand and get a grip on her neck squeeze and squeeze and squeeze until the tip of her protruding tongue stopped quivering and squeeze some more after that it was the way peter had killed the slut whod tried to seduce him maybe it was the way peter himself had died the body was so mutilated the prison doctor hadnt been able to be certain of the cause of death tears flooded the eyes of the inconvenient child oh megan im sorry im so sorry i just thought that you deserved so much more than you had she was shivering with the sobs a father who wanted to be rid of you what a terrible thing he wanted to get you out of his life and get back to those ridiculous young women he chased after and your mother a dear woman but a child herself really i thought about all sorts of thingshow i could adopt you get you into a foster home you really thought that she asked wiping her face her attention was wavering from the glass blade her hand was in the shadows at her side the hallway was dim and he couldnt tell whether the knife was pointed downward or at him yes i sure did i talked to a lawyer about adoption he said i wouldnt have a chance not with your natural parents around however neglectful they were his voice was soft lulling megan wiped her face again i just wanted to be loved and they didnt love you did they they didnt give you any love at all oh i wouldve done things so differently and thats why i took this chance im risking life in prison just to see if something might work out between us i just wanted you to have a home he too was crying now i just wanted a family thats all ive ever wanted boo she was sobbing uncontrollably now hand over her face yes thats it a home i never had a home i wanted a father so badly matthews stepped closer reached out a tentative hand and touched her cheek wiped away a tear he could almost feel her under his hands peeing and thrashing as she died hed leave her body out for the dogs so that collier would have to live with the terrible memory of what the crime scene photos revealed i wish i could have done it differently he said i mean this place is so disgusting megan but i didnt have any choice for both our sakes i just he reached out his other hand and put his arm around her shoulder rubbed her back i just wanted a home only a home she struggled to breathe i know you did his right hand moved down her face to her neck his left slipped down her arm until he gripped the glass knife she held he gently pulled it out of her hand got you he thought but then he glanced down frowning it wasnt a knife at all in his hand was a plastic bic pen but hed seen the blade he looked into her face saw the leering smile nice try megan whispered and with her left hand she jammed the glass blade deep into his side once then again and again a flash of terrible pain shot through him and matthews howled he twisted hard away from her and the blade snapped on a rib leaving a long glass splinter inside him now megan screamedan insane wailand as the doctor groped for his wound she slammed her open palm into his face a huge pop as his nose broke and blood spurted he went down on his knees she kicked him near the knife wound and his vision went black from the astonishing pain she came forward but he swam back to consciousness quickly and now it was his fist that connected hardslamming into her jaw sending her backward into the wall by the time he was on his feet she was disappearing down the dark corridor he touched the wound the pain was bad but it was nothing compared with the feeling of shock that raged through him shes the one who fooled me suckered me in nice and close got my defenses down my god the whole time i thought i was playing her but she led me right into the trap her fathers daughter matthews thought in fury and disgust he dropped to his knees and began working the fragments of glass out of his wound actually savoring the pain he wanted to remember it he wanted to feel what megan was about to experience the basement she plunged into the dim corridors of the hospital looking for the basement door shed seen earlier her jaw ached and the back of her head toofrom where shed slammed it into the wall after he hit her for just a moment shed thought about leaping on him againseeing him lying there blood filling his shirt blood dripping from his nose hed looked half dead but she wasnt sure that he was hurt as badly as he seemed he might have been faking if he lied with words hed lie with actions so she ranto find the basement door she heard matthewss unearthly screamit seemed to shake the wallsand then footsteps making slow circles through the corridors she finally found the door the one leading to the basement she grabbed a cinder block and smashed it down on the hasp and lock which snapped off easily megan flung the door open looked down into the musty place for a moment she was paralyzed no choice girl crazy megan the tour guide shouts move movemove but josh she protested silently i cant leave him hey if you die he dies go she clomped down the stairs and found herself in a dimly lit warren of corridors trotting slowly from room to room she took care to avoid the standing water so she wouldnt leave footprints he could follow please a door a window oh please she heard the creak of footsteps from the ceiling above her as matthews made his way to the door shed just broken open she found a door leading outside it was locked and the windows too were sealed another door nailed shut goddamn him cm blurts whyd he padlock the fucking door upstairs if we cant get out this way megan didnt bother to answer she couldnt figure it out either she returned to a room near the base of the stairs and glanced again at one of the windows the bars on these were wider than the ones on the main floor but she doubted that she could get through fucking hips dont start megan muttered silently and started to turn away then she paused looked back thinking okay maybe i cant get through the bars but i can make him think i did she smashed the glass and pushed an overturned plastic bucket beneath it so that it looked like shed climbed out then she ran back into the warren of dark storerooms to find someplace to hide most of the cardboard boxes piled in the rooms were too small to conceal her and she didnt have the strength to pull herself up into the pipes that ran along the ceiling his steps were approaching the door upstairs then he started down megan ran into a cluttered storeroom the farthest one from the stairs it was filled with cartons small ones like the others but over to the side of the room in the shadows was a long metal box it was almost too obvious a choice to hide in but this room was nowhere near the window where shed faked her escape and it was pitch dark in here matthews might not even see the box if he bothered to look could she get it open and was it empty but megan stopped asking questions matthews was now in the basement a shuffle of footsteps a moaning wheeze from the pain of the wounds words muttered to himself now crazy megan prods her go girl megan unlatched the trunk it took all her strength to lift the thick lid and it took all her willpower not to scream as she looked inside and saw the bluewhite flesh the limp hair the closed eyes a dark shriveled penis the long yellow fingernails cuts and gouges covered the young mans entire torso which was further mutilated by the large y incision from the autopsy an ear and an arm had been crudely stitched back onto his body it was matthewss son peter she recognized the eerie face from the newspaper clipping oh god my god tate bett somebody the footsteps were closer now they sounded only thirty or forty feet away go on crazy megan urges do it i cant do it megan thought no way in hell get inside cm chokes you have to either you fight him with your fists she told herself or you hide in here thosere your choices a moments pause the doctor was now right outside the doorway it seemed then megan closed her eyes as if that would lessen the horrorand climbed into the box lying down on the corpse on her back shivering fiercely she let the lid down the air reeked of sweet formaldehyde pickled fleshshe recalled the scent from biology class hating to be in school at the time but now praying that she could somehow be transported back to that time and place and beneath her terrible cold nothings colder than cold flesh then she heard faintly a moan very near aaron matthews was in the room crossing a gap in the shenandoahs tate glanced out the window of betts car at the darkened bungalows and ramshackle farmhouses abandoned barns the black pits that opened into the network of caverns that laced the earth beneath the shenandoahs and the blue ridge they sped past walls of ominous forestthe stark pines the scrub oak the sedge the young kudzu and virginia creeper tate imagined dozens of eyes peering at them and he thought of the dead reb once again ten minutes later well into the blue ridge tate pulled betts volvo into an allnight gas station the elderly attendant glanced at them cautiously when he asked about the mental hospital that old place phew the man cast a dark look westward where is it you get back on the interstate and go one more exit wed rather stick to back roads if we can the state troopers would be looking for him on the highway a fact tate didnt share the man cocked his head shrugged well that road there route one seventeen take it west ten twelve miles till you see a buyrite gas station then go left on palmer and just keep going well see the hospital oh youll see it cant miss it but id wait till sunup you dont wanna go there this time of night no sir but you asked for directions not opinions tate handed him a twenty and they sped off down the road theyd driven several miles when a nononsense siren burst to life a quarter mile behind them it was a county trooper the light bar flashed explosively in tates rearview mirror he accelerated hard you think he knows its us bett asked if he doesnt he will when he calls in your tags tates foot wavered what do i do drive like hell bett muttered try to lose him he did for about two miles it looked as if theyd get away the swedes make a good car but it was no match for the soupedup engine of the pursuing plymouth cant make it he told her he eased up on the gas ill talk to him maybe hell at least send a car to the hospital no bett said pull over what tate asked jockeying the skidding car onto the gravel shoulder and braking bett ripped her purse open and dug inside she paused took a deep breath then sat upright staring in the rearview mirror at herself stroking her cheek as tate had seen her do so often whats she up to he wondered bett he cried as she lifted the nail file to her face and dragged it hard across her skin blood poured from a gash deep in her cheek oh bett wheezed it hurts tate stared at the blood running more black than red down her neck and falling onto her chest in delicate paisleys get out of the car reverberated the metallic voice through the rectangular mouth of the pa speaker atop the car the young trooper stood beside the open door of his squad car his blueblack pistol dwarfed by the lawmans huge hand was aimed at tates head get out of that vehicle keep your hands up for a moment neither of them moved then betts door opened so fast tate thought that another deputy had snuck up behind them unseen and pulled her out but no she was moving on her own she screamed shrilly as she rolled onto the grassy shoulder of the road the leather strap of her purse was wound around her wrists as if she were tied up without the use of her hands she fell hard and dust mixed with the blood covering her face help me she cried he kidnapped me dont move nobody move the trooper called swinging the muzzle toward bett tate sat perfectly still hands on the wheel bett scrabbled toward the cop hes got a knife she cried help me please he cut me im bleeding help me she put the harrowing wail of a frightened child into her voice as she stumbled forward he was going to rape me get me away from him oh please oh the trooper gave in to his instincts over here miss youll be all right hes that fella from prince william isnt he the one killed that girl wheres the knife in his belt he picked me up at a rest stop she cried he kidnapped me put your hands up the trooper called over the microphone and i mean now tate did what happened the cop asked bett who was stumbling closer cut me i need a doctor the words were lost in the sobbing you in the car leave your right hand up and with your left reach out the window and open the door dont lower that right hand tate didnt move im not telling you again i have a put it down came betts raw scream from inches behind his head tates pistol was resting at the cops throat oh shit do it ive got him covered lady you do anything to me and hes gone ill shoot him i swear but he said this out of shame not resolve and when bett screamed were after my daughter and ill kill you right now if i have to the cops disgusted grunt was followed by the sound of his large pistol hitting the dirt bett stepped away from the man who towered over her he went limp as he saw the ferocity in her face maybe wondering just how close to death hed come he sagged against the car all right bett muttered lie down on the ground there on your stomach tate was out of the car and jogging toward them therere other troopers coming lady theyll be here in minutes all the more reason to move he eased down bett handed the cops pistol to tate cuff him and lets go she said but tate put his hand on her shoulder no youre staying no tate bett said holding a wad of kleenexes up to her bloody chin i want to come what could he say to her that there wasnt anything she could do and tate needed to focus on saving meganif she could be saved that it was important for her to stay here and tell the police exactly what had happened send them out to the hospital they were both surefire arguments but tate answered instead from his heart and told her the truth simply i dont want to risk losing you she looked at the dark blood on the kleenex and up at tate once more she nodded now listen to me he said gravely when they get here just set the gun down and put your hands up theyll be nervous and looking to shoot do exactly what they say you hear me she nodded he touched her cheek wiping away some blood a sexy woman with a scarwont be a man in the countyll keep his hands off you youll get her wont you tate ill get her he kissed her forehead and ran to the car he floored the accelerator splattering the squad car with gravel and dirt as he drove over a crest in the road the tach nosing into the red crescent of the warning zone he caught a glimpse of bett in the rearview mirror crouching beside the prone trooper undoubtedly apologizing earnestly still the pistol that was gripped in both her hands was pointed steadily at his face she couldnt take it anymore crazy megan was gone dead and sleeping with the fishes the depleted air suffocated her the smellsthe rot and the sweet scent from embalmed skinwrapped themselves around her throat and squeezed which was bad enough but then the panic started to sizzle through her body like electricity the claustrophobia no no no she said or maybe she just thought it no no let me out let me out let me out suddenly she wasnt even worried that matthews was outside the casket waiting for her it didnt matter she couldnt stay inside a moment longer megan pushed against the lid of the coffin it didnt move she tried again with all her strength nothing ah she gasped oh please god no hed locked her in she pounded on the lid then heard a wild laugh outside words she couldnt distinguish more laughter more words louder two having fun together likes you peter likes you let me out let me out her voice rose to a wild keening her whole body shivered in violent spasms you fucker you fuck let me outoutoutout with both her fists megan pounded on the lid until they bled banged it with her head feeling with horror peters cold face against her neck his cold penis against her thigh from outside aaron matthews beat on the lid too responding to her pounding then more laughter and finally more tapping like a drummer keeping perfect time with the rhythm of her raw screams no subtlety no nuance tate collier came to the end of palmer road and saw the mental hospital in front of him he aimed betts car directly toward the gate got his speed up to about forty and bounded over logs and potholes in the neglected surface he saw the infamous gray mercedes parked in the staffonly carport he saw a faint light in one of the windows he had no plan other than the obvious and as he skidded around a fallen pine and straightened for the final assault on the gate he pressed the accelerator down harder sealing his resolve he pressed his hands into the steering wheel pinning himself into the seat the car plowed through the chain link the air bag popped with an astonishingly loud bang hed forgotten about it and hadnt closed his eyes he was momentarily blinded and lost control of the car when he could see again he found the vehicle skidding sideways narrowly missing the mercedes the volvo crashed obliquely into the cinder blocks stunning him tate leapt out of the car and ran to the first door he could find gripping his pistol hard he flung all his weight against the double panels he was expecting them to be locked but the doors swung open with virtually no resistance and he stumbled headfirst into a large dim lobby he saw shadows shapes of furniture angles of walls unlit lamps dust motes circling in the air he saw faint shafts of predawn blue light bleeding in through the windows but he never saw the bat or tire iron or whatever it was that hummed through the air behind him and caught him with a glancing blow just above the ear iv the silence of the deed a hand stroked his hair lying on his side on a cold floor tate slowly opened his eyes which stung fiercely from his own sweat he tried to focus on the face before him he believed momentarily that the soft fingers were betts shed been the first person in his thoughts as he came to consciousness but he found that the blue eyes he gazed into were megans hey honey he wheezed dad her face was pale her hair pasted to her head with sweat her hands bloody they were in the lobby of the decrepit hospital his hands were bound behind him with scratchy rope his vision was blurry he got up and nearly fainted from the pain that roared in his temple aaron matthews was sitting on a chair nearby watching them both like the helpless prisoners that they were what astonishing black eyes he has tate thought like dark lasers they turned to you as if you were the only person in the universe why patients would tell him anything he understood why bett had been powerless to resist him earlier that night when hed come to her house konnie too and megan then he saw that matthews was hurt a large patch of blood covered the side of his shirt and he was sweating his nose too was bloody tate glanced at megan she gave a weak smile and nodded answering his tacit question if she was responsible for the wound he lowered his head to the girls shoulder a moment later tate looked up youve lost those five pounds you wanted to he said to her youre lean and mean it was ten she joked matthews finally said well tate collier well such a smooth baritone voice tate reflected but not phony or slick so natural so comforting patients would cling to every word he uttered i was just doing my job tate finally said to him peters trial i mean the evidence was there the jury believed it megan frowned and tate explained about the trial and the boys murder in prison the girl scowled said to matthews i knew youd never worked with him on cases those were just more lies matthews didnt even notice her he crossed his arms you probably dont know it collier but i used to watch you in court after pete died id go to your trials id sit in the back of the gallery for hours and hours you know what struck me you reminded me of myself in therapy sessions talking to the patients leading them where they didnt want to go you did exactly the same with the witnesses and the juries tate said nothing matthews smiled briefly and i learned some things about the law mens rea the state of a killers mindhe has to intend the death in order to be guilty of murder well that was you all right at petes trial you murdered pete you intended him to die my job was to prosecute cases as best i could if matthews pounced that was true then why did you quit prosecuting why did you turn tail and run because i regretted what happened to your son tate answered matthews lowered his sweaty stubbly face you looked at my boy and said youre dead you stood up in court and felt the power flowing through you and you liked it tate looked around the room you did all this and you went after all the otherskonnie and hanson and eckhard bett too mom megan whispered no shes okay tate reassured her i had to stop you matthews said you kept coming you wouldnt listen to reason you wouldnt do what you were supposed to this is where you were committed right him megan asked i thought hed worked here i thought so too tate said but then i remembered testimony at peters trial no he was a therapist but he was the one committed here nodding at matthews not peter tate recalled the trial mr bogan now dr rothstein could you give an opinion of the source and nature of peters difficulties dr rothstein yes sir peter displays socialization problems he is more comfortable with inanimate creationsstories and books and cartoons and the likethan with people he also suffers from what i call affect deficit the reason from reviewing his medical records appears to be that his father would lock him in his room for long periods of timeweeks even monthsand the only contact the boy would have with anyone was with his father aaron he wouldnt even let the boys mother see him peter withdrew into his books and television apparently the only time the boy spent with his mother and others was when his fat her was committed in mental hospitals for bipolar depression and delusional behavior matthews said i was here lets see on six intakes must have been four years altogether i was like a jailhouse lawyer collier as soon as the patients heard i was a therapist they started coming to me so you were patient matthews megan said eyes widening in the reports about the deaths here thats my megan matthews said she said to tate they closed this place because of a bunch of suicides i thought it was peter whod killed them but it was you tate asked matthews the dsmiii diagnosis was that i was sociopathicwell its called an antisocialcriminal personality now how delicate i knew the hospital examiners in richmond were looking for an excuse to close down places like this so i simply helped them out the place was too understaffed and too incompetent to keep patients from killing themselves so they shut it down but it was really just a game to you right megan asked in disgust seeing how many patients you could talk into suicide matthews shrugged he continued i got transferred to a halfway house and one bright sunny may morning i walked out the front door moved to prince william county right behind your farm and started planning how to destroy you matthews winced and pressed his side the wound didnt seem that severe tate recalled something else from the trial and asked what about your wife matthews said nothing but his eyes responded tate understood she was your first victim wasnt she did you talk her into killing herself or maybe just slip some drugs into her wine during dinner she was vulnerable matthews responded insecure most therapists are tate asked what was she trying to do take peter away from you yes she was she wanted to place him in a hospital fulltime she shouldnt have meddled i understood peter no one else did but you made peter the way he was megan blurted you cut him off from the world she was right tate recalled the defenses expert witness dr rothstein testifying that if you arrest development by isolating a child before the age of eight socialand communicationsskills will never develop youve basically destroyed the child forever tate remembered too how hed handled the expert witnesss testimony at peter matthewss murder trial the court the commonwealth may crossexamine mr collier dr rothstein thank you for that trip down memory lane about the defendants sad history but let me ask you psychologically is the defendant capable of premeditated murder dr rothstein peter matthews is a troubled mr collier your honor the court please answer the question sir dr rothstein i mr collier is the defendant capable of premeditated murder dr rothstein yes but mr collier no further questions all he needed was me matthews now raged he didnt need anyone else in his life wed spend hours togetherwhen my wife wasnt trying to sneak him out the door did you love him that much tate asked you dont have a clue do you why you know what we did peter and i we talked about everything about snakes about stars about floods about explorers about airplanes about the mind delusional ramblings tate imagined poor peter baffled and lonely undoubtedly could do nothing but listen yet with a sorrowful twist deep within him tate realized that this was something megan and he didnt do they didnt talk at all they never had and now we wont ever he realized weve lost that chance forever their captor fell silent looking into a corner of the hospital lobby lost in a memory or thought or some confused delusion finally tate said so aaron tell me what you want tell me exactly he closed his eyes fighting the incredible pain in his head after a moment matthews said i want justice pure and simple im going to kill your daughter and youre going to watch youll live with that sight for the rest of your life so its come to this tate sighed and thought as he had so often on the way to the jury box or the podium in a debate all right time to get to work i dont know how you can have justice aaron tate said to him i just dont know in all my years practicing law matthewss face writhed in disgust oh stop right there what tate asked innocently i hear it the psychiatrist said the glib tongue the smooth words you have the orators gift sure we know that but so do i im immune to you i wont try to talk you into a single thing aaron you dont seem to be the sort it wont work not with me the advocates tricks the therapists tricks personalize the discourse aaron this and aaron that try to get me to think of you as a specific human being tate but that wont work tate see its tate collier the human being i despise undeterred tate continued was he your only child peter why even try matthews rolled his eyes all i want is to get out of this and save our lives is that a surprise a perfect example of a rhetorical question well no its not a surprise but theres nothing you can say thats going to make any difference im trying to save your life too aaron they know about you the police you heard the message from the detective i assume on your answering machine they may figure it out eventually but since youre here by yourself an escapee i think i have a bit of time what does he mean megan asked escapee he saw no reason to tell her now that her friend amy was dead he shook his head and continued lets talk aaron im a wealthy man youre going to have to leave the country ill give you some money if you let us go leading with your weakest argument doesnt that mean youve just lost the debate thats what you say on your american forensics association tape the faint smile never wavered from tates face you saw my house the land he continued you know ive got resources a splinter of disdain in matthewss eyes how much do you want youre using a rhetorical fallacy appealing to a false needfor diversion matthews smiled i do it all the time soften up the patient get the defenses down then bang a kick in the head come on i didnt do this for ransom thats obvious whatever your motive was aaron the circumstancesve changed they know about you now but youve got a chance to get out of the country i can get you a half million in cash just like that more by hocking the house matthews said nothing but paced slowly staring at megan who gazed back defiantly tate knew of course that money wasnt the issue at all neither was helping matthews escape his immediate purpose was simply to make the man indecisive wear down his resistance matthews was right this was a diversion and even though the man knew it tate believed the technique was working i cant make you a rich man but i can make you comfortable pointless matthews said shaking his head as if he were disappointed aaron you cant change things tate continued you cant make it the way it was you cant bring peter back so will you just let us go specific request within the opponents power to grant matthews recited requiring only an affirmative or negative response your skills are still in top form collier my answer however is negative you tell me youre after justice tate shrugged but i wonder if its not really something else a flicker in the doctors eyes have you really thought about why youre doing this tate asked of course why i tate said quickly its to take the pain away isnt it matthewss lips moved as he carried on a conversation with himself or his dead wife or his dead son or perhaps no one at all what a man hears he may doubt what a man sees tate leaned toward him ignoring the agony in his head he whispered urgently think about it aaron think this is very important what if you get it wrong what if killing megan makes the pain worse nice try matthews cried setting up straw men or what if it has no effect at all what if this is your one chance to make the pain go away and it doesnt work did you ever consider that youre trying to distract me you lost someone you loved you lie on your back for hours paralyzed with the pain you wake up at two am and think youre going mad right matthews fell silent tate saw hed touched a nerve i know all about that it happened to me tate leaned forward and without feigning matched the agony he saw in matthewss face with pain of his own ive been there l lost someone i loved more than life itself i lost my wife i can see it in your face these arent tricks aaron i do know what im talking about thats all you wantthe pain to go away youre not a lust killer aaron youre not an expediency killer youre not a hired killer you only kill when theres a reason and that reason is to make the pain go away and to tates astonishment he heard a womans voice beside him a smooth contralto megan gazing into matthewss eyes was saying even those patients you killed here aaron you didnt want to kill them i was wrong it wasnt a game at all you just wanted to help them stop hurting excellent tate thought proud of her the pain the lawyer took over thats what this is all about you just want it to go away matthewss eyes were uncertain even wild how we hate the confusing and the unknown and how we flock to those who offer us answers simple as a childs drawing ill tell you aaron that ive lived with your sons death every day since the department of correction called and told me what happened i feel that pain too i know what youre going through i suddenly matthews leapt forward and grabbed tates shirt began slugging him madly knocking him to the floor megan cried out and stepped toward them but the madman shoved her to the floor again he screamed at tate you know you know do you you have no fucking idea all the days the weeks and weeks that i havent been able to do anything but lie on my back and stare at the ceiling thinking about the trial you know what i see i dont see peters face i see your back you standing in the courtroom with your back to my son you sent him to die but you didnt even look at him the jury were the only people in that room werent they no tate reflected they were the only people in the universe he said to matthews im sorry for you i dont want your fucking pity another wave of fury crossed his face and he lifted tate in his powerful hands and shoved him to the floor again rolled him on his back he took a knife from his pocket opened it with a click and bent down over tate no megan cried matthews slipped the blade past tates lips into his mouth tate tasted metal and felt the chill of the sharp point against his tongue he didnt move a muscle then matthewss eyes crinkled with what seemed to be humor his lips moved and he seemed to be speaking to himself he withdrew the blade no collier no not you i dont want you but why not tate whispered quickly why not tell me because youre going to live your life without your daughter just like im going to live mine without my son and thatll take the pain away yes the lawyer nodded then you have to let her go he struggled to keep the triumph from his voiceas he always did in court or at the debate podium then you have to let her go and kill me its the only answer for you daddy megan whimpered tate believed it was the first time hed heard her say the word in ten years only answer matthews asked uncertainly tate had known that eventually it would come to this but what a time what a place for it to happen all cats see in the dark therefore midnight can see in the dark he leaned his head against the girls cheek oh honey megan asked what is it what unless midnight is blind tate began to speak his voice cracked he started again aaron what you want makes perfect sense except that it was megans eyes he gazed into not their captors as he said except that im not her father matthews seemed to gaze down at his captives but he was backlit by dawn light in the picture window and tate couldnt see where his eyes were turned megan pale in the same oblique light clasped her injured face a pink sheen of blood was on her cheeks and hands she was frowning matthews laughed but tate could see that his quick mind was considering facts and drawing tentative conclusions im disappointed collier thats obvious and simpleminded youre lying when you were stalking megan and me how often did you see us together tate asked that doesnt mean anything you followed us for how long a splinter of doubt like a faint cloud obscuring the sun momentarily tate had seen this in the eyes of a thousand witnesses matthews answered six months how many weekends was she with me that doesnt how many two i think you broke into my house to plant those letters how many pictures of her did you see dad how many tate asked firmly ignoring the girl matthews finally said none what did her bedroom look like another hesitation then a storeroom how much affection did you ever see between us did i seem like a father ive got dark curly hair and eyes beth auburn and megans blond for gods sake does she even look like me look at the eyes look he did he said uncertainly i still dont believe you no daddy no you went to see my wife tate continued to matthews squeezing megans leg to silence her the doctor nodded well youre a therapist what did you see in betts face when you were talking to her what was there when she was telling you about us and about megan matthews reflected i saw guilt thats right tate said guilt matthews looked from one of his captives to the other seventeen years ago tate began slowly speaking to megan finally revealing the truth theyd kept from her for all these years i was prosecuting cases making a name for myself the washington post called me the hottest young prosecutor in the commonwealth id take on every assignment that came into the office i was working eighty hours a week i got home to your mother on weekends at best id go for three or four days in a row and hardly even call i was trying to be my grandfather the lawyerfarmerpatriarch id be a local celebrity wed have a huge family an old manse sunday dinners reunions holidays the whole nine yards he took a deep breath that was when your aunt susan had her first bad heart attack she was in the hospital for a month and mostly bedridden after that what are you saying megan whispered susan was married her husband you remember him uncle harris you were right in your letter megan your mother did spend a lot of time caring for her sister harris and your mother both did no megan said abruptly i dont believe it theyd go to the hospital together harris and bett theyd have lunch dinner co shopping sometimes bett cooked him meals in his studio helped him clean your aunt felt better knowing he was being looked after and it was okay with me i was free to handle my cases she told you all this megan asked mom his face was a blank mask as he said slowly no harris did the day of his funeral tate had been upstairs on that eerily warm november night years ago the funeral reception at the collier farm was over standing at a bedroom window tate had looked out over the yard felt the hot air filled with leaf dust smelled cedar from the closet hed just checked on threeyearold megan asleep in her room and hed come here to open windows to air out the upstairs bedrooms several relatives would be spending the night hed looked down at the backyard gazing at bett in her long black dress she hiked up the hem and climbed onto the new picnic table to unhook the japanese lanterns tate had tried to open the window but it was stuck he took off his jacket to get a better grip and heard the crinkle of paper in the pocket at the funeral service one of harriss attorneys had given him an envelope handaddressed to him from harris marked personal apparently written just before the man had shot himself hed forgotten about it he opened the envelope and read the brief letter inside tate had nodded to himself folded the note slowly and walked downstairs then outside he remembered hearing a loretta lynn song playing on the stereo he remembered hearing the rustling of the hot wind over the brown grass and sedge stirring pumpkin vines and the refuse of the corn harvest he remembered watching the arc of betts narrow arm as she reached for an orange lantern she glanced down at him i have something to tell you hed said what shed whispered then seeing the look in his eyes bett had asked desperately what what shed climbed down from the bench tate came up close and instead of putting his arm around his wifes shoulders as a husband might do late at night in a house of death he handed her the letter she read it oh my oh bett didnt deny anything that was contained in the note harriss declaration of intense love for her the affair his fathering megan betts refusal to marry him and her threat to take the girl away from him forever if harris told betts sister of the infidelity at the end the words had degenerated into mad rambling and his chillingly lucid acknowledgment that the pain was simply too much neither of them cried that night as tate had packed a suitcase and left they never spent another night under the same roof despite the presence of a madman now holding a knife hovering a few feet from them tates concentration was wholly on the girl to his surprise her face blossomed not with horror or shock or anger but with sympathy she touched his leg and youre the one that got hurt so bad im sorry daddy im sorry tate looked at matthews he said so thats why your argument doesnt work aaron taking her away from me wont do what you want matthews didnt speak his eyes were turned out the window gazing into the blue dawn tate said you know the classic reasons given for punishing crimes aaron to condition away bad behaviordoesnt work a deterrent useless to rehabilitatethats a joke to protect societywell only if we execute the bad guys or keep them locked up forever no you know the real reason why we punish were ashamed to admit it but oh how we love it good old biblical retribution bloody revenge is the only honest motive for punishment why because its purpose is to take away the victims pain thats what you want aaron but theres only one way youll have that by killing me its not perfect but itll have to do megan was sobbing matthews leaned his head against the window the sun was up now and flashed on and off as strips of livercolored clouds moved quickly east he seemed diminished and changed as if he were beyond disappointment or sorrow let her go tate whispered it doesnt even make sense to kill her because shes a witness they know about you anyway matthews crouched beside megan put the back of his hand against her cheek lifted it away and looked at the glistening streak left by her tears on his skin he kissed her hair all right i agree megan started to protest but tate knew that hed won nothing she could say or do at this point would change his decision ill call the dogs to the run ill be back in five minutes is it true she asked tears glistening on her cheeks oh yes honey its true you never said anything your mother and i decided not to until after susan died you know how close bett is to your aunt she wanted her never to find out about the affairit wouldve been too hard for her the doctors only gave her a year or two to live we were going to wait to tell you until shed passed away but megan whispered he smiled wanly thats right shes still alive why didnt you tell me last year or two years ago i was old enough not to say anything to aunt susan tate examined the wounds on her palms pressed his hands against them he couldnt speak at first finally he said the moment passed all these years she whispered i thought i mustve done something she lowered her head to his shoulder what a terrible thing i must have been for you what a reminder honey i wish i could tell you different but i cant you were half the person i loved most in the world and half the person i most hated one time i said something to mom she said weeping softly id been with you for the weekend and mom asked how it went i said id had an okay time but what could you expect you were just an adequate father i thought she was going to whip me she freaked out totally she said you were the best man shed ever met and i was never ever supposed to say that again tate smiled an adequate father for an inconvenient daughter why didnt you ever try it again the two of you he echoed the moment passed how much you must love her tate laughed sourly to himself at the irony the child who drove husband and wife apart had now brought them back togetherif only for one day how scarce love is he thought how rarely does it all come together the pledge the assurance the need the circumstance the hungry desire to share minutes with someone else and the dear desperation too its miraculous when love actually works he looked her over and decided that the two of them his exwife and her daughter would be finenow that the truth had been dumped between them a long time coming but better than never oh yes theyd do fine gritty footsteps approached now listen to me he said urgently when he lets you out find a phone and call ted beauridge at fairfax county police tell him your mothers probably in jail in luray or front royal what no time to explain but shes there tell him to get cops out here she told them you were here but they might notve believed her the girl looked at him with eyes that reminded him of her mothers not the violet shade of coursethose were betts and betts alone but the unique mix of the ethereal and the earthy matthews appeared in the doorway they turned to look at the gaunt man standing before them his muscular hand pressed to his bloody belly okay get going tate said to her run like hell go on matthews said and reached forward to take her arm she spun away from him and hugged tate hard he felt her arms around his back felt her face against her ear heard her speaking to him a torrent of fervid words flowing out coming from a source other than the heart and mind of a seventeenyearold high school junior megan he began but she took his face in both her hands and said shhh daddy remember bears cant talk matthews grabbed her again and pulled her away took her to the door he unlocked it and shoved her outside the door closed with a snap behind her through a dirty barred window tate saw her sprint down the driveway and disappear through the gate so collier said glancing up at matthews so he echoed outside the lawyer asked looking around at the gloomy place would that be all right id rather matthews hesitated for a moment but then decided why not yes thats all right he unlocked the door again and they stepped into the parking area and walked around into the grounds behind the asylum past the wild rottweilers in their runs matthews was thinking back to the times hed been committed here he recalled how beautiful these lawns and gardens had been then well why wouldnt they be give five hundred crazy people grounds to tend and brother youve got a showplace hed sat for hours and hours and hours talking to other patients andin his imaginationto his dead peter sometimes the boy responded sometimes not the dawn sun was still below the horizon but the sky was bright as they walked side by side through the tall grass and goldenrod and milkweed while dragonflies zipped from their path grasshoppers bounced against their legs leaving dots of brown spit on their clothing the dogs were in a frenzy behind them sniffing the ground and bounding at the wire fence of their run trying to escape and go after the intruder who walked beside their master look at this place matthews said conversationally he waved his arm i remember it like it was yesterday i remember the strange things people would say the delusional ones the paranoid ones the depressed ones the ones who were simply nutsyou know collier the mind isnt an exact science whatever the diagnostic and statistical manual says some people are just plain crazy and thats all you can ever say about them but i always listened to them why people give themselves away like free samples at a grocery store hand themselves to you on platters and what do they use words arent words the most astonishing thing collier said you bet they are there wasnt much time matthews reflected he supposed he had an hour or two until the police arrived at best it would take megan two hours to get to the nearest phone enough time to finish here bury peter and get to dulles for a flight to los angeles or maybe he should just drive west hide in the hills of west virginia he took a deep breath stop here they were beside a shallow ditch it would make a fine grave for collier and hed decided that hed kill the lawyer with a single shot to his head no pain no torment and he wouldnt let the dogs have the body out of respect for a worthy adversary then the lawyer stunned him by closing his eyes and whispering our father who art in heaven he slowly completed the lords prayer matthews laughed then asked you believe in god collier nodded why does that surprise you when id see you in court it seemed that only the judge and jury were your gods no no i believe he exists that hes merciful and hes just just matthews asked skeptically well hes the reason i dont send people to death row anymore do you believe in god im not sure matthews said you know i always wanted the chance to prove the existence of god in a debate how would you do that matthews asked truly curious resolved god exists isnt that how debates start collier looked up at the purple sky you know voltaire not really no id make his argument he said there had to be a god because he couldnt imagine a watch without a watchmaker matthews nodded yes i can see that thats good thats compelling but of course then you run into all of the counterarguments the con side such as incompatible religious sects interpretations of holy scriptures proven wrong later no empirical proof of miracles the crusades ethical and secular selfinterest terrorism thats an uphill battle all right no answer for that oh sure ive got an answer matthews was suddenly fascinated after peters death hed prayed every night for six months he believed that the boy bad answered some of those communiqués it gave him clues but not proof that peters soul floated nearby what is it whats the answer he asked hungrily that a watch collier answered slowly no matter how well made can never comprehend its watchmaker when we claim to understand god everything breaks down if god exists then by definition hes knowable and soulsyours mine megans petersare beyond our understanding when we create human institutions to represent god theyre inherently wrong so he has to exist apart from our flawed visions of him yes it makes sense how simple how perfect youve thought about questions like this havent you because of peter yes eyes on matthewss collier said you miss him so much dont you yes i do matthews stared down at the ground for all he knew hed stood on this very spot two or three years ago studying slugs or dung beetles or ants hour upon hour wondering how in their wordless world they communicated their passions and fears you can get help aaron its not too late youll be in jail but you can still be content you can find a doctor to help you somebody whos as good as you were oh i dont think so its too late for that one thing i learnedyou cant talk somebody out of his nature your character is your fate collier said matthews laughed heraclitus hed learned the aphorism from one of colliers closing statements he lifted the gun toward the lawyer then colliers eyes flickered slightly you wont turn yourself in collier asked no im sorry the lawyer said matthews frowned what do you mean im so sorry a snap of brush behind him matthews spun around there stood megan holding the gun collier had brought with him matthews had left it in the lobby of the hospital and had forgotten about it the girl was ten feet away and was pointing the black muzzle at matthewss chest matthews laughed to himself oh yes he understood remembered her whispering to tate before shed walked out of the asylum theyd planned this together collier would stall himwith his talk of theologyand megan would pretend to run but would return for the gun he remembered collier protesting as theyd hugged but shed had her way maybe she wasnt his blood kin but at the moment she was her fathers daughter he glanced at her eyes drop the gun she ordered but he didnt he wondered would she go through with it she was only seventeen and yes she had anger in her heartenough to attack him with a knifebut not enough to kill he believed character is fate he saw compassion fear and weakness in her eyes he could stop her he decided he could get her to lower the gun long enough to shoot her megan listen to me he began in a soft voice gazing into her blue eyes which were so unlike colliers i know what youre thinking i know what youve been through but the first bullet tugged at his side near the knife wound and he felt a rib snap he was swinging his gun toward her when another shot struck his shoulder and arm collier dropped to his knees clear of the line of fire megan stepped closer peter matthews whispered struggling to hold on to his pistol she pushed through the grass until she was only a few feet away matthews squeezed the grip of the pistol then he looked up into her eyes always the eyes her gun fired again and for an instant his vision was filled with a thousand suns and in his ears was a chorus of noisevoices perhaps peters among them perhaps and then there was blackness and silence the beach at san cristo del sol in belize is one of the finest in latin america even now in may the air is torrid but the steady breezes soothe the hordes of tourists during their endless trips from the airconditioned bars and seafood joints to the pools to the beach and back again windsurfing paragliding waterskiing and racing jet skis keep the surface of the turquoise water perpetually turbulent and within the bay itself hundreds of snorkiers and resortcourse scuba divers engage in their elegantly awkward amphibious ballets the town is also a wellknown staging area for those who wish to see mayan ruins there are two beautifully preserved cities within five kilometers of the main drag in san cristo the caribe inn is the most luxurious of all the hotels in town a spanish colonial hacienda that has four stars from mobil and accolades from a number of other sources proudly displayed behind the registration desk at which tate collier now stood hoping fervently that the clerk spoke english the man did it turned out and tate explained that he had reservations proffering passports and his american express card thats a party of the clerk queried party of two ah the desk clerk responded tate filled out the registration card with ungainly strokes so you are from virginia the clerk said near washington si tate responded selfconsciously ready for his pronunciation to throw the conversation off kilter if not insult the clerk personally i have been there several times i like the smithsonian especially si tate tried again forgetting even the words that conveyed some meaningless pleasantrywords hed practiced on the flight for a man whod made his way in the world by speaking tates command of foreign languages was abysmal he watched the clerk glance down at the reservation form with a momentarily perplexed frown on his dark handsome face tate knew why the clerk had taken a good look at the attractive woman whod entered the hotel on tates arm a moment before and though surely in this line of work the clerk had seen just about everything he couldnt for the life of him figure out why these two would want separate rooms a man is after all a man and an age difference of twenty years well thats nothing megan came out of the lobby phone booth and walked to the desk just as the clerk was showing tate a diagram of the available rooms tate pointed to two first a smaller inside room then a corner unit with a view of the beach ill take this one my daughterll have the corner room no dad you take the nice one ah this is your daughter the clerk said his curiosity satisfied of course i should have known im sorry tate asked him i mean the resemblance the young lady takes after you the mans suspicions crept back when he saw the two guests exchange fast glances and struggle to suppress laughter tate thought about pulling out drivers licenses and proving the relationship but then decided its none of this guys business besides mystery has an appeal that documented fact will always lack they settled on the rooms and after tates card was imprinted they followed the bellhop through a veranda josh said his new physical therapist is great megan told him glad to hear it but the way he put it was he said shes great think shes old and fat well be back in six days you can find out for yourself when do you say de nada again after somebody thanks you it means its nothing they say gracias and then i say de nada tate repeated the words several times as if he were a walking berlitz tape then i called bett megan continued shes glad we got in okay she said to take lots of pictures ill call her later she urn was going over to brads tonight but she said it in a funny way like there was something going on is anything going on i dont have a clue megan shrugged she said she talked to konnie and hes coming to your office on tuesday at nine to talk about the case the previous week tate had made his first appearance in a criminal court in nearly five yearskonnies arraignment hed answered the judges simple query with simpler words my client pleads not guilty your honor he had a novel defense planned it was called induced intoxication and although hed promised megan that they would be spending the week doing nothing but seeing the sights and partying hed hidden three law books in his suitcase and suspected the last day of the trip would find him with at least a rough draft of his opening statement to the juryif not a set of deposition questions or two he knew that as soon as megan met a handsome young windsurferprobably at the cocktail party that nighthe would have at least a few hours free on most of the evenings he and megan arrived at their rooms gracias de nada tate said and slipped the confused bellhop an outrageously generous tip a half hour later theyd showered and were in khaki shorts tshirts and wicker hats every inch los turistas they walked down to the lobby and asked about how they might bicycle to the nearest mayan ruin the clerk arranged for the bike rental and gave them directions it was just past the afternoon siesta and most of the guests were headed for the white sand beach but tate and megan snagged two battered bicycles from the rack in front of the inn and started away from town which way she called he pointed and they mounted up despite the opposing foot traffic and the astonishing heat they cycled fast along the cracked asphalt path straight into the dense fragrant jungle standing on the pedals hollering and laughing racing each other
