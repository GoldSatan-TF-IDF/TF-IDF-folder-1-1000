above the hips a mens chiton might be worn long or short worn very short or made of a small piece of cloth it was sometimes called a chitoniskos our guess is that most chitons were made from a piece of cloth roughly x inches and then belted or roped to fit long or short pins pleating and belting could be simple or elaborate most of these garments would in greece have been made of wool in the east linen might have been preferred chlamys classical greek a garment like a cloak made from a single piece of fabric woven tightly and perhaps even boiled the chlamys was usually pinned at the neck and worn as a cloak but could also be thrown over the shoulder and pinned under the right or left arm and worn as a garment free men are sometimes shown naked with a chlamys but rarely shown in a chiton without a chlamys the chlamys not the chiton was the essential garment or so it appears men and women both wear the chlamys although differently again a x piece of cloth seems to drape correctly and

represent the middle class of free men in most cities and while sometimes they seem like medieval knights in their outlook they are also like town militia and made up of craftsmen and small farmers in the early classical period a man with as little as twelve acres under cultivation could be expected to own the aspis and serve as a hoplite hoplomachos classical greek a man who taught fighting in

used by greek hoplites in warfare eight to ten deep and as wide as circumstance allowed greek commanders experimented with deeper and shallower formations but the phalanx was solid and very difficult to break presenting the enemy with a veritable wall of spear points and shields whether the macedonian style with pikes or the greek style with spears also phalanx can refer to the body of fighting

be composed of a dozen taxeis in a great battle xiphos classical greek a straightbladed infantry sword usually carried by hoplites or psiloi classical greek art especially redfigure ware shows many hoplites wearing them but only a handful have been recovered and theres much debate about the shape and use they seem very like a roman gladius bc the kurgan of kineas rose above the delta of the tanais river like one of the pyramids of distant aegypt rendered in turf at the top a plinth of parian marble winked white in the sun at the foot of the kurgan where the springbrown tanais washed against the muddy beach stood srayanka who had been kineass wife behind her waited a thirtyoared open boat the stern firmly set in the mud awaiting her pleasure while she hugged her children again melitta who at twelve was already the image of her mother and satyrus who was her twin and yet showed his father more in his hips and shoulders and around his mouth a mouth that was quivering with suppressed tears satyrus hugged his mother again and then melitta took his hand and they stood on the beach with philokles their tutor mind you let them away from their scrolls and dead poets srayanka said take them riding fishing too much writing kills the spirit reading trains the mind as athletics trains the body philokles intoned automatically he slurred the word athletics i should only be gone five days one ugly task and were off to the sea of grass for the summer what have i forgotten srayanka looked at satyrus who remembered things youve told us everything melitta said the new athletics coach from corinth should arrive any day srayanka said see that he is well received i know philokles said he was no more drunk than usual and resented her repeated instructions with the ease of ancient habit we all know melitta said satyrus would have liked to speak but it took all his effort not to cry he hated being separated from his mother but he gathered his wits took a deep breath and said i want to go in the boat srayanka smiled at him because satyrus loved boats and the sea the way his sister loved horses and the sea of grass soon my dear soon you can command my boat she looked out over the water but not this trip satyrus trembled with the effort of suppressing his reaction but he smiled at her and she smiled back pleased that her son was learning to command himself and then despite her misgivings srayanka walked down the beach and up the boarding plank into the boat they took two days to sail to the gap in the long sandbanks that defined the bay of salmon and another day to make their way through the passages between the temporary islands to the euxine once they were clear of the last treacherous mudbank they coasted along the shore camping in the open for the night and then rowing slowly along the beach before herons city of pantecapaeum looking for the rendezvous it was one of those days people remember when they remember being happy the sky as deep and blue as it could be the spring sun lighting the green grass as it rolled away to the horizon the sea a perfect azure reflecting the bowl of heaven and the crisp golden beach neatly contrasting the black mud of the fields to the south and west in autumn they would be full of grain the grain that made the euxine rich srayanka sat in the stern of the open boat with a handful of her best warriors and ataelus a sakje tribesman from the east who had been her husbands scout he was more than a scout now his clan numbered in excess of six hundred riders a mixture of greeks and local maeotae farmers like the sindi further west rowed the boat srayanka smiled to watch them row together because the mixture of the three races represented her notquiteakingdom on the tanais river today she was going to land near pantecapaeum to seal her status with a treaty a greek concept but well within her understanding that would ensure the safety of her shipping and her farmers and her children it was all very different from the way of her childhood she thought as her face warmed in the sun as a spearmaiden she had ridden the sea of grass when angered she had made war when her enemies were stronger than she she had ridden away into the grass and vanished kineas and his dream of a kingdom on the euxine had changed all that now she had thousands of farmers to protect and hundreds of greek colonists and traders hostages she could no longer ride away well up the beach as far as a good horse would go in two hundred heartbeats she could see the man with whom she had come to treat heron the tyrant of pantecapaeum like ataelus heron had been one of her husbands men a dozen years ago not one of her favourites but the bonds held heron intended to make himself the king of the euxine and much as that thought offended her acknowledging him would cost her no horses as the old sakje saying went she chuckled ataelus gave her one of his broad smiles it was easy and foolish to take those smiles for a lack of ready wit ataelus was just one of those men who found much to smile at for being happy ataelus asked fifteen years of living around greeks and his greek had never improved were going to make heron the ghan of the inner sea she said in sakje in that language her contempt was obvious that she who openly wore the sword of cyrus and might end her days as queen of all the sakje on the sea of grass should bend the knee to some greek boy with a mere city at his beck and call for calling him eumeles ataelus said with a shrug in greek eumeles not heron srayanka watched the beach grow nearer and shook her head i cant bring myself to like him she said ataelus shrugged the most greek thing he did he was wearing a heavy overrobe of qin silk worked in gold under it he had a harness of bronze and horn scales despite his small stature he looked like what he was a cheerful warlord want to change your mind he asked finally speaking in sakje she shook her head she could see heron eumeles standing a little in front of his guard two dozen mercenaries he was showy dressed in purple and gold with red sandals and a fancy sword another man stood just behind him a stranger but his position said he was almost as important as heron the second man was not remarkable in his dress in his size in any way he had nondescript hair and was of middling height but the fact that he stood so near heron caused her to narrow her eyes who is he she asked in sakje no need to go into details with ataelus ataelus moved his chin the breadth of a finger but the gesture said that he too had never seen the man before srayanka smiled at her captain nothing so grand as a navarch as the greeks called their boat commanders put us ashore here she said well walk a little ataelus grinned at her caution the bow of the open boat hissed and grumbled as he passed over the waves in the shallow water and then made a firm crunch as they ran up the sand the men in the bow jumped free of the boat and dragged the light hull up the beach an armspan and then the rest of the rowers were out and the keel was dragged free of the water only then did the sakje none of them remotely resembling a sailor jump down on to the sand two of srayankas warriors touched the sand and then their brows srayanka watched heron just a few dozen horselengths away relaunch the boat she said in greek ready to sail in a moment ataelus raised an eyebrow humour an old woman srayanka said she checked her gorytos the bow case that every warrior wore all the time her fingers touching the bow and the arrows the knife strapped to the back of the case and the sword of cyrus at her waist all the sakje mimicked her the warriors looked at her and at ataelus im a fool she said lets get this done for my children she thought she liked her life she had no real need to be queen of all the sakje nor even to displace her former enemy marthax she wanted to enjoy the rest of her life one bend of her knee and all she had worked for was safe she did not want to bend her knee oh husband of my heart we defeated iskander and now i bend the knee to a fool walking in sand was messy and undignified and she wished shed overcome her fears and her contempt and landed the boat at herons feet eumeles feet she thought the scarecrow the useless boy a nonentity who pretended to be her husbands heir and then she was there a horselength from the tall thin man in the purple cloak she bowed to him she is beautiful the man behind heron said his accent was athenian and she thought of kineas he seemed startled by her all yours heron said he turned his back and vanished through his guards betrayal she knew it in an instant she got her akinakes the sword of cyrus as long as her arm and wickedly sharp in her hand before the guards could cross the sand what a fool to use that gesture to warn me of his betrayal she thought and the cool jade of the sword of cyrus steadied her she grabbed the first heavy spear thrust at her and jerked it and then reached over the mans big round shield to sink the point into his neck a blow in her side but the armour under her robe turned the point and she spun but they had already closed around her and they werent taking chances she went down almost to the ground and swung her short sword up under a shield and the man screamed as he went down and she was into his place a blow against her back and another and pain so sharp she felt her vision tunnel and the strength going from her legs but the other man was there and she fell at him she had lost control of her muscles before her sword slashed across the bridge of his nose and his blood fountained across her back she saw their feet some bare and some heavily sandalled fucking whore the athenian screamed she smiled even though dark was coming down and she knew just what that meant the solid sound of an arrow going home in flesh the complex sound of the head punching through the guards white leather thorax would have made her smile again except that she was too far down the dark path for that ataelus she thought alive and hence shooting save my children ataelus then shouts feet pounding the athenian cursing sounding like a man with a bad cold cold every part of her cold lying awake in her wagon on the sea of grass naked to invite kineas to play but cold and then the warmth the reward as he came into her bed warm and the smell of man and horse and dirty bronze that he wore like perfume dont blame me heron said i gave her to you you fucked it up she cut off my dddose the athenian groaned nonsense most of it is still there ive sent for my healer now what do you want her head heron was impatient she formulated her curse on him and spat it out syllable by syllable like the last drops of honey dripping from a jar as the darkness came down and she could still hear fuck you the athenian managed to sound as if he had a spine any more insults and ill tell lord cassander you died in the fighting am i clear good my healer will see to your nose and then i will attempt to rectify your mistake before it costs me more money and more time heron sounded as he always did superior you mbissed the little scyth and dhow his boats got away the athenian said the shock of his wound was wearing off you were the fool who gave us away burder mbe and cassander will come for you if you are an example of cassanders might i have just backed the wrong horse heron said give my regards to the lady olympias remember i am to be king of the euxine this was the price am i clear a pause she was supposed to bring the brats where the fuck are they i need them dead fuck you the athenian spat srayanka was losing interest the cold was going she could feel his warm feet against hers and she could smell the scent of old bronze and oil and horse and a little male sweat as always kineass touch relaxed her and she flowed away part i forging bc the sand of the palaestra was cool under his cheek but the weight of his new trainer crushed the air from his lungs you have a good physique for a boy the athlete said he rolled off his prospective pupil and offered him a hand but any time you offer a test of strength to a man hell beat you the new coach had the shoulders of a bull he stood a head taller than his twelveyearold student and he was wider deep of chest and with the sort of muscles that decorated heroic vases his name was theron and he had competed for the laurel at nemea and at olympia and lost narrowly at both he had come a long way to be the boys coach and he made it clear that he wanted to see what he was getting what he was getting was a slim figure with the muscles of a boy an athletic boy but he had neither weight nor breadth he was handsome enough with a shock of dark brown hair and widespaced eyes his body was well enough formed his nose as yet unbroken and he had not yet sprouted the hair of adolescence the boy grasped his teachers hand and popped to his feet he gave a petulant smile and rubbed his hip his shins were decorated with bruises the brown blotches so regular that his mother said that he looked as if he was wearing scythian trousers ill have you someday he said then he relented and grinned wondering if that was too brash theron shook his head youve speed and talent boy but that chest of yours will never have the width to put my head in the sand the boy bowed a natural movement devoid of servility as you say he said he didnt mean it and his attitude came out clearly in his delivery in fact there was a tinge of mockery to the sentence he glanced at his tutor another big man who reclined under the stoa of pillars the athletes resentment showed in his suddenly red face the boys sister perched in the cool arch under the colonnade laughed the new coach the prospective coach spun girl he said you are not allowed in the palaestra he inclined his head young mistress he moved a hand to cover his privates the males were both naked the young mistress rose from her concealment i disagree she said she was wearing a mans chiton over her slim hips and long legs she was also twelve years old with the first sign of her mothers deep breasts and with large and adult eyes of no particular colour my mother will insist if you like i too wish to learn to fight the greek way theron a born athlete who had travelled three thousand stades across the euxine to take a contract that would make him a wealthy man in corinth for the rest of his life stood his ground it is unseemly for women to take part in athletics he began spartan women take part in all the games the girl said my tutor tells me so her eyes flicked to the big man reclining under the colonnade when hes sober her brother added he picked up a strigil and began to scrape the sand off his backside and he says women run at nemea you competed at nemea did you not theron theron looked from one to another and a slow smile caught at the corners of his mouth but while the boy was watching the smile he reached out one hand at the end of a giant arm and grabbed the boy rotated him and tripped him over an extended foot pinning him in the sand in the palaestra i am master he said your sister should not be here when she returns from making her treaty i will speak to your lady mother about the womens events i would be happy to teach a child with such long limbs to run but not pankration pankration is for men it is for killing the girl nodded it was clear from her posture that she was nodding from courtesy not in agreement my mother has killed fifty men the girl said you she nodded before he could answer ill expect a daily lesson from you then she said to the recumbent form of her twin brother it will be good for you to teach me youll have every lesson twice master may i get up now the boy asked theron leaped to his feet and again extended his arm of course he turned his back on the girl and confronted his new pupil does your sister watch you train he asked the boy laughed she trains with me he said master theron shook his head not until i have spoken to your lady mother young mistress please leave the palaestra the girl nodded again a slow gesture that was identical to her brothers nod we will speak of this again she said she rose to her feet with muscled grace showing none of the coltishness of her age and walked out of the arches heading to the baths she paused at the archway you should call us by our names she said that is the policy of my mother and it is a good one i am not the mistress here any more than you are master i am melitta my brother there is satyrus we are the children of kineas of athens and the lady srayanka our family fought at marathon against the medes and on the sea of grass against darius my father was descended from herakles and my mother from artemis she bowed her head the only mistress here is my mother and she has no master theron didnt know many twelveyearold girls in corinth who could stare him down she hadnt blinked since she had begun to talk i understand that your father is dead he said the girl melitta gave him a long look we will speak of this again she said and went into the baths theron turned back to his proper charge satyrus i said three falls he said he glanced over his shoulder as if to make sure that the girl was gone was that one fall or two the boy asked there was no wickedness to his question he meant it just as he asked it master he added a little late have to watch that if i want to keep him satyrus thought to himself theron swung his arms that was one fall he said are you ready the boy took up his stance he was confident in his postures his tutor knew the pankration well enough to teach a boy theron stood without moving and satyrus held his stance for as long as it took him to draw twenty breaths and release them slowly he held it well his hands high weight well distributed left foot forward and ready to kick theron began to circle and satyrus circled with him carefully keeping his distance he had misjudged therons immense reach the last time now he was careful theron lunged in moving from his left foot to his right and reaching with his arms the boy blocked one of his reaching arms and kicked hard at his knee but theron moved a fraction and took the kick on the side of his leg he grunted good kick he said as he backed away satyrus flashed a grin and moved in to attack spun on his front foot and kicked again theron grabbed for the leg he had expected another kick and grasped air the second kick was a feint satyrus whipped the kicking foot around spinning his centre of gravity he closed grabbing therons extended hand with both of his own and throwing his weight to rotate the arm therons other arm shot out and grappled the boys shoulders pulling at him grasping for a hold to turn the boys body and take the weight off his arm satyrus was too small to resist that grapple long desperate he bit the older mans left bicep drawing blood theron shouted and punched him in the head and satyruss whole body moved with the strength of the blow but he set his jaw and tried to hold his grip on the sweatslick muscles of his opponents arm pressed almost ear to chest he could hear therons heartbeat racing as he sank to one knee under the pressure of the boys attack on his shoulder joint therons second blow to his head broke his hold and satyrus fell bonelessly to the sand it wasnt that he decided to relinquish his hold the strength just flowed away from his limbs he wondered if he was going to die as men did in the iliad when the strength left their limbs his vision tunnelled and the palaestra began to go away but he could still hear he heard the big corinthian get to his feet his hands brushing away the sand he heard the sound of someone clapping good thing that you won came the voice of his tutor he sounded drunk and sarcastic embarrassing to lose to a new pupil knocking him unconscious will probably teach him a lesson too the new coach sounded upset when he replied i never meant to hit him so hard he said apollo im bleeding like a sacrifice he shifted his weight satyrus could hear everything he could hear the sound of the man breathing i regret that he said the tutor rose unsteadily his feet scraping loose sand on the marble floor as he stumbled every grain giving its own sound to satyruss ears then he crossed the sand satyrus heard the uneven sound of his footsteps even on the sand heard him fetch a canteen from the far wall and felt the cold water hit his face as he sprinkled the contents liberally satyrus felt his eyelids flutter of their own volition and light came to his eyes like a bolt of pain ugh satyrus said he tried to sit up and after a few heartbeats he managed the trick only to fall on all fours and vomit up his barley porridge he still had some of therons blood on his mouth theron knelt at his side can you understand me he asked yes satyrus replied master theron nodded you scared me he said he shrugged i applaud you that any boy could scare me like that is in itself a kind of victory i will take you seriously now promise me that you will not bite or gouge in a contest it is against the rules not in sparta said the tutor he wiped the boys mouth with his chiton theron sat back on his heels his puzzlement plain on his face it was clear from his expression that he couldnt decide if the tutor was a peer or a slave he had a paunch and his hair was thinning on top and he was clearly drunk functional the way many harddrinking slaves went through life but drunk nonetheless the room was spinning around satyrus and he was in no mood to help the new man besides if he couldnt see that the pins of his tutors chiton were gold he was a fool the drunkard leaned forward you going to live boy he asked the smell of sour wine washed over satyrus and he retched again when he was done he extended a hand to his tutor yes master satyrus replied he had no trouble calling the drunkard master but theron had obviously not risen to be a champion by underestimating his opponents you are a spartan he said to the tutor the other man nodded i was a spartan he said now i am a gentleman of tanais the spartans wit dripped with selfmockery theron of corinth the athlete said extending his hand philokles the other man said accepting therons hand theron made a face suggesting that the spartan had quite a grip for a drunk the two big men watched each other for a few heartbeats theron grinned philokles smiled slightly can i get up now the boy asked he rubbed his temple everything is moving around he said theron pressed with his thumb at the impact point his heart pounding and he showed his relief with a sigh when he found nothing moving under the pressure while the boy tried to hold his head still against the pain no more fighting today he said and no afternoon nap sleeping after a heavy blow is dangerous philokles nodded at the corinthian youve read the hermetics theron nodded he raised an eyebrow at the tutor whose smile broadened i feel better the boy said lies but the lies of virtue lets have a third fall no theron said lets go fishing philokles said a pleasant way to spend a spring day aesop would approve and xenophon wrote a book on it the spartan rose to his feet ill find some lines and some wine meet me at the stables before the sun is at the zenith he bowed satyrus returned the bow a little unsteady he went across the sand under his own power and headed for the baths do you fish he heard philokles say his ears were ringing and it was all he could do to walk without putting his hands on the columns for support but he had done other things as hard my father was a fisherman theron said ill take that to mean no he heard philokles say and then he was safe within the steamy warmth of the archway the town of tanais was the same age as the twins the newest town on the euxine sea far up the bay of salmon the new settlements spread up the north bank for almost a parasang with greek farms interspersed with the heavy stone buildings of the maeotae farmers native to the valley where the wheat grew like a carpet of gold much of the mouth of the river was covered in small wooden wharves and hurdles for drying fish the famous produce of the bay of salmon the foundation of the fish sauce that every athenian gourmand craved between the salmon and the wheat the town was already rich the town itself was a small affair centred on a temple to nike and the accompanying baths and palaestra of a much grander town built in wood on stone foundations and decorated in the latest fashion the ivory and gilt statue of the goddess was the dedication of two of the towns most prominent founders diodorus a soldier of fortune currently far to the south in service to eumenes the cardian and leon the numidian one of the euxines principal merchants their names appeared on the founding stones of the temple and the palaestra on the stone stele to the dead of the town and on the marble plinth at the corner of the new law court leon owned the warehouses at the edge of the water and the stone wharves and his contributions had dredged the harbour and raised the breakwater that had turned a chain of tiny islands into an impregnable defence against the euxines occasional winter storms the lady srayanka the mother of the twins was not a greek woman her name appeared on no dedications no founding stone had her initials and none of her weapons were dedicated at the altar of nike but her hand was visible all along the river as ruler queen some said of all the eastern assagatje it was her word that kept the settlement free from the predations of the tribes of the sea of grass and her warriors that made the town independent of the labyrinthine politics of the nascent kingdom of the bosporus to the west in her name the sindi and the maeotae farmers lived in safety along the river valley her horsemen and the hippeis of the town kept the bandits away from the high ground between the tanais and the distant rha so that merchants like leon could bring their precious cargoes from the hyrkanian sea far to the east and farther from seres itself and qin satyrus was her son and melitta her daughter they walked through their town hand in hand to the stables built in their fathers name in the hippodrome where their fathers friend coenus still drilled the remainder of the men who had followed their father east in his fabled war with alexander most of them were away in the south with diodorus on campaign as mercenaries hows your head now melitta asked satyrus blinked for some reason he said slowly its worse in the sun they entered the hippodrome a building that was new and wellbuilt and out of all proportion to the number of cavalrymen that the town actually supported satyrus gritted his teeth against the ache in his head as they crossed the sand and squeezed his sisters hand until she grunted in pain sorry he said they passed the line of columns at the edge of the stables wooden columns but carefully painted to look like marble and the smell of horses enveloped them pelton an old freed slave of leons greeted them the gods prosper you twins he said master philokles took a mule that new feller too big for a mule he took a horse twins was something like a title in tanais melitta nodded ill take bion she said bion was a sakje charger bigger than a greek pony like a warhorse scaled for a tall girl she called the beast bion because the gelding was her life happy or sad angry or elated she dealt with the rigours of life by riding twice now she had gone with her mother to the summer pasture of the assagatje riding with the maidens while her brother learned philosophy and law in faraway athens her horse was her answer to most things satyrus walked down the line of stalls until he reached the end where his fathers charger cropped barley straw with the contentment of a retired warhorse care to go for a ride he asked the giant thalassa was a mare but a mare of heroic proportions she raised her head and nuzzled him for a treat until he produced a carrot then she chewed the delicacy with a finicky patience tossing her head you want to go he asked again i think the answer is yes the former slave laughed when has the answer ever been no eh tell me that he stepped in and put a bridle on the old mare in a single motion his lower hand putting the bit into her mouth without so much as a jingle of the bronze against her teeth melitta put her palms flat on her horses back and sprang on to her in one go pelton do you ever wonder why you were a slave she asked pelton looked at her for the time it took an insect to cross a leaf nope he said will of the gods mostly i expect he plucked a piece of grass and put it in his mouth could happen to anyone couldnt it sister satyrus didnt always appreciate his sisters approach to the world a blunt approach to say the least she looked down at him from her horse well leon owned him and leon was a slave so leon should know better better than what satyrus asked he liked to think that he was already a man a man who understood things one of the things he understood was that you didnt tease slaves about their slavery better than to own people she said satyrus rolled his eyes he led thalassa out of the stable her heavy hooves ringing on the cobblestone floor and sending pings of echo off the whitewashed walls to penetrate his brain and increase his headache he led her around to the mounting step and climbed on to her sitting well back as a boy can on a big horse he adjusted his gorytos and then leaned over to his sister he could see philokles down by the gate arguing with theron its not nice to talk to slaves about slavery why not melitta asked pelton was a slave who else would i ask you satyrus made the sound that brothers make all over the world and tapped thalassas sides with his bare heels and the mare surged into motion satyrus could feel her power even at the age of seventeen she was a big animal with power and spirit the veteran of a dozen battles when he was on her back he could imagine that he was his father at the jaxartes river about to crush alexander pelton emerged from the stable with a scruffy straw hat clutched in his fist thisll help male twin satyrus wheeled the mare in a neat curve and snatched the hat and pulled it on the shade of the broad brim was like a healing balm all the gods bless you pelton satyrus said and you twins the former slave called my sister means no harm satyrus said pelton smiled hope she never has to find out for herself he said before he went back into the stables theron and philokles were arguing about the nature of the soul as satyrus and melitta passed the bronze equestrian statue of their father that stood at the edge of the agora his hand raised pointing east as if he had just ridden from the hippodrome there was another statue to him in olbia where he already had semidivine status as a hero who had overthrown the tyrant and the sakje still sacrificed horses to him at the kurgan on the coast in athens on the other hand many men spoke ill of their father and a year ago satyrus had attended the legal proceedings that had finally revoked his fathers conviction for treason making satyrus a citizen and returning his grandfathers fortune which had only served to prove what every twelveyearold knows by heart the world is far more complicated than it appeared when you were ten surely plato argues the point convincingly theron began as if hed already made this argument and was still awaiting some acknowledgement philokles had a leather bag over his shoulder he tapped his mule into motion theron was mounted on a tall horse one of the towns cavalry chargers and he towered over the spartan but he had to thump the horses sides to get him into motion in a few surges of the chargers hindquarters it was clear that the corinthian wasnt much of a rider melitta was looking at the eastern horizon as if following her dead fathers hand the town sat on a bluff and she could see a parasang thirty full stades or more in the early afternoon sun is that smoke she asked philokles looked under his hand and so did satyrus i expect theyre clearing new fields satyrus said he regretted his tone almost at once hectoring his sister with a display of knowledge when he didnt actually know what he was talking about i must outgrow that he thought she glanced at him and gave him half a smile as if she could hear every word of his interior dialogue leons still away she said indicating the empty wharves as they rode through the gates leon the numidian is our richest citizen philokles said to theron who was more interested in mastering his horse than in the towns social life married to a barbarian wonderful horseman a wellrounded man for all that he started life as a slave even in corinth ive heard of your leon theron said whoa it will do you no good to lose your temper at a horse melitta said she laid a hand on therons bridle and stroked his geldings neck and the horse calmed thats quite a squadron for this time of year she said pointing out to sea satyrus looked at first he saw nothing but after a moment he could see a line of sails just nicking the edge of the world three or four hours out in the bay triremes he said because the sails were matching sizes closer in a pentekonter raced for the beach under full oars is that mamas boat satyrus asked he was relieved to see it early for our mother melitta said but she smiled they both wanted her home theron glanced at her and looked away changing weight and sitting too far back on his horse the horse sensed his inattention and decided to be rid of him he halfreared and then shot forward and theron landed on the road like a sack of barley the gelding raced away oof he said then he lay still satyrus put a hand on his borrowed straw hat and leaned forward the change of his weight enough to push thalassa into a gallop and he raced across a field of new emmer wheat that rolled away to the east broken only by boundary walls and the line of the road he caught the gelding easily turned thalassa under the offending horses nose and caught his dangling reins come on hermes he said hermes was a gelding who missed his prick and tended to take it out on his riders satyrus stood up on thalassas back and jumped on to the gelding pulled the reins and began speaking a litany of nonsense to him the gelding turned and trotted back to the group and thalassa followed along riderless but obedient when he was within range of her voice melitta called out can you handle him just to annoy her brother who responded by prodding the gelding to a gallop and racing through the middle of them scattering dust and almost riding his new coach down sorry he said by way of apology he handed the corinthian the reins to his fathers warhorse master theron this is the smartest horse who ever lived shes the mother of half the cavalry horses on this side of the euxine and shes still the toughest thing on four legs just dont sit so far back on her rump the athlete made a poor showing of mounting the tall horse without a step but he got up on his fourth try melitta didnt hide her laughter theron glared at her and then at philokles is this the order you maintain master tutor he asked satyrus caught his sisters eye and they rode a little apart close enough to listen far enough to give the appearance of privacy if you mean platos views of the soul as he rather meanspiritedly i might add puts them in the mouth of socrates id say that theyre interesting but scarcely irrefutable philokles said you dislike plato theron asked i dislike a sophist whose underlying theme is that hes smarter than his audience name me one dialogue where plato is bested by a student philokles wasnt looking at theron but at satyrus who shook his head and smiled because no such dialogue existed theron shrugged i doubt such a thing happened he said philokles laughed their father studied with plato until he died im afraid that his tales of his former teacher have left an indelible impression the spartan smiled i prefer simonides or heraklitus that posturer he only worked for money theron sounded outraged satyrus and melitta grinned at each other because philokles said that their father had said that plato was a pompous ass which was an image so droll as to evoke giggles even here theron looked at the children theyre both quite intelligent he said it didnt sound like a question philokles nodded is breeding people any different from breeding horses he asked their sire was a brilliant soldier and an educated man a decent athlete as well third or fourth in the hundredandninth olympiad really theron asked what event boxing the spartan replied boys boxing he never competed as a man why not theron asked any boy who could make the top tier would have been a frontrunner as a man war philokles said we had quite a bit of it back then no shortage now theron said at any rate the mothers no different youll see when shes back from pantecapaeum shes not the beauty she used to be but shes a firstrate tactician she gives a fine speech for a barbarian and shes a brilliant athlete philokles looked out over the fields and smiled to himself shes a runner theron asked running was virtually the only sport open to greek women philokles smile became a grin shes an archer a mounted archer perhaps the finest on the sea of grass and a pretty fair swordswoman theron nodded i see hence the daughter he glanced at melitta satyrus watched his eyes the spartan nodded just so he said it took them an hour to ride to the fishing spot a small bluff at a curve in the tanais where rushing water from the spring of niobe a local nymph tumbled down the hillside to swell the river the spring water ran all year clear and cold and small trout congregated in the deep pools just above the confluence the twins dismounted immediately tethered their horses amidst the lush grass hung their bows on their saddlecloths and went upstream bronze knives in hand to cut rods when they were satisfied with what they had they came back philokles was laying the horsehair lines out in the goatcropped grass at the edge of the stream then the spartan deftly attached bronze hooks decorated with red thread and hackles the colour of a bay horse ive never seen anyone fish like this theron said come melitta said taking his hand he seemed shy of the contact but he went with her willingly dont scare the fish she said in a whisper and went down on all fours to crawl up the big rock that separated them from the stream she was up the rock in a moment just her head showing to the fish she raised an arm carefully and when the corinthian was in place beside her she pointed see the trout she asked theron watched for the time it would take him to fight a bout following her pointing finger breathing carefully i see it he said she was conscious of the warmth of a grown man next to her on the rock something to be aware of she thought watch she said different from lying next to my brother time passed she was conscious that he must be bored annoyed at the passing insects for failing at their duties but at last a fly slowly came down one of the big brown flies that the fish loved it trailed across the water its abdomen brushing the surface from time to time melitta assumed that it was laying eggs eggs so tiny she couldnt see them although she had watched this dance many times her brother crawled up the rock on her left side any luck oh he exclaimed as one of the pools residents powered up from the dark at the bottom of the pool and took the big insect right off the surface of the water and rolled away in a redorange flash leaving a growing circle of ripples in its wake melitta grinned in delight slipping back down the rock and clapping her hands see she asked or rather demanded therons grin was lopsided and far friendlier than either of the children had seen from him yet i do see this isnt fishing with nets it is fishing with insects not real insects satyrus said for some reason even if you catch them the fish wont take them but if you tie some feathers to a hook he pointed at the rods of young cornel that philokles had rigged the dogwood sticks were the height of a grown man and the horsehair lines were the same length and if you dabble the bug on the surface like the real ones melitta added then sometimes bang you get a big fish they strike like a bolt from zeus satyrus took one of the rods eagerly melitta grabbed another and untied her sandals im going upstream she said philokles nodded ill go with the young lady he followed her he seemed sober now and satyrus thought that his tutor was as happy as hed ever seen him perhaps he needed company adult company the thought saddened the boy a little he wanted to be adult company but he loved the big spartan drink and all and if theron of corinth made him happy so be it satyrus went back to the rock pondering the corinthian and his odd reactions to his sister he moved carefully up the rock brought his dogwood rod level with his shoulders and flipped the hook over his head the feathered hook sank through the still air and landed lightly on the water the feather of the hackle resting on the surface tension after a heartbeat satyrus gave the gentlest of tugs and the bug skittered across the surface he took a breath and repeated the motion nothing he sighed softly and popped the fly back off the water and over his shoulder the hook arcing through the air and tiny drops of water brushing his skin using just his wrist he flicked the hook back on to the water took a breath and skipped the fly the movement of the fish was so fast that only long afternoons spent at this pastime enabled the boy to pull the hook just right and he had a fish the length of his arm pulling at the end of his rod he raised the rod and dropped the fish on the cropped grass behind the rock will you take it off he asked theron who wasnt fishing but just watching the big man knelt in the grass and took the hook from the fishs mouth he bashed the fish on a rock then pulled out a bronze knife and gutted the fish in two strokes youve done this before satyrus said accusingly theron smiled ive never seen anyone use a fly like that he said but my father had a fishing boat cleaning fish is the same everywhere id wager satyrus held out his rod want to try he asked theron rinsed his hands in a side pool and reached out for the rod id love to why dont you like my sister satyrus asked as the corinthian flicked his hook on to the water i dont dislike your sister the man answered do you know that in hellas women do not go fishing with their brothers satyrus could see a rider across the stream he was a couple of stades away and he was moving so fast that he raised dust ive been to athens satyrus said proudly the girls all had to stay at home exactly theron said i thought it was stupid satyrus added i think thats coenus he said sliding back off the rock whos coenus theron asked politely a fish chose that moment to hit his lure and despite his inexperience he jerked the rod and he hooked his prey a trout at least as long as his forearm well done satyrus exclaimed with all the enthusiasm of his age he reached out and unhooked the trout a big male with a heavy jaw and some fat on his backbone the big fish had swallowed the hook and satyrus pulled carefully at the horsehair line trying to retrieve the hook fish hooks were precious hes riding hard theron said satyrus got bloody fingers on the shaft of the hook and pulled and the hook ripped free of the cartilage and the big fish spasmed and vomited blood satyrus reversed his bronze knife and killed the fish with a practised blow then he laid it on the grass and gutted it coenus was one of my fathers companions he said as he worked hes quite old older than you he married a persian and keeps the temple of artemis down the valley hes a great hunter his son is at school in athens the boy smiled xeno is my best friend besides my sister i mean i wish he was here more soberly coenus says that a tutor is no substitute for athens hes riding fast theron said still perched on the fishing rock satyrus raised his head as he dropped the two fish into the net bag he wore he is he said will you excuse me there are other riders behind him theron said rising to his feet something in the posture of the riders disturbed him get the horses satyrus said im going down to the road get the horses and the others theron hesitated and satyrus looked back move he said coenus is bleeding something is wrong the corinthian chose to obey he jogged off up the trail along the stream s atyrus ran downstream until he came to where the big oak trees overhung the road he climbed down into the road he could hear the rhythm of coenuss gallop he stood in the middle of the road coenus he shouted if philokles and theron were big men coenus was bigger and middle age had not diminished his size a life of constant exercise kept him fit he was clutching his left side and blood flowed freely down his belly what are you doing here boy he croaked by the light of my goddesss eyes he was holding his horse with his knees despite the wound in his side satyrus had his knife on a cord over his shoulder he pulled it over his head opened the brooch that held the shoulder of his chiton and stepped out of the garment bandage your side he said tossing him the garment what happened were attacked coenus said he turned his head at the sound of hoof beats theyre well behind you satyrus said he was suddenly afraid attacked sauromatae coenus said he used satyruss chiton as a pad to staunch the blood and satyrus stood on tiptoes to help him tie it as tightly as possible satyrus found that his hands were trembling and his senses heightened so that he could hear his sister calling out and philokles answering quick boy coenus said who is with you philokles my sister and theron he answered the new athletics coach coenus looked over his shoulder the rise of the bluff on their left blocked any sight of his pursuers we have to get to town he said he grabbed satyruss hand thanks boy he said gruffly satyrus grinned despite his nerves the hoof beats were getting closer ares and aphrodite coenus muttered theyre on us he turned his horse and drew his sword onehanded a crookbladed kopis two men on ponies cantered around the bend in the road they were barbarians and their horses were painted red one raised a bow and shot despite the range his arrow fell short they pressed their horses into a gallop and both loosed arrows together satyrus ran off the road into the trees he was unarmed and nothing but a target and he was scared coenus sat still in the middle of the road he looked tired and angry he glanced once at satyrus and then put his knees to his horse and she responded with a leap into a canter the next two arrows flew over his head behind the screen of trees satyrus could see his sister on bion the sakje horse flying along the broken ground at the edge of the water and then leaping the stream like a deer philokles emerged from the cover of the oaks with their horses in his fist satyrus he called satyrus ran out on to the road and sprinted for his tutor coenuss horse took an arrow and gave a shrill cry and then plunged into one of his attackers and coenuss arm went up in the classic overarm cut and came down like an axe cutting wood and the unarmoured man was literally cut from the saddle the blade ripping from the curve of his neck all the way into his breast but the blow was too strong and the horses were moving too fast and coenus lost his blade he tried to turn his horse but the mare was spent from a long gallop and wounded and she didnt want to turn coenuss other assailant had troubles of his own as hed kept his bow to hand too long and had dropped an arrow in the road he froze in indecision as coenus flashed past him and he never saw the arrow that took him in the belly satyrus ignored philokles and vaulted on to thalassas back his tutor was screaming at him to run he ignored the spartan and turned his horse down the road to where coenuss horse was in the process of collapse exhaustion and wounds having done her in his sisters arrow had saved coenus and the sauromatae warrior sat his horse in the middle of the road both hands wrapped around the shaft of the arrow screaming in agony and yet still mounted more sauromatae came around the curve at the far end of the valley drawn by the screams satyrus run philokles shouted again satyrus had a secure seat thalassa moved under him and he reached down and secured his gorytos and tied the girdle around his waist as he rode he tried to ignore the shaking of his hands he couldnt hear anything but the beat of his horses hooves like the thudding of his heart and he had a lump of bronze at the base of his throat he was afraid melitta was not afraid she was on the road fitting an arrow to her bow she shot and the men on the road moved most of them pushing their horses to the verge or even in among the trees satyrus didnt draw his bow instead he used his knees to line thalassa up with coenus who was kneeling in the road coenus he yelled his voice was shrill but it carried and his fathers friend looked up then his face changed as if he was making a hard decision and he stood up clutching his side melitta shot again she had a light bow and now that the surprise of her having a bow at all was lost the sauromatae were shooting back strong men with mens bows she backed her horse down the road she shot again arching her back as she shot to get the most from her bow satyrus reached down and held an arm out to coenus the pain showed like a scar on the big mans face and his lips were more white than red and it was close no matter how heroic a twelveyearold cannot haul a warrior on to the back of a charger but coenus found the strength from somewhere and got a leg over almost tumbling his saviour on to the road and then thalassa sensed some change of weight and she was turning moving away philokles was up on hermes with the coach behind him as soon as he saw his students in retreat he turned his own horse and pressed him to a gallop and they were away down the road the five of them galloped back along the river road for two stades without slowing until bion picked up a stone in his hoof and melitta had to pick it clear as the men watched the road behind them thalassa never flagged nor did her head go down at the halt instead she looked around as if aware that fighting was next then she raised her head higher straining at the reins and gave a cry satyrus had a pounding head and the weight of a grown man who was in pain on his back and thalassas fidgets were nothing but increased complication until he realized what she was seeing by the father of the gods he said pointing coenus slumped in agony raised his head oh gods he said and his head went down again philokles held up a hand hoof beats he said melitta vaulted on to bions back she had her bow in her hand in a moment there was a column of smoke rising to the west from the town melitta watched it the way a child watches the death of a loved one unable to take her eyes away satyrus felt the strength of the fight the daimon some men called it leave his limbs and he felt as weak as he had when theron hit him in the palaestra perhaps it is just a house fire he said but he didnt believe his own words melittas voice broke as she spoke but no tears came raiders she said the ships i saw philokles didnt sound drunk when he spoke we must get across the river he said there were sauromatae riders coming around the last bend they were approaching carefully this time and there were a dozen of them we should take refuge in the shrine melitta said philokles was watching the riders this this was planned he shook his head there will be no refuge in temples children all these men have come to kill you satyrus sucked in a breath melitta sat straighter well she said and her eyes were bright with unshed tears we will have to give them a surprise then satyrus wished that hed said such a thing thats the spirit philokles said he got down from his horse and stood barehanded on the ground can you children shoot one of the riders as close to me as possible i need a spear theron looked around at them what are you doing he asked the riders were nocking arrows walk away philokles said to theron who remained on the horse they had shared leave us and live theron shook his head you three are going to fight all those horsemen he grinned he looked from one to another his grin growing and he slid from his horse im in satyrus had to smile at the athletes declaration he drew his own bow and struggled to string it with the weight of coenus hanging on his back theron reached up and took the wounded man he set him gently on the ground philokles went down on both knees in the road picked up a handful of dust and rubbed it in his hair he raised his arms furies he cried those who guard the most sacred of oaths i must break my vow theron looked at satyrus what vow he asked melitta was watching the horsemen mother says he vowed never to draw the blood of another man she said watch out satyrus got his bow strung and fitted an arrow as the first dozen came from their foes there were too many arrows to avoid and his heart almost stopped in terror as the flight came in time stretched as the arrows fell and then they were past none of the arrows hit a target now he was down low on thalassas neck and melitta was with him the two horses kicking up dust as they sped right at the sauromatae and again he could hear nothing but thalassas hoof beats this was a sport the children knew although they had never played it for real they left their tutor kneeling in the road looking like a fool or a mime in a play the sauromatae were not good archers they had slim bows of wood and not the recurved bows backed in sinew and horn that the sakje used and they relied too much on their spears and armour up close or so satyruss mother said all her comments floated through his brain as thalassas hooves pounded along the grass at the verge of the road a slow rhythm that marked out what might be the last moments of his life melitta the better archer of the twins loosed her first arrow and turned away guiding bion with her knees as the big gelding curved away to the right satyrus held his course until he saw the sauromatae raise their bows and then he loosed a clumsy shot wrecked by speed and fear so that the arrow went high and was lost but he was close enough that his shot had the same effect on some of the sauromatae not all though thalassa lost the flow of her gallop as he turned her and the rhythm of her run changed when he looked back she had an arrow in her rump he turned her back head on to their enemies and now suddenly close he had an arrow on the string the horn nock sliding home between his fingers fear a few yards behind him but catching up they were big men and the closest one had a ferocious grin he had dropped his bow in favour of a long spear artemis the boy shouted more a shriek of fear than a war cry and loosed he couldnt breathe almost couldnt keep his knees tight on thalassas broad back he was so afraid his arrow knew no fear the man with the grin took the arrow in the middle of his torso right through his rawhide armour he went down over his horses rump and satyrus could breathe he leaned hard to the left and thalassa was still there for him skimming the ground in great strides and yet managing to turn away from the barbarians the man hed hit screamed soundlessly his mouth round and red and his rotting teeth black and all satyrus could hear were hoof beats satyrus reached across his body for an arrow half drew one and dropped it he felt for another one more he thought ill shoot one more and that will be enough he got the fletching of another arrow in his fingers and pulled the arrow clear he leaned back got the arrow on the bow and the nock on the string and put his chargers head back at the enemy another one was down and a third man was clutching an arrow in his bicep and screaming rage and fear and pain all together as a pair of children flayed his raiding party but the flow of the fight had carried the sauromatae up the road almost to where coenus lay in the grass and philokles knelt the sauromatae ignored them thalassa missed another stride and almost went down she slowed sharply im dead satyrus thought he rose on his knees and shot the way ataelus the sakje taught from the top of his mounts rhythm his arrow went deep into the gut of a young sauromatae he drew another arrow as they turned towards him he had started on a better horse but she was tired and old and had carried a heavy burden for several stades and despite her heart she couldnt keep the pace for ever lita shot again they were ignoring her and she shot the horse of a man near coenus so that the man was thrown right over his horses head he rolled once in the road and tried to get up satyrus shot at a man in red with a golden helmet and the arrow glanced off the mans scale cuirass of bronze philokles rose from his knees he stepped up to the man who had just been thrown by his wounded horse philokles killed him with a vicious kick to the neck the mans spine snapped and the sound carried across the vale then philokles bent and picked up the mans long spear the action on the road and the snap of their comrades spine drew attention away from satyrus the second of hesitation saved his life and thalassa powered through a gap in the circle closing around him and he shot one man from so close that he could see every detail of the shock of pain that hit him could see the spray of sweat from the mans hair as his head whipped around and the burgeoning fountain of blood emerging from the mans throat where the arrow had gone in tyche the best shot of his life he turned thalassa again ready for her heart to give out in the next stride but while she was moving he was alive he made for the road because the flow of the battle had left it the emptiest part of the battlefield melitta shot again and missed but he watched them dart away from the point of her aim gaining him another few strides thalassa crossed the road close to philokles dust and sweat streaked the spartans face like an actors mask of tragedy satyrus twisted in his seat and shot straight back and missed the man behind him even though the range was just a few horselengths but in his peripheral vision he saw the man duck and then saw philokles rip him from his horse with a spear point through the face gaffing his jaw the way maeotae farmers took the big salmon philokles kill broke the sauromatae it was not just that they were taking heavy casualties it was the manner in which philokles victim died his head almost ripped from his body the other sauromatae flinched away abandoning their wounded and galloped off down the road in heartbeats the drone of the spring insects and the calls of a raven were the only sounds to be heard over the panting of men and beasts and the murmuring of a wounded sauromatae boy with an arrow in his guts calling for his mother satyrus thought that it would have been nice not to understand his thick sakje it might have been nice to think that the boy just a few summers older than lita might live but no one lived with an arrow in the guts i did that he thought we have to get across the river philokles said as if nothing had happened please motherohpleaseohhhhh said the boy in the tall grass it wasnt a boy satyrus was close enough to know that his target was a maiden archer one of their young women please ohmotherohhh she said satyrus looked away afraid of what the girl in the grass meant about life and death afraid of himself thalassa trembled between his thighs he raised his eyes and met philokles look please the girl begged war is glorious philokles said do you want me to kill her another death will hardly add to the stain on my soul his voice was without tone the voice of a god or a madman satyrus looked at his sister she was retching in the grass her head down bion was wrinkling his lips in equine distaste theyre forming up for another try theron observed he was looting the downed sauromatae he had a sword a backcurved greek kopis satyrus drew an arrow from his quiver and rode over to the girl she was rocking back and forth arms crossed over the blood her face was white and her hair was full of sweat and dust she had some gold plaques on her clothes somebodys daughter this close she didnt look any older than he was take her quickly huntress he thought he was curiously far away watching himself prepare to kill a helpless girl his own age and his hands didnt tremble much the range was close he shot her he meant the arrow to go into her brain but the shaking of his hands or the flexing of the shaft put it in her mouth she shuddered and made a choking sound and then vomited blood like the fish like the fish her whole body spasmed again and then she lay still he watched her soul leave her body watched her eyes become the eyes of a corpse it was like being hit in the head by theron he couldnt see much he sat on his horse and he heard the sauromatae charge and he heard his name called but he couldnt control his limbs so he sat and watched the dead girl time was an odd thing because this time yesterday she had been alive but she would never be alive again philokles shouted his name lita shouted his name and then there was just the grass in the breeze and the sound of the insects and the ravens calling you with us boy philokles asked he poured a mouthful of wine into his mouth satyrus spluttered and shook and swallowed some the wine the wrong way they were still in the fields by the road and satyrus was lying on the ground his head hurt but he didnt have a wound on him what happened therons face appeared you killed the girl then you fainted therons sword arm was red to the elbow for the second time that day satyrus tried to get to his feet and threw up instead he lay back and theron gave him another mouthful of philokles wine while the spartan collected horses and gear with melitta can you ride he asked when he came back im sorry satyrus said he was deeply ashamed never mind sorry boy can you ride philokles held his shoulders satyrus nodded and sat up slowly thalassa was bareback now the arrow was gone from her rump we have a lot of horses now philokles said ares satyrus said you killed them all no philokles said everyone helped theron grinned and then put his smile away as no one else seemed to think that winning the fight was something to be happy about therell be more almost immediately we have to get across the river philokles said all these people theyre upazans people the man in the gold helmet had his badge the antlers he shook his head clearly leaving some thought unspoken get mounted satyrus had never heard philokles sound like this he knew that it was because he had shown fear had fainted he got on to a dead mans horse and hung his head hot tears burning in his eyes im sorry he said im sorry too boy philokles said well have to swim the river thalassa probably wont make it coenus gave a groan he was tied roughly to a sauromatae pony and the red war paint was staining his chiton leave me he said fuck that you big megaran snob philokles said he put a gentle hand on coenuss shoulder they were all mounted and philokles led them straight across the fields to the point at the edge of the water they could see all the way up the bluff to the town flames licked from above the wall and there was fire in the gate like the mouth of a giant forge there were men in armour up the hill several stades away more horsemen were coming now or never philokles said theron can you swim theron laughed and rode his steed recklessly into the river which was four stades wide at its narrowest point it was spring and the current raced by them as they were on the outward edge of the curve beneath the town where the river ran fastest satyrus might have hesitated more afraid now of showing fear than of being afraid but his horse followed its herdleader and leaped into the muddy water the animal bearing coenus went in next and in the time it took an eagle to catch a salmon they were a line of heads swimming for their lives melitta swam like a nereid and bion though tired kicked along beneath her but coenus struggled just to keep his head above water and his horse wasnt much better without really thinking about the risks satyrus released his horse to make its own way and swam across the flow to coenus but he mistook the current spun around and got kicked in the gut in a heartbeat he was under the muddy brown water sinking away from the noise still exhaling he got a fist tangled in something hair and suddenly his whole body jerked as he was towed forward his eyes saw light and he pulled harder and his head came out of the water and he breathed ahhh and he was moving fast his right hand wrapped in thalassas mane her head was up and despite her wounds and his weight she was powering through the water he breathed again choked and sprayed water and snot from his nose thalassa was turning ignoring his struggles as she swam closer to coenus coenus was coughing his face out of the water but his horse sinking away under him there were arrows falling from the sky it took satyrus a few heartbeats to realize that they were being shot at from the bank he could hear a man shouting in the sauromatae dialect for volunteers to go into the water and finish them off he didnt turn his head to look his whole concentration was on coenus he was close closer he reached out a hand and tried to pull the man up but he was twelve and coenus was the biggest man he knew then philokles was up with him and theron swimming alone without a horse and they cut coenus free before he drowned himself and his horse theron pushed the megarans head and shoulders into satyruss arms and he pulled hard eliciting a low scream of pain from the big man and then they were swimming satyrus looked up and found that they were halfway across but the current had moved them and they were no longer at the narrows he set his shoulders and concentrated on keeping coenus alive time passed slowly his shoulder hurt and every other moment he thought that the dying man might drag him into the water he was afraid for thalassa who made harsh noises though her mouth and nostrils coughs and hacks almost as if the horse was attempting to curse there were leaves and logs in the river deadwood floated away by the spring rains in the high ground to the east and once a dead sheep bloated and stinking passed them as they swam on the point was so far behind them that even from his perpsective just above the surface satyrus could see the bay of salmon widening away they were almost as far from the other shore as they had been when they slipped into the water even with the powerful aide of the horse swimming beneath him even with his arms wrapped around her neck satyrus was tired coenus was a dead weight satyrus thought that the mans cold body still had life in it and he passed several minutes trying to find a sign of breath he wasnt sure when he looked up the stone farmhouse that marked the end of the maeotae territory was in sight he looked around for melitta and she was right there at his side holding on to bion with one hand and pushing against coenus with the other swimming strongly but with lines on her face like an adult their eyes met she gave a push probably all she had strength for and coenus went a fingerbreadth higher on thalassas proud back poseidon lord of horses satyrus said she swam more strongly and satyrus tried to sing the hymn and melitta joined in two thin voices singing whole words left out as the singers struggled to breathe but thalassa seemed to relish it and her ears went up and she moved faster the stone house on the shore was closer i think hes dead lita panted satyrus thought of the dead girl he shook his head thalassas legs kicked hard they were half a stade from shore but suddenly she rose out of the water stumbled scrambled and pushed and she was walking satyrus could see the drowned meadow beneath her hooves the mud billowing away from her steps in brownblack clouds she managed a few long strides and then she slipped and fell and they all went down in a splash coenus and satyrus underneath but satyrus had his toes wrapped in her saddlecloth and when she came up in deeper water he was still clinging to her and he had coenus wedged with desperate strength against her side theron was there and philokles pushing against his sides and melitta with an arm around coenuss neck holding his head clear of the water he wasnt dead yet because he was spluttering the marshy bank was just a few long strides away melitta let go of coenus and she and bion were first up on to the bank followed by two unridden horses then thalassa pushed herself up one giant lunge to plant her hind feet on the mud and a struggling leap almost straight up with the weight of a boy and a big man and she was up front feet scrambling over the edge satyrus lost his seat and slid free to fall on grass and coenus fell on top of him in a tangle and moaned philokles and theron climbed the bank under their own power satyrus had been kicked at the end and he lay just breathing with waves of pain running from his right thigh to his brain theron lay breathing beside him philokles dragged himself to his feet he went to hermes the big gelding and pulled the sauromatae spear from the horses saddlecloth where he had bundled it with the gear of the other men they had killed satyrus rolled over ignoring the pain determined not to be afraid this time he looked for his other horse and she was gone lost in the river so much for dry bowstrings he pulled his bow out of his gorytos which was still full of water all his arrows were soaked and his bow felt odd whipping in his hand the bindings wet through strapped to the outside of his gorytos was the short sharp steel akinakes that ataelus had given him he drew it it was no longer than his forearm a pitiful weapon against a grown sauromatae warrior coming up the bank he stumbled to the edge there were four riders in the water and they had had as hard a swim as he had they were not armoured most had cast their helmets aside and only their heads and the heads of their horses came above the water the sauromatae didnt even seem to know where they were they let their horses swim them to shore and the first horse touched the mud at the same spot where thalassa had touched scrambled in the shallows and then swam the last few lengths to the bank philokles leaned over the edge and killed the lead man while his horse gathered itself for the scramble up the bank a single punch of his spear the other sauromatae milled around a few horselengths from shore calling to one and other come and die philokles yelled did upazan send you the barbarian warriors swam their horses back to the drowned meadow and got their legs under them then the one with gold in his hair shouted back let us ashore and we swear not to harm you they were only a few horselengths apart it was an easy bow shot but no one had a bow that would function satyrus exhausted managed a laugh did upazan send you philokles called again yes the barbarian returned then you can swim back to him philokles called he stepped away from the edge he sank on his haunches and looked at the children and theron we cant let them up the bank he said i cant go on much longer theron looked around i can he said who has a javelin the water was drying from his body he looked like a god philokles went to hermes moving like an old man and took a javelin out of the kit strapped to the gelding he walked with an unaccustomed heaviness theron looked them all over we wont get far he said that house will have to shelter us we can only stay a few hours philokles said sooner or later theyll send a ship he gave the athlete the javelin theron unbound his hair and took the leather thong wrapped it twice around the spear and made a loop then he tied the loop off he appeared unhurried he walked to the bank measuring off his strides right out to the edge and then back after three times he hefted the javelin well out of sight of the barbarians i assume that if i kill one the other two will charge us he said philokles was silent he took a deep breath and stood the big spear in his fists do the thing he said theron ran three steps skipped once and threw the javelin it flew like a thunderbolt and hit one of the barbarians so hard that it went a third of its length through his body before he fell into the water nice throw philokles said the other two came forward they were brave and they knew they had no choice so they urged their horses forward across the last stretch and up the muddy bank the first man came up just where thalassa had come up and died there spitted on philokles spear the second mans horse took him further upstream to an easier climb and he made it up the bank his horse had spirit and he turned the animal and went straight for philokles he got his own spear out and up and parried philokles buttspike the spartan was just getting the weapon clear of his kill he might have had philokles then except that melitta got under his horse with her knife and ripped at his booted leg slashing what she could reach desperate to save the spartan satyrus didnt feel as if he was in control of his own body because he didnt recall pushing his body into panicked attack but he was suddenly cutting at the rider with his akinakes the blade locked against the other mans long iron sword satyrus saw his blade skip over the bigger weapon and cut the mans tattooed bicep and then theron was there cutting with his kopis in big overhand cuts like a slave hewing wood and they swarmed the man until he was dead when he was down his cries stilled they looked at each other covered in blood theron made a sound like a foxs cry choked grief or rage and they all looked away at once satyrus saw movement in the corner of his eye and he turned to see thalassa give a little skip almost rearing she tossed her hooves at the heavens and then she toppled and fell philokles walked over to her a hand stretched before him in supplication he put a hand on her withers and then on her head he shook his head her heart went he said poseidon lord of horses take her to you satyrus said and burst into sobs heavy wrenching sobs of a kind he hadnt cried for people and melitta fell across him crying they went to the horse patting her head ineffectually and weeping we need to eat philokles said his voice had a dead quality to it as if he wasnt letting himself think about his words therell be another pursuit as soon as they find a way to cross the river melitta shuddered i thought we were safe she said and immediately sensed the illogic in her words youll never be safe again philokles said get your packs and follow me all they had was their fishing kit and they had it on their shoulders quickly satyrus stood looking at thalassa in the grass we should burn her or bury her he said we should but we cant im heading for that house the spartan pointed at a distant stone house a maeotae farmhouse perhaps the farthest along the shore the yard was empty and the man didnt want to raise the bar on his door philokles threatened him from the yard until he complied and the twins were afraid of philokles rage melitta and her brother had exchanged looks of horror yesterday they had had the love of these farmers now they couldnt trust the man whose roof gave them shelter hey the man called scared as theron scooped sausage from the rafters we need to eat theron said we have fish satyrus said and theron managed a smile we do at that he said he and satyrus each had a fish in their soaking leather bags and the fish were no worse for their swim in the tanais theron broiled them on the hearth and shared the fish with the farmer it didnt make him love them any more but he shared some sour wine and they were quickly asleep theron woke them at the edge of dawn a heavy hand on their heads and pulled them stumbling into the cold spring morning past the terrified farmer boat on the water he said time to go out on the swollen river they could just see the flash of oars as a pentekonter rowed steadily against the current the boat wasnt making much headway but it was coming the first rays of the sun were pink and red their horses were all lame the riders equally spent despite ten hours of sleep and they had to walk slowly away from the stone house theron had a bag of sausages and he handed everyone a link heavy garlic and spice overpowering in the morning or so we thought melitta pondered her brothers sullen silence he seemed ashamed when he should be proud he had fought well i put two in the grass myself she thought my mother will be proud and i will not go to hades without slaves then she thought of her fathers horse a tangible link to the man she knew only through her mother and philokles and coenuss stories dead she frowned away a new bout of tears as they crossed the farmyard to fetch the horses she saw a rough bundle on the manure pile she had to turn her head away and her eyes met philokles is that she paused coenus she asked quietly so that her brother wouldnt hear you think id leave coenus on a manure heap philokles asked and didnt meet her eye he wasnt sober she could tell and there was something wrong with him melitta made bright small talk to hide the corpse from her brother she knew who was on the manure pile the farmer wasnt going to betray them because theron or philokles had killed him coenus on the other hand had lived through the night he was stiff but his wounds had stopped bleeding and he had the farmers whole store of linen wrapped around his torso he was in better shape than philokles who could barely walk they made less than ten stades in the first hour and if it hadnt been for therons muscles they might have done worse melitta watched her tutor sink into the same kind of sullenness that affected her brother and finally she spoke up where are we going she asked heraklea philokles said that was a quarter of the way around the euxine that will take weeks melitta said philokles stumbled to a stop look girl he said yesterday we were attacked by upazan galleys out of pantecapaeum sacked the town what does that tell you pantecapaeum is an ally melitta cried her brother raised his head mother was going to pantecapaeum he said to renew the treaty with eumeles and now you will be hunted philokles said upazan and eumeles have made a deal he shook his head utter weariness getting the better of his good sense all we can do is run melittas nails bit into the palms of her hands what of mama she demanded shes not dead shes not dead she grabbed her brothers hand and he gripped it as if she was a sword shes not dead the boy shouted philokles and theron kept walking and coenus raised his head shook it and looked away maybe not the old soldier said none of them spoke for a long time after a while the sun tried to rise on a grey day and then it began to rain coenuss head came up rain he said cover our tracks cover our scent he looked at philokles and drew a deep breath although they could see that it hurt him now you have a chance philokles stood on the road in the rain for as long as it takes a good smith to shoe a horse then he said we need to get off the road coenus nodded crosscountry until you have to cross the river he agreed theron shook his head we must be ahead of the news no one else could have swum the river coenuss eyes came up he was having trouble breathing and his eyes were dull but he got his head up and he pointed his walking staff at theron listen boy he said eumeles needs these children dead his whole fucking attack on our town is for nothing if the children live hell be across this morning if he has to swim himself hell flood this side of the river with soldiers men he trusts theron swished his walking staff in irritation this is not the sort of expedition i signed on for but then he saw something in philokles that changed his mind melitta saw him start he doesnt want to end up like the farmer shed never seen philokles the tutor philokles the drunk like this he was scary he looked them over and gave a smile a halfsmile almost of contempt crosscountry it is follow me they walked all day leading their horses the rain continued and they crossed muddy fields and walked through dripping woods melitta was tired in an hour and exhausted before they sat under an oak and ate more garlic sausage coenus could barely walk her brother met her eye and shook his head but they were too tired to talk after they had eaten the sausage they walked again as darkness began to settle philokles and theron began to take turns carrying coenus and then they stopped in a stand of ash and cut poles and made a stretcher out of his chlamys and walked on again carrying him between them none of the horses was fit to ride in the evening they came to a village theron went in alone and came out dejected men were here this morning he said they took all the horses and killed some men he shrugged i took this he said and held out a clay pot the size of his hand i tried to pay but everyone ran off they made a camp above the town none of them had a fire kit and everything was wet through and theron couldnt get a fire started he looked at philokles youre the old soldier he said i get fire started by telling a slave to light one philokles shot back fine pair of bandits you two will make coenus muttered he sat in the dark shredding bark between his fingers for a long time so long that melitta fell asleep and she awoke to the warm kiss of golden fire on her face he did it with a stick satyrus said with delight they gazed at the fire for a while listening to their bellies rumble and then they were asleep in the morning they cut north again at coenuss urging into wilder country farther from the river and the shore of the euxine bion had recovered and philokles and theron got coenus up on her and they made better time theron ran down a rabbit and they stopped in the hollow of a hilltop and made fire quickly because coenus had shown them how to wrap coals and embers in wet leaves to carry with them rabbit soup in therons clay pot nothing to eat it with so that melitta burned her lips drinking it straight from the pot and roast rabbit cooked on a green branch used as a spit melitta grew used to taking direction from coenus as he lay on a pile of cut boughs protected from the rain only by their one spare cloak which had belonged to one of the dead sauromatae after the meal they were all better even coenus they slept a little collected embers and walked on that night they slept in deep woods soaked to the skin but warmed by a big fire in the morning coenus was well enough to look over the horses and frown the two steppe ponies are well enough and bion is healthy but were killing the other two theyre too well bred for this life we should kill them for meat or trade them to a farmer for meat satyrus asked his eyes wide our horses hermes coenus grunted and sat suddenly and without ceremony son there are no rules now we cant get attached to anything including each other he looked at philokles im slowing you brother philokles shrugged yes you are on the other hand without your knowledge of hunting and living rough the children might already be dead or id be driven to taking chances he looked down the hill as it is weve made time were only a day or so from the ford at thatis coenus smiled grimly ill try and stay useful then philokles grunted see that you do otherwise well i suppose youd make a good roast theron turned away from philokles laughter and coenuss grunts you spartan bastard coenus spat you make it all hurt more theyre joking satyrus said theron shook his head theyre not like anyone ive ever known he said i thought that i was tough the plain of thatis was an endless succession of rich brown streams swollen with the rain maeotae farmers tilled the mud in silence and only a handful even raised their eyes to watch them if they were forced to come into a village it was all so dull that they were almost captured owing to simple inattention they were walking along the wooded edge of a field of wheat when coenus raised his head i smell horses he said ares philokles whispered just across the hedge in the next field were a dozen horsemen led by a tall man in a red cloak with a livid scar on his face two dismounted soldiers were beating a peasant scarface watched with an impatience that carried over a stade of broken ground melittas heart went from a dead stop to a gallop just keep walking philokles said theron didnt know much about horses and he walked off but satyrus jumped in front of coenuss mount and got his hands on bions nose there honey he said in sakje there there my darling he looked up at coenus who gave him a nod they walked along the edge of the field until they came to a path going off up the ridge deeper into the woods what were they doing melitta asked nothing good philokles spat keep moving he grunted thank the gods they missed us they climbed the ridge apparently without being spotted but when they reached the open meadow at the top they could see horsemen across the meadow working the field carefully despite the pouring rain another group of horsemen was in the trees below them they saw the second group as soon as they stopped think theyve seen us philokles asked coenus shook his head his lips almost white we must be leaving tracks or some poor peasant saw us and talked but they dont know where we are not exactly if they did theyd be on us they watched for another minute from the cover of the trees melitta could see six of the enemy horsemen all big men on chargers greeks not sauromatae the lead man had a face with a red wound across it and it looked as if his nose had been cut off even a hundred horselengths away it looked horrible off the trail and up the next ridge coenus said fast as we can were heartbeats from being caught if they see us were done up until then melitta had thought that the going couldnt get any harder constant rain endless trudging along no food to speak of none of it had prepared her for walking across country instead of walking on trails every branch caught at her every weed every plant growing from the forest floor tore at her leggings and her tunic her boots filled with things that cut her feet and philokles wouldnt stop they came to a stream swollen from days of rain and no one offered her a hand the water came up to her belly and proved to her that she hadnt actually been wet until then dont move philokles said she was halfway up the muddy bank one sodden boot on a rock and the other still in the stream when the order came satyrus was in the stream without turning her head she could see that well upstream half a stade or more a man on a horse had just emerged from the thick brush of the valley and was looking right at them do not move philokles said quite clearly at her side he was moving so was satyrus without a splash her brother lowered himself into the water and vanished melitta turned her head as the sakje taught because nothing gives the human form away to a pursuer like the face she pressed herself into the bank and tried to ignore the cold of the water on her left leg it would be worse for satyrus who was now fully immersed she could feel the enemys hoof beats through the earth he was riding along the verge of the stream beside her philokles began to pray quietly first to artemis and hera and then to all the gods she joined him the hoof beats stopped suddenly and she heard a splash by the maiden coenus said his voice sounded as loud as a trumpet melitta looked upstream and saw a horse thrashing in the deep water of the next long pool above the ford the bank collapsed under him philokles said stay still the horse thrashed again and then the rider emerged on the bank just a few horselengths away he was cursing in fluent greek he was an officer his breastplate showed fine workmanship dhat you lucius called a voice from where theyd come a voice that couldnt be more than ten horselengths away and sounded as if it had a horrendous cold yes lucius shouted his voice betraying his annoyance my fucking horse put me in the drink he stood on the bank and wrung out his cloak that you stratokles yes the man addressed as stratokles was closer more tracks he emerged as he was calling out walking into the grey light and the rain just as lucius came up the bank to meet him they were perhaps three horselengths away and a long peal of thunder rolled across the hilltops and echoed from the valleys only the overhang of the bank and the thin greenery of a single bush stood between melitta and her pursuers thunder barked overhead and a lightning flash followed close the bang almost intimate fuck eumeles and fuck this what tracks lucius demanded no ones paying me enough to do this shit if zeus throws one of those bolts at me look stratokles said his voice was thick and even without moving her head melitta could see that he was the man with a wound on his face whatever one horse maybe two were looking for six men isnt that right and a pair of children lightning struck again just as close and a gust of wind tore through the trees they arent moving in this crap i cant move in this crap lucius looked around there are bandits here and i dont really want to find them theyll fight back and this storm is going to flood this stream lets get moving the peasants said stratokles began screw the peasants my lord listen that fool you caught last night hed say anything you wouldnt let that creepy sicilian torture him well good on you lord but sometimes it is the way we asked the question ten times before he answered if hed known hed have told us right away lucius snorted give me a hand up there was a squelching noise anything down there came a call from up the hill melitta could hear the jangling of bridles and all the music of a troop of horses the rain came down heavier than ever and stratokles pulled his wool cloak up over his head fuck the weather he said well never get a scent and im not all that sure we saw a hoof print everything fills with water as soon as bah to hades with it lets go back lets find a rich peasant and kick him out of his house lucius said ndothing down here stratokles called sound the rally he put a hand to his nose and shook his head then melitta could hear the sound of a horn being blown three calls repeated over and over she clung to her patch of bank and shivered moving as little as possible she couldnt feel her leg time passed she had time to wonder if she could do any lasting harm to her leg by leaving it numb and to watch a fish swimming in the current and wonder if she could become a fish and she had time to wonder how coenus was doing and then philokles hands reached down grabbed her shoulders and lifted her clear of the stream sometimes the gods are with us he said wheres your brother somewhere in the water she managed to choke out and then she collapsed against bion who nuzzled her theron dragged satyrus out of the water where he had taken cover in a bed of reeds downstream at the bend he couldnt walk we cant build a fire theron said philokles grabbed her shoulder walk he ordered melitta hated to be weak but she couldnt make her limbs move cant she said satyrus just shook his head crawl then coenus said itll get you warm so they did it was a new low crawling through the wet woods feet filthy hair sodden but it soon restored enough warmth for them to stand then walk satyrus used one of the sauromatae ponies to keep him erect for a while and they walked on melitta had lost one of her sakje boots so sodden that it lost all shape and fell off her foot after another stade she found that she was dragging it by the laces she was so tired that she hadnt noticed until it got caught in some undergrowth how are you she asked her brother fine he said and gave her a smile that smile was worth a great deal she drew some energy from it i thought you were dead she whispered fiercely me too he said back and they both smiled and then it was better but coenus was worse he began to cough and to tremble immersion was the last thing hed needed and now he was gaining in heat what the rest of them lost and starting to mumble we need to get him into a bed theron said i could use one too philokles nodded they went over the top of the ridge and then down towards the cook fires of another village they didnt follow us over the ridge theron offered as an opinion philokles shrugged im about to risk our lives on it he said they came down on to the muddy road just short of a small plank bridge theron went across first looking at the ground and then at the far tree line before motioning the rest of them to follow him the village was so small that they were through it while coenus was still muttering an internal debate as to whether to steal the towns single horse a wealthy peasant watched them ride by from the shelter of his stone house no one spoke to them theron turned aside and asked the wealthy peasant for lodging the man went inside and they heard him drop the bar on his door every one of these bastards will remember us philokles spat peasants like helots sell you for a drachma theron wolfed down warm bread stolen from a farmyard passing pieces to the children and to coenus who ate it ravenously other than the bread they gained nothing from the town just beyond was the next river and the ferry and then they had to stop and wait for half an hour in the endless rain while philokles checked it out sure enough there was a party of cavalry keeping watch on the ferry philokles spotted them when their sentry got restless and dismounted in the trees to relieve himself now what melitta asked were already wet philokles said we ride upstream and cross with the horses it took them the rest of the day and they made camp in a tiny clearing between two stones with ancient carving just at nightfall their fire was weak and wet and smoked constantly so that it was difficult to sit close enough to get warm and they had nothing to eat but the last of the bread it was the longest night melitta could remember thunder came and lightning and whenever it flashed she woke if she was sleeping at all to find her brothers eyes locked on hers the night stretched on and on long enough for her to have an ugly dream about her mother and another about coenus caught by wolves and eaten and then the sky was grey in the east and the ground was pale enough to see to walk nothing to keep us here philokles said theron sat on his haunches his fingers clenched until the knuckles were white on his walking stick we need food any ideas philokles asked if not keep walking when the sun was high in the sky somewhere beyond the endless grey clouds they reached another swollen stream i dont think this is the hypanis philokles said shaking his head ares i have no idea where we are i hope i havent got you going in circles no coenus muttered not circles every time they awoke melitta expected coenus to be dead but so far he wasnt not circles he said not hypanis either they crossed with the horses again all wet to the bone as every person had to swim some of the distance with one hand on a pony the horses are failing philokles said when they were done he was wearing his chlamys like a giant chiton pinned at the shoulders it made him look even bigger we need a house theron said i dont think coenus will make another night in the open i doubt were ahead of the bastards cordon philokles said well never escape them if we spend a night in a town maybe theyre past us theron argued they cant be everywhere you just want to sleep in a bed philokles accused is that so bad theron asked id like a cup of wine too it was coenuss fever that convinced philokles to risk a night in a house he walked down the trail and found a farmers field and exchanged a few words with the man and he came back to them where they waited in the trees i like him hes the village headman and i think he can be trusted philokles looked at coenus we need to get out of the rain dont take the risk on my account coenus muttered theron ignored him and nodded the farmer called gardan the blue for his bright blue eyes was friendly and his wife welcomed the twins as if they brought her house good fortune they sat together in the main room of the house swathed in dry wool and warm for the first time in five days enjoying a meal of goat and lentils and barley bread they ate like hungry wolves melitta assumed that they would buy fresh horses from the extensive string she had seen in the paddocks concealed in a stand of woods away from the road she waited for philokles to mention it and when he didnt she nudged him if we buy their horses we can make better time she said philokles looked at her with illconcealed sorrow i have the gold from the men we killed and our gear he said he nodded in the direction of the farmer we cant give him a fair price for his horses not and have the money to take a ship neither of the twins had given a thought to the sea but where will we get a ship melitta asked philokles looked around at the farmer smiled grimly and shook his head at the children quiet hes a good man and i dont want to have to kill him to keep you alive understand they went to bed without another word in the morning the farmer walked them to the edge of the road he bowed to the twins young master young mistress may i speak freely satyrus nodded you are a free farmer he said seriously you can say anything that you want gardan tugged at his beard youre on the run he said he looked at philokles you dont have a clean garment among you philokles nodded looked around and then said its true the sauromatae attacked the city with help from eumeles soon enough some of them will come down this road looking for us he shrugged i recommend that you be helpful to them the farmer nodded he rubbed his beard he was a short man swarthy as many of the maeotae were although he had the blue eyes of a hellene and jetblack hair from the age of heroes my uncle fought with marthax at the ford of the river god he said we remember your father he tugged his beard again i know what happened at the town he said slowly he looked at philokles been two patrols through both sauromatae farmers round here dont take kindly to such people a man was killed he shrugged and pointed at the heavy bow that rested on pegs over the door they may come back to burn us out and then again they may not he said with something like satisfaction then he seemed to gather himself im chattering what i mean to say is no one in this steading will give you away nor any of our neighbours we know who you are and theres five good geldings down the road in a pasture no ones watching them he smiled ill tell the next barbarian that the last barbarian stole them his wife came out of her door into the yard a bag of feed in her hand theres clean fabric and wool blankets she said philokles didnt answer instead he looked at the twins this is a lesson he said i have told you of solon and lycurgus and i have read to you from plato and from other men who account themselves wise but this is the lesson that good returns good and evil returns evil these people have saved our lives because your father was a good man and your mother has ruled fairly and well remember satyrus nodded soberly i will remember he extended a hand to the farmer who clasped it melitta rode forward a few steps when i am queen she said i will return this favour a hundredfold she kissed the wife and clasped hands with the man the horses were just where the farmer had said and three of them had bundles tied to their backs when you are queen satyrus asked melitta shrugged it is a role brother we are exiles perhaps we will return those people just gave us all of their profit from a year of farming the whole generation of their horses the wool from their sheep theres linen here that was grown as flax in aegypt and paid for with the wheat they gave it all in one openhanded gesture like heroes because of who we are she shrugged they are more like heroes than we are satyrus spent too much time gulping against sobs now he did it again they rode through the rain in silence philokles was quiet too why are you crying satyrus asked philokles met his eyes not even trying to hide the tears all we built he said heavily a decade of war to create peace gone he took a rasping breath you have no idea what was given to gain this land and the peace it deserves he shrugged leave them hermes and the other horse theyre good beasts and then gardan wont be at such a loss satyrus nodded he took his tack off hermes and put it on the strange gelding and then whispered to the old cavalry horse for a bit he looked sheepish when he was done mama says pater always talked to his horses he said defensively then he gave a wry smile at least hermes will survive this adventure if we dont were doing pretty well i think given the odds theron said with a meal in him and a dry chiton he was a new man our father gave his life for this country melitta said not just your father my dear philokles managed a smile a great many men and no few women he looked back into the rain and his smile faded and he seemed to be watching something else somewhere else i hate the gods he said coenus shook his head i hate impiety he said its foolish for a man to hate the gods someones feeling better theron said five fresh horses made all the difference they rode hard but the horses were changed regularly the blankets and clean clothes and the gold pins they were wearing made them look prosperous instead of desperate although the wiser elders on the road wondered quietly why they were out in the rain at all or moving at such speed they were eight more days from the hypanis river and as they trotted over the rainsodden landscape melitta knew that she couldnt have walked the whole way and coenus despite his fevered wound was better for the saddle and for sleeping dry gardan the blue had packed them a heavy wool blanket carefully felted as big as the roof of a small house the work of four or five women for a whole winter it made a waterproof shelter they were in better shape when they came down the last slope to the hypanis a small party with packhorses and good clothes and enough rest to make good decisions im afraid of the ferry melitta heard philokles say to theron and coenus he sent theron ahead but theron came back with the news that aside from outrageous rates the ferry was safe weve ridden clear philokles said he shrugged they have so much ground to cover eumeles cant be everywhere theron bargained with the ferryman the way a slave bargains for fish in the agora hectoring the man and threatening to swim the river himself on horseback until the man conceded a copper obol at a time and finally they were crossing with their whole train for a single silver owl coenus watched in silent disapproval but his fever was so high that he couldnt contribute much his face said that they should be above such things the rain stopped while they watched the brown hypanis flow past their broad raft it took the effort of the ferryman both his sons and theron to wrestle the unwieldy thing against the current and they had to make two trips because the rush of water prevented the horses from swimming well philokles paid down a second silver owl without being asked and the ferryman bit it with a knowing smile you overpaid theron said he risked his boat for us philokles said and no one will follow us for a day or so theron pursed his lips why he asked the river will go down if the rain stops coenus roused himself the river will go up for another day as the water comes down from the hills he pointed at the loom of the mountains to the east and south where the foothills of the caucasus were visible even in the clouds and i put a cut in the pull rope philokles said with a shrug when theron glared philokles shrugged again i paid for the rope and he was an arsecunt they were another day riding to the sea at gorgippia a small town that owed allegiance to no one the town existed to make fish sauce for the athens market and not much else and the smell hit them ten stades away in the harbour vats of fish guts gave vent to a stench so strong that the twins gagged and breathed through their mouths poseidon melitta swore i can taste it on my tongue satyrus was glad to see her make a joke it had been a quiet ride philokles was on edge from the moment they entered the town but there were no boats in the harbour except local fishing craft and after some careful probing in wine shops he grew more confident no one has been here he said he shook his head eumeles may have given up coenus was gasping like a man suffocating philokles remounted and supported his friend he needs cool baths and a doctor he said normally a party of gentlemen would look for the richest house and try to arrange guestfriendship normally the children of the lady srayanka would have had no trouble finding lodging but philokles didnt want to show his hand yet he took them to the best of the waterfront wine shops and paid a few obols for some beds in a wooden barn behind the drying sheds the straw was clean and the smell of animals was refreshing compared to the overpowering odour of rotting fish coenus went to sleep the moment he was off his horse that is a tough man theron said he thinks hes a pompous aristocrat though philokles said he had a clean wet linen towel and he wiped the megarans face hes far gone theron theron put his head down on the bigger mans chest and listened and then felt this wrists we need to change his bandages he said i doubt that theres much that a doctor can do that we cant he said to philokles eight days of rain and silent children had caused them to pool their knowledge about many things and they had each others measure coenus didnt wake up as the two men and the twins rolled him over sat him up and unwrapped the bandages the cut that went high across his ribs looked better with new pink flesh along the dark red line of the scab the lower cut that had as best they knew not quite penetrated his guts was infected along its whole length the skin inflamed above and below the line of the wound and two long tendrils of angry red tissue like the trailing legs of a squid there was pus at the ends of the wound theron put his head down and smelled the wound and shook his head wet and dry and wet and dry for eight days its a miracle that he lives apollos arrow is doing him more damage than the original wound the infection is deeper than when we crossed the ferry send the children to make a sacrifice to the golden archer and let you and i do what we must do satyrus knew even as a queens son when he was being dismissed so that adults could do adult things he bowed and caught his sisters hand well find a temple he said they walked out of the barn into the first sun theyd seen since the fight at the river hand in hand they walked along the smooth pebbles of the beach that gave the town its existence if it hadnt been for the smell of fish the place would have been pleasant as it was it was like tartarus the smell will kill him melitta said ive read it it is a miasma and it will choke his lungs let us go and make a sacrifice satyrus said melitta nodded head high to hide tears then she said do you believe in gods brother satyrus glanced at her and squeezed her hand lita i know things are bad but the gods she pulled at his hand why would gods be so childish she asked satyrus what if mama is dead have you thought about it if she is dead it is all gone everything our whole lives satyrus sat on a wooden fish trap he pulled her down next to him then he put his head in his hands i think about it all the time round and round inside my head she nodded i think mama is dead she looked out to sea theres been something missing something gone she lost her battle with tears and subsided into his shoulder satyrus wept with her clinging to her they wept for a few minutes until the tears had no point and then they both stopped as if on cue coenus is still alive satyrus said our fathers friend melitta added they got up together hand in hand eyes red they walked up the shingle towards the town such as it was behind them a long triangular sail cut the horizon they found the temple of herakles two stades outside of town on a small bluff that looked over the bay and seemed free of the smell it was the only temple that the town had and the priestess was old and nearly blind but she had a dozen attendants and a pair of healthy slaves she received them on the portico of the temple seated on a heavy wooden chair her attendants gathered around her sitting on the steps satyrus thought that she looked friendly but she scared him too it was melitta who first gathered the courage to speak we need to make sacrifice for a friend who is sick melitta said they were still holding hands and they bowed together come here child said the crone raising her head to look at them around her cataracts handsome children polite but unclean you are both unclean at your age she sniffed satyrus bowed his head unclean despoina she gripped his right hand in hers and he felt the bite of her nails in his palm she raised it to her nostrils i can smell blood even through the fish sauce boy you killed you have not cleaned yourself and your sister she too has killed she raised her head again and smoke from the temple brazier behind her rose in a fantastic curl behind her head like a sign from the god satyrus made the satyrs head sign with his left hand to avert misfortune how may i become clean he asked she tugged at his hand you are a gentleman i can see that where are you from he didnt want to resist her tug he looked into her eyes but the cataracts made them hard to read he felt a rush of fear we we come from tanais he said ahh she said as if satisfied and how do a pair of children come to me soaked in blood men tried to kill us melitta said bandits we shot them with bows one of them was a girl satyrus said the words coming from deep within him i shot her to end her pain she had an arrow in her guts and she begged he sobbed he could see her sweatfilled hair the priestess nodded lifetaking is a nasty business she said horrible for children she turned to her attendants bathe the boy for the ritual then bathe the girl to satyrus she said when you are clean you may sacrifice a black kid each and i will say the prayer lest some uncleanness cling to you she looked unseeing out over the bay where is your friend she asked friend asked satyrus who was still thinking of the girl hed killed he wondered if her face would ever leave him you have a friend who is sick yes the priestess asked her voice rasped like the sound of a woman scraping cheese with a grater this temple also serves artemis and apollo did you not know we did not melitta said she saw now the statue of her patron goddess among the greeks a young woman with a bow she bowed deeply to the priestess we have a sick friend in town the priestess nodded the men in the trireme are searching for you you will be safe here and nothing is more important than that we make you clean i will send a slave to your friends they must come here satyrus turned and for the first time saw the trireme coming into the harbour under sail coenus came up the bluff in a litter while the trireme was performing the laborious task of turning around under oars and backing her stern on to the beach she was full of men satyrus could see the warm wink of sun on bronze on her deck philokles put the horses in a stand of oaks behind the temple you bet your life on an old priestess he said satyrus stared at the marble under his feet you didnt lie to the people in the wine shop philokles nodded i didnt tell them the truth either they assumed that we were small merchants from up the coast and i let them think it he shrugged it doesnt matter the navarch on that fucking trireme will be on to us in twenty questions theron dumped a heavy wool bag inside the precincts of the temple are we asking sanctuary or running the old priestess emerged supported by the larger of her two slaves the children are bathing to be clean in the eye of the gods she said a process that would benefit you too oathbreaker then she pointed at coenus with a talonlike finger take him to the sanctuary we will not give him up nor will those dogs from pantecapaeum have him the rest of you should ride as soon as you are clean hell only slow you philokles bowed as you will holy one why do you help us she shook her head in annoyance i can tell the difference between good and evil cant you then you know why i broke my oath philokles said i she asked the gods know i am a foolish old woman who loves to see brave men do worthy deeds why did you break your oath to save these children philokles said is that the only oath youve broken she asked and philokles winced she turned the girl is bathed and clean she said come boy he followed the old woman into the sanctuary which was sumptuous beyond anything in tanais with walls picked out in coloured scenes showing the triumph of herakles the birth the trials of leto and more than he could easily take in there was a statue of apollo as a young archer in bright orange bronze his eyes and hair gold and his bow of bronze shooting a golden arrow in the centre of the sanctuary was a pool the water moved and bubbled above the pool stood a great statue of herakles nude except for a lion skin standing in the first guard position of the pankration the sight of the statue made the hair stand up on the back of satyruss neck and he smelled wet fur a heady bitter smell like a cat or a lion skin this is the pool of the god she said it was here before there was a temple we do not let just any traveller enter this pool remember as you go in that herakles was a man but by his deeds he became a god an attendant took his chiton unpinned the pins and threw the garment into the fire that burned on the altar he dropped the brooches not his best pair but solid silver into a bowl on the altar and the fire on the altar flared and smoked the god accepts your offering and your state the priestess said into the water with you satyrus thought that his sister had just done this he wondered why he hadnt seen her strong hands grasped him and he hit the water and was under it in a moment the water was warmer than blood and bubbled fiercely fizzing around his limbs and with bubbles rising between his legs and up his chest he rose to the surface and took a breath eyes tightly closed and somebody placed a hand on his head pray he was commanded and the hand pressed him down into the pool he could hear the voice counting above him the bubbles continued to rise around him and he was on the edge of panic his hair rising in the water and his skin scoured and his breath stopped so that coloured flashes came before his eyes and still the hand pressed on his head the pool was too small for him to stretch his arms he was trapped pray the voice said lord of the sun golden archer he began what was he praying for he wanted to live not drown coenus golden archer take your shaft from the side of my friend coenus he prayed and forgive me for killing that girl i only did it because she begged i couldnt stand her pain but what if she too could have been healed lion killer hero make me brave he prayed fervently and an image of the golden statue of the god at pankration filled his mind the hand on his head released him and he shot up from the pool then the temple slaves pulled him on to the marble and a towel began to rub him vigorously did you hear the god the old woman asked no satyrus said or perhaps i did the woman nodded thats as well your sister did she held something under his nose something with a strong scent like hot metal you are clean do you know how to sacrifice an animal satyrus who had sacrificed for his family since he was six was tempted to make a childish retort but he bit it back yes he said good she said the slave led him out of the back of the sanctuary to an altar at the top of wooden steps that led down to the oak woods his sister was drying her hair an attendant a young priest he thought handed him a blade a narrow blade of stone with a goldwire handle it is very sharp he whispered and as old as the stars satyrus took it the kid was tethered to the altar satyrus put a hand on the young beasts head and asked its forgiveness he raised his eyes to the sky and cut its throat in one pull stepping clear of the fountain of blood the attendants caught the animal and slaughtered it with the precision of long practice well done the priestess said now go i will look to your friend satyrus went down the steps wiping the blood from his left hand on the grass at the bottom melitta mounted first and tossed her wet hair over her shoulders her eyes were sparkling there are gods she said satyrus got up on the horse he had named platon for its broad haunches i know he said philokles had the train of spare horses in motion where are we going satyrus asked theron the athlete shook his head philokles got a tip in town he said were going to bata philokles said well be there tonight if we ride hard theres a heraklean merchant in the harbour if he hasnt left yet if he has we ride for the mountains we cant come back here what if the marines follow us satyrus asked as they jogged along already moving at a trot and screened from the beach by the trees theyd need horses philokles said he smiled grimly then he shook his head dont ask he said to theron there was a ship waiting off the beach in bata stone anchor deep in the mud and waiting for twenty more jars of batas salmon roe in oil before unfolding his wings for heraklea the ship had seemed like a gift from the gods the more so when they sailed down the coast to sinope without the sight of a trireme satyrus and his sister were too tired to examine the gift or question it and the ship ran south with a fair wind and the gentle hand of moira to guide it five days out of bata melitta had her first sight of heraklea in the last full light of the sun and the marble of the public buildings shone like coral in jewellery or wellburnished bronze pale orange in the setting sun and gold and bronze sparkled from statuary and adornments heraklea was as rich as sinope or pantecapaeum or olbia richer than athens the tyrant dionysius was not a friend of their mothers or their city but nor was he a friend of eumeles of pantecapaeum he was a friend of his own power and philokles said they had no other choices tanais might have looked like that in twenty years melitta said tanais is a blackened corpse satyrus said his mood dark melitta took his hands and together they stood against the rail of the merchant ship as she heeled into the evening breeze and thrust her way across the waves to heraklea you need to take life for what it is she said look she waved her arm like an actor beauty enjoy it you need to stop pretending to be an allwise priestess he shot back our mother is dead and our city is lost do you realize that we could be enslaved that any man on those wharves with the strength to take us could kill us or sell us we could be pleasuring customers in a brothel before another sun sets do you get that she nodded i get it brother she looked at theron and philokles who were rolling dice in the cover of an awning i think they will protect us and i think the gods will see us right the gods help those who help themselves satyrus said then get off your arse and start helping melitta said killing that girl is the best days work you ever did stop moping like a little boy you are a king in exile start acting like one she looked over the side you must follow my lead in this i know what im doing satyrus watched the wharves melitta had assumed that the sea would cure him the sea that he loved where he went on his summers to sail on uncle leons ships and learn the ropes this voyage he hadnt even watched the sailors rig the sail fine satyrus said the angry silence that followed lasted them until the ships side scraped along a stone jetty and then again until they were standing in the dust and ordure of the heraklean waterfront philokles had spent some time with the captain of the merchant ship throughout the voyage keeping him sweet or so theron said as they approached the wharves philokles took the man aside on the platform where the steersman conned the ship when they were done talking philokles came down the gangplank with a worried look theron was trying to unload the horses with the help of the deck crew they had kept the three best horses from the farmer and melittas bion the rest of the horses had been sold at bata where they had got a good price shipping the horses had cost more than shipping the people but philokles had told the twins that without horses they were too vulnerable bion hadnt liked being swayed aboard in a sling and now he didnt like walking down the gangplank resisting every step showing his teeth and acting like a mule melitta had to coax him on to dry land with a hastily purchased honey and sesame confection stupid horse she said fondly satyrus ignored her he stood with his back against his own horse and his arms crossed philokles tugged at his beard i have to take a risk he said he was not quite sober in fact he had drunk steadily once they were on board theron shrugged its been all risk since i joined this crew he said why do you stay melitta asked she was drawing looks from passersby on the wharves as a young woman of good family out in the public eye in fact she was a young woman of good family who was out in public wearing a short chiton with a scarlet chitoniskos over it and she was wrangling horses she got a great deal of attention theron smiled the companys good he said and im not bored philokles gave them all a crooked smile this is not the place to have this conversation he said lets go satyrus got on to his horse with a wriggle and a push melitta did her usual acrobatic vault and every head on the street turned you have to stop doing that in public theron said girls dont ride they certainly dont ride astride they dont vault on to horses and they dont do acrobatics of course they do melitta said with a toss of her head i see it on athenian plates and vases all the time theron made a choking noise that satyrus recognized through his sullenness as illconcealed laughter those are flute girls and hetairai he said melitta shrugged then she turned her artemis smile on the people around them and some of the men smiled back where are we going melitta asked leon the numidian has a factor and warehouses here philokles said uncle leon melitta asked will he be there i doubt it philokles said gods what a salvation that would be zeus soter let leon be there part ii forming bc s tratokles rode up to the wall of the barn before the macedonian mercenary could get the girls knees apart with his own he had her hands pinned and hed headbutted her to stop the screams but she was a tough woman with a farmers muscles and she wasnt giving up without a fight as the macedonians face testified stratokles slid down from his horse pivoted on his left foot and kicked the man in the head so hard that his body made a gentle thump as it hit the stone barn who allowed this he asked the ring of mercenaries who had gathered to watch you youre a phylarch arent you the man so addressed a sicilian from faroff syracuse flinched at the man with the livid red scar across his face yes he muttered are you aware that without these people well never catch the fucking children stratokles was furious not just from the constant pain of his face but from the stupidity of the men he was saddled with they know where the children are the macedonian spat he sat up and retched fuck me i may at that stratokles said he had a knife in his hand and it was pressed against the macedonians temple dont move around too much the sicilian phylarch shook his head its been a hard ten days lord the boys need some some rape i recommend that they practise on each other then listen you fuckwit these people are heron of pantecapaeums citizens stratokles shook his head we done worse when we took that town tanais you werent so high and mighty then the phylarch knew he had the rest of the men with him stratokles shrugged sometimes men have to do evil deeds to attain an end tanais had to be sacked it was a symbol a symbol your master cant afford but one day of sacking a town an event that should have sated your urges for a little longer does not give you the right to rape your way across the countryside the phylarch shrugged they all hate us anyway stratokles nodded he sheathed his dagger and the macedonian breathed again stratokles shook his head are you surprised he picked the girl up she had a broken nose two black eyes and blood all down the front of her chiton but she tried to resist him he grabbed her wrists and threw her over his shoulder then carried her around the barn to where other soldiers had the wife and the farmer himself penned in the house let me past you idiots stratokles roared he walked up the steps to the stone house and put the girl on the floor im sorry for what my men have done here but her virtue is not stolen and her nose will heal sooner than mine he said with an attempt at humour but it fell to its death on the ironhard faces of the farmer and his wife she leaped to her daughter put her arms around her and the two began to talk fast in the local tongue we know you had the twins here three days back perhaps four stratokles looked at the boy cowering against the hearth im doing my best to restrain these animals but it could get ugly here and im just one man if you tell us what we need to know well be gone the sooner and no one needs to get hurt this is what heron of pantecapaeum stands for is it the farmer spat yes it is stratokles thought to himself politics made strange allies and for stratokles a democrat of the most rabid sort a man of principle dedicated to the freedom of athens to be forced into a yoke with the tyrant of pantecapaeum was the richest sort of irony please stratokles said help me to help you when were they here the farmer wilted his eyes went to his son and daughter outside the mercenaries were moving around with heavy footsteps their very silence ominous three days back the farmer said they took our horses the best of the mercenaries was an italian named lucius a big man with a brain who had stood by stratokles repeatedly during the chase stratokles demoted the phylarch on the spot and promoted the italian in his place there was a lot of ugly muttering stratokles rode in among them pushing his horse right up against the macedonians listen children he said i could have killed fuckwit here for mutiny and rape but i chose to assume that his useless phylarch shared some of the blame so you get to live stratokles grinned around at the ten of them if you annoy me enough ill just start killing the ones i find most annoying get me i can take all ten of you together apart one at a time any way you want it care to start dancing if not shut up and soldier you aint our officer the exphylarch said in a whine were paid men mercenaries we have our own rules stratokles smile widened im your officer now he looked around at them again a useless assortment of boys and thugs and the only rules here are mine they were badly mounted and he suspected that the children hed been sent to kill were now better mounted but he knew horses and they made the best time he could manage five days across the hills and down the valleys to the hypanis there should have been a ferry across the swollen torrent but instead they found an angry ferryman and a cut rope yesterday the thieves the fucking catamites the ferryman shouted he had a dozen or more customers camped around his stone house waiting for the water to go down stratokles looked at the river and then at the horses and men he had with him he was tempted to curse the gods but he knew from experience that the gods give what they give we swim he said fuck you the former phylarch said i aint swimming theyre a day ahead downriver into a port and gone stratokles looked at lucius who shrugged id put it a nicer way he said but the mans got a point stratokles nodded well im swimming he said lucius id appreciate it if you came the rest of these scum arent worth my trouble ride back to heron tell him you failed and see what you get as it was they rested the horses overnight ate a hot meal in the mans barn and the river was down in the morning even with that though the swim across the hypanis was one of the scariest things stratokles had ever done halfway across when an underwater log thumped against the ribs of his horse and both of them rolled under for a moment he thought he was done oh athens the shit i do for you but then he was up the far bank he had brought a light rope from the ferryman and he tied it to the big oak at the top of the bank and the ferryman gave him a wave and a cheer service restored stratokles said to lucius whod also made the crossing arent we going to wait for the lads lucius asked when stratokles rubbed his gelding down and got back up on him stratokles watched the ferryman and one of his sons inching across in a light boat using the line stratokles had carried to keep from racing away downstream itll be all day before he gets his hawser across the athenian said youre the boss lucius said you think we can take six men all by ourselves i have to try stratokles said well im with you lucius muttered im a fool but im with you they made bata in three more days there was a heavy trireme beached by the stern and heron of pantecapaeum was just coming up the beach when they rode their tired horses down to him they got away stratokles said heron nodded this morning about five hours ago he looked at lucius and then back at the athenian youre a better man than i took you for you stuck it out all the way across the countryside stratokles shrugged i missed them though heron nodded his long nose seeming to mock the stub that stratokles had the ship theyre on is a coaster bound for heraklea he said i can give you this ship and the marines on board go and kill them stratokles took a deep breath i have business in heraklea and an agent or two he said on the other hand this is getting beyond my remit im not your man heron im cassanders and killing those children cant become an end in itself what damage can they do you heron looked out at the ship and shrugged just do as you are told or tell cassander and your precious athenian tyrant that unless those children die im no part of his alliance and he can whistle for the grain he wants the tall man gave stratokles a slight smile more like a mockery of a smile i dare say hell find that he can spare you for a few weeks stratokles stifled the wave of resentment that threatened to escape his throat and take voice the political daimon that ruled his thoughts the spirit of expediency he called his daimon told him that herons come and go the things i do for athens stratokles thought introduce me to your navarch he said t he factors steward said that leon was not there and his factor when summoned at philokles insistence was none too pleased to speak with them he was a middleaged heraklean merchant named kinon and he viewed the four mounted travellers outside his palatial house with distress and suspicion kinon was as wide as he was tall and not all with fat he wore a fortune in jewellery on his person with a jewelled girdle and gilt sandals two armed slaves stood behind him and the heavily studded gate was only opened wide enough for the three of them to stand abreast kinon spoke brusquely i do not expect leon for some weeks indeed i do not know if heraklea is on his summer sailing itinerary at all good day to you philokles slipped down from his horse and stood in the gateway so that it was difficult to close the gate politely well accept your hospitality anyway he said i havent offered my hospitality kinon said leon is my guestfriend i need the shelter of a roof as do these children and their trainer are you turning me away philokles seemed bigger and far more noble than usual kinon looked at them what proof do you bring that you are the guestfriend of my employer get you gone before i send for the tyrants guard philokles shrugged i helped free your master from slavery he said he was the slave to nicomedes of olbia kineas of athens and i kineas you are that philokles the spartan kinon took a step forward slapping his head satyrus watching couldnt decide whether it was a theatrical gesture or a real one or perhaps both together i am philokles of olbia and tanais these children are the children of kineas and a curse on you for making me say that on a public street philokles didnt seem so drunk keep your curses for those who mean you harm kinon said but he turned red a thousand apologies come in what are such noble guests doing here with so little ceremony now i know that leon would require me to show every courtesy could you not just have said or sent a note the armed slaves helped bring the horses into the houses business yard the house steward was already raising his hands to heaven where shall i stable so many horses he asked the gods and melitta didnt like how his eyes lingered on her kinon dismissed his worries with a wave of the hand guests are from the gods he said so are their beasts i could not send a note because i did not wish it to be known that we were here philokles said my charges are in a dangerous position tell me the news what is the tyrants relationship with pantecapaeum eumeles who used to be called heron kinon was pleased to be master of the situation and pleased now that he had guests to show off his possessions two more slaves came out of the slave quarters at the back of the business yard they took over the animals while a young girl brought wine mixed with mineral water fizzing on the tongue it made satyrus think of the bath at the temple of herakles hes the one philokles said he tasted his wine and bowed indicating his pleasure troops of slaves it seemed emerged from their quarters to take the baggage off the horses and march it into the house the steward reappeared i have prepared rooms for them master he said kinon nodded his lips pursed until another girl appeared from the arch that led to the gardencourtyard this one beautiful like a young aphrodite with wide eyes above a narrow arched nose and lips that seemed too lush to be real satyrus looked at her and her fleeting glance slaves rarely raised their eyes caught his in a flash of green she smiled a little she had a garland in her hair and five more in her arms with her eyes down she gave satyrus a garland my master welcomes you she said and her eyes touched his again satyrus blushed and took the garland he could see every contour of her body under her simple linen chiton all women and all men were naked under their garments and almost no one except the sick wore undergarments but this seemed to be the first time that satyrus had ever noticed such a thing he dropped his eyes and missed her flash of a smile theron didnt he took his wreath and grinned that sir is a beautiful girl kinon patted her shoulder with unfeigned fondness beautiful and modest i bought her for a brothel but i dont think ill ever sell her he gazed on her with a connoisseurs appreciation there is more to life than profit your sentiment does you great credit theron said what is your name girl i am called kallista she breathed what could be more natural for her kinon said now your eumeles you must know our dionysius hates him as does his brother it is very personal yes philokles drank the rest of his cup of wine and handed it to a slave that is the best news that i have heard today master kinon there is no master here kinon said with courtesy this is your house may i engage you as guestfriends of my own account the children of kineas and srayanka melittas eyes flickered at her brother do it and he stepped forward he imitated philokles gesture handing his wine cup to the air and assuming that a slave would appear to take it it worked i am satyrus son of kineas of the corvaxae of athens and olbia herakles fathered my ancestors on the nereid who dwelt on the slopes of gagamia in euboea arimnestos of the corvaxae led the plataeans at marathon and won undying honour there kallikrates eusebios corvaxae led the exiles from plataea he and his son gave their lives for athens he reached out and took both of kinons hands i ask your guestfriendship kinon of heraklea and i gift you with mine and my childrens kinon clasped his hands the merchants hands were soft and a little moist but his grip was firm so might the heroes themselves have spoken indeed for a youth you sound more like a man of gold than a man of iron i am honoured with your guestfriendship satyrus eusebios of the corvaxae he took a wine krater and snapped his fingers and one of the slaves who had been carrying a sword appeared with an offering bowl kinon poured a libation i swear to hera to demeter who loves all guests and to your ancestor herakles that i will be your faithful host and guest satyrus pinched the libation bowl between his thumb and forefinger greyeyed lady of wisdom and the strongarmed smith who works bronze and iron keep this man and be my surety that i will be a faithful guest and friend i feel as if i have peleuss son achilles as a guest kinon said from an irritation this has become a pleasure please follow me to a more comfortable situation he led the way through the main arch and they went from the businesslike courtyard with shed and slave quarters to a garden with roses and three colonnades there was a fountain in the centre and couches had been arranged on a clear space of gravel amidst the rose bushes they were not quite in bloom but the buds were formed you are in luck kinon said as they looked at his garden the roses will bloom tomorrow or the next day how long will you stay having sworn the guest oath satyrus was now the centre of their hosts attention he looked at philokles who made a small sign with his hands just long enough to see the roses satyrus said with a smile kinon smiled back a little too warmly and satyrus wondered if he had sent the wrong message to the man i think we could all do with a bath philokles said goddess kinon was genuinely shocked ive been remiss did you ride all the way here theron spoke up we came on a merchantman from up the coast he said kinon exchanged a glance with his steward and satyrus wondered what it meant is that draco shortlegs from sinope philokles nodded the very one may i bore you with another question i crave news speak to me sir may i call you philokles you may if all your wine is as good as what you just served us well be great friends have you heard of our friend diodorus the captain of mercenaries who on the euxine does not know the man indeed i just sent him fifty new boeotian helmets made to his order in our shops kinon nodded hes more than just a soldier hes a good man of business and his wife is a delight philokles laughed for the first time in days sappho he shook his head she is superb diodorus had defied convention and married a hetaira the situation was more complicated than that sappho had started her life as a respectable woman of thebes and only when the city was sacked had she been sold into harlotry diodorus loved her and made her his wife in fact hed gone farther taking her into society with the same boldness with which he led a cavalry charge and sappho herself was intelligent direct and plainspoken in a way that most women were not younger she had been a beauty now she was a mother of two daughters and she could still turn heads at a symposium i think well be good friends philokles said if only we might have a bath an hour later they were back in the rose garden satyrus was as clean as hed been since the temple of herakles and melitta wore an ionic chiton long and flowing and pinned with a set of motherofpearl brooches cut like nereids kinon eyed her critically i purchased it for kallista he said but when i heard your brother speak of your ancestry i though that you had to wear it melitta looked at him gravely has anyone ever told you that you are very like odysseus for wisdom she said kinon laughed ah flattery how i love it that was well said mistress he waved at the couches will you recline mistress melitta shook her head a chair i fear host i lack the experience to control my garments at a feast and i would not stain kallistas dress for anything she smiled at the slave girl yours now mistress kinon said i would not lend a guest a garment melitta blushed the linen and the pins were worth more than everything she currently owned thanks she stammered kinon arranged her chair himself and pulled kallista by the hand will you wait on the young mistress my beauty he asked as if she were a member of the family raising his eyes to his guests he said i do not treat her as a slave in the privacy of my garden theron shrugged i could rest my eyes on her for ever he said satyrus would have liked to have said that he settled for a nod philokles laughed this is the effect of leon he said a little too loudly he had been drinking for an hour kinon settled on to the couch opposite the spartan you understand philokles smiled i am a spartan bastard he said i understand all too well theron took wine from a slave and leaned on his elbow i would like to understand he said kinon nodded leon began as a free man and was made a slave when he became free he determined to free more men and women we call them our families he grinned selfconsciously i am not likely to have any other kind of family he said i was a slave theban philokles asked ahh the boeotian accent philokles nodded and your respect for sappho yes i knew her before kinon shrugged slavery is neither the beginning nor the end of life but leon made me free and put me in a position to become as rich as i am he shrugged i will give the same gift to kallista when she is old enough to find a husband and not a brothel philokles spilled a libation on the gravel to freedom he said and slipped the krater on to the back of his hand he drank the bowl dry and flipped the leavings across the garden with a practised flick of the wrist so that the drops of wine rang as they struck the bronze slops urn to freedom echoed all the other diners more drops of wine crossed the roses but no one else hit the urn youre good kinon said i spend a lot of time practising philokles said his voice light melitta leaned across her brother and whispered in his ear kinon is flirting with philokles she said hush satyrus said shocked he saw the slight smile on kallistas face and he blushed and she blushed their eyes were locked and he had to make himself look away his sister glanced back and forth between her brother and the slave girl she shook her head brother she hissed he hung his head their mother had strict rules about servant girls and boys theron and philokles talked with kinon long into the night at some point between wine and shared anecdotes philokles stopped hiding their situation and kinon expressed immediate sympathy they began to map out how the twins could travel either to athens where satyrus owned property that was untouchable by eumeles of pantecapaeum or to diodorus who was it appeared in the field with the army of eumenes the cardian philokles was sober enough when it came to politics but theron who had drunk less finally shook his head i think i need to hear all that again he said pleasantly enough kinon looked at theron as if he was a fool satyrus sat forward please he said i too would like to understand its all been the same since the conqueror died kinon said bitterly alexander conquered well damn near everything he took a drink tried to hit the bronze urn with his dregs and failed theron took the bowl kinon shrugged at his own failure when alexander died he left chaos in macedon antipater was regent for alexander yes and throughout the old persian empire dariuss empire alexander had left satraps petty kings who ruled over wide areas some were the old persian satraps some were greeks or macedonians the system depended on a strong hand on the reins and alexanders hand was very strong theron took the bowl and drank the whole of it rolled it on his wrist and his flick caught kallista on the top of her hair she leaped from her couch and tossed water back at him and they all laughed it took time to settle down again satyrus couldnt help but notice how transparent her linen was when wet shall i go on kinon asked please satyrus said it was his turn with the bowl he sipped carefully so the army met in council all the spearmen and all the cavalry and all the officers and none of the persians or auxiliaries trust me that will make trouble in time at any rate alexander left no heir no one who could run his empire he has two children one by roxane and another byblow by a persian noblewoman some say shes a common harlot others that she is a princess kinon looked around because philokles was smiling you know her nothing common about her philokles said with a smile shes remarkable at any rate the army vote to hand the empire to alexanders brother the halfwit but he cant rule himself much less the world and there are rumours still that antipater was about to revolt anyway that eumenes and seleucus were about to divide up the world anyway there are ten thousand rumours the fact is alexander died and there was no one in charge so all of his generals decided to fight over the empire perdikkas had the army he had been alexanders top soldier at the moment of the conquerors death but antipater had the macedonian army the army that had been kept home the army that defeated the spartans philokles said only needed odds of five to one useless fucks satyrus was done drinking hed been careful and consumed the whole cup without spilling a drop he laid the cup along his arm as philokles did and he snapped it forward and the handle broke the cup smashed on the marble floor his sister gave him the look reserved for siblings who behave like idiots and kallista burst out laughing slaves hurried to clean up the mess philokles roared good shot boy only next time hold the rim not the handle kinon laughed like a good host another cup pais he called to the slave nearest the door bring a metal one theron added satyrus squirmed melitta decided to rescue him so antipater had an army and perdikkas had an army kinon nodded a sober young lady antipater had macedon and perdikkas had the rest so it appeared but one of alexanders generals the best of them philokles put in i must agree kinon said with a civil inclination of his head a new cup appeared and was handed to philokles ptolemy had taken aegypt as his satrapy he had a large macedonian garrison and he began to recruit mercenaries like uncle diodorus satyrus said just like philokles nodded and sipped wine so perdikkas decided to defeat ptolemy first and take aegypt to provide money and grain for his army which had been alexanders army kinon looked at satyrus still with me of course satyrus said and perdikkas failed got beaten and was murdered by his officers no one ever called macedonians civilized philokles said now antigonus has the army that used to belong to perdikkas except for the part that eumenes the cardian has antigonus means to unseat ptolemy ptolemy the least harmful of the lot and a good friend to heraklea perhaps antigonus will lose philokles said i know ptolemy hes a subtle man you know him kinon laughed again he was drunk now i am in the company of the great philokles finished the cup flicked his wrist and his wine drop scored on the bronze rim of the urn like a bell tolling i know him pretty well he said i took him prisoner once he laughed and kinon looked shocked melitta nodded its true and my father and philokles released him theyre guestfriends i think right thats right philokles said thats why diodorus is a little more than just a mercenary to ptolemy kinon shook his head you took him prisoner in a battle next youll be telling me that you knew alexander my father did satyrus said but please go on perdikkas is dead and antigonus oneeye has his army exactly kinon got the bowl and balanced it expertly while talking antigonus has the whole field army behind him and ptolemy wont get another miracle in the delta he has no soldiers to speak of now just some military settlers and some useless aegyptians he wont last the season ill miss him hes the only one of those macedonian fucks who wants to build something instead of just killing as he drank his boeotian accent got thicker and now he sounded like a character in a comedy philokles shrugged and eumenes is left with the rump less than the rump although hes wily antipater had him once and he escaped kinon snapped his fingers for more drink by this point he had kallista sitting on a stool beneath his couch and he played with her hair while he spoke melitta had already excused herself like an athenian matron philokles laughed again i remember his wiles he said he and kineas chased each other all over bactria kinon sighed and then theres greece of course now that antipater is gone and we had polyperchon as a replacement too old and not smart enough to live athens made a bid for independence back oh six years or so they defeated antipaters army and frankly they looked to overthrow the whole system that united all the macedonians for a while philokles shrugged and kineass old friend leosthenes died kinon looked knowing died or got very sick and slipped away when the whole alliance started coming apart there are people who claim to have seen him but the chaos that he caused in thrace and greece is why oneeye has time to move against ptolemy because polyperchon is still rebuilding the athenians showed that the macedonians could be beaten and theres a new man on the stage antipaters son cassander hes a different matter bad to the bone that one smart like a lion and rotten like an old corpse theron shook his head i paid no mind to politics when i was at corinth it wearies me friends and all of you know these men these great men like fellow guests at a symposium im going to retire friends secure in the knowledge that the only people of consequence i know are athletes and none of them is much of an adornment at a dinner party when he rose he gave satyrus a long look satyrus got the message i thank you for hospitality and good talk wisdom and beauty he slipped the last in with a look at kallista kinon nodded tomorrow well have a look at the agora perhaps the palaestra theron asked of course the host patted his stomach i may remember the way there and with that laugh satyrus stumbled off to bed he managed to make it to the couch in his room and then his wits turned off like a snuffed lamp in the morning they threatened to stay off melitta came to wake him prodding him under the ribs with her thumbs and tickling his feet until his groans turned to counterattacks she giggled backing away from his couch and he discovered that he had a splitting headache time to get up sleepyhead she said oh he said clutching his temples an older slave heavy with muscle and black as an athenian vase came in and began to tidy his chamber satyrus wanted to get off his couch but he couldnt quite make himself do it could you fetch us some water melitta said youre twelve satyr not twenty you drank far too much wine last night i dont think it was the wine satyrus said plaintively i think ive hurt my head or caught a cold the black slave snorted he was only gone for a few moments and then he returned with a silver pitcher of water and a bronze cup drink up master he said with a grin satyrus raised his head why are you smiling my head hurts drink all the water in this pitcher the slave said ill get you another when you are done then your headache will cure itself i promise satyrus managed to drink down two pitchers of water and then he and melitta made their way out into the rose garden where all the guests were reclining melitta watched him with a superior smile more wine brother she asked hard head boy philokles asked worst age for a male satyrus at twelve you are invited to behave like a man but you cant best be wary of the wine theron raised an eyebrow at the spartan and the two men glowered at each other for a bit advice everyone could heed a young male slave came in sheathed in sweat with a scroll kinon took it and opened it his eyes scanning the page and he frowned i asked our tyrant dionysius to grant us all an audience he rolled the scroll and scratched his chin with it he has declined the honour saying that the time for meeting is inauspicious which is a load of mule dung and no mistake he handed the scroll to the same black slave who had waited on satyrus after he awoke zosimos have this scraped clean and put in the stack zosimos took the scroll and vanished through the pillars of the colonnade kinon glanced around pulled out a gold toothpick and went to work on his teeth satyrus looked away a female slave offered him wine and he hastily put his hand over his cup might i have some more water he implored her she went to a sideboard and returned with a gleaming silver pitcher and a slight smile he accepted both gratefully something is amiss kinon said nonetheless im sending to diodorus by courier so that he is warned of your circumstances ill send a caravan with the armour three days at the least im afraid what do you need philokles leaned forward clothes weapons remounts some cash kinon i am merely being candid pardon my bluntness kinon shook his head no need to apologize i am rich and my friend leon could buy and sell twenty of me and together your burden isnt a flyspeck arms and armour are easy we make them why dont i have zosimos take you to the shop none of the gear will be silver chased or inlaid but it is all solid and workmanlike take what you need or have zosimos order it with our smith he rubbed his chin i dont like the fact that the tyrant wont see you he looked around where is tenedos one of the female slaves darted into the colonnade and tenedos the steward emerged chewing on a stylus master he asked very much in the tone of a man annoyed to be interrupted what shipping came in today tenedos kinon asked tenedos took a breath and satyrus thought that he hesitated pentekonter from tomis laden with wine property of isokles of tomis merchantman from athens laden with pottery and fine woollens and some copper property of a mixed cartel of athenian merchants and some of our friends the copper is ours military trireme no lading kinon sat up and swung his legs over the side of his couch from pantecapaeum he asked by way of gorgippia and bata if the oar master is to be believed tenedos tucked his stylus behind his ear philokles swung his legs over the edge of his couch ares he said he sounded tired kinon shook his head this is heraklea not some grain town on the north shore of the euxine we have laws here and a good ruler even if he is a tyrant but theyve got to him tenedos i should have told you now i am telling you i wish to know anything you learn of this ship of its master and its navarch and who they visit understand yes master tenedos said sounding both competent and longsuffering philokles nodded if you will lend me young zosimos i will see to some armour he looked at satyrus fancy some armour and a light sword boy satyrus was off his couch headache forgotten before philokles was done speaking as would i melitta said were not on the sea of grass now philokles said will that render me safe from assault she asked as a woman kinon started and then reconsidered the code of war said that women were exempt from the rigours and results but no one fought by the code any more the spartans and the athenians had killed the code in their thirtyyear war almost a hundred years before women caught with a defeated army were sold into slavery ill come with you she insisted theron rolled off his couch ill come too philokles raised an eyebrow we wont be able to pay you for a long time athlete i honour you for your loyalty but shouldnt you be finding a new employer theron gave a wry smile so anxious to be rid of me i thought that id get myself a free suit of bronze that will pay my fees for some months kinon laughed i hadnt thought what taking in a pair of princes would be like of course tutors and trainers well need a sophist philokles shook his head ive got that covered he said kinon laughed heartily now ive seen everything he said a spartan sophist philokles returned a twisted smile just so when i cant convince a man i kill him they had to walk all the way through the landward gate called the sinope gate by the locals from stonecobbled streets to gravel roads and then to heavily rutted dirt and mud the armour smiths place was a dozen stades outside of town and they went far enough to get a good picture of the life of the local helots satyrus walked next to philokles that ship from tomis he said philokles eyes flickered over the fields and the bent figures working them i was thinking more of the trireme what about it satyrus shrugged wasnt isokles a good friend of my fathers he asked wed be safe there philokles nodded and tugged his beard i hadnt given that thought you may have a point we could probably secure passage on his ship but what then across thrace to athens satyrus said right across cassanders territory philokles asked does that seem wise satyrus let his shoulders droop oh he said the armour smith had a circle of houses almost like a small village and a dozen sheds each more illbuilt than the last and a slave barracks in the middle surrounded by a fence a stream flowed through the middle of the facility and it stank of human waste and ash the road outside the gate was a cratered ruin from heavy cartage and there was a dead donkey at the bottom of one of the worst pits its body bloated and stinking satyrus was shocked and he wrinkled his nose in disgust theron smiled you thought that armour and weapons were made in forest glades by hephaestos and his mortal helpers or inside volcanoes perhaps melitta looked at the devastation of ten forges and all the support the forges required as she watched a string of donkeys perhaps fifty of them were driven past every donkey had a pair of woven basket panniers and each one was full of charcoal the drovers were careful to leave the road and get the whole string around the deep potholes where the dead donkey rotted by the lame smith she said this is an assault on gaia this is like impiety theron shook his head this is a goodsized commercial forge mistress he shrugged over there he said pointing at the mountains that stood like a wall on the southern horizon is bithynia and paphlagonia there is a war there armies of twenty thousand men and every man must have a sword a spear and a helmet at least he looked at the twins we have manufactories in boeotia and in corinth this one isnt bad its just a dead animal wait until you see a battlefield philokles said the factor of the armour factory was a chalcidian freedman his face was red and his arms and legs and chiton were covered in burns and he had no hair at all zosimos he said a pleasure his voice belied his words but he gave the black man a quick smile at the end to pull the barb zosimos bowed and flashed a smile in return eutropios i greet you and i bring you the greetings of my master kinon he asks that these men friends of his and of master leon zosimos said this with a significant look receive whatever armour they might need and weapons eutropios put his hands on his hips he had the muscles of herakles in fact his upper physique was a match for therons i thought he was too well dressed to be a new smith for me he said looking at theron i hoped though listen tell your master from me that if he wants this big order to go out before the mounikhion he had best not be sending me any new orders if these gentlemen and eutropios bowed without much courtesy take armour from the order im that much worse off philokles dismounted from his horse pulled his straw hat off his head and offered his arm to clasp im philokles of tanais he said this is theron of corinth who fought the pankration last year at the olympics eutropios nodded the corners of his mouth turned down in appreciation so ive heard of you and you he said to philokles youre the warrior philokles shrugged im a philosopher now he said and the tutor to these children satyrus writhed at being called a child in the presence of a master weapon smith and who needs arms the smith asked oh get down from your mounts believe me i have nothing better to do than to talk to olympic athletes he turned his back on them and started walking im sure youll want to see the workshops zosimos worked for me he can show you anything i need arms as does theron and for the young ones men are trying to kill them philokles voice changed pardon sir if we have interrupted your work but i have known a number of craftsmen and all of them work flat out there is never a good time to visit true please aid us we will not require a tour or much of your time a few workmanlike items and well be out of your hair eutropios turned back to philokles i have no hair he said you fight spartanstyle or macedonian he asked spartan philokles said with an aspis not one of these little macedonian shields now thats lucky for you because i have some made up no one wants them any more except some of the cities up north hoplite panoply i have two or three to hand from an order that never sold cavalry equipment dont even ask everyone is a horse soldier now soon enough there wont even be any hoplites no one wants to do any work any more everyone wants to ride a fucking horse the chalcidian grinned sourly he led them to a heavily built stone house that held up sheds at both ends the door was sealed shut he took a curious tool from his belt and twisted the seal wire and opened the door for them satyrus gasped the room was a veritable treasury of ares bronze helmets bronzefaced shields and rows of swords most with a light coat of rust on them straightbladed and leafbladed and bentbladed of every size spears stood against the wall their blades dark with rust their bronze sauroteres or buttspikes brown or green with patina all built for the tyrants guard but now he has them aping the macedonians he said the swords are good he said as he plucked a short kopis from the floor and wiped the surface rust off on his chiton good work from home i bought this lot from a pirate the shipment was for aegypt saves me time to have a store of them philokles nodded no scabbards he said do i look like a scabbard maker the smith asked hephaestos protect me are you expecting to be offered wine ares and aphrodite zosimos will you fetch these fine gentlemen some wine while they look at my wares and ask for fucking scabbards theron picked up a longer kopis made in the western style with a birdshaped hilt it was a heavy weapon he swung it without much effort sure you wouldnt like to do a little smithing boy the smith asked shoulders like that you wont have to worry about someone trying to kill you in the olympics ill make you rich he laughed hermes im already rich but i cant spend it because i cant stop working he needs temerix satyrus said to melitta she smiled at him and then both of them realized that their friend the sindi master smith of tanais might well be dead or a slave with his eastern wife and their three sons playmates all life would seem exciting for an hour and then something would happen to remind them satyrus wiped his eyes and stood straight temerix is the toughest man i know he said he would survive and lu is too clever to be attacked melitta shook her head and ataelus he must be dead he was with mama she wiped her eyes looked around the room and spotted a small helmet with cheekpieces on the stack of helmets mostly unrimmed pylos helmets and a couple of boeotians she pulled it on and it went down over her eyes philokles lifted it off her head the bowl fitting in the palm of one of his great hands and replaced it rocking it gently on her hair not bad he said well make you an arming cap he reached into the pile and pulled out a small helmet with a bowl like a loaf of bread try that he said to satyrus satyrus wanted to look like achilles and not like some cheap foot soldier this was a plain boeotian with a simple rim and no cheekpieces and no crest he put it on his head and it sank past his temples but it only needed padding and a helmet of his own was better than no helmet fits he told philokles he went to the rows of swords and came up with a short leafbladed weapon the length of his forearm philokles approved despite the fact that the blade was redbrown with rust just a little work the smith said you suited then he seemed to relent relaxing visibly you want to see the forge he said to satyrus he wrinkled his nose at melitta not much for a girl to see melitta made him laugh by wrinkling her nose back you need to get to know a better class of girl she shot back lets go theron and philokles declined they were trying shields so the children followed zosimos and eutropios out into the smokefilled air and then into the largest shed built of upright roughsawn boards on poles driven deep into the ground the sound was loud outside the shed but inside it was almost overwhelming satyrus and melitta had seen temerix at work his hammer ringing on his bronze anvil or his iron one and theyd seen him work with one of his journeymen curti or pardo the hammers banging in turns but this was ten anvils in a circle around a furnace whose heat struck them like fists as they entered and the hammer blows rang like continuous thunder on a hot summer day every smith in the shed was working bronze building helmets working them up from shaped trays that were probably made in another shed working on the bowls and turning the whole helmet slightly after each blow every smith had a helper and some had two and the pieces were constantly being reheated in the furnace before coming back to the smiths on top of the high furnace at the centre of the room a bronze cauldron bubbled away adding steam to the smoke the twins stood amazed individual workers stopped drinking cool water from pottery canteens hanging on the walls or watered wine from skins or a hot drink from the bronze cauldron on top of the furnace or rubbing their hands or putting olive oil on a burn but the shed continued to work as a whole the ringing of hammers never ending eutropios watched with pride were working a big order he shouted i love it when every hammer is working he gave them a smile at the sound of the master smiths voice many men stopped working and looked at him so he had to wave them all back to work guests he shouted some of the smiths laughed are they slaves melitta asked hard to say eutropios said slaves dont always make the best craftsmen young lady most of those men werent born free some are working off their freedom and others are taking a wage none of them are getting the same wage theyd make if they had their own forge he shrugged every few months a couple wander off to start a business and i need more i eat smiths like my forges eat charcoal he waved at the boys running water back and forth or carrying nets of charcoal the boys are mostly slaves i use em until kinon finds them a buyer its hard work but good food and all they can eat they go to market well fed and well muscled melitta chewed her lip my sister has taken against slavery satyrus said in disgust when you said we could end up slaves it made me think what about that girl kallista im pretty melitta said in disgust men would look at me the way you all look at her eutropios laughed lady that will happen anyway he said let me be a good host come this way he led the way to another shed where two men worked on long wooden benches while half a dozen younger men held things whitesmiths eutropios said finishers see what theyre making they were finishing small blades knives shaped like swords but made the size of meat knives look at them no black on them any more see what klopi here he has the knack see what hes got the blade shines like a mirror people pay money for hilts in bronze and gold but it is the bladework and the finishing that costs the money to make and a polish like this wont rust he swatted klopi on the back nice work master work in fact come and see me tonight he looked at the other blade not bad klopi help him finish and show him how you got that deep lustre when they emerged from the sheds theron and philokles had a mule with panniers loaded with bronze and iron we have a good deal of work to do ourselves philokles said they spent the ride back to heraklea babbling like the children they were while their tutors made plans no sooner were they back in the courtyard of kinons house than philokles set to work borrowing labour from the house staff he sent zosimos out to find a leatherworker to make scabbards and belts and straps for the corslets and he started with the shields ripping the old leather backing off melitta and satyrus were handed jars of rancid oil and scraps of linen and powdered pumice they enthusiastically rubbed the surface rust off the blades of the swords helped by various slaves who knew how to use the tools at hand in minutes they were red to their elbows with rust kinon came out into the working courtyard dressed in an elegant chiton and with a heavy cloak over his left shoulder he glanced around if hes fobbed you off with a lot of old stuff i think were entirely satisfied philokles said a little work wont hurt any of us he said with a glance at the twins satyrus agreed it felt good to be dirty good to be doing something he enjoyed the slow progress of his work watching the red fall away from the steel and then the rhythmic effort would widen the bright spot there was a lesson there he thought melitta began to hum to herself as she worked a sakje song about drinking wine satyrus started to sing the words and then they were both singing kinon nodded i have an appointment he said tenedos is out listening for news ill see you at dinner he added he stopped in the gate where zosimos was entering with a leatherworker the mans trade obvious from his apron and knife im reminded of my father he said looking around this was the way our courtyard would be when he made ready for war and all his clients and friends gathered to fix their kit philokles raised his head satyrus followed his glance and saw tears on the thebans face and he went back to singing dinner was just as good as the first night and satyrus gazed on kallista until his devotion was obvious to everyone there but he couldnt keep his eyes open and fell asleep on his couch to his own acute embarrassment melitta stayed up later listening to the older men make plans and watching the complexities of the interplay between the men friendship was growing between philokles and theron and something similar between philokles and kinon but kinon and theron didnt seem to be getting along she watched them carefully after the wine began to circulate quickly and the slaves were sent to bed kallista came and stood beside her may i share your couch she asked melitta moved aside and the older girl lay down melitta put an arm around her and they snuggled against each other i havent been dismissed but kinon wont want me listening the beautiful girl said hes flirting with the spartan why dont they just say what they want melitta peeked over the back of her couch the men had forgotten them altogether they were laughing in the way that melitta associated with jokes about sex or women in that respect sakje men and greek men were little different philokles doesnt know what he wants she said my master wants him kallista said melitta held her breath a moment i thought that that is to say it seemed oh dear i thought that he loved you kallista laughed first mistress im a slave he can have me when he pleases or send me to pleasure his guests ive done all that but no in this house ive never been asked to oblige my master in any way except to wait at table i am an adornment much like the silver pitchers oh melitta said do youis it better than obliging kallista laughed how old are you mistress twelve melitta said ive had men since i was eleven kallista said sometimes its nice sometimes its big drunk men who want me on their cocks in the middle of a party she shrugged turned away so that melitta couldnt see her face but ive never kindled aphrodite be thanked and kinon hasnt pushed me at a man since i went into this house perhaps my hymen will grow back she said she rolled over carefully so that the couch didnt make a noise have you had a man melitta felt herself blush no she said it all looks silly the older girl chuckled you dont know the half of it and your brother has he the girl pulled her a little closer melitta felt an alarm bell begin to ring softly in her head why do you ask she said no reason kallista replied hes pretty enough for his age men would want him girls too melitta thought about that for a moment i dont think hes given it much thought she said kallista stiffened then rolled away again she lay with her back to melitta for a little and then rolled to her feet that must be nice she said bitterly and vanished into the darkness melitta lay by herself for a moment and then followed the other girl she could hear the sound of her feet on the colonnade and she tracked her the older girl was crying very softly melitta caught up with her at the entrance to a dark room by the simple expedient of running a few steps and grabbing her shoulder im stupid sometimes melitta said the older girl collapsed in her arms sobbing her sobs were very quiet melitta realized that when you were a slave you didnt even own your sobs hey melitta said she came from a family without a great deal of patience for tears im sorry kallista put her head on melittas shoulder then she started kissing the nape of melittas neck melitta froze for a moment and then wriggled out of the other girls embrace with all the skills that her brother had taught her hey she said again the sound of her voice threatening to get louder if required oh kallista said i thought aphrodite melitta said id like to be friends kallista said do you always chew on your friends melitta asked its fun the older girl breathed listen kallista melitta said stretching a hand out i ride with the spearmaidens in the summer i know what girls do she shrugged maybe we can be friends she pushed away from the column at her back but not lovers im twelve not five i know how all that works do you the beautiful girl asked and melitta caught the derision well melitta admitted probably not kallista squeezed her hand melitta felt a flutter of something like a flush that spread from her chest to her groin she let go of kallistas hand and fled for her room leaving kallista laughing or crying behind her but she didnt get to sleep quickly kallista was on her mind when she awoke and as soon as she bathed she walked around to her brothers room where he was stretching as if for the palaestra you look better she said he shrugged comes and goes he said you the same she sat on his sleeping couch you have a thing for kallista she said accusingly that got her brother to grin i do he said just like our lady mother promised all the feeling in the world as if she was the only woman who had ever lived aphrodite incarnate he spoke with selfmockery because their mother had lectured them so often on the perils of young love and the intrigues of sex then he sat down next to her and they embraced both thinking of their mother maybe mama is all right melitta said satyrus held her more tightly and she hugged him back kallista made a pass at me last night melitta said satyrus stiffened and then sat back oh he said she asked me about you melitta said i rather like her its nice having a girl to talk to but theres another face to her something else when she asked about you she sounded greedy satyrus got up and went back to doing his pankration guard positions oh i understand he said with my wellknown riches she thinks ill make a good client i think ive seen the play yes melitta said i think thats just how she sees you she was sorry to inflict pain on her brother but she saw her shaft sink into him she promised her mother alive or dead that shed fill that role whenever she had to somebody in the family had to be tough and she wasnt letting her brother get taken by a hetaira no matter how lovely it made her feel better ouch satyrus said he faked a kick with his left leg and then struck with his left hand but in a flare of anger he misjudged his distance and his hand hit the plastered wall dust flew and he cursed holding his hand under his right armpit fuck he said satyr his sister admonished i feel like an idiot he said ill withhold the obvious comment she said lets go and eat i need to get out of this house satyrus said wine one night and slave girls the next save my virtue lita im doing my best she said werent you tempted by her though he asked he put his hand in the water pitcher no she lied they walked out together to breakfast pancakes and honey with sesame seeds they both ate all they were offered and then had to bathe again because they were so sticky philokles laughed at them and melitta laughed at herself because for all her wisdom and she offered prayer and libation to athena for her help the night before she was still a little girl who ate too many pancakes by midmorning they were in the business courtyard again cleaning helmets under therons exacting direction philokles had a pile of horsehair while they worked philokles went over his plan tomorrow or the next day well go south he said theron will go as the captain of the escort and i will go with him you are just two noble children travelling under our charge well be travelling through a war i hope that we dont have to do it for long theron shook his head why dont we just take a ship for athens philokles spoke quietly tenedos says that the marines from the trireme are watching the waterfront i think they want us to take ship so that they can catch us out on the sea he looked at satyrus thats a firm no on the subject of going to isokles satyrus ground away at the greenbrown patina on the helmet he was cleaning for the time it took to think his way through the whole hymn to athena then he said how long will they hunt us philokles grunted for ever he said until you go back and kill them and make yourself king thats the way of it his eyes met satyruss and satyrus felt as if he was being asked a particularly hard philosophical question satyrus looked away philokles seemed to be accusing him of something of being afraid afraid to stand up for his rights or something im tired of worrying he said theron shook his head satyrus the worrying has just begun he looked as if he meant to say more but zosimos came through the gate he made his way through the armour and stood between the twins he gave them a showy bow master eutropios sends you these he said he held out a small bundle wrapped in linen he apologizes that they do not have scabbards inside the bundle were the two heavy knives or very small swords that they had seen the whitesmiths polishing the day before now they gleamed like water and had hilts of steel and bone philokles reached out may i he asked melitta handed him hers please she said although she loved hers from the first touch very nice he said somewhere between an eating knife and a short sword he handed it back zosimos would you be kind enough to take them around to the leatherworking fellow satyrus stood can you carry my deep thanks and those of my sister to the smith zosimos smiled sure he grinned again there were now two armed slaves on the courtyard gate all the time they opened the gate for zosimos to go out and tenedos came in he glared at them and went off towards the slave quarters i thought he was buying us remounts theron asked after the man was gone i think he disapproves of us philokles said by late afternoon the twins were barely able to keep polishing for sheer fatigue theron had given both of them a workout in the garden and philokles had given them a lesson in swordplay on the hard earth of the yard basic stuff and so much like pankration that all the footwork was the same and most of the attacks and then theyd been put back to work but satyrus raised his head to see zosimos come into the yard past the armed slaves the smith is delighted that you are so pleased he said but you can give your compliments in person the caravan will form up at the factory we will leave in two days so you should come out tomorrow evening and spend the night thanks for your help zosimos philokles said zosimos nodded ill be coming with you im to accompany the caravan out and back and then im free he grinned except for all the legal parts then what theron asked i think ill try being a smith the young man said master eutropios has been offering to train me for years well since my shoulders got big anyway he went away smiling the equipment in the courtyard was finished to philokles exacting requirements the edged weapons polished and sharp the wood shafts of the spears oiled the heads ground and the buttspikes gleaming like gold he packed the helmets in leather bags put covers on the shields and pulled the cross belt of his sword over his head theron did the same they fitted and the scabbards were careful work leather over wood with bronze fittings the twins knives had the same mounts and they put them on proudly i suspect youre the only greek woman in heraklea with her own xiphos theron said hail to you greyeyed goddess he put a helmet on her head stop clowning around philokles said i wish we could ride out to the factory right now and miss another dinner with kinon theron said somewhat waspishly satyrus thought philokles gave him a long look you are a man of virtue theron theron blushed because you are a man of virtue i have to say that some of your insinuations are womanish and unbecoming philokles when sober was quite imposing theron frowned philokles you too are a man of virtue but you drink too much and lose that authority which would be yours by right the authority to tell me that im womanish for instance the two men were standing how much i drink is between me and the gods corinthian keep your views to yourself philokles hands bunched into fists fine words from you spartan but then spartans were always better at dishing it out than at taking it the corinthian stepped up to philokles philokles moved forward eye to eye with the athlete stop it melitta said stop it have you forgotten that there are people in this city who seek to kill us she rose to her feet and looked around im going to have a bath she said i recommend that you men do the same she marched out of the courtyard like a queen satyrus busied himself with the last spot of verdigris on his own small helmet and wished that he was as brave and regal as his sister theron glanced at philokles she told us eh philokles nodded youve heard of kineas theron nodded now youve met him that was him in his daughter philokles poured a cup of rough wine from a skin that hung on the wall and spilled a libation on the ground heres to the shade of kineas and to his children and to friendship with you theron philokles drank theron took the horn cup he looked at satyrus is it hard having a hero and a demigod as a father he gave the boy a smile my father was a fisherman sometimes that is the easier path he raised the cup to philokles poured another libation and took an orators stance to the shade of kineas who sits with heroes arimnestos and dion and timoleon ajax and achilles and all the men who shed their blood at windy ilion and to your friendship spartan which means a great deal to me whatever i say in anger and to the twins he spilled wine at each pronouncement and drank in turn then he offered it to satyrus satyrus accepted it wishing he could think of something noble to say finally he spilled a libation and said i wish i was more like my father may he be with the immortals feasting may you two be friends he took a sip smiled selfconsciously and handed it back the solemn moment was broken by the shouts of melitta in the bath she was throwing water at someone and that someone shrieked and giggled they were all bathed for dinner kinon returned from his business just a few minutes before the couches were set tuna melitta pronounced as she came in she was beautifully dressed in an ionic chiton with silver deer as brooches sakje deer made out on the sea of grass by a silversmith she lay down on the same couch as her brother kallista says were to have tuna as it is our last night satyrus looked like a prince himself in a wool chiton of white with redorange flames rising from the hem and falling from the shoulder in a repeat pattern that baffled the eye his garment pinned with gold at each shoulder you found it on your bed he asked his sister no kallista brought it to me when i finished my bath melitta was unused to reclining and she reached under her hip to smooth her dress kinon grinned i wanted both of you to have something beautiful to wear dionysius has agreed to receive you tomorrow in public after that you will be safe indeed i would hesitate to leave with the caravan you will be safer here best not spill any food on the clothes then melitta said softly philokles didnt look happy much as we enjoy your hospitality he began but kinon interrupted him leon our master has been all the way west to the pillars of herakles his business there is secret even his trip is itself a secret but i have had news today that he is safely returned to syracusa and will visit alexandria for the summer before coming here he will be here in late autumn i have sent letters to him i think that you must wait here in addition i have started the process of arranging for satyrus to speak to the assembly in athens i spoke to theogenes he sometimes represents athenian interests here he suggested that you live in his house as an athenian citizen kinon took a sip of wine i do not trust him that far he has stratokles there who is this stratokles theron asked a politician from athens kinon said just arrived two days back on a trireme from pantecapaeum he said and paused to let the import of that statement filter through he now claims to be the representative of athens here in heraklea he claims vast wealth family connections and political power kinon shrugged im not sure but he does appear the representative of athens hes busy buying every cargo of grain we have to sell and that gains him friends ive done business with him myself he is an extreme democrat the sort of man who wants to give every citizen equal power he and leon are sometimes rivals and he has the name of a killer where he goes enemies of athens die well avoid him then philokles said with a smile oh no kinon said i dont trust him but he has the ear of the tyrant demetrios of phaleron the tyrant of athens that is and demetrios was a friend of phocions and of kineas your father we need him he can get you a passage to athens and safety except that he arrived here on a trireme from pantecapaeum satyrus put in and philokles nodded ares what a rats nest i think we should stay away from this stratokles see what we can learn about him in the meantime what of macedon kinon philokles asked tell me where you are with respect to polyperchon kinon held out his cup for more wine the heavy scent of tuna in syphillium wafted in from the kitchens bowls of white cabbage in honey vinegar were put on the side tables that were positioned next to every diner ahh the crux of the matter kinon drank some wine it is not polyperchon with whom we had good relations i think you are behind on your news my friend polyperchon is deposed as regent of macedon and antipaters son cassander has the reins in his hand but behind him is that madwoman olympias alexanders insane mother that is news philokles said you said something of it just before we went to bed but what of heraklea what side is she on kinon shook his head no one is on our side perdikkas remember him the first commander when alexander died assigned us to the satrapy of phrygia and refused to accept our status as a free city despite all our years and he received all our discontents and exiles and threatened through his lieutenant eumenes the cardian to lay siege to the city then he died in aegypt murdered now antigonus has his army and he faces off against the cardian confused yet but philokles said you and leon sell weapons to the cardian no kinon said he looked over his shoulder where kallista was motioning for the slaves to bring in the tuna she was more beautiful than ever in a crossgartered chiton of dark crisp blue no he said clearly having lost the thread of what he was saying he looked away no he said for the third time we sell weapons to your diodorus who is a great captain and a good customer he serves eumenes the cardian for money and with the permission and even the support of ptolemy of aegypt we would prefer for antigonus to defeat the cardian but wed really prefer it if they went on fighting each other in phrygia and left us alone satyrus felt as if his head was spinning i dont understand he said kinon tested a finger bowl of tuna for his guests and nodded vigorously superb tell the cook shes a genius he looked back at satyrus no one can understand all of it young prince but heron at pantecapaeum is part of this game the big players want all the small players lined up or out of the game your city of tanais threatened the kingdom of the bosporus and your mother was the obvious queen of all the assagatje that makes you children the heirs of two small empires in two bodies you unite the whole north of the euxine that means gold grain sakje warriors and greeks he watched for a moment as his slaves carried the tuna around the garden showing off its size and quality before carving steaks from it and serving them on trays kinon watched it all with pride pride in his team and pride in his table the macedonians arent united antipaters death was like the end of the world for them antigonus is not antipater nor yet is cassander or olympias in charge the athenians are still powerful and they will back anyone who gets the garrison out of their city at the moment they favour cassander he shrugged i think that stratokles is working for cassander and cassander needs grain from the euxine to woo athens am i making sense to you theron looked around in confusion i heard all this every day in corinth and still it made no sense to me attica and athens eat three times as much grain as they produce kinon said men like me grow rich collecting the grain from the euxine and selling it to athens cassander needs that grain to flow to make athens happy he can accomplish this by supporting eumeles of pantecapaeum as sole king of the bosporus hence you children are in his way and need to be eliminated philokles nodded id come to the same conclusion myself kinon continued our leon is heavily invested in aegypt and the new city there at alexandria so we are willynilly allies of ptolemy that sets us against cassander and against antigonus sometimes and eumenes the cardian at other times cassander is powermad antigonus is an excellent general and a useless ruler eumenes would be a great man if he werent so addicted to proving hes a better man than any macedonian he really is the best general and the best man of the lot but is a greek and not a macedonian you can imagine what that means philokles gave a grim smile i know he said and he married one of alexanders mistresses you know that banugul she had a son by alexander although not many people know it a handsome boy named herakles melittas eyes happened to be on kallista she saw the slave girls attention fix she was listening attentively and her eyes stole off to cross with someone else someone standing behind melitta she rolled back casually tossing her arm over her brother and saw tenedos the steward standing by a sideboard with a ewer of wine he didnt seem aware of the conversation and melitta watching saw so many slaves come and go that she couldnt be sure perhaps slaves listened all the time i know banugul philokles said kinon grinned so you said last night i gather theres a lot to know leon was fulsome in her praises he continues to be her friend and loans her money and keeps track of her son even as melitta watched philokles took a gulp of wine and stared off into space lost in reminiscence next to her her brother cleared his throat i think that i understand it master kinon so cassander must be allied with heron he said he was handed a gold cup by one of the slaves and he took an appreciative sip i can see how the sides will shape up even how this will affect the euxine kinon looked at the boy with respect yes young prince that is exactly correct ive only had a few days to put this together but it appears to me that heron has offered to put the whole north of the euxine at cassanders disposal in exchange for a free hand melitta spoke quietly any news of our mother she asked i fear not kinon shook his head let us do honour to the meal and banish sad thoughts philokles said melitta leaned over so that her chin was on satyruss shoulder they think shes dead she said yes satyrus whispered the food swam before his eyes melitta put her arm around him its better if shes dead rather than a slave or worse she said we are her children and the children of kineas make your face a mask of bronze and start to think of our revenge but even as she spoke the words her voice broke satyrus sobbed first but in a moment they were crying not bold princes of the euxine but two children whose mother was probably dead they lay together weeping and the other diners avoided looking at them their sobs lasted through much of the tuna and then they dried their eyes and ate satyrus began to build himself a mask of bronze in his mind philokles new helmet had a high peak and long cheekpieces that covered his face in the front imitating a moustache and beard and a thracian hat satyrus chewed the excellent tuna and some rich salmon sauce on oysters and good thick barley bread and thought of the armoured mask and how it would cover his face hide his fear if i cannot be brave he thought i will pretend to be brave that is my duty he looked at his sister who was obviously enjoying her food pouring quantities of honey vinegar over the fish in a way the cook had never intended to suit her sweet tooth and he wondered why the gods had given her so much courage he drank several cups of wine on purpose then when the men were preparing to do some serious drinking satyrus got off his couch holding a krater he walked to the middle of the garden and the others fell silent he was nervous he was taking a chance although he couldnt see just how kinon this may be our last night as guests tonight i spill a libation to zeus master of all who loves a man who has guests and i offer libation to athena my patroness and herakles my ancestor and all the gods satyrus felt just a trace of nerves like elation the wine covered the rest hear him theron said well said philokles agreed and before all the gods i offer this oath that neither age nor weakness nor infirmity nor the number of my enemies nor any other power of the earth the heavens or the underworld will keep me keep us the twins from our revenge on anyone who ordered his mask slipped and his voice broke ordered our mothers death they will die we will rule the bosporus they will rue the day they chose to start this war philokles watched him with sad eyes alas boy such an oath once sworn carries power even now the furies listen and they move the strands of fate what joy did you just forfeit what doom have you created melitta rose and went to stand by her brother i stand beside my brother in this oath we care nothing for the consequences dear tutor we will have revenge eumeles who was heron will die upazan will die cassander of macedon will die every hand against us to the end of the game stop theron begged by the gods will you children stop before the gods punish you first melitta appeared to be filled with fire her face caught the last of the sun the deer on her arms twinkled like stars and her dress was an unearthly white we will stop for nothing she said her words sounded oracular a gust of wind swept through the garden moving the roses and making the torches flare into great gouts of flame kallista clapped her hands the gods hear you melitta she said and then looked embarrassed at her own temerity philokles glanced at theron on the next couch you sure you want to stay with these children he asked there was no irony to his question theron sighed i feel the weight of doom he said until this moment i was the son of a fisherman now you are the ally of the twins philokles said kinon shook his head swearing revenge is all very well for my rose garden he said but keep that to yourself in front of dionysius he plays this game he plays it well he outmanoeuvred alexander and he has kept us free of perdikkas and now cassander dont make him send you away because he will not harbour you if you endanger his policy what is he like philokles asked hes the fattest man youll ever meet kinon said and perhaps the most brilliant and ruthless some say he is the soul of dionysius of syracusa come again hes his brothers heir and no mistake and he is not afraid of anything theron drank his wine down for all that hes a tyrant he said im a man of corinth timoleon overthrew that dionysius of syracusa kinon looked around we do not say such things in heraklea theron shrugged you may not say such things he said i am a man of corinth the city of tyrantslayers philokles glared at the athlete perhaps we should call it the city of poor guests mmm think again theron this man has given us gifts we cannot repay and how do we return them with rudeness instead of becoming angry theron winced my apologies host philokles is correct they spoke more about politics and satyrus watched kallista as she sat by her master we should go to bed if we have to be princes for the tyrant in the morning melitta said satyrus nodded and yawned eager to be an adult and without the strength to be one bed he said kallista smiled at him and he smiled back he would never see her again it all seemed so unfair but he rose and said his goodnights and thanked kinon with his sister for his spotless hospitality which made the man smile he stumbled on the smooth marble of the colonnade and he didnt even undo the brooches on his chiton but merely peeled it over his head and handed it to yet another slave and slipped on to his sleeping couch the spring air had a touch of chill and he pulled his thracian cloak carefully cleaned by the staff over himself and he was asleep satyrus woke instantly to a sound in his room the room was dark with the doorway illuminated by the light coming from the courtyard and filtering down the colonnade something moved across the doorway and satyrus was alert his heart beating hard its just me kallista said from the middle of the room satyruss heart didnt beat any the slower although for different reasons she slid on to his couch found the thracian cloak and wriggled under it and her breasts brushed against his chest she giggled put a hand between his legs and put her mouth unerringly over his he was caught between fear excitement and an odd anger this was not the way he wanted kallista if he wanted her at all and yet he did as his erection testified she put a hand on his chest and pinched one of his nipples hard the way his nurse had done when she was angry but while the pressure was the same the result was different she took one of his hands and placed it on her breast ahhh a smoothness and softness that was almost unbelievable a sort of olympian perfection his cock leaped to attention under her smooth hand she laughed in the courtyard a man screamed alarm and there was a crash like a log hitting a wall the whole building shook aaaagghh the same voice screamed satyrus knew that scream a man with death in his guts his erection vanished and his mind moved fast and he was off the couch in the dark hand sweeping the wall until he found his sword hanging on its baldric from a peg he put the belt over his head and grabbed the cloak off the bed what in hades are you doing kallista said aaaagh the next scream was cut off suddenly and then there was another crash and a cheer a terrible sound and then running feet satyrus threw the cloak over his arm and went to the doorway brushing the curtain aside there was a man in the colonnade with a weapon he wore a helmet that glinted in the distant light of the garden and he was less than an armlength away a big shadow against the stygian dark of the corridor get some light in here the man shouted his voice filling the corridor follow me satyrus wanted to hesitate but before the fear could catch him he cut low just as philokles had shown him again and again his left hand stretched forward with the wrapped cloak to block a counterblow and the man caught his movement and his weapon came down into the wool cloak numbing his arm but his sword went behind the mans greave and as satyrus recovered he pressed the cut ripping the tendon at the back of the leg just as hed been taught the man went down in a tangle of bronze and limbs and satyrus stepped clear just as the man voiced his pain aiyyee ares gods im cut aiyyyeee ah ah ah theyre wearing armour satyrus thought and then the fear caught him and he stood paralysed he tried to open his mouth tried to call satyrus his sister shouted wake up were under attack his limbs loosed and he almost fell and then he moved clumsily stumbling like a drunkard im here he called there they are a mans voice shouted and there were torches in the colonnade light flickering off the thrashing man on the floor satyrus got past him abandoning kallista and he was beside his sister run he said where she asked him their portion of the colonnade led to a blank wall at the corner of the property in light there was a mural of more pillars painted there to give the suggestion of space ares he cursed athena aid us the men with torches came to their comrade and there was commotion and cursing hamstrung one voice said ill kill the bastard kleon will never walk again just kill everwud you fide another voice said he ripped open the curtain to the room where satyrus had slept satyrus was frozen with indecision the right thing to do was to attack them make a futile effort to save kallista he would die but it was the virtuous thing he didnt want to die he was an ungracious animal there was a crash in the dark and half the light went out satyrus crouched and pushed his sister behind him in the fitful torchlight satyrus watched theron and philokles side by side with shields on their shoulders rip into the armoured men in the doorway the men turned quickly too late for the torchbearer who went down like a sacrifice and didnt even moan his torch lit the scene from the ground sputtering and burning fitfully the attackers fought back silently they had swords and they knew how to use them philokles gave a cry and stepped back and one of the adversaries bellowed stepped forward and died on philokles sword tricked in the dark into believing hed hit his opponent satyrus got his limbs in motion and came up behind them again he went low cutting at the tendons of therons opponent the man screamed like a horse and went back straight into the boy and therons back cut with his kopis took off the top of the mans head and he collapsed on satyrus pumping gore so that satyrus was trapped against the wall shit the last man fighting said and died there must be more of them philokles panted boy are you all right philokles was looking into his sleeping chamber satyrus was trying not to puke at the warm spongy stuff all over his face im right here he managed in a squeak theron caught up the torch and thrust it in his face i thought that man went down too fast he said well cut little hoplite now get up wheres your sister watching your backs she said theres more of them in the other wing and more yet in the slave quarters i can hear them the screams from the slave quarters were harrowing several people cries from nightmare the other wing had the sound of rushing feet theron and philokles had time to turn around before they were hit by the rush theyre armed someone shouted and theron plucked up the torch and threw it over their attackers and there was no light at all or almost none just a flicker of light from the floor but the attackers were backlit and theron and philokles fought from the darkness nearly invisible satyrus was on the floor he could see their feet by the single flickering torch he reached out and flicked his wrist and the blow was light but the weight of the blade alone sliced the mans sandal and his foot and he yelped and went down then another man took his place kill theb said a voice behind the fight gods do a hab to do this myself give us some help then stratokles came a deeper voice i dont see you in the front rank theron stumbled and went down on one knee he grunted his legs straddling satyrus satyrus swung his blade as hard as he could at therons opponent who took a thrust right through the arch of his foot he gave a cry swore and the rim of his shield came down on satyruss face breaking his nose and sending him back a foot in a mist of his own blood and the metallic agony of a face wound cut back cut back satyrus knew from wrestling and pankration that the moments after taking a wound were the most dangerous and his sword slashed empty air in front of him as he writhed blind in pain on the ground and his blood fountained down his chest then it caught something a shield and his arm rang and he skinned his knuckles the pain almost lost in the pain from his nose theron powered to his feet under his shield and satyruss opponent went flying back then theron grunted and went down when a spear shaft hit his unprotected head and philokles was holding the corridor alone satyrus wiped at his face and there was another bloom of pain as he tried to stand using the wall behind him to get himself up but his nose hurt and his legs didnt want to work he got up anyway philokles was everywhere in a burst of godsent prowess and his sword was at their throats and at their knees and he forced them all back off the bodies get that archer in here called the voice that gave most of the orders a voice that sounded as if it had the worst head cold of all time like fighting fucking ares the gruff voice said charge him finish him the man in charge said charge him yourself you ballless fucking athenian a gruff voice called out you warrior we offer you life take it and go free come here and die philokles said im killing your wounded from the sounds he was doing just that whos the little fuck in the fancy helmet anyone you liked fuck you leave him too late dead now this big mule fuck you the athenian voice screamed there was a rush of feet and then an impact like stone on stone there were two men on philokles this was the longest exchange so far philokles and the two enemies hammered at each other for five blows ten blows and satyrus stabbed repeatedly at the other mens feet but they were fast and had footguards on their sandals finally gruffvoice swore and ducked back but the smaller man forced philokles back in a flurry of blows the spartan was tiring then the smaller man put his shield over one of the bodies hoisted the man took a blow from philokles on his own blade and backed up a step philokles hammered his shield satyrus lunged at his lower leg and was defeated by a heavy bronze greave the man backed away again archer he roared anyone else philokles said ill come and get you then archer the athenian screamed again fuck this the gruff voice said and there was the sound of feet moving away stand your ground the commander ordered you shoot him drop said melittas voice satyrus didnt have far to drop so he obeyed he heard the buzz of an arrow like a drone flying fast and it hit armour like a hammer on a gourd there was a thin scream and from his new vantage point back on the floor satyrus could see a pair of feet in expensive sandals stumbling then by the light of the courtyard torches he caught sight of the man a livid scar across his face he was lifting another big man over his shoulder weaving and then gone into the garden nice shot melitta philokles said the words were sane enough but the voice the dead timbre of a madman but a sober madman fighting had burned the wine out of philokles in the dark too satyrus had a hand on theron therons alive he said then that was the same man we saw on the plains south of the tanais scarface stand your ground philokles said were not done yet he sank to one knee scarface tagged me in the shin good swordsman he coughed and stood back up melitta took her brothers hand and helped him to his feet she had her bow in her hand theres fighting by the gate philokles explained more fighting they could hear it and the screams of the wounded satyrus took a deep breath and made himself rewrap the thracian cloak around his arm then he stepped forward until he was abreast of philokles here i am he said although all his ms sounded like bs like scarface good boy philokles said if they come again just keep them from wrapping my shield for as long as you can satyrus resisted the temptation to wipe his nose blood was still pouring down his chest melitta came up close behind them i have eight arrows she said thats all i had in my room im sorry i brought you here philokles said the fighting at the gate was petering out shall i shall i kill you satyrus felt his knees tremble again and cursed himself no he said ill die fighting there for once hed said what he wanted to say melitta took a deep breath i think she began hold put down your weapons came a deep voice satyrus grasped his little sword tighter i have forty swords and as many archers the voice said whoever you are i order you to put down your weapons zeus soter my lord the fuckers have killed everyone in the place said a thin rasping voice and suddenly there were lines of torches coming in under the colonnade twenty feet away a big black man in headtofoot bronze armour filled the colonnade as big as philokles he was like a man made of bronze he looked around quickly and caught site of the three armed people in the dead end you he shouted a line of armed men filled the colonnade in front of him with drilled rapidity who are you philokles voice boomed i am nestor of heraklea the commander of the guard put down your weapons or die i am philokles of sparta and these are the children of kineas and srayanka of tanais he said let me see let me through there the captain said he stepped out of the line and peered at them ares spartan you must be quite the spearman so they didnt get past you eh he stepped forward ground your weapons all of you my orders are to take you to the tyrant if you live philokles swept out an arm and pushed both of the twins behind him melitta sobbed kill me she said im too scared to do it myself i wont be a slave nestor heard her no lady stop he held up his hand and the line of his soldiers paused we did not do this a rumour came to us that you were to be attacked tonight we came in time i have two dead men in the yard you may live lady i give my word i bring you no harm but my masters orders satyrus stood naked covered in blood and afraid he looked at philokles and philokles shook his head i cannot make this choice he said i can kill men and discuss philosophy but i cannot choose it may be as he says it may be that you will leave this place to be a slave satyrus reached back and grabbed his sisters bloodslick shoulder theres no logic in it lita the tyrant doesnt need us dead you wager my life in a brothel she asked and your own a dying man gave a long moan we retain our arms satyrus called out his thin voice cracking as he called none of you comes within a sword cut of us nestor shrugged if thats what it has to be my lord satyruss eyes met melittas his eyes said i want to live so did hers not if the price is too high she said out loud i think we can do this he whispered if not ill try to kill us satyrus stepped past philokles from the dark into the torchlight there were bodies everywhere and the torchlight wasnt kind it was worse than the end of orestes i am satyrus of tanais he said he bent and wiped his blade on the cloth of a dead man nestor bowed my lord will you ares youre a child someone get a cloth the worst of it was that everyone else was dead zosimos lay by the gate hacked down with a heavy blade so that his head was askew from his trunk kinon had died in his bed but hed been pinned in his sheets and then hacked to pieces satyrus didnt see the stewards body but he saw the blood trickling down the steps of the slave quarters like water from a spring and he finally lost it spewing tuna steak and barley bread into the blood while some foreign soldier held his head if the tyrants guard wanted to enslave him he wasnt doing much to resist there laddy the soldier said gives me the fucking willies poor boy he was patted on the head let go of my brother or ill cut your hand off melitta said she was standing alone in a circle of soldiers naked and covered in blood with her akinakes in her hand philokles was sitting on a step drinking wine from a skin hermes girl im helping him the soldier stepped back fucking medea come to life get her a dress nestor said i found another live one a third soldier said he produced kallista she was shrieking with sobs uncontrolled unacted her fists pummelling at the man who held her she was not beautiful she looked like the embodiment of fury nestor addressed himself to satyrus may i get you some never mind listen boy were walking away from this im taking you to the citadel can you hear me satyrus straightened his back something i have to do first he said he walked over to the crowd of corpses where the tyrants guard had stormed the gate a torch please one of the guardsmen gave him a torch he held it high looking for a man with a scarred face he didnt find one some of them got away satyrus said nestor shrugged not unless they can fly he said have you searched the whole house satyrus asked nestor shrugged my orders are to bring you along well search tomorrow satyrus was too tired to argue lead on he said he held out a hand to philokles who got unsteadily to his feet they walked through the courtyard paved in corpses out of the gate where a thin trickle of liquid splashed out into the streets gutter and shone red in torchlight do you need to be carried nestor asked satyrus no i can walk he heard himself say as if from a distance be careful of my sister no man would touch your sister nestor said somehow they walked the stade along the twisting city streets passing twice through the walls until they came to the citadel gate nestor gave the password and sentries grounded their spears the buttspikes clashing on paving stones and then they were inside there were paintings on the walls and the floors were heated and slaves appeared with bowls of water as if from the air and then they were in a chamber as big as a rich mans house on the dais sat the fattest man hed ever seen a man as broad as he was tall he had a shock of blond hair that stood straight up and his eyes burned with intelligence under heavy brows welcome he said the twins were ushered to the space in front of him and kallista was brought to stand with them she was utterly silent her beauty extinguished in grief melitta was naked except for a soldiers cloak and her feet glistened with blood satyrus was conscious of his nudity the thracian cloak was still around his shoulders and over his left hand at some point he had sheathed his blade but his hand rested on the hilt his right ankle ached more than ached his face throbbed and his nose led the chorus of pain philokles loomed behind him still carrying an aspis and a sword the tyrant waved at a slave get my doctor he said to philokles he said you are the first armed men to enter my presence in a generation philokles seemed to be speaking from very far away i think we can accept the tyrants good intentions satyrus satyrus satyruss eyes were resting on the face of another child or perhaps a young woman whose head peeked out from behind a curtain just beyond the dais her face was like that of a nereid with an upturned nose and freckles and a cloud of dark curls their eyes met having faced death and survived satyrus had the courage to smile at the nereid she smiled back satyrus philokles sounded gravely concerned get my doctor the tyrant said standing there with a smile on his face satyrus became conscious that he was wounded his ankle hurt and there was blood coming off his shin a moist sweat on the arch of his foot when he looked down it came in little spurts that sparkled in the lamp light he watched it for a moment and then he was gone melitta thought that the worst part of the whole night was waiting to see if her brother would die it was clear from the attentions of the guards and the slaves that the tyrant had no ill intentions and so his wound became her whole focus she refused sleep drank some watered wine and watched sophokles the athenian surgeon bandage his foot after giving him something that slowed but did not stop the bleeding melitta didnt like the doctor and having heard what she had heard in the fight she distrusted all athenians when he was done wrapping the bandage the man got to his feet he rubbed the bridge of his nose will he she asked it is with the fates and the gods he said he turned to a slave there were four of them in the alcoves at the end of the room the tyrant seemed to have a great many get me wine and poppy juice he said to melitta he said you should sleep i will give you poppy and you will have rich dreams she stepped back from him i wouldnt accept it she said ill stay here until he awakes he has lost a great deal of blood girl he wont awake for a while indeed hell sleep for hours or hell die the athenian doctor shook his head i can wait she said he put on a voice he must save for women and idiots listen honey he said putting an arm on her shoulder you cant affect the outcome you need to sleep a little girl like you she rolled out from under his hand and backed against her brothers couch ive lost my mother and my kingdom and people are trying to kill me and my brother and i think ill just stay awake beside him she said dont make me he began she pulled her knife out of its sheath under her arm she adopted the stance that philokles and theron had been teaching her left arm out knife hand close to the body and low youre deranged he said she nodded perhaps she said the doctor affected patience dont make me wake your guardian girl hell be quite angry melitta met his eyes steadily theron call him she was too tired to be afraid better yet why dont you go and see to philokles theron the man with the blow to the head hell be fine the doctor was impatient girl you are interfering with my work she stood aside the knife held firmly be my guest she said ill just watch there was a chuckle from the doorway and nestor the guard captain came in his armour was off and he was just another big man now wearing a handsome chiton of tyrian purple wool let her alone athenian he said shes a titan the doctor sighed she needs to be in bed nestor chuckled again she nearly gutted one of my men girl youll get a husband faster if you wave that about less i am not waving it about this is the low guard and my hands are steady she wished she hadnt sounded quite so anxious nestor stepped fully into the room and his grin flashed in the lamplight sheathe the weapon my lady as a favour the doctor means no harm and neither do i melitta bowed my pardon she said she really was tired a chair he said to the slaves where is kallista melitta asked the other girl in the slave quarters is she yours im sorry i took for granted she was kinons shall i ask her to attend you nestor made a motion and another slave ran from the room where is philokles she asked in the next room with the other man nestor said melitta nodded when kallista comes i will go to bed she said her brother lay unmoving as pale as the aegyptian linen on which he lay his lower right leg was wrapped in bandages that were slowly becoming the colour of nestors chiton hes not going to die she said nestor met her eye good i honoured his courage he was very serious he doesnt think he has any courage melitta said nestor gave a small smile many men who appear brave suffer from the same failing he said sometimes they die trying to prove themselves brave when no one has ever questioned their courage he added thats my brother she said proudly nestor shook his head make sure you save him then he said to the doctor as if he could just order such a thing when kallista came she looked more like medusa than helen of troy her makeup smeared her eyes wild and her hair unkempt she stepped straight into melittas arms they killed everyone she said she burst into tears melitta held her while she sobbed and then started to walk her to the door take me to my room she said ill take you to the womens wing nestor said i want to be right here melitta said nestor nodded very well he said with a yawn with two slaves he took her past where philokles lay unsleeping on a couch past therons snores and into a darkened room the slaves moved about filling the pitchers with water and wine lighting lamps turning down the linens on her sleeping couch shall i make up a pallet on the floor one of the palace slaves asked if you would be so kind she replied kallista kept right on crying nestor bowed if my lady will permit i for one intend to get a few dreams through the gate of horn before the sun rises melitta returned his bow thanks for your courtesy sir she paused how long has the athenian been a doctor here nestor thought a moment not long he said why melitta bit back her answer born of fatigue and unreason she was sure no matter she said thank you for all your help nestor may the gods be with you he smiled and patted her head which she normally hated this time it was somewhat reassuring when he was gone she waved her hands at the slaves go she said they both looked at her kallista continued to sob now she said go and attend the doctor both slaves left silently she steered the other girl to the bed its my fault kallista said through her sobs melitta had suspected something like this why were you in my brothers room at kinons she asked and her voice was sharper than she meant tenedos told me to fuck him the beautiful girl sobbed i was supposed to take a lamp and leave it burning outside the room she wailed we would all be free thats what he said she looked around wildly and now theyre all dead melitta got up from the couch and went to the table where as she expected the doctors poppy juice was freshly prepared by the ewer of wine she mixed the two filled a cup and handed it to kallista listen girl she said do you want to live kallista nodded she sobbed and choked again you are my slave listen you came here with me theres no one to say otherwise right melitta called upon her dwindling reserves well talk tomorrow drink this obediently the older girl took the cup and drank good melitta said you can start by tasting my food and wine the slave girl was asleep in minutes melitta watched the darkness and blood behind her eyes until the sun rose at some point she must have slept because she woke to the bright light of a noon sun pounding through the courtyard outside and into her room for a long moment she didnt know where she was her back hurt like fire and she was in a chair kallista was snoring in her bed a breast bare in the reflected light her usual beauty restored by sleep melitta got up and found that every muscle in her body hurt she limped across the room and pulled a cloak over the slave girl then she stood in the middle of the room rubbing her hips and buttocks she stretched and remembered that her brother was dying might already be dead she was out of the door of her room flying along the row of pillars philokles rooms door was covered by a curtain of beads that dazzled in the sun and her brothers was tied back there was a slave asleep in a chair with a thracian cloak over his legs satyrus was as pale as unworked clay her hand went to her mouth and a sob escaped her she stepped up beside him reached out a hand and hesitated as long as she didnt know that he was dead the world would not end she put a hand on his forehead it was cold as ice she pulled it back as if it had been burned and another sob escaped her i should kill myself she thought im really not sure that i can deal with this the problem was as she realized immediately that she didnt want to kill herself any more than she had wanted to do so in the dark and flame of the fight but with her mother and brother both gone his chest moved the sound of his exhalation seemed to echo inside her head for some time like the west wind in the halls of olympus philokles she yelled in her joy she slept again and woke to softer evening shadows with kallista sitting by her bed fanning her mistress she said as soon as melittas eyes fluttered open kinon gifted you to me melitta said her brain was running at a high speed like a chariot rolling effortlessly on a smooth road she could see a great many things and one of them was that kallista was in as much danger as the twins themselves thats why you are mine he gifted you at dinner last night understand and you were in my room when the attack started yes mistress the other girl said there were dark smudges under kallistas eyes as if she had been punched and the whites of her eyes lacked their usual clarity but otherwise she was unaffected melitta rose on one elbow tenedos told you to go to my brothers room and leave a lamp outside yes kallista replied so that his murderers could tell what room he occupied melitta said you must believe me mistress i knew nothing of what he intended the beautiful girl shuddered you understand tenedos may still be alive he needs you dead what do you know of this stratokles melitta asked the older girl shook her head hes athenian kinon spoke of him with contempt she shrugged he wasnt one of our friends melitta nodded get some more slaves she said make up the room bring me something to wear and fetch me nestor she took one of the other girls hands stand by me and ill see you free before the year is out fuck with me and ill see you dead i swear kallista began youll do anything to survive melitta said she nodded mostly to herself i must not hold that against you let me tell you that i think you know more about this than you are telling now go she shooed the slave out of her rooms melitta shrugged into a chiton cursing the foolishness of greek female garments then she ran down the hall and looked at her brother he had a little more colour in his face and he was still asleep she watched his chest rise and fall for a while how soon will i be shouting at you for something stupid you say to hurt my feelings she said aloud how long before i slap you any time now i would think philokles said he was sitting where the slave had been sitting and shed missed him now she ran and embraced him we got off easy he said not so easily she said still hugging him true enough kinon is dead he said and zosimos whom i liked and many other men and women all of the bosporan marines marines she asked the armed men who attacked us were mostly the marines off the trireme philokles sighed whatever god told me to kill their wounded i feel like a murderer today none survived so we will never know who ordered their attack it must have been heron it was stratokles the athenian i heard him melitta stepped away from her tutor and kallista was ordered to leave a lamp burning outside my brothers door when she went to to make love to him philokles started ordered by whom tenedos the steward melitta went back to watching her brother philokles was silent for several breaths i must tell the tyrant he said how do you know that stratokles was involved he was the man kinon was going to use to get us to athens i heard him he talks like a man with a cold because of the scar across his nose i heard other men call him by name and he has my arrow in him she said proudly he may be dead in the house philokles said the tyrants bodyguard were not kind he got to his feet and melitta could see that he was as stiff as she or worse gods i am old he said you are a hero she said just a killer he said you were a hero your fathers daughter melitta caught his hand why do you never praise my brother like that she asked men dont need to be praised philokles said he is kineass son of course hes brave melitta shook her head he thinks i dont know i have only his silences to go on i think he thinks that he is a coward and that you think the same philokles grunted i was raised in a barracks he said no one praised me i survived melitta shook her head and look how little it affected you she said philokles paused for a second at the curtain as if to retort but then he thought better of it and went out kallista came with a flock of palace slaves and her room was cleaned and her bed made kallista continued a fawning devotion to her new mistress but melitta was very careful with the beautiful girl slaves brought food and kallista tasted all of it slaves turned down her bed and kallista offered to share it i like to sleep with someone mistress she said id be happy to warm your bed or more she smiled and the artful winsomeness was slightly offset by the fatigue and the desperation melitta wasnt interested on the floor please she said she lay awake until kallista began to snore softly then right hand clutching her short sword under her blanket she fell asleep her brother was awake in the morning his leg was infected but the doctor seemed unconcerned and let him hobble about on it he proved his fitness by hobbling into her room just after sunrise his nose was still red were alive he said he hugged her gathering her in his arms where she lay and she woke up slowly already happy at the sound of his voice i didnt even know i was wounded lita oh i feel so alive my muscles still hurt she said by artemis goddess of all maidens ive never been so stiff your skin has colour most of it in my nose he laughed the doctor says ill be pale for days he said im to eat all the meat i can find the tyrant is giving us a public dinner tonight philokles says that stratokles has fled the city i saw him noseless bastard as if he was a leper i think you need to slow down brother hows theron she asked throwing her legs over the side of the bed and wriggling past her brother whose eyes seemed to have strayed to kallistas body did you make love to her melitta asked her brother shrugged we started then the attack came he shivered she was ordered into your bed brother to show the attackers where you slept melitta put her fingers on his cheek remember what our mother says about slaves shell do anything to survive anything satyrus watched her then he looked at his sister and smiled his old lets go and make some trouble smile i hear everything you just said he admitted and then i look at those feet that leg he grinned i just want her kallista reached out an arm gave a snort and rolled over melitta gave her brother a mock slap shes mine now hands off yours melitta leaned close im telling everyone that kinon gifted her to me at the dinner she whispered itll keep her alive id forgotten satyrus said straightening okay shes yours can i have her when youre done he had a satyrs smile and melittas slap had some venom in it this time shed forgotten his broken nose and he sat down hard ouch he said while she cosseted him she thought thats how long it took me satyrus was stiff too and his ankle hurt like fire and his nose was two sizes too big but he was an instant favourite with the guard and he was young enough to bask in their admiration so he wandered the citadel all day looking at the armoury eating in the military barracks where the tyrant quartered his most trusted guards the guardsmen were all mercenaries some of whom had been elite soldiers under alexander hypaspists or even argyraspids with the king of macedon all seemed to be named philip or amyntas and all seemed to be fond of boys he was kissed a little too often but they said good things too and made rough jokes he refought his part of the action lying on the clean floor of the barracks hall and showing how he had cut at the feet of his attackers and they roared their appreciation thats good thinking for a boy one old veteran said get your head out of your arse philip another with a grey beard said his da beat our sorry arses over the jaxartes remember that kineas the athenian i knew your da boy youve got his head on your shoulders he was a strategos was he brave satyrus asked and then regretted the question philip rubbed his beard not brave like alexander he said dont get all soppy on me amyntas nobody was brave like the king he was afraid of nothing he was as stupid as a mule amyntas grumbled thats not courage thats tomfoolish the two veterans glared at each other to satyrus it had the sound of an old argument you remember cleitus not black cleitus who the king killed remember red cleitus in the phalanx another man with the heavy accent of macedon came in and slung his cloak on a bed he was brave he was fucking insane philip said i was there when he went over the wall at tyre and you remember how thin he was and how no matter what he ate it hurt his guts like fire sure amyntas said he said hed rather die than eat and remember what happened when antigonus got him healed he stopped fighting like he was insane he covered up like everybody else right cause of how he had a reason to live right enough whats your point you northcountry bastard philip asked huh maybe i dont have a point maybe i just like the fucking sound of my own voice eh whose little bumboy is this hes a little long in the tooth but ill be happy to keep him until his hair comes in the newcomer pinched satyruss cheek kineas the athenians son as we saved in the fight the other night put two men down hisself amyntas walked over not a bumboy fuck me the newcomer said he gave a military salute pardon me boy no harm meant none taken satyrus said stiffly the barracks was like another world scary and fun and dark and light draco the newcomer said holding out his hand satyrus he said now youve touched the hand that saved alexander on the wall philip said hah youll go far boy draco saved the king once in india didnt you darling i was just the poor sod who was next on the ladder he farted on me all the way to the top draco agreed they all laughed draco came with them later in the day when satyrus accompanied philokles to kinons house the bodies were there laid in neat orderly rows in the courtyard where they had eaten dinner and it was all satyrus could do to keep his gorge from rising but he walked up and down the rows and then came back to where draco stood with nestor thats all of them satyrus asked nestor nodded in this heat if wed missed one wed know satyrus shook his head tenedos the steward is not there nor is stratokles the athenian nor the first man i cut i saw stratokles dragging a wounded man when your lot rushed the gate talking steadied him he took a breath and the stench hit him again and against his will his gorge rose and he threw up draco stepped adroitly aside poor lad youll get over it with time draco gave him water from his canteen and he rinsed his mouth in the street and then forced himself to confront the courtyard again the smell was just as strong and so were the flies there was brown blood everywhere like a slaughterhouse or a sacrificial altar satyrus had come to see the bodies but he was also there to claim their goods before the tyrant seized what was left of the estate kinon had left no heirs and no will take whatever you want nestor said he turned to draco when young satyrus has secured his partys goods i want every one of these bodies on the wagon in the street do it yourselves then every man who was here when we stormed the place gets one pick from the mans goods rest goes to the boss clear draco nodded and winked at satyrus sounds good to me captain satyruss sandals stuck to the floor every step as he approached his quarters and there were flies everywhere he breathed carefully as he turned the corner the semidried blood was like a redbrown carpet in the sun stretching away to the door of his room he closed his eyes and took a breath and he could feel the tickle of the copper in the old blood at the back of his throat even with his eyes closed sure enough there was a lamp outside but when he bent to check it he could see that the wick was newcut it had never been lit had she forgotten there were so many layers to the puzzle that it made him feel lightheaded he could hear draco laughing with another man around the corner how do they get used to this he thought his room was better his cloaks were on the floor where hed thrown them he rolled them up collected his bags and managed to get them and his sisters gear and their new clothes and their jewellery packed and on to their horses without spewing again his right ankle and shin now hurt with every movement and he kept rubbing his nose like a fool but he forced himself to walk down the far hall where he had never gone under some paintings of men having sex with other men and into the receiving room he was looking for something to take something that would remind him of kinon draco was standing in front of a persian wallhanging whatd you take boy he asked nothing yet satyrus said sheepishly youll never make a soldier if you cant loot a house what you looking for the man asked he had a set of gold cups satyrus said he was proud of them i thought id take one for each of us i stand corrected little prince looting comes naturally to you gold cups how many draco winked ought to be six satyrus said ill take five draco winked glad to meet you he said lets look the gold cups were in the heavy chest in the pantry it was sealed draco shrugged and smashed the seal and there was a treasury of heavy plate beautifully crafted drinking ware and wine equipment draco counted out five gold cups sure you dont want the rest he said satyrus shook his head you keep it he said draco waved for another soldier thanks my lord in seconds the guardsmen were bundling the silver and gold into their cloaks satyrus took the stack of cups they nested in the bosom of his chiton he found philokles loading the horses in the stable and showed them to him ones for you satyrus said one for lita one for theron and one for kallista thats well thought young man philokles said satyrus put a hand on his arm tenedos is not in the house he said philokles nodded i saw nor all the men i put down just the marines id say its a mystery or this stratokles has allies satyrus felt better for saying it we need to get free of this place philokles shrugged that convoy of armour it wont leave for days now too many loose ends from the dead men he turned to go back for another load i agree we need a way out of this he added when he was alone in the stable satyrus wrapped the cups in a bloodsoaked towel and put them in his shoulder bag they rode up to the back of the citadel approaching by the military road that was used only by the guard and the palace servants because only the guard kept horses there was a jam at the lower gate where a train of donkeys carried game deer mostly for the evenings feast his ankle was throbbing and an odd depression had settled over him there was a man right by the gate his back was to satyrus and something about him was familiar we should go back to regular lessons tomorrow philokles said out of nowhere fine satyrus said a black cloud of infinite dimensions had replaced the joy of being alive taking the gold cups made him feel like a thief nestor was cursing the delay whats going on at the gate ill whip the fools he turned back to them and his brow cleared you are the most militant tutor ive met sir what do you teach the arts of war the spartan spat im no hoplomachos he said derisively i teach philosophy politics swordsmanship satyrus said well you seem a good teacher to me nestor said your student held his own in a fight against men in armour philokles gave satyrus that look which he associated with his tutors gentle contempt all i did was lie on the floor satyrus said nestor laughed your sister has you pegged he said satyrus sat with his ankle throbbing for as long as it took to run a stade in armour and then again somewhere in that time he had the nagging feeling that something had been forgotten by the time the column finally shuffled forward it had almost gone from his mind and then as he passed the gate it hit him philokles he said i saw tenedos with the kitchen staff at the gate are you sure philokles asked satyrus wished that his ankle didnt hurt so much pretty sure he said who is tenedos nestor asked kinons steward the twins think he was involved in the attack philokles was giving satyrus an appraising look describe him the black man demanded satyrus did his best hes balding thracian id even say he was getae his head is round like that he has a slight stoop and wispy hair how did i miss that he asked himself theres enough bald thracian slaves in this building to glut the market nestor said ill put the word out he cant be operating alone philokles said no slave would do anything to endanger his skin they went in under a fine marble arch and turned right across the courtyard for the stables satyrus rode in but philokles had to dismount to avoid hitting his head satyrus looked at their train of animals where do we put all this stuff will we still ride with the caravan philokles shook his head i dont know boy i dont know anything any more satyrus got up and gave his tutor a hug philokles stiffened for a moment and then squeezed back sorry boy things are i need a drink i dont need a drink i need to get on top of this and im not we need to get out of here satyrus said agreed philokles said what if theres somebody inside working with stratokles satyrus said then we ought to be dead already philokles said he shook his head i thought that id left all this behind i was good at this once satyrus hesitated what if theres someone inside but waiting for orders philokles stopped moving and turned to satyrus so sharply that the boy was afraid the spartan meant to hit him it had happened at least in the distant past but philokles made an odd clucking noise instead thats good thinking lad he said and now youve seen tenedos we need to be on our guard all the time philokles hailed a soldier who got them a file of slaves to carry their gear it was odd to be bringing bags of armour into the palace and the slaves didnt like the weight of the loads satyrus led the way carrying his own pack and his satchel with the bloody towel full of gold cups he was eager to give one to melitta and doubly eager to give one to kallista he climbed the steps from the working courtyard to the main floor and turned to the left leaving the official precincts for the guest quarters and the tyrants family space he led his caravan of slaves up the steps of the formal entrance to the palace and past a pair of sentries one of whom shot him a wink satyrus grinned then he went in under the bust of herakles and followed the colonnade towards his room the scale of the citadel and the palace dwarfed anything in pantecapaeum or olbia and was far larger than anything in little tanais he wondered what it would be like to live with this level of opulence just as an example in tanais the only stables had been in the public hippodrome the tyrant of heraklea had his own stables for his private use and they could accommodate more animals than tanaiss public stables satyrus tried to consider what this meant in terms of political power it was the sort of thing that would please philokles and he began to compose a question an intelligent question then he heard his sister scream satyrus dropped his pack and ran despite the pain in his ankle the shifting of his nose and the pounding of his heart she screamed again he saw the athenian doctor burst out of another curtain halfway around the courtyard and run towards his sisters room he reached under his arm and drew his sword the gesture was becoming natural his sister screamed again and called help he pushed through the curtain to her room melitta was fulllength on the marble floor trying to hold kallista kallista was flopping on the floor her face purple satyrus put his back against the wall and tried to cover every side of the room with his blade poison melitta said kallista was writhing as if she was in a pankration fight with an invisible opponent the athenian doctor burst in followed by philokles ahhhhhgggg kallista bellowed she had both hands at her throat her eyes were bulging like eggs the doctor cast around the room what did she drink he barked melitta pointed at a ewer of wine she tasted it for me oh hera she tasted it for me the doctor smelled it then he put a finger in hesitated and tasted it he wrinkled his lips like a horse and spat fuck shes dead he said bluntly poisoned not much i can do philokles didnt hesitate he fell on the girl despite her violent struggles he had her unable to move in seconds melitta rolled off theron came through the door with his head in a bandage help me philokles growled get her legs what in hades the doctor asked theron got his left arm under her knees pinned her ankles together and wrapped one great hand around them and lifted her up philokles kept her arms pinned philokles whirled you have hemp doctor he demanded the moment her head cleared the stone floor philokles yelled keep her there at theron hemp he demanded again the doctor shrugged ill find some he said and walked out just keep her there he said over his shoulder the moment the doctor was out of the door philokles punched the slave girl in the stomach a vicious blow with his whole weight behind it that made theron stumble she responded with an explosive vomit all over philokles some of the stuff spattered theron and satyrus got a gobbet in the face now look what youve done melitta shouted wait for the hemp satyrus grabbed a towel sopped it in water and wiped his own face then he set to cleaning philokles the spartan punched the girl again upside down she flinched her guts heaving and puked again a thin stream of blackpurple liquid satyrus caught it as it passed her mouth he tossed the towel in a corner and grabbed another thanking zeus that the girls had just bathed he turned to theron who was straining under the continued weight of the girl held up high they heard footsteps and nestor came in with a clash of bronze poison philokles said he stuck his hand into kallistas mouth and made her gag hermes god of travellers nestor said making a sign with his hand seal off this corridor he called outside let the doctor in philokles cried and moments later sophokles returned behind him a slave came with a brazier a bronze bowl and a tripod how did you induce vomiting the doctor asked he shrugged one way or another this is it apollo god of healing and all the gods be with me he smiled at the slave right here put the tripod here well done you have some bellows the slave produced bellows make it hot the doctor said kallista opened her eyes and screamed sophokles threw the herb on to the brazier and a pungent smoke arose to satyrus it was the scent of the sea of grass the sakje made little hide tents and sat in them to enjoy the smoke the doctor used the bellows until the smoke was rich and thick then reversed them sucking the smoke into the small instrument he put it in kallistas slack mouth and forced the smoke into her lungs she coughed choked and vomited again not dead yet sophokles proclaimed grimly apollo stand at my shoulder and save her he made more smoke and pushed the bellows deep in her throat before forcing in the smoke she retched and coughed but no more bile came up let her down the next time i need a patient held immobile you two are my choice lay her on the couch thats right satyrus was lightheaded in the smoke he could see kallista in her full beauty dressed for a party hovering just over the crumpled and stained victim on the couch like an allegory she seemed to smile at him a draught of air pushed the smoke aside and the vision of a healthy kallista vanished like a rainbow kallista drew a deep shuddering breath her whole body twitched make her drink water sophokles said melitta handed her brother a pitcher go to the well draw it yourself and bring it back she said imperiously satyrus discovered he had the acidic vomit in his hair when he ran a hand through it he wiped his hand on his chiton damn my best one from kinon and ran for the courtyard one of the guardsmen came with him satyrus looked at the man under the helmet one of the macedonians from the barracks im going for water he said stepping aside the guardsman was burdened with a heavy spear and a shield he was slow satyrus waited until he was moving and then ran down the stoa towards the stairs hey the man shouted wait for me lad satyrus ignored him cut down the slaves stair to the main courtyard and stuck his pitcher into the water there were groups of slaves mostly women all around the fountain chatting away most of them were looking at him he looked back when his jar was full he got his feet under him and hoisted the jar clear of the fountain all the slaves moved out of his way clearing a path tenedos the steward was trying to hide behind another man satyrus froze the guard had followed him down the stairs but he was separated from tenedos by the whole crowd of slaves he thought that he could take the slave man to man tenedos was bigger and older but it was unlikely that he had ever trained to fight he could hear theron saying any time you offer a test of strength to a man hell beat you but he was just a slave and satyrus had a blade of course kallista needed the water fuck why is life so hard he thought he turned his back on the slaves and set his pitcher down on the stone he took a deep breath whirled around and started for the man tenedos moved fast shoving a young woman flat on the floor and pushing a bigger man against the rim of the fountain as he fled satyrus jumped over a downed stool and saw the macedonian guard moving fast despite his armour across the back of the fountain room tenedos slipped through a door and was gone satyrus rounded the corner at full speed and raced under the eaves of the slave quarters where the womens quarters overhung the working courtyard but there was no one there but two old slaves weaving linen chitons who shoved themselves flat against the wall as he raced past the steward must have gone into one of the slaves rooms or into the kitchens the guard came up panting well thats the steward from kinons satyrus said seeing that his words meant nothing to the guard he said the assassin the guard nodded sharply put a bone whistle to his lips and blew hard over and over every slave in the area immediately lay flat on the ground and the corridors around the courtyard were full of the sound of running feet well get him the man said as soon as i get a squad here my lord youre going straight back to your chambers satyrus shook his head i can identify him hes in one of these rooms lets the guardsman shook his head look lad were protecting you let us fucking protect you he grinned half a dozen archers appeared big black men with ostrich plumes in their hair assassin in one of the slave rooms he pointed his spear take him alive satyrus shouted the lead archer turned perhaps he said with a wicked smile back to your room my lord the macedonian said behind him three of the archers nocked arrows while the other three drew wickedlooking iron knives medje the macedonian said your steward is doomed wait until they get their fucking monkeys they can smell a man a stade away satyrus did not want to leave the chase and he wanted to learn more about the medje hed seldom seen a group of men who gave such an impression of competence how will they know him if he isnt lying on the floor in the position of submission the macedonian shook his head and if he is he wont have a slave disk now move satyrus put his sword back in the scabbard and snatched up the pitcher as he passed the fountain house angry with himself and ran for the slave stairs i saw tenedos he said as he put the pitcher into melittas hands it didnt seem as if anyone in the room had moved he was in the working courtyard i think he saw me watching him did he escape philokles asked why didnt you run him down satyrus thought that was unfair the palace guard are after him one of our guards made me come back nestor nodded good he said thats a man who knows his busi ness what on earth were you thinking boy philokles asked nestor will you search the palace nestor grunted im sure it is being done and the boy did right as did my man your prince has no business chasing assassins hes the target he leaned out into the corridor and began to shout orders then he turned back to the room you two will know him he said to philokles you and theron come with me ill make up two parties i must attend the tyrant hell lock the palace down we dont need the palace locked down philokles said nestor shook his head we do this may all be aimed at the tyrant frustrated satyrus glared at philokles in the middle of the room melitta took the pitcher dont mope she said send slaves for more water in a few minutes the whole complex was flooded with soldiers men of the guard were at every door and most of the windows and when a slave moved guards would call out so that the slaves movements were watched and recorded somewhere every time the whistles blew all the slaves would lie flat their arms by their sides it was efficient and scary draco appeared at satyruss side a man cant even get laid without your enemies fucking it up he said but he gave satyrus a grin lets go to your rooms my lord ive been ordered to go through them with you he gave satyrus a nod and together they went out into the stoa as another guardsman called out that they were moving when they reached satyruss portion of the wing they went through all of the rooms on his side opening every chest and looking under every chair and bed and behind every drape his thoroughness was unsettling satyrus had never considered that men might be trained to search a room slaves continued to bring pitchers of water satyrus turned to go back to his sisters rooms no more traffic draco said you can wait here my lord you know me satyrus said go to your room read the iliad whatever just obey understand the macedonian mercenary was all business satyrus shrugged with adolescent annoyance and went to his room he was alone he went to the alcove and found the scroll bag hed seen there the day before sure enough the iliad satyrus slumped on the floor and tried to read about achilles rage and tried not to think about the hourly process of assassination achilles failed to illuminate his problem no one in the iliad faced enemies who crawled in the dark and used poison well except odysseus but the winged words had their own healing he was lost soon enough reading avidly there was shouting in the corridor and a sound in the distance like a scream and his head came up from his scroll he was scared he wondered if the next thing hed see would be an assassin bursting through the door fuck he said without meaning to he thought of his mother and the warmth of her infrequent embraces and then he thought about the sauromatae girl crying for her mother as she lay dying his hands shook he backed into a corner his brain running like a chariot drawn by maddened horses he thought about the city and the stables and about his mother he thought about his father the demigod he thought about his sister about kallista what kind of life did she lead would she die was it his fault slowly his breathing slowed his hands stopped shaking and he realized that he had his sword in his hand and he was huddled in the corner of his room im losing my wits he said aloud he sheathed the sword and wiped his face and then poured water over his head and rubbed his face hard draco he called out voice fairly steady of course the man had heard him no privacy anywhere my lord the soldier asked id like to go down to my sisters room satyrus said prince satyrus moving draco called go ahead my lord satyrus stepped out into the evening air and moved along the gallery to melittas room when he passed the soldier the macedonian turned to look at him another few minutes and thisll be over he said in a whisper thanks satyrus said lita he called come in she said and he ducked through the curtain melitta was sitting on a chair by kallista who was lying on the bed she was deeply unconscious melitta gave a bright and entirely fake smile hello brother she said you all right he asked the corners of her mouth quivered a little but her smile remained in place no she said people are trying to kill me us its different from a fight its horrible satyrus i like people satyrus put his arms around her happy to comfort somebody especially his sister who usually comforted him its not everybody sis its just a couple of idiots if id been quicker on my feet wed be safe what are you achilles is it all on you are you the centre of the world stop all this assumptionofresponsibility crap its the product of too much plato she put her cheek on his shoulder and squeezed the weight of her head was grinding one of his best gold fibulae into his shoulder but that was an occupational hazard of being a brother i didnt get him and that macedonian made me come back here i should have stayed at it it makes me feel like shit satyrus felt better just for saying the words out loud she looked up her eyes red and shook her head slavery doesnt make them weak you daft weasel slavery makes them desperate promise me that when were king and queen well have no slaves done he said i swear it by zeus and all the gods they stood there embracing for some time the shadows got longer kallista continued to breathe im better melitta said thanks she stepped away and started to rearrange her hair hey he said what if im not better she made a rude noise can i tell you something she said her back to him probably he said he was watching kallista in his head he was comparing her blotched face swollen lips burn marks and stressed flesh to the image of beauty she had presented the first night in the rose garden the comparison was full of lessons when i thought you were dying i was going to kill myself she said evenly i dont think id want to live without you brother she put a pin into her hair he rubbed his hand through his hair in embarrassment yeah he said another of his excellent responses my lord draco asked from the other side of the curtain thats draco our sentry come in satyrus called the macedonian pushed his head through were out of here my lord the medje have your man and the dinner is on our tyrant wont be cowed by a slave so youre to dress his eyes flicked over to where melitta sat my pardon mlady hold on satyrus said slipping through the curtain thanks draco grinned from under his thracian helmet no problem mlord what happened to satyrus or boy orders you two is to be treated as visiting royals draco grinned most visiting royals dont help us loot a house o course can i ask a favour draco sure ask away im back off duty as soon as i get this thorax off he slung his shield around on his back can you find me a chiton a nice one he pointed to the long streak of black vomit on his fine flamedecorated garment draco grinned thats easy hey he said turning hey philotas wheres that squeeze of yours another armoured man emerged from the columns on the other side of the guests courtyard shes right here you whoreson send her over here the prince needs some clothes draco chortled so does she philotas laughed it might be a minute draco shrugged hes a pigdog our philotas girls love him his cocks longer than a girls foot he rolled his eyes his girl is one of the wardrobe slaves his current girl satyrus tried to be a man of the world my mother says no slave girls aphrodite whys that draco seemed shocked because they cant decide for themselves they arent in control of their bodies satyrus managed to deliver the line well without primness as if he really knew what he was talking about draco laughed ares who cares he said willing unwilling he looked at satyrus oh balls im sorry boy dont take it like that im no monster your mums just a little strict for me the slave girl came up her eyes averted and her ionic chiton neat and graceful master she asked the prince would like to know if he might get a chiton from the wardrobe draco asked in an official voice his best got ruined in the poison attempt the slave raised her eyes and looked at his chiton she fingered the stain never come all the way out she said she brightened but i have a little bitch who itll do good to try can we move about draco free as friggin birds honey draco answered my lord i leave you in good hands give me the cloth mlord she all but snapped her fingers and satyrus pulled it off over his head get the brooches mlord draco said or youll never see em again dont you have somewhere you ought to be guardsman the woman said to draco her nimble fingers plucked the fibulae off the shoulders no one in this wing would steal mlord draco is from macedon theyre the thieves draco gave him a look that said hed stand by his statement and satyrus was left standing naked with a pair of gold brooches in his hand and a sword strap over his shoulder life with slaves and guards was so alien that he almost laughed aloud philokles came up behind him planning to go to the dinner naked boy he asked the sword is a nice touch you could be young herakles satyrus blushed and hurried back to his room as quickly as he could he wriggled into a chiton best bathe i can smell the vomit on you philokles called after him leaning in past the curtain will you go sir satyrus asked i will too we can just squeeze it in satyrus felt his tutors hand on his shoulder and they walked off down the gallery to the stairs philokles didnt know the palace like satyrus did now this way he said heading down the slaves stair its faster no boy the spartan said he pulled satyrus past the slaves stair not fair to them you didnt grow up with slaves but i did they need their own places where the likes of us dont interfere just like soldiers officers dont go into soldiers parts of camp bad manners oh satyrus said they went down the public stair together the baths were crowded because everyone had either been on duty or locked down for the afternoon the men in the steam fell silent when satyrus entered welcome prince nestor called out satyrus blushed he blushed more when he saw the murals on the walls he got in the steam and then he plunged into a cold bath deep enough to dive and swim with a beautiful bronze woman with a fish tail at the bottom as if swimming for the surface when he emerged he took a warmer bath and then went into the towel room massage a bored slave asked youre the foreign prince eh in there he said satyrus found himself on a slab between nestor and philokles they were like a pair of matching statues as they reclined waiting for masseurs nestor in black and philokles in white philokles was not at his best years as a tutor in a backwater had not forced him to maintain his fighting trim but he was not fat either nestors musculature was perfect and he would have adorned any gymnasium in greece boy or girl the towel boy asked surprise me nestor said a heavyset man came in and set to work on philokles soldier sir he asked i can always tell from the shoulders nestor laughed hes a spartan he said the masseur grunted youve pulled some muscles here sir best take some light exercise ill keep that in mind philokles said wheres theron satyrus asked as another man started to pummel his shoulders then a huge thumb was thrust roughly under his shoulder blade and it hurt ares he squeaked be nice glaukis probably the first real massage the boys ever had nestor hissed between his teeth they all hurt mlord satyruss masseur grunted and rotated his arm as if forcing his head down in pankration oww satyrus said the two big men laughed eventually it was over there was a point where it started to feel good and another point where he started to feel the glow he got from a long exercise bout oil mlord the masseur asked just a little satyrus said the masseur helped him off the slab second curtain mlord satyrus headed down a corridor barely able to walk with the absolute relaxation of his muscles erotic scenes involving various combinations of partners adorned the walls satyrus wasnt prudish and he certainly knew how it all worked there was even less privacy in tanais than in heraklea but he blushed anyway the second curtain gave way to a small room with a small darkhaired girl not much older than he she helped him up on to a stool scented she asked cedar or lavender no scent thanks he said she began to apply oil her hands light but efficient anything else master she asked as she began to massage the oil into his penis no thank you he said no squeak at all he was quite proud of his lack of shock there you go then she said with an utter indifference that made him feel hed made the right choice he walked back up the main stair in a glow of wellbeing eudaimonia and he walked straight into his sisters room how is she he asked goodness you glow like a god melitta said shes breathing better do you know that when they put oil on you in the baths they offer sex acts do they do that in the womens baths melitta giggled yes and no she said lets not go into details she turned bright red and they laughed the laughter went on go and put some clothes on brother she said theres a slave waiting in your room she made a motion with her hand were suddenly at the age where people will talk if were together naked satyrus turned a bright red zeus soter he said thats disgusting melitta shrugged the macedonians do it all the time ask your soldier friend draco melitta gave a wicked smile a smile that most twelveyearold girls couldnt manage your guard friends think thats what were doing in here satyrus vowed never to be naked around his sister again and headed off to his room satyrus found the wardrobe slave waiting for him sorry to keep you waiting he said she continued to look at the floor but she gave a small smile thats polite i had a nice rest and i tacked the side seams put it on good youre not dripping oil smudges the fabric she held out a chiton which was light wool woven beautifully but with a double row of purple decoration woven in himself will never wear it she said came with the tribute and it wouldnt go around his head much less his body she smiled thank him for it when you make your bow just so im covered hestia goddess of the hearth watch over you whats your name he asked harmone my lord there you look like a prince you need gold sandals ive never had such a thing satyrus said harmone laughed im a slave and i have four pairs she said the worlds a funny place and no mistake she waited at the doorway waiting for a tip satyrus cast around the room saw all of his kit where the slaves had dumped it was it really just that afternoon its going to take me some time to find my purse he said ill wait she said i knew you was a gent satyrus wondered what he had in his purse harmone he asked as he pulled his sleeping roll off the pile whats a fair tip this isnt how i live every day she rolled her eyes ten gold daricsd do me fine she said and giggled youre a rare un an obol or two is fair for any extra service a slave does except fucking thats more unless offered free satyruss hand stopped over his satchel he looked at her she smiled she was a good ten years older than him and he wasnt sure she was offering and the world was a very confusing place he had to look away she was licking her lips and his downturned eye caught a needle sticking pointfirst out of the flap of his satchel just a few fingerbreadths from his hand the point of the needle was dark with something stuck to it wax or poison hades satyrus breathed hed heard of poisoned needles harmone ill tip you later get nestor she caught the seriousness in his voice satyrus didnt move the discovery of the reality of poisoned needles had frozen him in place he felt very vulnerable indeed he tried not to think he didnt panic especially he just crouched by his pack until philokles and theron came then nestor arrived with a file of soldiers they told him not to move while they sent for more soldiers in heavy gear his sister stood in the doorway dressed for dinner with her hair piled on top of her head in silver pins and chewed on her fist men in heavy felt mittens pulled his gear apart men in heavy military sandals came in and literally carried him out of the room he leaned his forehead against the cool smoothness of a pillar and breathed for a while as his hands and knees shook then he went to the door someone hand me out my sword he asked good voice he did that well touch of irony melitta smiled philokles looked stricken and a little drunk this is all my fault he said thickly we need to get out of here satyrus said if kallista can travel in a litter i suggest we leave tonight the doctor came up behind philokles that ankle of yours needs a couple of days he said i could be dead in a couple of days satyrus said he managed to hide the bitterness philokles turned to nestor id like to send a messenger to the smith to see if his caravan is still going it has probably left or been cancelled if it has left id like an escort until we catch it theron pushed in ill go he said no philokles said from now on we all stay together all the time nestor leaves a guard on kallista until we come back from dinner and then we sleep in melittas room and in the morning we pack our beasts at first light and ride nestor nodded pending the tyrants permission of course philokles nodded back of course he said sophokles glanced at nestor ill go with them he said they all need medical care nestor was surprised you were just hired as the tyrants physician he said sophokles shrugged i feel responsible he said satyrus looked at the athenian trying to read his soul lets go to dinner melitta said satyrus was struck again by the sheer bulk of dionysius of heraklea as he entered the mans hall the tyrant filled the dais and his couch was three times the width of every other couch and he lay alone he was grotesque and his bristle of short blond hair made his head seem all the smaller he looked like an ogre come to life he held the eye nonetheless his white chiton immaculate the gold wreath on his head brilliant in its helioslike spray of leaves and tendrils that flickered like fire in the lamplight satyrus and melitta led the way to the dais arm in arm and walking with their heads high and satyrus was aware even as he stared at the tyrant that every other eye in the hall was on him or his sister the couches of the principal diners were drawn up in a circle where women had been invited they sat in chairs beside their companions the dinner was not an orgy but a feast and when satyrus managed to tear his eyes away from the tyrant he saw that the couches of the inner circle were full of seriouslooking men attended by women their own age not hetairai before they approached the circle satyrus turned to philokles any special etiquette for tyrants he asked be polite philokles answered dont make speeches about the freedom of the assembly theron choked a laugh and then they were passing an empty couch and entering the clear space before the dais greetings prince satyrus and princess melitta the tyrant raised himself on an elbow nestor offer me a libation on the altar for the safety of our twins satyrus hadnt noticed that nestor had somehow beaten them to the dining hall the black man was seated behind the tyrant and he rose took a libation bowl and poured wine on a small altar set into the wall with a statue of dionysius in gold and ivory in a niche over the altar the tyrant nodded the blessings of dionysus stay with you may the strength of our patron herakles defend you he smiled and it was a hard dangerous grin for such a fat man you are still wearing your sword young man satyrus bowed deeply i rejoice in your your favour dionysius i thank you for your hospitality for the healing of your doctor the safety of your roof and for your generosity even the clothes on my back i owe to you he bowed again and his voice rose as his nerves betrayed him but too squeaky but twice men have tried to kill us under your roof i beg your forgiveness and your permission to wear this sword i missed the last part of that dionysius said he rolled heavily and the legs of his couch creaked nestor what does the boy say nestor leaned down by the tyrant and whispered in his ear dionysius nodded heavily so be it i am deeply sorry that these criminals have so abused my hospitality now sit and eat dinner how is the slave girl he asked the last with a sudden quickening of his eyes she will live melitta said she may be marred dionysiuss eyes roved over melitta i have a daughter amastris just your age would you sit with her melitta nodded her head gracefully i would be delighted nestor made a sign and a chair was moved melitta followed the chair to sit beside another girl her own age you sit by me dionysius said to satyrus he pointed to the couch on his left hand satyrus went and lay on it philokles and theron were escorted to other couches in the second circle as soon as the tanaisians were in their places nestor clapped his hands and dancers entered they danced the rites of spring as village girls danced them throughout the euxine if with more grace and while they moved beautifully through the familiar figures the first course was served on threelegged tables next to each couch nestor tells me you wish to abandon my hospitality dionysius said he was enormous and he was elevated by the height of a mans lower leg the combination made conversation awkward as the tyrants head was four feet above satyruss head lord you know that the slave tenedos the steward of kinon was at large in your citadel satyrus craned his neck to see the tyrants eyes young satyrus i know of every event in this castle i know when a slave girl fucks or does not fuck a guest and how much he tips her he put a morsel of food in his mouth and winked tenedos is now past worrying about but he had many interesting points to make before he went to hades satyrus nodded the lesson going straight home to his heart did he betray his master he said carefully yes and no young man that is he admitted that he was turned by this stratokles but he claimed while in enormous pain that it was the slave girl kallista who was the driving force not he of course oh satyrus said ahh to be so young a man will say anything under torture anything it need not be the truth indeed it seldom is the tyrant took a whole quail and dropped it in his mouth what of the athenian if i may ask lord satyrus took a quail for himself when the platter was offered fled days ago by ship i suspect but he will have left other agents here i have no doubt the fat man spat bird bones into his hand and dropped them into a bowl on his couch how convenient for everyone satyrus said i regret that i must agree in your place i would suspect that the tyrant dionysius was complicit he smiled satyrus sipped his wine bowl the thought had crossed my mind he said he tried to sound like a man of the world but instead he heard a scared boy but of course if i wanted you dead youd be dead dionysius winked again nestor could have gutted you both and had your meat served in a local shop at the crook of my finger or you could die of poison right now from the wine in that cup you didnt have it tasted youd never know or i could have you strangled in your sleep by my slaves really theres no need to concern yourself with such things you are so utterly in my power that it may be that i just cant make up my mind how to dispose of you satyrus forced himself to take a bite of food he had no idea what it tasted like his mind was not moving the sword you wear is a nice conceit but will it defend you from poison or even from a determined man with a sword from my ill will it offers no defence at all and by wearing it you accuse me of being a poor host it is rude the tyrant rolled over on his couch and from his position under the huge man satyrus could see the length of the thongs that held the mattress and how stretched they were but you wished to make a statement perhaps you felt that you needed to get my attention boys do such things they posture the tyrant smiled again i posture too when you are as old as i and as fat men will assume that as you are ugly so you are evil dont you kalos kalon the beautiful is the good eh boy and since im so ugly i must be evil i must rape virgins every night and perhaps bathe in blood eh the man leaned over the edge of his couch so when they call me evil i posture a little understand boy stupid violent men often mistake goodness for weakness and see evil as strength you look smart do you know whereof i speak satyrus had in fact got the drift he raised his cup i drink to the virtue of ugliness lord he said turning a pretty phrase hed held it in his mind since the tyrant had used the stock phrase kalos kalon dionysius sat up and his couch protested nestor did you hear that the boy just paid me a genuine compliment nestor chuckled virtue of ugliness indeed well said young man i think we may indeed be friends tell me what you want dionysius snapped his fingers and the second course was served he watched the servers with much the same pride as kinon had shown and then a messenger distracted him lord i want to that is satyrus stared at the tyrant what do i want he thought since the man was distracted he looked around and his eyes found melittas sitting on an ivorydecorated chair to his right sitting next to her with her face almost touching his sisters was the nereid from the other night her black curls framing her face she was telling his sister a story and they were both laughing melitta caught his eye and the other girl saw her attention waver and turned her head to look at him and their eyes met hers were green all thought left his head so green a slave bent over his dining table the slave was holding out a solid silver ewer and he should have asked if satyrus wanted more wine instead he opened his mouth and the buzz of the diners the ebb and flow of conversation the drone of flies and the sound of the sea spoke like the voice of the god from his mouth that girl is what you want said the slave he raised the ewer what did you say satyrus asked more wine master the slave squeaked when satyrus looked back his sister and the nereid were laughing together again he looked at the slave the boy was terrified well slaves were often scared he was learning a great deal about slaves he held up his wine cup the boy raised the pitcher and poured and satyrus noted that the pitcher was nearly empty the boy spilled wine when his hands shook just a few drops that fell harmlessly on the couchs cover never mind satyrus said kindly he dismissed the boy with a wave he turned back to the tyrant what i want lord is revenge he said and the restoration of my city revenge is utterly worthless young man dionysius sipped his wine i hope you havent already had a surfeit of tunny the run this year is superb the giant fish was carried past him by four sweating slaves all grown men when satyrus glanced around he realized that the boy who had just served him was the only young slave in the hall he was nowhere to be seen i have a mind to make myself king of the bosporus satyrus said and raised the wine cup to his lips i had no such intention but eumeles heron has forced this on me dionysius narrowed his eyes satyrus put his wine cup down untasted hed just made the connections lord i think this wine is poisoned dionysius flinched as if struck that is quite an accusation he motioned to nestor who came up take this cup and test it on someone the boy thinks that it is poison the tyrant motioned him away he turned back to satyrus as if nothing untoward had happened it is all very well planning to be a king that will require riches and armies what do you want from me dionysiuss voice made it clear that neither riches nor armies would be forthcoming i would like permission to leave and an escort i wish to reach my friend diodorus the athenian satyrus watched nestor until he vanished he had a pounding headache and he wondered if he had absently already had a sip of the wine or been poisoned earlier he felt queasy done the tyrant said silence fell over the hall nestor came in by another entrance with a file of soldiers one of them was carrying a dead dog soldiers took station at every entrance slaves suddenly moved like lightning herded by other soldiers nestor moved to the foot of the dais he bent his head down and spoke to the tyrant and the man started then he spoke rapidly i apologize for the inconvenience nestor announced this dinner is ended and you are all guests of the tyrant for the night soldiers will escort you to rooms when you are cleared you will be escorted home again we apologize for any inconvenience those responsible will be punished nestor glanced around with the utmost rigour diners looked pale a woman burst into tears soldiers moved up to every couch and took the diners away satyrus saw two soldiers escort theron from the hall and another pair taking philokles your wine was poisoned young man and theres a boy with his throat cut in the kitchen the tyrant shook his head i hate that this has happened here it makes me feel weak it makes me look weak he shrugged moving the whole mass of his flesh escort them to their rooms young man you have brought me a great deal of trouble but you have also identified for me a serious threat and for that you have my thanks he gestured with his hand nestor moved to satyruss couch my lord he said satyrus rolled to his feet melitta came up next to him and together they bowed to the tyrant who responded with a civil inclination of his head you are excellent children he said i hope that you live satyrus met the ogres eye i hope that i will always remember that beauty is not the only good he said he started to turn away but he caught the smile that flashed over the tyrants face when you are ready to be a king come to me dionysius the tyrant said i think i would be happy to be your ally with that despite his bulk he moved quickly vanishing into his guards not bad melitta said i think youre starting to play the prince ill have to live long enough to grow into the part he shot back but then he grinned at her watch out lita i could grow to like it nestor escorted them to the door draco he called out many of the diners were gathered outside being searched with brusque efficiency by the tyrants guard there was a fair amount of silent outrage draco ran up and saluted captain take these two back to their rooms he said i will make arrangements on your behalf be ready he spoke tersely and turned away satyrus glanced at melitta she shook her head he means dont go to sleep she whispered right this way lady the soldier said when they were clear of the guests and the other soldiers he led them by the servants ways and the slaves stair to their rooms there were soldiers at every junction in the palace this happens a little too often for me he said word to the wise the guards saw a man going up the slaves stairs about twenty minutes back they shouted should have just charged the fucker and he got away the macedonian shrugged more poison going to bag that slave girl who the fuck knows ive never seen the like of this except at court at home satyrus paused at the door of his room suddenly overwhelmed with an irrational or perhaps wholly rational fear of a dark room would you have someone search my room he asked draco sighed im not even on duty can the search of your room wait until morning satyrus whirled no it cannot listen someone just tried to poison me earlier someone had a go at my sister and managed to poison kallista er her slave my mother is probably dead in pantecapaeum im cut off from my friends and my patrimony and im at the end of my tether and i want you to get your arse into that room and check it out or get someone who will understand me his voice was shrill and his tone was murderous and he regretted the whole speech the moment it was out of his mouth draco stiffened yes my lord he said woodenly he summoned two more guardsmen had a whispered conversation and then with lamps in hand they searched the room ripped the coverings off the couch and searched them for needles and summoned a pair of slaves to remake it then they did the same for melitta moving the snoring kallista when they were done satyrus tried to make amends im sorry he said draco shot him a look of contempt just my job my lord ill be on my way satyrus paused yes it is draco sorry for the inconvenience but it is your job draco stalked off philokles and theron joined them in melittas room they dropped their packs and sat on them then philokles went with satyrus to his room and they collected his gear and moved it to his sisters room before they could get it all arranged there was the rattle of armed soldiers in the colonnade and nestor appeared through the curtain he entered followed by a slim figure wrapped to the head in cloaks the tyrant himself is otherwise engaged nestor said he sent me to prove his determination on your behalf amastris said emerging from her wraps she smiled hesitantly and because i wanted to say goodbye nestor will escort you to the stables father wants you gone immediately while he has the palace locked down and no one can speak of your flight then he intends to sell every slave in the palace that boy the one who served you was one of ours her eyes met satyruss and she smiled at him he had to lean against the wall he shouldnt even have been in the room hes not a server just a cooks boy but none of the slaves seem to know anything her shrug told a great deal so father is selling every one of them in the morning ares philokles said every slave in the palace nestors face hardened ill find the man responsible and well never get to the slaves while theyre still on the staff the man responsible is the athenian stratokles satyrus said and his agent the slave tenedos nestor shook his head stratokles has fled the city and is a citizen of athens we have the house watched but there is not much more we can do it now appears that this slave tenedos may have been his messenger to someone inside the palace surely you can take action against him arrest him satyrus blurted athens young prince does not take well to the prosecution of its ambassadors nestor snapped his fingers and a pair of soldiers brought a cauldron of stew or their murder i have eaten from this pot the wine is my own please eat satyrus didnt hesitate he took a loaf of bread from one of the soldiers picked up a bowl and began to eat melitta did the same philokles and theron joined in amastris took a bowl and joined them she shared the rooms only chair with melitta like sisters my father says i smell olympias and her pet cassander olympias serves dark powers she loves poison she glanced at melitta we all fear olympias she has been a figure of fear to me since i was born many of your soldiers are from macedon melitta said nestor nodded it will be looked into you need to be gone from here before someone gets you he looked at philokles how long have you been with the twins all our lives satyrus answered he was my fathers friend you cannot possibly accuse him nestor shook his head my lord i accuse no one but i must ask everyone so you are the same man as figures in tales of kineas good nestor nodded at philokles and turned back to satyrus i think that if he drank less hed be more trustworthy but he seems a solid man philokles went red and then a blotched red and white impervious to the spartans rage nestor glanced at theron how about this athlete theron nestor pointed at him how long have you known him he has been with us from the attack at tanais satyrus said his voice was very low he looked at melitta he would never betray us she said hes had a hundred chances to kill us nestor why are these things happening amastris spoke in a low voice almost husky why my lady nestor shrugged people play games for power olympias and her friend cassander play them for the love of playing olympias is like a cat she likes to hurt her prey and they want to own us and sinope and the north shore as well nestors mouth was a hard line the last time olympias stretched her talons out towards the north your father cut them off he said to satyrus zopryon was her lover he chuckled of course everyone at the court of macedon was her lover at one time or another he continued satyrus was gazing at amastris who looked even more like a nereid she was gazing back the pressure of her green eyes on his almost too intense to bear like strong sunlight on a sunburn satyrus wanted to touch her curls and see what kept them bound so close to each other she smiled at him i like your sister she said as if she had been his friend for millennia and as if the two of them were alone in the room me too satyrus said he ruined the line with some weak giggles nestor put a possessive hand on amastriss shoulder amastris will rule here one day amastris this handsome boy is a penniless exile and you will not pay him the slightest attention you are going to ptolemy to find a husband a powerful husband with a fleet he said these words with the amusement of a father i know captain she replied she smiled at satyrus again look all you like young man nestor said she is our greatest asset in this game of thieves and she is not for you were looking for a middleaged tyrant with a good fleet syracusa perhaps the nereid said ive been raised to it i can name the rowing positions i think id make a decent navarch she laughed and turned her grassgreen gaze on melitta if your brother ever restores his fortune youll be in the same boat melitta hell marry you off to secure his coast not if he wants to live through the night melitta said she reached over and ruffled her brothers hair and met amastriss eyes your father is not what he appears she said if he were what he appears nestor said hed have eaten you for dinner tonight but he regrets that someone has the power to show him weak you two must be gone the choices are by ship or by caravan it is your life young man which will you choose i may be a foolish boy satyrus said but i think that if i can make it safely to my fathers friend diodorus i will be safe many of the men i grew up with are among diodoruss mercenaries even as he spoke satyrus relived the last two weeks he pursed his lips and looked at his sister will we ever be safe she asked speaking the same thought that bounced around in his head philokles was still silent with anger hitting his wine cup hard theron put a hand on the spartans shoulder i think were safer by land philokles shrugged all i have chosen goes wrong he said im just a drunk melitta went and stood in front of the spartan is that how it is going to be philokles she asked if you wont think wont help and keep drinking wine id just as soon leave you here theron shook his head violently out of the spartans sight line satyrus stepped in philokles please help us you saved our lives again and again the last few weeks get us to diodorus land philokles said thickly let us ride satyrus turned to the captain of the guard we will go by land now if you will help us well need a mule litter for the slave girl nestor nodded all is ready my lord he looked at satyruss leg and meaningfully at kallista who was still pale and could barely eat you are all of you injured he said if my lord allows it i think that you should take the doctor melitta shook her head i dont like him philokles shrugged i take your point drunkard that i am you think that we need his skills melitta made a noise and philokles cut her off doctors do not grow on trees he said may you be safe amastris prayed we will be safe when we have power satyrus said that is not the lesson that philokles would teach if he were sober melitta struggled for composure she looked at her new friend pardon me amastris sometimes i remember that i have no home the other girl gave her a quick hug when the hasty meal was over nestor summoned amastriss maids to take her to her own wing of the palace she hugged melitta write to me in alexandria she said you have adventures i marry some old man with a fleet she smiled then she frowned hestia protect you i didnt mean that you should have adventures stay safe hestia keep you safe and artemis who protects virgin girls she blushed and hugged melitta again she was a year older than the twins but melitta was a head taller and satyrus was taller yet satyrus reached out a hand to her the bravest act of his life and she took it you be safe she said stammering a little and blushing and you my lady satyrus said he kissed her hand as he had seen theron do with kallista she giggled my father would kill you she said and followed her maids she left something hard in satyruss hand a ring it was quite a ring made of gold with garnets around a big red stone carved with a tiny perfect representation of a man with a club and a lion skin herakles he looked from it to her hed never held anything so precious hermes protects travellers she called from the doorway but herakles triumphs part iii quenching bc s tratokles lay on a couch in the shade of a flame tree and watched the sun set against the towering storm clouds to the north his mind was on a thousand things but the beauty of the sunset infected him and he called for a tablet and a stylus but all that came to him were snippets of other mens poems and tags of menander he laughed lucius lying on the other couch coughed and shook his head not much to laugh about thats just where you are wrong stratokles said were alive other men are dead and we my friend are still alive cant tell you how how much i appreciate that you came back for me lucius said his tone conveyed more insult than flattery his tone told stratokles that he never expected once wounded that his employer would pick him up and fight his way out what a cockup and no mistake stratokles said to be honest i must be responsible but i cannot see how anyway i like you lucius im tired of thugs youre a gentleman he shrugged not sure why i went back for you myself lucius started laughing oh fuck that hurts he said and wheezed so what next we heal up youll be out a month more i expect ill be able to hobble about in a week but itll be a month before i can exercise he shrugged then back to athens and fucking demetrios of phaleron who will tell me how i could have done it all much much better hes your boss lucius asked you are a fucking barbarian anyone ever tell you that stratokles laughed and snapped his fingers for wine a thracian girl with flamered hair bustled out on to the terrace poured his wine and vanished demetrios of phaleron is the tyrant of athens a scion of phocion friend of kineas whose children we just so notably failed to murder he sighed an extreme oligarch whose policies will overthrow two hundred years of democratic traditions in athens he raised his wine to lucius my boss how does that work lucius asked i dont get much of your greek politics but ive read aristotle and i have ears youre a democrat if hes an oligarch youre not friends lucius if ive learned one thing in my life its that in politics there are no friends stratokles sighed look theres no point in deposing demetrios of phaleron if that costs us alliance with cassander and athens ends up being sacked give the man his due demetrios of phaleron is brilliant ruthless the best diplomat of the age and a passable poet poet lucius asked he took an appreciative sip of the wine makes my wound pound like the tide on the sea but tastes like heaven he looked up who owns the redhead she came with the house stratokles waved his hand ours for the use i think lucius shook his head you greeks are so rich you dont know he said someday someones going to come and take all this away from you someone did stratokles said his name was alexander and he took our liberty and our way of life and left us a bunch of mercenary wolves in place of a government stratokles shrugged again sipped wine and watched the redhaired girl return ill give my life if i have to to win my city back her liberty the redhaired girl was moving selfconsciously clearly aware of what the italian wanted perhaps unsure of what to do about it i hear a lot about your alexander lucius said most people say he was a god we latins dont believe in that crap stratokles raised an eyebrow and you predict the future with the entrails of chickens lucius laughed we learned that from you greeks he said hey girl know how to play a flute stratokles sat carefully at a writing table and two slaves brought eightwick lamps for him the latin and the thracian girl were making a fair amount of noise upstairs which made stratokles smile the latin was like a character in menander overblown comic larger than life until he said something like ive read aristotle stratokles rubbed his hands together sniffed the coriander on his fingers and thought it was worth the risk i need a man i can trust really trust lucius is the man he remembered the blood and the noise in the house in heraklea and his hand trembled just a little stratokles had fought in every battle of the lamian war and ten more actions but fighting the monstrous spartan in the dark had had an almost supernatural terror to it i did it though he watched his hand until the trembling stopped then he flipped his wax tablets open and began to write stratokles to menander greetings it is too long since we strolled in the academy or listened to the muses or booed the chorus at the theatre our mutual friend has sent me to virtual exile on the euxine a business trip that threatens to take me until the end of my life and perhaps a little longer i have had many opportunities to observe the trials and triumphs of life and i have to say that there have been many trials and few triumphs it seems to me that i have arranged for all the grain our friend will need despite some business matters that did not go as planned i would appreciate it if you would tell him from me that the first shipments of grain should arrive with this letter i also wish to note that some political matters have not fallen out as our mutual friend might have hoped or expected there is a rumour here that heron the ruler of pantecapaeum attacked tanais a little city on the bay of salmon and destroyed it but failed to catch its rulers still they are children and many years must pass before they play any role in the grain trade in addition it came to my notice while doing business here that dionysius of heraklea is much more powerful in the region than is commonly asserted in athens and heron for all his bluster has no hope at all of seizing heraklea or sinope that said we might consider a slight change in policy after direct observation of his business practices i fear that our partner in pantecapaeum may prove difficult and even dangerous heraklea on the other hand impressed me with efficiency and culture and a great deal of available grain i further wish that our mutual friend might understand that our partner in pantecapaeum and our friend in thrace may not be friends for ever i wish to have a free hand to decide where we may turn in such an event but i will await advice in the meantime shipments of grain from pantecapaeum heraklea and sinope should all be arriving at the piraeus in the next moon think of me as they send their cargoes ashore i sit under a beautiful moon after a sunset of such splendour that i could wish for your stylus and your museled wits rather than my own write and tell me of what passes under the gaze of greyeyed athena he read through the tablet struck out a bad phrase here and there and rewrote his work twice then he took ink and papyrus and began to copy fair he was so intent on his task that he didnt notice when lucius came up behind him in the dark room mars brother youll lose your sight luciuss voice made stratokles twitch but his hand was steady and his writing was beautiful the latin bent over the table youre either a scribe or a fucking aristo stratokles stratokles sat back and rolled his shoulders to loosen the muscle guess which lucius sat on a folding stool and handed the athenian a cup of wine is that the menander the playwright mars and venus brother you are the friend ive always wanted look at this fucking house ours for the asking you know menander he winked i could learn to like this stratokles couldnt help himself we grew up together he said with a shrug and put a finger to the injury on his nose hermes my face hurts he laughed i used to be accounted a handsome man bah lucius said now you look like a hero or a villain a man of action not a greek aristocratic pansy he was reading over stratokles shoulder you didnt like heron any more than i did eh stratokles shook his head i dont like people reading over my shoulder pardon lucius backed away stratokles shook his head no no just as a matter of course much of what i write is secret i expect that eventually ill share it all with you but im not there yet he smiled to take the sting out if you choose to stay with me anyway no i thought heron was a brilliant fool more of a danger to us than an ally i want demetrios of phaleron to tell cassander to ditch him he touched his nose again and winced are we giving up on putting the two children down then lucius asked he was naked and he smelled of lavender oil and cloves a real improvement stratokles thought stratokles shook his head no its a foolish order and probably an ignoble one but ive done worse for athens and i will again we need herons grain the children must die i have other resources in place ive already mobilized several they dont call you greeks wily for nothing lucius said you have so many spies that you keep some just lying around for emergencies stratokles sighed yes lucius laughed you need to get your sausage wet friend and get drunk and live a little ill send you the redhead shes openminded stratokles shook his head im not really so far gone that i need a barbarian to get me laid he said lucius laughed a fullchested roar that shook the tablets on the table mars and venus friend youre a cool one and no mistake he got up if you dont want her he hobbled across the room his wounded leg barely able to support his weight but he stopped at the stairs what you said about secrets youll keep me on absolutely stratokles said im yours lucius said i know stratokles thought but he didnt say it out loud he just took a sip of wine and ran his eyes over his letter one more time they rode through the night and all through the next day changing horses every hour and changing the mules on the litter twice nestor sent them with guides and a pair of soldiers philip and draco and sophokles the physician he was a poor rider and a constant drain on their spirits complaining at every turn of the road they crossed the plain south of the city riding through long rows of farms kept by mariandynoi helots the farmers watched them from their fields and once a woman sitting on a bench in front of her hovel spat as they rode by their guides were mariandynoi satyrus wondered if either of the pair glaucus or locris felt the same way they crossed the kales river around noon and immediately they were climbing into the mountains of bithynia the guides were stunned at their speed and began to join in complaints about the pace from sophokles and kallista by the time the sun had begun to set even the soldiers were complaining melitta teased them you conquered persia she asked riding up close you must have walked that kept them going another hour they camped on a feeder stream of the kales with the whole valley of the river at their feet and the sea just on the edge of the horizon in the distance philokles made the entire ride in silence he dismounted without a word took out an amphora of wine with some ceremony and emptied it while theron glowered at him then he fell asleep the twins watched hurt but unable to express themselves after a while ignored by the soldiers they made up a bed put kallista into it and fell asleep themselves the next morning they were a mass of stiffness aches and pains kallista was awake and complaining but theron got them all in the saddle an hour after sunrise do you understand that if were caught well all be killed he said everyone get that through your skull or your hangover he added with a glare for philokles no one could keep that pace you set yesterday draco grumbled give us a rest stay behind if you need rest theron shot back leave the litter and ride we have to move faster they rode an hour before kallista began puking she lost her breakfast and proclaimed that she couldnt ride another stade my thighs are bleeding she cried theron rode up to her and pulled her off her horse he put her across his saddle ride he ordered at the noontime halt draco offered satyrus a bite of garlic sausage your tutor intends to ride at this pace all the way to eumenes he asked satyrus gave the macedonian a tired grin happy that the man had decided not to stay mad my sister and i can keep this up for days this is how we ride on the sea of grass philip shook his head id rather die he said he shrugged but i wont just you watch i wont die kallista lay on the patchy mountain grass and sobbed at the end of the halt theron picked her up like a sack of grain and put her across his lap to ride fucking hills is full of thieves draco said watching the hillsides around them as they rode were going too fast for thieves philip said he nodded at theron athlete knows his business at this speed any bandit what sees us gets left in our dust we need a watch tonight draco said he drew his knees together favouring his thighs and trying to sit back on his horses haunches prince you willing to take a trick i hear how youre a swordsman satyrus looked away unsure as he always was with these men whether he was being mocked or praised ill take a watch he said draco pushed his gelding up next to theron three watches you and the spartan me and the boy and philip and the guides he looked at the athenian doctor with thinly disguised contempt and you sophokles can you fight id rather not the doctor said thats fucking helpful you helots what about you the guides locris and glaucus looked at each other were not allowed weapons lord locris said can you throw a javelin draco asked both men nodded after some looking around sling philokles asked it was his first sensible word in a day again both helots looked at each other for some time after a minute locris nodded we can sling he said draco and philokles shared a look draco nodded back why dont you two boys make yourselves slings at dinner he said and ill give each of you a javelin and my warrant that you can carry it thank you lord locris said to the macedonian everyone was a lord to the helots at dinner the two of them sat by the fire unweaving a net bag for the twine and then making slings they wove the fibres braided them really so fast that satyrus couldnt follow their motions philokles watched him watching in sparta a helot can make a weapon out of anything he said the spartiates keep disarming them and the poor bastards never really give up he stroked his beard ten slingers will beat a hoplite every time satyrus wanted to say youre sober but he knew that would be the wrong thing to say i havent had a lesson in weeks he said as if requesting a lesson from your tutor was an everyday thing philokles gave him a tight smile the last three weeks have been nothing but lessons boy sophokles the doctor produced a wineskin here he said offering the skin to philokles have some wine philokles swatted the skin away rat piss he produced his own want some he asked he looked dangerous he thrust the skin at satyrus like a swordsman satyrus sat on his haunches balancing his forearms on his knees no he said i dont want any wine and id rather you didnt have any either his voice broke as he said it philokles scared him when he was this way why do you have to be like this wouldnt you like to know philokles said and started drinking the doctor watched the spartan his face full of anger later he offered wine to melitta and she glared at him keep your wine she said sophokles stalked off still later when they were all in their blankets philokles started to sing satyrus didnt know the tune but it sounded martial with a strong beat the big man was by the fire dancing stomping his feet to the rhythm of the music that he sang the postures of the dance looked like pankration and then they looked like swordsmanship and then they looked like marching philokles dancing was beautiful and he danced on singing as his own accompaniment fucking spartans philip said you people ought to do something about him sophokles said later just before the dog star set the spartan sat suddenly like an olive shaken from the tree and burst into tears it was a long night you look glum brother melitta said she didnt look glum riding freed her somehow and she wore her freedom on her face when she had a horse to ride thinking of harmones golden sandals he said she had four pairs now shes been sold she was the head of the tyrants wardrobe a real job doing something she liked wherell she go draco laughed any brothel will be happy to have her lad she loves the game satyrus shook his head with adolescent vehemence shell be a whore aphrodites tits boy begging your sisters pardon of course but are you in love with her shell land on her feet or her back philip said with a leer i think what my brother is saying melitta said primly is that she might just possibly want more out of life than sweating under the likes of you that reduced the two macedonians to silence for twenty stades the athenian doctor laughed later theyve never considered the possibility that women might be human he said good for you why does he applaud every time we fight among ourselves satyrus asked his sister she laughed youve been to athens she asked satyrus made a show of receiving a blow of course he said just after the noon halt they met a caravan coming the other way two heraklean merchants with salt and alum and a consignment of lapis lazuli on forty donkeys made up the convoy with ten paid guards two of them wounded theron stopped their group at a wide point in the twisting mountain trail and pulled them all to one side so that the donkeys could pass in single file have a fight philokles called one of the merchants rode over the next pass but one is full of bandits old soldiers he looked at the group and the two girls best ride back with us theyll kill you for the women philokles loosened his sword in his scabbard have any wine to sell he asked aggressively the man shrank back a bit from this display i might find you a skin he said he thought that he was being threatened it was obvious from the way he looked up at the hillsides theron glared at philokles philokles paid no attention he paid a silver owl for a skin of wine an unheardof amount and the merchant beamed with friendship drink it in good health he called theron drew his sword while philokles attention was on the merchant and cut the skin right out of philokles hand leaving him holding the neck the wine made a gurgling noise as it poured out into the dust get down and lick it if thats what you want theron said there was no warning philokles launched himself from the back of his mare on to the back of therons mare and the two of them went down on the far side of the horses in a tangle of limbs philokles landed on top and got in two vicious blows at therons head breaking his nose so that blood fountained and satyruss nose hurt in sympathy satyrus edged his horse closer but a macedonian arm blocked him let em fight draco said the spartan bastard has it coming besides i want to see this theron broken nose and all gripped philokles arms and began to force the man off his chest he managed to raise his own hips an amazing feat of strength and then he rolled and tumbled and suddenly he was free dust flew as if they were dogs fighting and satyrus saw theron get a fist in philokles hair and then there was a sickening thud as philokles landed a heavy blow on the corinthians head ten gold darics on the spartan philip said shouldnt somebody stop this sophokles asked the doctor was amused the macedonians ignored him done youre an idiot draco turned to satyrus here youre a prince you hold the money theron was on his feet with the spartans hair in one hand hed taken three heavy blows and his face registered pain but now he stepped in grabbed a hand and suddenly as if by magic he had philokles kneeling in the dust one arm behind his back submit he ordered fuck yourself the spartan spat ill break your arm theron said and put some pressure on the joint philokles roared with rage and kicked back with his right foot for all that he was off balance and in pain it was a shrewd blow but theron had not competed at the olympics for nothing he loosed his hold rotated his hip and avoided the blow and then replaced his hold all as if giving a lesson this time he jerked the spartans head up and his right arm down submit he said or what philokles said despite the pain in his arm socket he managed to roll his own hip and land an elbow in therons gut he broke the hold and rolled away when he rose he could barely raise his right arm melitta slipped off her horse if you two dont stop one of you will be too injured to fight bandits she planted her hands on her hips if he will not submit his drunken foolishness will kill all of us theron said act like a man spartan im not going all out you fool of a spartan i could pull your arm right out shall i or do you have to pretend that you can take me all i hear is talk philokles spat and came forward there was a flash and a sound like a tree branch snapping in the wind and then only theron was standing he was shaking his right hand back and forth apollo lord of games he said fucking spartans philokles lay unconscious in the dust sophokles dismounted in weary disgust and went to look at him glaring at theron all the while locris and glaucus had eyes as round as kraters the last guards from the caravan hurried away exchanging money as they went and laughing nervously satyrus handed draco all the money he had put in his hat it took both macedonians and theron to get the spartan over his horse and they made poor time until philokles recovered consciousness satyrus watched him and met his eye and smiled philokles winked satyrus suppressed his urge to say something instead after ten minutes had gone by he raised a hand halt he said he slipped down from his horse and with some help from philip they got philokles on his feet he walked his horse for some time without speaking and then he climbed painfully on to the beasts back without using his right arm and then he rode with his face in his horses mane they were a silent crew until they made camp can you manage a watch theron asked philokles every head in the camp turned why dont you stand it with me philokles asked i will theron responded philokles looked around i want the doctor on my watch he said his tone said that he was looking for trouble i dont stand watches sophokles said i need a clear head fine philokles said ill just kick you every few minutes satyrus wondered why theron did nothing to interfere but he didnt i want to say something satyrus said to his sister she shook her head emphatically theron has some idea of what hes doing let him do it she rubbed her chin theres something going on philokles and theron and the doctor i dont get it philokles is up to something and theron is in on it satyrus said he didnt get it either and he went to sleep thinking about it it was philokles who woke satyrus for his watch his blankets were warm and his sister had been pressed comfortably against his back and the mountain air even in summer had a bite to it but he rose took the offered spear and sat by the fire with draco draco nodded youve done this before lad he said my mother made us stand watches on the sea of grass he said ill go and look at the horses good lad the macedonian said three or four similar exchanges passed the whole of the watch and then satyrus was in his cloaks again and asleep the next day they awoke to find that both of the guides were gone fled or deserted it was hard to know theyd taken the javelins theyd been given and nothing else the two macedonians were for riding after them philokles shook his head how would we find them he asked they were our guides theyll know the tracks and the hillsides well stick to the path they rode down and down into a deep valley where they halted for lunch the two macedonians were hyper alert but nothing came at them they ate standing by their horses and after they had all switched to fresh they rode on kallista moaned quietly she was on her own pony now and she looked so miserable that no one would mistake her for a beauty the doctor watched the hillsides endlessly an hour from the valley draco rode up past satyrus and pushed his horse close to therons i just saw the flash of metal on the hillside he said right up above us i saw it too philokles said he turned to theron since youre in charge corinthian you can tell us what are we doing theron looked at them were four competent fighting men and a boy who knows which end of the blade to hold and a girl who can kill if she has to if theyre foolish enough to attack us we kill them bandits are all cowards draco grunted not here they aint athlete here theyre like as not veterans of arbela and issus or the fight between athens and macedon the one macedon lost sophokles asked we call it the lamian war even melitta who didnt like the doctor was surprised by the venom in his voice philokles tried to rotate his right arm in its socket and his face clouded with pain any more good ideas corinthian theron smiled at him since youre sober why dont you tell us how to proceed philokles philokles was still he held therons eye steadily and after a pause that went on too long he said i would rather not theron looked around ill go first as soon as they start shooting we ride for it we have fresh beasts and we can outdistance pursuit if the twins would care to give us some archery wed be the better for it melitta grinned i thought that youd forgotten me she took her bow out of her gorytos put that away philokles said dont let them know were on to them draw when they come for us not before and melitta dont let yourself be taken understand ive been pigheaded i should have turned us back when we met the caravan he looked at the ground and then at theron dont let the children be taken speak for yourself philip said he sat straighter lets see how many we can put in the earth eh draco nodded but his lips were pursed theron shook his head if we go back were certain to die he said if we get through the bandits the doctor spoke up his face was white i dont think that this is well thought what if there are very many of them let us go back we can still take ship from heraklea theron didnt even turn his head were not going back this is foolishness the athenian said are you insane we can ride back up the trail a day and go down the gordian passes with a real caravan just turn back spittle flew when he spoke enough talk philokles looked at theron satyrus was sure that there was some exchange in that look then the spartan tucked his heels into his girth and prodded his gelding forward ill go first my arm isnt worth a crap and i might as well eat the first spear he had the set look of a man committed to a course of action we have armour satyrus said draco was dismissive if we put it on theyll know we know theyre there satyrus shook his head we stop and melitta sneaks away to have a piss in a way that can be seen from above get your cuirass on under your chlamys while you pretend to have a dump philip laughed and looked at satyrus as if reappraising him you may make a general yet boy he ruffled satyruss hair theron nodded halt he said he turned to melitta a little too loudly he said very well princess go and relieve yourself with a credible imitation of a shamefaced girl melitta climbed behind a rock to their left and they could hear her muttering to herself as she fumbled with her multiple chitons satyrus had a small thorax of scales from the armour shop he got off his horse on the downhill side his heart pounding and got to his pack animal with a minimum of fuss his thorax was wrapped in goatskin he unrolled it on the ground put the skin back in the basket and pulled the thorax on he laced it up the side himself annoyed at the sound he made then he slipped his sword belt over the whole and pulled his cloak over it this is insanity boy sophokles scrambled up call your sister over and well slip away that spartan is going to his death and taking us all with him satyrus shrugged twice under his armour trying to get the chest to fit it felt tight he unwound one of the laces and redid it he didnt know what to say to the older man so he ignored him he was afraid enough without help the man walked away the two macedonians made a pretty good show of wagering on which of them could piss the farthest then they complained about how long women took and then they argued over their wager until philip threatened to piss on his partner satyruss brain finally realized that they were going to fight it hit him between breaths and his chest grew tighter as if the armour was still laced too hard he met philokles eye scared boy philokles asked satyrus chose nodding as being better than squeaking me too philokles said he flashed a grin still i wont kill anyone this way he winced as he got his left arm into the armour he had picked up pull it tight boy he asked that doctor is scared worse than me satyrus said hmm philokles answered satyrus got philokles into his armour while kallista complained about her thighs horses and the world satyrus didnt think it was an act the doctor sat on his gelding glaring around him as if every rock could vomit bandits and then theron yelled at melitta for being a weaklivered bitch and she came out from behind her rock and they were up and moving satyrus could scarcely breathe he tried to keep his right hand off his sword hilt and his left hand off his bow the trail was steeper here and the sharp bends were so numerous that sightlines were less than a stade on each turn there were no trees at all just scrub and rock and summer meadow grass and more rock any time now philip said about one breath before an arrow hit philokles between the shoulders the arrow didnt penetrate the bronze scale and philokles gave a shout and pressed his gelding into rapid motion behind satyrus the doctors horse panicked and he tried to turn the beast on the narrow road blocking the track satyrus looked all around him saw an arrow coming in and flinched away drawing his own bow his horse leaped forward and he gave it its head and the beast pushed right past philokles and he was in the lead not a position he wanted two arrows hit his horse thumpcrump and the beasts legs collapsed spilling satyrus on to the scree of the trail so that he rolled clear of his dying horse and fell over the edge he fell the length of his own body and all the wind was driven from his lungs as he hit his head rang time passed as he tried to focus his eyes he could hear shouts on the trail above him and then a clash of iron or bronze and then he had control of his lungs and then a few seconds later control of his limbs he was lying on a rock shelf a little wider than his body he got to his feet and started collecting arrow shafts as his fall had dumped the contents of his quiver he grabbed ten or twelve and thrust them back into his gorytos feeling the press of the fighting above him melitta shouted something and he heard the buzz of an arrow he went to the end of the shelf and got a foot up on a projecting boulder his head throbbing as soon as he could look over the trail he saw theron standing over philokles he had his cloak over his arm and his sword in his fist and a man lay in the trail philokles was clutching his knee in the gravel draco and philip were back to back down the trail with a knot of men around them and melitta sat between them still mounted shooting arrows satyrus didnt think anyone had seen him he pushed himself over the edge of the trail and stood up just a few horselengths from theron then he nocked an arrow forcing himself to go slowly to get the nock on the string he breathed in deeply raised his bow only then letting himself look at the desperate fight twenty feet away he chose one of therons opponents the men were in armour but satyrus had all the time in the world to aim at the back of the mans thigh an easy shot at twenty feet the mans leg went out from under him immediately and he rolled and fell they all had armour satyrus was just taking that in when theron freed from one opponent feinted a cut and kicked his other opponent in the shield so that the man went over backwards theron kicked the man between the legs and then finished him with a short thrust to his neck already looking around therons other opponent made the mistake of thinking that philokles was out of action when he stepped across the spartan to attack therons rear philokles left hand locked on his ankle like a vice and philokles scissored his feet up and grabbed the mans waist and pulled him down theron stepped back over the spartan as if they had designed the whole move as a dance and cut the mans throat satyrus had another arrow on his string his sister shot and missed an archer standing on the hillside he ducked but he didnt see satyrus and satyrus could still see him he shot on instinct a little high a little wide to the right for the breeze he watched his arrow fly thrilled as it arced and vanished into the bandits side satyrus saw it all but he didnt see the archer who shot him there was a blast of pain like falling into cold water and then he was out there was a slave market in krateai but it wasnt much just a red mudwalled barrack with a heavy wooden door the town only existed because the mountain roads divided here the northern road going down the valleys to gordia while the southern road went past manteneaon and then turned through the great pass into the plains of anatolia roasting in heat at this time of year a small parcel of slaves probably taken by thieves claimed by no lesser being than the tyrant of heraklea or so the macedonian factor said was bound for gordia satyrus had a bruise on his side as big as his head and the centre of it was livid and leaked pus where the scale armour had deflected the arrows point mostly his ears still rang from time to time and twice he put down his heavy load to vomit and the guards hit him with their canes and laughed at his feeble attempts to puke melitta wanted to kill them both of them she was carrying the heaviest load of her life a basket full of grain purchased with threats in a village lower down the pass it was in fact about half the food that their little caravan had and the water was running out springs were zealously guarded in these steep defiles and the petty lords and bandit kings who ruled from their eyries charged heavily for each beaker of water but their new owner apparently had a soft heart he stopped to get them water and a nights sleep and bought a quantity of food then he offered his whole parcel for sale satyrus and melitta brother and sister right on the edge of adulthood and both startlingly attractive both virgins to a pair of greek merchants they also offered the other girl also a beauty you could tell despite her pale face and her complaining satyrus was naked and had a bad bruise on his side and the girls were clothed and men in the crowd shouted for both of the girls to be stripped one of the soldiers in the caravans escort used the stock of his riding whip to knock a heckler unconscious and that was the end of the salacious catcalls men bid some bid high for the twins but the greek merchants had cash and a seal from some great power down in the green valleys and the men of the town glared lustfully at the girls and the boy as they were shackled and led away one of the two merchants was a spartan by his way of talking he was the worse for wine even at the height of the sun and he probably paid too much for the children for his partner a boeotian glared at him until their little cavalcade rode off down the south fork no one thought to ask how the greeks had happened to have so many horses or why the merchants caravan guards went with the greeks was that necessary melitta asked theron after they had cleared all possible onlookers theron was still calming kallista at some point she had gone from his enemy to his lover and she had shared his blankets almost every night on the road since the fight with the bandits she seemed as infatuated with him as he was with her but even the pretence of a slave auction had driven her into a state not far from madness theron is not listening satyrus said his skin was burned a deep brown from days of riding and days of walking naked in a pack of slaves his feet were harder than theyd ever been before but the first day had been agony for him and he still had an angry red mark on his left arm where the arrow had gone right through his bicep and the wound in his side while not lifethreatening hurt when he breathed heavily the soldiers had cooperated to make his journey as easy as possible but the charade as slaves had been necessary to pass the town hed had to carry a load like a slave and that had inflamed his side and put knots of pain deep into his back the load had been as light as possible but he couldnt be emptyhanded without appearing different and negating the whole disguise he had muscles in his shoulders that hed never had working in the gymnasium and his chest was broader i did not enjoy pretending to be a slave melitta said so were free did you worry that we might not ever get free brother i worry about everything now he said yes i wondered what would happen if bandits hit us again wed be slaves for ever philokles swayed on his horse to some extent he said were all slaves he had taken a cut in his leg in the fight and theron had given him wine for the pain and now he was drinking as hard or harder than before his fight with the corinthian satyrus was indignant i didnt see you walking naked in the sun tutor i saw you drink wine in the shade though their athenian doctor laughed aloud a nasty laugh ditch him he said hes a drunk that brought no reply and they rode in silence while the sun sank there was an old persian station house on the road just south of geza a tiny hamlet that had probably existed to serve the needs of the great kings messengers but a macedonian veteran and his local wife kept the station house and they camped in the yard and the woman fed them on beans and bread we should fight theron said after dinner he drank some water from the well and handed the dipper to satyrus youre bigger and stronger satyrus shrugged whatever he said theron hit him not hard but hard enough to hurt that was the response of a child he said i am your athletics coach you are satyrus of tanais not a slave and not an idiot act the part satyrus of tanais sat for a moment in the mud by the well he thought of thousands of replies bitter sarcastic cutting outrageous youre right of course he said after a pause good for you lets go they walked past some low scrub where the animal pens were to a cropped lawn kept by goats and stripped melitta followed them satyrus hadnt fought anyone since he took the wound in his arm he took his guard carefully and the bigger man circled him and satyrus found himself viewing the fight from a very different perspective than he had the first time the two of them had faced off on the sand in tanais most of all he couldnt see it as a game any more people could die in a fight he knew that now theron had a long reach and he stepped in and grabbed with both hands satyrus blocked and kicked and after a pair of exchanges he was down in the grass a recent contribution from the goats warm and liquid on his thigh and his left side and shoulder screaming with pain dont be so cautious theron said be confident easy for you to say satyrus grunted as he twisted around one of the corinthians long legs theron tipped him and put him down while he was trying to dodge all those kicks he got up and tried again this time he moved in close trying to get inside his coachs reach he tried to be confident and got a mouth full of grass for his efforts he got up and they began to circle again he decided to go for a hold that ended quickly they went ten falls satyruss new muscles served him well in that he could continue and for a blow or two he could match the bigger man but experience told every time and weight and reach and pain his shoulder wound hurt all the time lets just practise some holds theron said after the last fall you are tiring and we are boring your sister so they stood in a line and practised guards and theron moved back and forth between them making simple attacks so that his hands and feet could be blocked when all three of them were breathing hard he picked up his canteen from his clothes and handed it around i never meant the two of you to remain on the road so long he said but draco was sure we were followed until we crossed the mountains we should have gone south after bithynia satyrus shrugged well live he said and a little happiness began to grow in his heart he turned to his sister we will live they had barely spoken in days and they shared a long embrace melitta kissed him on the nose and turned to theron we have to stop philokles from drinking she said for good theron hung his head he he and i it is hard to say this to a child he thinks he failed you and then he feels i have spurned him for kallista he looked at both of them and there is more to this than meets your eyes trust me and trust philokles i do satyrus said i can see that you have a plan melitta said theron wiped sweat off his face with his forearm he paused a moment and said perhaps i have at that melitta turned on her brother kallista wasnt for you anyway why not theron and philokles drinks because he is cursed not because of a silly girl with big eyes she turned back to the corinthian and satyrus thought that she was getting more and more like their mother tomorrow as soon as we have ridden over the pass she said we will get off our horses all together and search all the baggage and destroy every drop of wine in the packs thats a start theron said until we reach a place that will sell wine one step at a time melitta said sister i love you extremely satyrus said he felt as if he was putting on his former self and the last days were a skin that was falling away she hugged him again i love it when you say things like that she said she was serious so he used the embrace to pin her and tickle her ribs until she boxed his ears neither of them saw theron grin the next day the soldiers said that theyd seen bandits ahead theron stopped them beside the road where trees gave cover and sent philokles with draco forward to scout then the rest of them pulled every pack off every mount opened all the baskets collected all the wine and dumped it until the last amphora but one leaked its red contents into the purple dust the athenian sat on his horse and laughed his laugh at them hes a winebibber he said a cisternass youll never get it all satyrus ignored him and went back to searching he was appalled to find how many jars of wine were secreted in the packs almost every armour pack had something but he watched the two macedonian soldiers again amazed at the skill with which they searched philip had an amphora to his mouth he took a long pull and handed it to satyrus last grape until we get the spartan off the sauce he said satyrus drank some and passed it to melitta who drank a little and handed the jar to theron who took a long pull and gave it to kallista who finished it what about me the athenian asked you can have some when you start helping doctor philip said they loaded all the panniers and baskets and bundles tied everything down and rode on the fun started when they made camp when philokles began his search he at least pretended discretion but then he went on with increasing desperation its all gone melitta said she walked up behind him as he searched one of the armour baskets philokles turned on her his eyes wild all gone tutor every drop its two days travel back to the last town and ten days forward we all love you and well stand by you she offered her hand to him satyrus watched with a lump in his throat theron and the macedonians pretended to be doing something else the doctor watched with the insolence of a man watching bad theatre philokles made a grunting noise after a few minutes it became sobbing then he was silent the silence lasted a day on the second night philokles got wine from somewhere and he drank it then he was sick violently sick so sick that he puked his guts out the doctor looked him over sprawled on his blankets fastidiously he listened at the spartans chest and felt his neck and wrist he pursed his lips and shook his head nothing i can do he said when a man tries to kill himself with drink he will theron glared at the athenian and made philokles drink salt water until he puked again then he sat with his arm around philokles nobody slept much the next day philokles lay on the ground barely breathing the macedonians walked around the camp muttering and satyrus threw javelins and spent too much time squatting beside the spartan is he actually trying to kill himself he asked theron kallista came and sat gracefully by them i tried to kill myself once she said in a matteroffact voice she looked at the doctor in an almost teasing voice she said and i almost died of poison once theron looked at both of them as if considering something melitta came and sat by the slave girl where did he get wine she asked theron shrugged we missed something melitta looked at satyrus who shook his head philip and draco went through every basket he said i watched them theyve been trained to search sophokles came up laid the back of his hand on the spartans cheek and shrugged you missed something i told you that you would then he went and sat near kallista he laid two fingers lightly on her cheek but she shook him off and he smiled at her melitta watched therons face as he caught the physical exchange he was angry satyrus watched the three of them there was something between the girl and the doctor theron was now the girls lover satyrus rubbed his chin and his wandering eyes found his sisters somewhere in the contact there was a spark of illumination of course satyrus said his eyes and his sisters locked in silent communication we never searched your packs he raised his eyes from melittas and looked at sophokles im not denying that i have some wine sophokles said its medicinal and for my own consumption theron shot to his feet when the athenian attempted to move one of therons long arms pinned him open his pack he said i like the spartan kallista said she seemed to be speaking to the air i dont care who you like slave the doctor said i dont want him to die she said heal him satyrus opened the doctors bedroll the outer layer was a pair of goatskins inside were two chlamyses with a cup a very elegant leather bag and a pair of amphorae wrapped in wolf skin the amphorae were themselves beautiful black with red and white figures dancing keep your hands off those boy the doctor said bring them here theron said in a voice of bronze satyrus obeyed kallista looked at melitta for a long time melitta met her gaze satyrus watched the two of them while he walked back and felt disoriented he was surrounded by secrets even his sister had them they were staring at each other the doctor was staring at kallista then he looked up be careful with those he said chian wine the best his voice had an odd inflection make him drink it kallista said her voice had a dreamy quality to it shut up slave girl the athenian spat this has gone far enough melitta shook her head she had stopped staring at kallista have you chosen your side girl she asked the slave girl looked away now or never melitta said kallista looked at satyrus satyrus understood it all in a moment of inspiration as if athena had whispered the whole plot in his ear he drew his sword and stood by the slave girl we can protect you he said melitta gave him the look of a sister who is glad her brother has a brain choose she said imperiously kallista hung her head so that her hair covered her face hes no doctor not really youre a liar whore the athenian shot back he kills for money kallistas voice was calm i dont have to listen to this filth sophokles said he began to squirm in therons grip kallista has chosen her side traitor melitta said you tried to poison us and her and now youve poisoned philokles sophokles looked around foolishness you may be a princess but you have the soft head of a woman i saved her when she was poisoned and theron tightened his grip inspiration written on his face the spartan saved her he said carefully you put on a show i didnt see it at the time he nodded at the recumbent spartan he did he saw through you you bastard how long have you known satyrus asked his sister about two minutes she answered with a hard smile kallista told me with her eyes when you got the wine shes in on it too then draco said he drew his sword yes kallista said she sighed they offered me money and freedom she looked around i meet the offer melitta said proudly youll be free in days kallista it was all too fast for satyrus he looked back and forth you have no proof the doctor said this is insane i dont need proof draco said fuck he must have been planted on the court who sent you you asscunt his sword flashed as he hit the athenian with the bronze hilt the doctor if he was indeed a doctor was unprepared for the leap to violence and he went down clutching his head theron jumped him and pinned him again in a classic possession hold head back arm locked and near breaking stop theron said the doctor tried to struggle and there was a burst of activity as he did something but whatever his surge of wriggling meant it failed to overcome therons impassive grip satyrus and melitta exchanged another glance satyrus got up would you like to live he asked the doctor couldnt even look up of course he said if he was aiming for arrogance he missed he sounded worried terrified satyrus tried to look at kallista save philokles and i will let you live betray your employer and i will let you go he looked around theron nodded and after a minute draco shrugged fair enough prince but i can get it out of him anyway draco smiled with just half his mouth fucking traitor fucking athenians eh too right mate philip said he had a small very elegant knife in his hand steel a slot of brilliant blue in the sun give me a minute just a minute and ill see to it that we know all he has to tell swear by zeus soter that youll let me go sophokles said i swear by zeus soter that i will do nothing to harm you and that if you betray your employer i will let you go free satyrus said make your friends swear the athenian said i swear that i will order that you not be harmed he looked around for one day i swear theron said i swear melitta said i swear by zeus soter that you deserve to die and i hope it comes to you soon kallista said but i swear not to harm you today philip and draco shrugged at each other listen prince this is a big thing if he betrayed our tyrant his life is forfeit its not your place satyrus stood his ground i understand you but im here and dionysius of heraklea is far away a days grace thats all i swear to he can have a day philip looked at draco i dunno draco nodded we swear by zeus soter not to harm him for one day philokles gave a snort there you have it athenian save him or die the doctor took a ragged breath in the leather satchel theres a small black pot thats it give him some with water satyrus mixed it himself while theron kept the athenian pinned it wont work for an hour the doctor squawked you going to pin me the whole time he shook his head this whole thing is messed up he should be dead you should all be dead no one bothered to answer him draco heated water and satyrus added the orange powder at the doctors directions then he spooned it into the spartans mouth now for your employer draco said the athenian shrugged stratokles he hired me the man looked around now let me go melitta shook her head draco how long has this man been at the tyrants court draco shrugged two months since the feast of herakles anyway how long has stratokles been in heraklea satyrus asked mostly just to show that he knew where his sister was going philip glared draco glanced at the twins with open admiration you two are good at this he said sophokles looked disappointed satyrus almost had to admire his courage he himself would be gibbering in terror at this point but his hatred for the man grew it was as if he was flaunting his contempt for them stratokles hired me he said long before either of us came to heraklea melitta spat as sakje did when showing contempt you lie she said youve all sworn your oaths the man said so let me go ive told you all that i have to tell satyrus tried to imitate philokles delivery its a pretty piece of sophistry he said to pretend that after weeks of betrayal and multiple murder attempts we could be in the wrong by breaking your interpretation of our oaths he shrugged i admire you for trying though he said damn that was good right to the sarcasm stratokles the doctor insisted thats all i know he knows more than that kallista said youre dead you know that sophokles said you are fucking dead all of you really tyche preserved you this far ive never been so unlucky in all my days as the last three weeks and this drunk fuck on the ground somehow managed to keep me away from your food at every turn until i figured out that it wasnt all luck so fuck yourself kallista i know you know how in fact i might tell them what you did for me does theron know how many of us you service theron turned at her and she hid her face maybe that will serve you right you faithless bitch sophokles spat he knows who employs him us kallista said she sighed i hate him he scares me i wish you would all kill him but he knows she looked around as if she expected the little valley to sprout enemies he kills for olympias and yes theron ive fucked him when he made me i serviced them all when ordered i know youre dead sophokles said again i hope that you choke on the next dick you suck harlot porne sperm bag theron was grunting with anger his face was splotchy with rage and his great hands clenched and unclenched satyrus kicked the athenian in the head it was a hard kick and he probably broke the mans jaw thats for sowing poison with your mouth traitor he stepped away a man like you demeans all men lets just waste him draco said he sounded happy to do it his blue knife flashed philip turned to satyrus listen lad he said you cant play this game by the rules dracos right lets kill him sophokles suddenly realized that hed gone too far he could barely talk but he managed no you swore listen to me shes a fool by saying that name shes written all your death warrants and probably mine as well we dont say that name you swore let me go his mask of contemptuous bravery was gone it was very instructive for satyrus at a certain level he was learning something about the game of ruling and something about what bravery was and evil if that was the word dont do it philokles whispered what satyrus asked he looked at the spartan who was white as alum leather and whose eyes were rimmed in red but they were open oath gods philokles head which had only been raised a fraction sank back on to his blanket satyrus turned to his sister lita he asked mama would gut him like a salmon she said in sakje our father would let him go he answered after a moment she nodded yes she said satyrus stepped up close to the traitor listen he said you think that you will have revenge on this girl on me on my sister he could see the mans rage his helplessness his intention to harm the man had taken to killing because he was weak satyrus could see that it was very instructive satyrus leaned close i say let the gods decide who lives i give you a proven oathbreaker and your foul mistress to the furies he took a breath his chest felt heavy and there was something in the air moira give him a horse satyrus said to the soldiers draco looked uncomfortable but theron nodded his hands were trembling but his voice was steady give him a horse none of his kit minutes later the athenian galloped away they didnt move again the next day satyrus held the two macedonians until the sun was as near to the height of the oath as he could then he let them go youre close to eumenes draco said as he mounted i can smell his greek breath from here he reached down and clasped hands with theron and then satyrus youll go far boy if the gods do as they ought in which case well kill that athenian bastard before tomorrow night philip added travel well the two macedonians cantered away into the afternoon and left the party poorer by a great deal of foul language and humour satyrus missed them immediately but philokles was better if very quiet the next morning philokles was pale but he could rise from his blankets and after some sweating he managed to mount his horse two days later they were descending the mountains towards the great plains of the south on the third day the twins cornered philokles while he loaded his packs in the morning weve come to thank you melitta said and to beg you to stay with us satyrus said were sorry we took so long to figure out what you were doing with the doctor i had to be sure philokles said he shook his head i used to be very good at that game children i thought i could catch him and turn him or catch him and use him to spot other trouble we outsmarted each other he looked down wine doesnt help i drank when i should have been sober and i almost lost everything crap melitta said you saved us lets not have any sudden drama master without you wed be poisoned i have humiliated myself i am no use to you and i cannot possibly teach you after my my the spartans voice cracked something like a sob escaped from him get on your horse and ride at my side melitta said i am srayankas daughter and kineass and you swore to protect me please continue to do just that no excuses that is just what i mean philokles said in something like his normal voice you can order me like that because i have failed you so often i cannot teach you ethics i can only teach weakness i smell horseshit melitta said you protected us from the doctor bah philokles said turning away drunkards luck im a fool i cannot play this game any longer stop melitta called listen philokles you have saved our lives fifty times we owe you more than we can repay she shook her head get us to diodorus and you may have your release if you demand it philokles stood with his back to them very well he growled satyrus looked at his sister as if hed seen a ghost you sure you know what youre doing he asked no she said im doing what i think mum would do she put her head on his shoulder whats wrong with people aphrodite and ares brother kallista acts as if fucking is the only way she can talk philokles drinks to forget things he had to do for us theron thinks that hes a failure because he didnt win the olympics the only ones who acted like adults were the soldiers and theyre a smug pair of thugs well put sister i think being an adult is harder than it looks satyrus said melitta stifled a giggle mind you satyrus said the hardest part still seems to be staying alive and i think weve got that part licked melitta shook her head dont tempt the fates she said four days later they found eumenes army or rather it found them just a few minutes after they completed the descent of the last range of hills into the plains of karia their group was surrounded by armoured horsemen arent you kids a little far from home the officer asked he had a red and grey beard sticking out from under a silvermounted thracian helmet and a tigerskin saddlecloth diodorus melitta screeched she flung her arms around his heavily armoured torso he flipped his cheekpieces open and tilted the helmet back on his head whats happened he asked homes gone satyrus said heron killed mum even now two months on his voice choked when he said it upazan took the valley diodorus looked as if hed been punched and after a moment he wept and the word spread among his patrol and they heard shouts of rage and men rode up to embrace the twins a big blond man almost as old as diodorus dismounted and drew his sword he knelt in the dust and held the hilt out to satyrus take my oath lord he said melitta dried her eyes on the back of her hand dont be silly hama diodorus is your captain kineas was my chief hama said and then srayanka now you andronicus the gaul grey at the temples and still lean came and crushed her in an embrace and antigonus still big and blond gave her a gaulish bow he was diodoruss hyperetes and he had a fortune in gilded bronze armour on his back and rode a heavy nisaean charger all of the dozens of other men she knew who came up and knelt or grasped their knees or touched their hands looked prosperous carlus the biggest man either of them had ever seen slipped off his charger and came to kneel beside hama he too presented his sword the sword was hilted in silver and had a pommel of crystal war had been kind to the hippeis of tanais they werent just weeping for srayanka either most of these men had had wives and children even small fortunes in tanais and now they were gone diodorus shook his head this wont be good for morale he said hades twins i wish id known you were coming with this sort of news he shook his head i know it seems paltry beside the loss of your mother but we have a battle today tomorrow soon he pointed across the plain where a dust cloud rolled north antigonus oneeye with alexanders army then he saw philokles sitting quietly with the baggage animals he went over and embraced the spartan i missed you he said i broke my oath philokles said i have killed diodorus shook his head the stamp of his tears still plain on his face you worry about the strangest things brother he put his arms around the spartan again and unaccountably philokles began to weep for the first time in days weeks even melitta rode up close to her brother it will all be better now she said just watch satyrus shook his head he was looking at the dust to the north this is going to be a big battle he said melitta glanced from her beloved philokles to the dust so she asked satyrus watched the dust which seemed to be stuck in his mouth as well as his eyes off the griddle and into the fire he said quietly e umenes camp sprawled across several stades of scrub and red dirt and the smell hit them while they were still a stade away raw excrement human and animal from forty thousand people and twenty thousand animals a hundred of them elephants tents of linen and hide stretched away in disorderly rows intermixed with hasty shelters made from branches every tree on the plain was gone cut by thousands of foragers from both sides to fuel thousands of fires the smoke from the fires rose with the stench thats the smell of war diodorus said welcome to war lad antigonuss camp looks bigger satyrus said he has a bigger army he has every mede cavalryman in the east asia must be empty hes got bactrians and saka diodorus watched the enemy camp see the patrol going out those are saka with some macedonians for stiffening the enemy camp was so close that satyrus could see the flash of gold from the saka horses why are the massagetae fighting for my enemies melitta asked someone should speak to them diodorus shook his head you are your mothers daughter lass why dont you just ride over there whoa that was what passes for humour around here he had a hand across her chest honey bee im taking you to my wife and shes going to look after you greek maidens dont belong in army camps i am not a greek maiden melitta said i am a sakje maiden diodorus took a deep breath and looked at philokles theyre growing up philokles said he spread his hands i couldnt stop them diodorus gave his friend a look that indicated that he held the spartan responsible let me get you children under cover he said philokles rode up next to diodorus theyve both killed he said theyve fought and stood their ground satyrus felt as if he might swell from the praise they arent children philokles said diodorus let out another breath very well satyrus would you care to come with me satyrus nodded politely and the cavalcade rode on they passed through two rings of sentries to enter the camp the outer ring was cavalry small groups of them spread wide apart a few mounted and the rest standing by their horses closer in spearmen stood in clumps where there was shade eumenes was being careful where are the elephants satyrus asked the opposite side of the camp from the enemy diodorus replied antigonus made a grab for them last year nasty trick we only just stopped it we cant put them with the horses horses spook so they have their own camp where its safest may i see them later satyrus asked ill take him lord hama said diodorus nodded listen twins im a strategos here a man of consequence i love you both but were a day or two from the largest battle since arbela and i wont have much time for you understand whats the battle about satyrus asked diodorus looked at him you really want to know satyrus nodded i know that eumenes is one of the contenders for alexanders empire and antigonus oneeye is another i know that ptolemy is backing eumenes because antigonus is a bigger danger to aegypt then you know more than most of my cavalrymen diodorus said were fighting for the treasury at persepolis and the allegiance of the persian nobles winner take all this is the olympics boy the winner of this battle should be able to reconquer all alexander took unless unless melitta asked what am i your war tutor unless the price is too high and the battle wrecks both armies diodorus squinted south into the dust eumenes and antigonus have each beaten the other eumenes is a superb general but he forgets hes not a homeric hero antigonus is not a superb general but he tends to get the job done and his preparations are always excellent now is that enough i have several thousand men to see to of course melitta shot back do you think were foolish ill see to them a handsome blond man said he made a barbarian bow from his saddle he had a pair of gold lion fibulae and gold embroidery on his cloak and a sword that seemed to be made from a sheet of beaten gold he was covered in dust crax philokles said it has been a long time crax bowed again a broad smile dimpling his round getae face you look prosperous philokles said i like gold crax said he drew his sword and presented the hilt to melitta i was swordsworn to your mother now i will swear to you both of you that is a beautiful sword satyrus said you like it lord it is yours crax said philokles laid a hand on satyruss shoulder gift it back to him he whispered if you are his lord he must give you anything you ask melitta put her hands on either side of the sword hilt you are our man and our knight she said using the sakje words satyrus reversed the sword and handed it back it pleases me for you to have this he said it is one of the finest swords ive seen as fine as papas crax took the sword back with pleasure he turned to diodorus we waited all night strategos we were not discovered neither did the gods give us a challenge we collected a dozen prisoners and returned by the secret way diodorus nodded get some rest crax commands my scouts melitta leaned forward may i ask a question uncle diodorus nodded although there were other men waiting for him under the awning of a striped tent go ahead he said where is ataelus she asked off with leon searching the oceans for lost money perhaps in the hesperides fetching golden apples not here where i need him diodorus slipped off his big charger and a swarm of slaves took his horse and began to take off the tack as soon as his feet hit the ground men fighting for his attention surrounded him take them to sappho diodorus ordered then he was lost in his staff crax kept them mounted with the wave of a hand this is his command tent he said he sleeps in our camp come they rode off unnoticed in the masses of soldiers servants and slaves who filled the camp they passed wide streets and narrow streets stalls selling produce and wine and a hidecovered brothel whose occupants were as noisy as the animals in the street outside much to satyruss embarrassment and his sisters amusement the camp was larger and better populated than most of the towns that passed for cities on the euxine satyrus tried not to stare as they rode although there was more to contemplate than youd ever see in a town there were no walls and no courtyards so that every business was plied in the open boys squatted in front of tents polishing bronze helmets or putting white clay on leather corslets to make them whiter a swordsharpener hawked his talents to a pair of argyraspids men in their fifties with shields faced in solid silver and inlaid with amber and ivory phrygian infantrymen stood in groups having just left an inspection and a squadron of lydian lancers cantered by shouting and laughing their officer wore a garland of roses and he bowed to melitta and then blew her a kiss a porne knelt in the mud of a street servicing a client while he dictated orders a pair of dirty children sold sweets off a broad leaf the twins drank it in as if they had been starved philokles told an abbreviated version of their adventures to crax and introduced theron who seemed as stunned as the children at the spectacle around him the getae man pointed to a magnificent pavilion in scarlet and yellow that towered over every other tent in the central area banugul crax said remember her philokles laughed its rather like muster day for old friends he said satyrus couldnt tell whether he was joking or not but his attention drifted when kallista threw back the shawl on her hair and immediately drew whistles and more vocal attention she smiled on every admirer theron watched her going into business he asked his voice tense she pouted and flipped her shawl back over her head philokles shook his head you cant transform a porne into a wife overnight he said and i believe that she is the slave of my mistress theron glared at the spartan ahh the philosopher is back he said perhaps you would like to give me some sage advice i would philokles said but you wouldnt take it i scarcely ever take my advice myself but that doesnt mean it isnt good did you find all this wisdom in your amphora of wine theron spat there and elsewhere philokles returned but the comment hurt him satyrus could tell she will not do well with jealousy philokles said and you are an expert with women i find theron said really it is a pleasure to have you sober theron shut up melitta said philokles please dont be offended theron is as happy to find you returned without your illdaimon as we are he has forgotten his place and will apologize theron if you ever wish to lie with my serving maid again youll apologize theron shook his head you are going to be a formidable woman melitta mistress philokles im sorry he extended his hand the spartan took it as am i kallista glared at all of them from under her shawl i was only playing she said melitta nodded ask my permission next time she said your actions reflect on me satyrus watched it all with admiration but while they were dismounting he said i thought that you were against slavery i am his sister agreed but if you are going to do a thing do it well kallista needs a mother since she doesnt have anyone but me ill do it as her owner and then they were led into a tent with cool dark panels of bluegreen canvas sappho a family friend since they were born reclined on a couch fanned by a pair of children she sat up as soon as they were escorted in children i have wine and cakes for you i heard that srayanka is dead im sorry to be so blunt my wits are astray and im an old woman she spoke at random her arms wrapped around both of them satyrus had forgotten her smell a wonderful smell of incense and musk and flowers no one in the world smelled like sappho and she was as beautiful at fortyfive as she had been at twentyfive her beauty the outward form of a hardwon happiness her shoulders were held high and her skin soft her face lined with both laughter and pain but more enhanced by the lines than aged especially when she smiled her eyes were unchanged large and liquid they both kissed her and allowed themselves to be held while slaves bustled around them and then they were taken away to another tent to be bathed satyrus was mortified to be bathed by women as if he was a child but he was clean for the first time in thirty days he found his riding boots and a fresh chiton on a stool and he put them on melitta had beaten him to it although she seemed embarrassed to be dressed in a long womans chiton and gilded sandals to sappho she said i cannot ride like this please domina i am not a greek woman sappho shook her head you are while under my tent my dear she said there is likely to be a battle women dressed as men will be in danger melittas brow furrowed i can be raped to death as effectively in this kit as in my trousers she shot back where did you learn such things sappho asked war is awful but no one is going to be raped to death here sold into slavery is more likely she raised an eyebrow i would know from my mother melitta answered but she had lost the initiative sappho who had endured the sack of thebes had survived rape and worse and melitta had no answer for her calm if you wish to go riding sappho agreed i will see to it that you dress appropriately in the meantime you will be a greek maiden for a while and that slave of yours she said reaching out a long white arm to point at kallista she is a hetaira not a maidservant why do you have her shes worth a few talents it is a long story despoina satyrus said melitta inherited her from kinon uncle leons factor in heraklea we promised to free her sappho crooked a finger at the beautiful girl more beautiful still now that her hair was clean and she had on a clean gown come here my beauty can you dress hair she asked kallista nodded and perfumed oil i imagine you know how to apply it she asked kallista looked at the ground under her feet your mistress came into my tent looking like a cross between a barbarian warrior and a ragpicker do you have any excuse sappho asked she had the other girls wrist between her fingers please mistress we were in disguise people tried to kill us kallistas voice was breathy hmm sappho said she looked at melitta i can give you a far better maidservant and have this one sold shed benefit herself with that body and voice shell be free before shes twenty sapphos look at the girl was not unkind youll never purchase your freedom as a maid dear we promised to free her satyrus said we owe her sappho nodded sharply very well well discuss this later satyrus you are to go with crax to see the elephants melitta will stay with me i see that i have a great deal to catch up on despoina satyrus said in his newfound voice we are not children please aunt dont be offended but weve spent a month being chased and poisoned weve killed men and seen things he kept his voice steady by force of will melitta is not a child neither am i sappho reached out and took their hands in hers i hear it in your voices dears but it is exactly because you are not children that i must be so careful especially with your sister she could be married any day and her reputation will matter to her melitta stamped her foot which didnt do her case any good at all satyrus feeling like a traitor slipped out of the complex of tents with a cleaner crax by his side its not fair he said to crax and to philokles who was waiting by the horses its not fair he said again shes always been allowed to ride and hunt shes braver than i am philokles gave him a hard look i doubt it boy he said crax shrugged greeks hate women he said he shrugged again i dont know why afraid maybe he smiled well break her out lad but listen lady sappho well shes the only wife in this camp theres some soiled flowers of various shades but shes the only wife she needs somebody to talk to hear me satyrus shrugged want to see some elephants crax asked vaulting on to his mares back satyrus banished thoughts of his sister yes the elephants were huge not only were they the largest animals satyrus had ever seen they were many times larger than anything in his experience horses and camels they had long wicked tusks that looked like curved white swords and they made noises that all but panicked his horse on the other hand their eyes had a curious intelligence are they as smart as a horse he asked crax fucked if i know the getae replied lets ask a mahout hey indiaman he shouted at a wrinkled brown man sitting in the shade the elephantkeeper stood from his crosslegged squat with a foreign elegance and walked over master he asked are they intelligent satyrus asked yes the man said with an odd singsong inflection to his greek very smart smarter than horse or cow or dog smart like person he patted a big cowelephant on the shoulder like person they dont make war until man teach them he shrugged even then they wont fight unless they have men on their backs hesitantly satyrus patted the heavy skin of the animals shoulder it was crisscrossed with scars she has been in battle he asked since she was five years now she has fifteen years ten big fights and ten more the mahout beamed with pride a sad pride satyrus thought he spoke to her in another language liquid and rather like a paean satyrus thought she raised her head i tell her battle comes the indiaman shrugged expressively men teach them war but when they make war so much he shrugged again and smiled like a drunk man with wine so is an elephant trained to war and a battle war has the same effect on some men philokles said yes the indiaman said like elephants man can be taught to love anything even murder youre a strange one for a soldier crax said he grinned at philokles longlost brother of yours the indiaman had a name which proved to be something like tavi so tavi was what they called him they spent most of the afternoon roaming the elephant camp meeting the beasts none of them seemed very warlike despite their size let them smell you tavi said let them see you then they know you on the day of battle satyrus submitted to being smelled and in some cases prodded by elephants he fed them nuts and grass delighted by the manipulations of their trunks and the play of intelligence in their beady little eyes i want to be a mahout he exclaimed with twelveyearold enthusiasm tavi put him up on the older cow and he rode on the beasts neck with the indiaman behind him he was allowed to carry the goad and he tapped the old girl called grisna on her shoulder and she turned obediently this is power he said to philokles and crax when he had jumped down from the beasts neck more proof if any were needed that war is the ultimate tyrant philokles said these beasts are as intelligent as men he shook his head more intelligent in that tavi says they wont make war without men crax bit his lip always you say war is so wrong he said why how do you stop an invader how do you keep your freedom by talk philokles made a clicking noise with his tongue and nodded to the getae thats the root of the matter isnt it crax you must train every man in the world out of his love for war at the same time if you leave just one hell drag the rest of us back to ares bloody altar crax glanced around as if looking for another speaker so im right he asked philokles looked at the elephants too right he turned away dinner was a subdued affair punctuated by satyruss excited descriptions of the elephants and of tavi the mahout who had made a lasting impression on him and on philokles but sappho was attentive to her husband and diodorus was far away he would listen with a smile on his face to an elephant story and then his eyes would drift off the speaker and he would eat absently is it upon us sappho asked as the roast kid was cleared away im sorry diodorus said im not happy with the arrangements for my wing excuse me for a moment he rolled off his couch and went to the door of the tent and called one of his officers they could all hear him speaking and the brief replies and then he was back thats better diodorus said when he returned will we fight tomorrow philokles asked yes diodorus said crax pulled in a dozen prisoners today and andronicus brought in as many yesterday they all say the same thing antigonus will form his line of battle in the morning sappho bit her lip but when she spoke her voice was light then we must get you to sleep early my dear youll be up in the dark you are the best soldiers wife in this army diodorus said fondly faint praise indeed she returned considering that im the only wife around what of the children philokles asked diodorus shook his head theyll stay in camp of course i expect that well fight on the plain to the north theyll be safe enough here shall i find you a corslet philokles no thanks ive never accustomed myself to the idea of fighting on horseback and i dont care to stand among strangers asiatic strangers at that ill stay in camp with the children theron nodded as will i strategos without offence this is not my fight and i have equipment only as a hoplite diodorus looked at the two of them and smiled i could base one hell of a taxeis on you two he said theron youre like a second philokles ill bet youre a terror in the scrum theron shook his head ive never done it he said ive drilled with the ephebes and ive fought men but ive never stood my ground like my father at chaeronea philokles smiled grimly you havent missed a thing he said sapphos steward came in and bowed deeply master there are more and more men waiting outside asking for the strategos diodorus wiped his mouth excellent meal my love i must go and listen to eumenes fears and worries i remember him as a firstrate commander philokles said he is but the macedonians hate him for not being macedonian one of the reasons he hired me is to have a greek officer on whom he can rely but even that has made trouble the macedonians dislike me all of us really they havent changed much have they philokles asked he and diodorus both smiled sharing some memory satyrus thought that it was like dining with the gods to hear such things they discussed the great eumenes the cardian as if he were just someone they knew like a playmate theron sat up on his couch i heard some things i didnt much like today he said about greeks about eumenes diodorus looked around and lowered his voice you notice that i came back to my own regiment to eat and sleep that we have our own guards and were a little separated from the rest of the army its that bad friends if we lose tomorrow if we even look as if were losing this army will disintegrate the idiots in the argyraspids would rather kill eumenes because hes a greek than beat antigonus who hates them sappho drank wine carefully held her cup out to a slave to have it refilled and spoke slowly you have never spoken so directly husband she said should i make preparations diodorus rubbed his beard its never been so bad i suspect that oneeye is putting bribes into the argyraspids but i cant figure out how he does it i keep telling eumenes to parade banugul and her brat to quieten the hardliners thats banugul who claims to have been alexanders mistress and herakles her son sappho said with a significant look at her husband hes just your age or a little younger and the very image of alexander she smiled but her eyes did not smile she herself is unchanged to the twins she said banugul is the inveterate enemy of olympias her son herakles threatens everything olympias aims at she shrugged she should be your ally diodorus spoke over his wife as if she hadnt made a sound but he wont says that hes not going to run his army through a child yes sappho theres going to be trouble in fact im pushing us into a battle to see if we can beat oneeye before the macedonians assassinate my employer he shrugged all in a days work sappho summoned her steward eleutherius collect a string of horses and pack animals and have us packed and ready to move by first light leave the tents standing and all their contents just pack the clothes and bedding and what wed need to live eat and move fast diodorus got off his couch leaned over his wife and kissed her it was embarrassing for the other men in the room because it was a lustful kiss and it went on for too long when he broke off she slapped him lightly im not a flute girl she said diodorus kissed her again no you are the best staff officer in this camp you just come with certain other benefits im off i may join you later and i may be up all night he glanced around the tent and lowered his voice ive given the boys a rally point in case of the worst its a stade behind the gully the gully thats south of here philokles you should get with crax and see that you know the spot may i rely on you to get the hippeis women and children there if it all goes bad philokles was eyeing a wine cup he rubbed his chin yes he said thats a big responsibility youve handled bigger diodorus said he took a purple and dustcoloured thracian cloak from a slave and swung it on to his shoulders go with the gods philokles said diodorus gave a sketchy salute and went out of the dining tent sappho rolled off her couch bed right now children well be up before the cock crows and in sensible clothes for riding satyrus looked at his sister were good at riding he said melitta looked triumphant i know its wrong to hope we lose she said but im already stifled i dont want to be a good greek maiden a kore a few minutes later they were on their sleeping couches listening to the bustle of a dozen slaves packing all around them each of them thought it would be hard to get to sleep and then they did s atyrus saw the sunrise already dressed and in boots with his corslet under his cloak and a broad straw hat tossed back over his shoulder it was a spectacular sunrise pink and grey and red and gold and he kept glancing at it while he helped theron pack the two baggage mules they had brought all the way from heraklea all around them in the semidark were men moving into the battle line about eight stades from the camp the deployment was carefully organized although satyrus watched it critically thinking how it might be done better men gathered at the heads of their camp streets by group and then the groups were formed up in taxeis and moved off the bettertrained groups marched with flute players playing and shieldbearers stepping as proudly as the phalangites in the ranks but many the phrygians the many thracians and lydians and karians simply wandered off after an officer or a nobleman that they knew staff officers resplendent in bronze and iron with big plumes of dyed horsehair rode up and down the mobs of moving men calling constantly artabarzes karian javelins no no youre on the right wing in the rough ground no sir you must march this way and philip white shields yes sir centre of the line with the silver shields on your right yes sir when the baggage animals were ready and sappho had ordered them all moved to the rear of the camp the twins walked up to the head of their street to watch the grand parade of the army they were just in time to watch the elephants come past sixty enormous beasts that seemed to personify the power of war each one festooned with red and gold blankets with gold bands and bronze breastplates or headplates their mahouts often as well armoured as generals thats tavi satyrus cried and began waving like mad the indiaman now looking like a brown achilles in a purple chiton and a scale corslet with alternating rows of gold and silver scales raised his prod itself a weapon and saluted them behind him a pair of macedonians with long sarissas waved at the children on their street the fourth troop of diodoruss mercenaries all the men who had had a night watch or other duties were collecting and mounting and as the elephants passed every man sprang to hold his horses head their horses stamped and fidgeted until the last elephant walked slowly past then crax vaulted into the saddle and bellowed for the troop to mount he looked down through the swirling dust at the twins stay safe he said if it all goes to shit rally behind the gully right satyrus nodded and crax gave a salute with his fist and the troop swung into line on the road moving slowly at first then faster until they vanished into the rising cloud of dust every trooper saluted the twins as they rode past and many of the keltoi reached out and touched melitta for luck i want to watch the battle satyrus said to philokles me too melitta said philokles shook his head of course he said he pointed at the bluff from where they had first seen the camp he and theron collected horses and the four of them mounted where are you going sappho asked she was dressed in persian trousers and a sakje jacket and her hair hung in braids please aunt we want to see the battle melitta said philokles will go up on the bluff with us sappho considered for a moment im sending a slave with you targis go with master philokles and the children bring me word if anything untoward should happen she walked aside with philokles they spoke in low voices for a minute and then sappho was in philokles arms weeping satyrus saw it but he wasnt sure hed really seen it because a moment later she was issuing orders the only sign of her tears a certain redness around her eyes philokles came back to them targis philokles said politely he was always polite to slaves come with us please targis was a pale blond man with long legs he looked like a runner he nodded to his mistress and followed the group i wonder what happened to philip and draco satyrus asked philokles raised an eyebrow i doubt they could come to any harm he said i miss them satyrus said youre starting to see that theres a world beyond yourself philokles said they rode up the bluff at a trot with targis running hard behind them the blond man ran easily his arms pumping away theron admired his form hes trained in a gymnasium theron said when they stopped theron waved at the slave you were an athlete he asked the slave averted his eyes i was not born a slave he said no one is born a slave melitta said men make each other slaves philokles glanced at the girl you show signs of real wisdom girl where did you learn such things melitta blushed from you master she said bah philokles said ive never said anything as well put satyrus barely heard them his attention was already fixed on the broad stretch of flat plain to the north and west where both armies were forming and he ignored the movement of men and horses on the bluff to focus on the armies beneath his feet at the bottom of the broad salt plain of the valley there were skirmishers psiloi and peltastai none of them were visible as individuals but the movement of so many men even spread well apart raised a salt dust that looked like dandelion fluff behind the screen of his skirmishers eumenes army was about halfformed with the phalanx in the centre ready for action their spears erect and the points glittering in the sun above the dust the rightflank cavalry where diodorus had his command subordinate to philip a macedonian were almost formed and satyrus could see that there were prodromoi the scouts well out on the flank and armoured cavalry closer in to the phalanx on the left however closest to the camp there was nothing short of chaos a heavy curtain of sand rose high in the air hiding eumenes best cavalry and his peltastai who were forming to cover the flank of the phalanx where it would pass the rough ground of the valley floor where heavy brush and an olive orchard interrupted the flat fields across the valley antigonus oneeye formed his best cavalry on his right facing eumenes best cavalry and they were already formed his centre was wrecked the phalanx in disarray and his left was in flux lost in obscuring clouds his far left the part of his army that faced diodorus was reacting to the very visible fact that diodoruss flank extended farther than his opponents and they were vulnerable nothing seemed to happen quickly at this distance they couldnt see individuals and they couldnt hear anything but a vague roar like a distant stream running over rocks why do they wait for each other to form satyrus asked surely the first to form has a clear advantage not a bad question for a pup a harsh voice barked just to their right almost unnoticed in their excitement at the panorama of war a cavalcade had mounted the bluff a swarthy man in a silvered breastplate and a matching helmet rode over neither commander will attack until hes sure of his own dispositions and the longer we keep our men in line the more shit well think of to fix it can go on all day war is nothing but a contest of mistakes boy the fewer you make the more likely you are to win ive failed to get my right wing in line and i dont have my peltastai where i wanted them and my opponent has fucked up the disposition of his elephants he committed them to the line nows hes seen the error of his ways i suspect his son had something to do with it eumenes philokles said he was on his feet philokles gave a salute in the spartan fashion by all the gods a spartan you have the better of me sir eumenes extended an arm leaning down from the saddle philokles took his hand and clasped it philokles a friend of your strategos diodorus and of kineas whom you fought in bactria these are his children eumenes grimaced you could put them in with herakles we could start a nursery for orphans of great generals he looked down at them imperious in purple and silver what do you think boy i think that youre hiding your elephants in that dust cloud melitta said and youre going to break the enemy in the centre i think uncle diodoruss flank extends well beyond his opponents satyrus piped up and theyre already scared not bad eumenes said looking like a man who had all day to discuss his tactics with children not bad at all but heres the question boys and girls he has more cavalry than i do yet his battle line is shorter where is the rest of the cavalry that is what i rode up here to see satyrus and melitta exchanged a glance eumenes went on speaking mostly to himself battles happen because both generals think that they are in a superior position and one of them is always wrong he said or because one of them is desperate im not desperate my phalanx is better and i have more elephants oneeye has more cavalry it is his only advantage beside the fact that hes a macedonian and im a greek he took a linen towel from his satchel and wiped his brow so where the fuck is it he went on if hes sent it out on the flanks well i may have crushed his centre before they arrive no dust cloud i guess they could be coming behind that range of hills to the west but thats twenty stades he pushed his towel back in his satchel well spartan enjoy your view children consider this a lesson without another word he waved at his entourage and galloped down the face of the bluff raising a cloud of dust that took ten minutes to dispel and obscured their view of the battlefield theron opened a basket and served a late breakfast of figs and dates all of them enjoyed the rich fruits and they were quite sticky before the dust cleared so that was eumenes the cardian satyrus said in the life philokles answered what do you think he meant about this being a lesson satyrus asked philokles got the look that both twins associated with lessons what did eumenes say was the key to battle why do battles happen satyrus nodded seriously battles happen because both generals believe they are superior and one of them is wrong he said melitta jabbed him with an elbow in this case i believe that eumenes has decided that his opponent is staking his battle on a flank march eumenes is staking his on his elephants philokles pointed out at the field where the curtain of dust was slowly subsiding one of them is wrong who melitta asked ask zeus theron said look out on the plain eumenes whole line had started forward the apparent confusion of his left was now revealed as a ruse with the whole force of his elephants guarding the left of his phalanx and walking boldly forward a stade or so behind the main line on the right diodoruss cavalry was already well down the field and pressing on but satyrus was hopping up and down but nothing was happening philokles voice sounded strange almost as if he were drunk once a battle starts he said it moves fairly fast as they watched both sides manoeuvred pushing the last units into line or trying to straighten the more ragged divisions but both sides had some forces in motion and any form of uniformity was shredded except in the centres where the phalanxes marched forward in order they appeared about equal in size and they were getting closer to each other less than a stade apart now this is the worst part for the men in the ranks philokles said when you can see that wall of spear points coming at you you feel naked nothing but honour and fear of the contempt of the gods and your friends can keep your feet moving forward your heart races as if youre about to die perhaps you are he looked away poor bastards may the gods stand with every one of them look our men are winning melitta cried she was watching the cavalry on the right where diodorus was stationed ares theron said that was fast philokles shook his head either oneeye has set a trap and philip has fallen for it or oneeye has made an error satyrus caught the flash of sun on weapons to the far right it is a trap oh uncle diodorus even as the whole line the rather thin line in front of diodorus buckled and fled his prodromoi were struck in the flank by lancers coming over the low ridge to the east but the contest was by no means onesided and just before the battle haze hid the action on the right from them they saw a whole regiment of diodoruss cavalry come out of the distant dust and fall on the ambushers who were in turn the ambushed while his main force continued straight on what happened satyrus asked philokles stroked his beard for several minutes i dont know he said cavalry fights are fast and confusing its like watching a pair of dogs go for the throat until one lies dead it is hard to guess who will win but diodorus has been at this for longer than youve been alive id guess he walked into that with his eyes open as philokles spoke the phalanxes in the centre moved so close to each other as to look like a single mass and then both seemed to stop moving forward but they both kept moving from the back as a child satyrus had once watched two caterpillars collide on a narrow branch their heads locked together while their rear legs kept moving and the phalanxes were much the same and then the noise carried to them a strain of a paean and the crash as the two great bodies met they both stood philokles said they were both moving theron countered thats not what i mean philokles said testily what i should have said is that neither broke before contact it often happens that way although no one likes to speak of it later look melitta said grabbing her brothers shoulder and pulling at it satyrus tore his eyes from the death struggle in the centre and the elephants marching stolidly up from the second line eumenes left the part with his elite cavalry closest to camp was about to be struck in the flank by a tidal wave of cavalry satyrus had missed their appearance where did they come from he asked melitta shook her head she was chewing her lips theyre going to sweep right over our cavalry she said right into the flank of the phalanx theron said its not unlike watching the climax of a race philokles said except that the contestants are dying diodorus needs to turn into the flank of the enemy phalanx satyrus added after a tense silence eumenes elite cavalry were outnumbered and their dislike of their employer showed in the haste of their retreat so that his left wing collapsed in mere minutes bactrians and medes surged forward many units penetrating the line without having engaged at all melitta was on her feet they cant see the elephants she said satyrus stood up with her it was like cheering contestants at an athletic event thousands of enemy cavalrymen were pouring into the void left by the flight of eumenes left wing but instead of hitting the flank of the phalanx they were about to plunge over a very low ridge into eumenes elephant force the low ridge was scarcely visible melitta was guessing that it must be there because the bactrians galloped straight at the elephants and on the farthest left they could see a body of their own cavalry launch their own charge into the nowopen flank of the enemys bactrians satyrus thought that it was remarkably like boxing punch and counterpunch the brave man who was leading the charge right in front of them was throwing a fairly feeble left but in order to deal with it the mass of bactrians and saka would have to change front and they would lose all the advantage of their position see how the medes are avoiding a second fight when men have triumphed in battle they are often just as finished with violence as men who have lost so the medes hesitate and look around for easier meat satyrus found that hed eaten another fig without a memory of picking the fruit from the basket dust now hid everything all along the line he put his cloak on the ground behind him and sat on it he washed his hands from his canteen nothing seemed to be happening although the sounds of combat were now clearly audible carried on a fresh breeze from the east the medes and bactrians had vanished into the towering saltdust clouds and the battle line was hidden from end to end and then the bactrians came bursting out of the edge of the cloud closest to the camp p hilokles watched them for a long heartbeat and then he grabbed the runner go to your mistress as fast as you can run tell her that five thousand asiatic cavalry are about to hit the camp she may have ten minutes shell know what to do go the young man was off down the hillside his tanned limbs flashing in rhythm as he ran philokles watched the medes for ten more heartbeats then he turned to theron and the twins eumenes left is broken beyond saving but the men who broke it have chosen to loot the camp rather than face the elephants he nodded very wise of them actually but in effect it nullifies oneeyes victory unless i miss my guess that man down there follow my hand is eumenes hes trying to stem the rout look at those cowards theron said indeed the cream of eumenes macedonian cavalry were rallied off to the far left in an old river bed many of the units were formed up as if on parade but they werent moving forward difficult to tell the difference between cowardice and treason philokles said is it our responsibility to tell eumenes that his camp is attacked or even that his phalanx is still in the game what of your friend diodorus theron asked at their feet a short column of horses and mules was already formed and moving south diodorus planned against this philokles said as did sappho he shook his head diodorus needs to know that this has happened will you go theron theron looked at the maelstrom of churning salt dust and bronze i dont even know who id be looking for he said no not my game ill go satyrus said philokles didnt even look at his student he was looking at the camp i need to repay an old debt you stay with the children diodorus is a big boy ill go satyrus said again already the word of the catastrophe was spreading and refugees were pouring out of the camp heading south to the north the bactrians were already in the horse lines taking remounts the saka were riding to the east coming around the tangle of tents that would impede their horses what old debt theron shouted ares man you cant go into that banugul philokles said quietly the name didnt mean much to either of the twins mum used to talk about her melitta said you used her as an example once of a woman of power philokles didnt take his eyes off the onrushing enemy you really do listen to everything i say he said aunt sappho said that she ought to be our ally satyrus said your father saved her life once philokles said his eyes on another fight far away in time and place he reached up under his arm and loosened his sword in its scabbard you children go with theron down to the column and go to the rally point im going to save a gilded harlot the twins looked at each other a message passed between them but they mounted with theron and started down the back of the bluff both of them watching philokles as he mounted and vanished over the campside crest is he insane theron trotted ahead muttering satyrus turned to his sister ill ride to eumenes he said quietly and to diodorus she nodded good ill help philokles she looked at his borrowed dun gelding i wish you had a better horse me too satyrus said they exchanged a smile and he glanced at theron and pulled his horse off to the left on a dun horse helmetless with a duncoloured cloak satyrus vanished in the dust as soon as he turned his horse he was away back up the slope of the bluff until he had a view over the worst of the dust and down into the salt plain eumenes silvered helmet was a flash of white light just a stade or so to the north satyrus pointed his geldings head at the general and tapped his heels for speed and they were away melitta watched her brother turn his horse she reached down and checked her bow case theron turned in his saddle this way he called melitta followed obediently for another minute and then as they entered the dust of sapphos column she shouted wheres satyrus theron turned in his saddle retying his chlamys over his face against the dust wheres he gone theron asked ares he was right there melitta said go to sappho theron said turning his horse satyrus he bellowed melitta didnt answer she just rode towards where theron was pointing until the dust swirled around her then she slipped her sakje tunic off her shoulder so that her right arm and shoulder were bare and pulled bion around in a short turn dust didnt bother her shed ridden in the drag position with the maidens and the boys on summer marches with the assagatje she wrapped a scarf over her mouth as she cantered back towards camp the dust was thick and the saka were close she could see them shouting to each other just to the east she waved her bow over her head at them and they shouted then they were gone in the dust she had a good idea where the enormous red and yellow tent stood so she rode on instinct trusting bion to move carefully in a forest of tents and stakes and ropes she didnt ride fast but she took the straightest line she could find she terrified a great many camp followers emerging from the curtain of dust she looked like a massagetae under her mask of dust and her head scarf she smiled wickedly gave a shriek of joy and terrified them a little more it would only move them faster that might save their lives twice bion stumbled catching a leg on a tent stake or a rope but both times they recovered without a fall good boy she said in sakje patting his flanks she was speaking sakje and thinking in sakje and the greek of the terrified women around her was almost incomprehensible to her she felt bions weight change and she got up his neck for a jump he was up and over and she never knew what theyd just jumped then the gelding turned under her and she almost lost her seat and they were cantering again she caught a flash of colour to her left and then another and beneath bions hooves she was looking at fruits they were in the agora of the camp and close to banuguls tent now where is philokles she asked herself satyrus rode easily leaning well back as they slid down the face of the bluff and then shifting his weight forward as they got the hard ground of the valley under them he let his horse have his head and they were off at a gallop satyrus trusted his seat so he used the gallop as a smooth platform to get his chlamys off his waist where hed tied it and to wrap it around his head he had just got the length of wool around his face when he burst into a crowd of bactrians he knew them from their long burnooses and their trousers and then he was through them moving so fast that they had little chance to catch him his heart raced and for the first time the foolishness of what he was attempting rose with his gorge to choke him i could die doing this he thought it was very different from being hunted by assassins this was a risk he had incurred at his own will and it felt stupid its not even my battle some part of his mind shouted at him too late now another part answered and he came out of the protective wall of salt dust as if shot from a bow instantly he felt naked there was a breeze here and it had ripped the veil of salt asunder and left him riding alone with a thousand bactrians in full view to the west less than half a stade away his bare legs proclaimed him a greek and probably an enemy and a dozen of them turned their horses and came for him with a series of shrill whoops ahead he saw the body of men he was aiming for macedonian cavalry in white leather spolades and bronze helmets the man at their head had a silver helmet but at this range it was obvious that he was not eumenes he was ten horselengths away and he was shouting orders in a voice as young and shrill as satyruss own his cloak was purple satyrus got up on his knees pressed his heels into his geldings flank and raced for the narrowing gap between the macedonian cavalry and the bactrians behind him a dozen bactrians were down on their horses necks calling to one another in hot pursuit but he was a lighter rider on a better mount it occurred to him that he ought to shoot at them but he didnt have the nerve to spare he was too busy being one with his horse the young officer whirled around and satyrus passed him at javelintoss the pin on his purple cloak would have ransomed a small town in a flash he was through the gap riding along a file of macedonian troopers every head turned and some men pointed and the bactrians on the right started to turn and more bactrians so close that they could almost touch him turned their horses as he went by and then he was past out on the salt pan beyond and the breeze was gone and he was back in the towering clouds of dust he galloped long enough to wind his mount and then he curved carefully off to his right slowing gradually and listening as hard as he could he could hear fighting to the right and his horse though tired was fidgeting hard he couldnt imagine why she was so restive but he curbed her hard while he got his wits about him he was lost on the battlefield somewhere in the battle haze melitta remembered the red and yellow tent as being at the south end of the agora and she rode in that direction the agora was already empty except for rubbish and a dead child of six or seven with his throat cut that gave melitta a shock she looked at the little body too long and then pushed on across the last food stalls she could see the roof of the red and yellow tent in front of it were a dozen horses men were shouting and there was a rising sound of a panicked mob coming from the north the medes must be in the camp suddenly the impulse to help philokles rescue banugul seemed foolish how would she ever find him how could she take on a dozen men and she had no time the wail of mass despair was right behind her were the fuck is she came a shout from the complex of tents clustered around the red and yellow she knew that voice that was the doctor the false doctor sophokles she ran another man said get her brat hes got a sword melitta was on the point of fleeing down the long avenue that ran back towards the gully when she heard sophokles voice and the power of her brothers oath washed over her she got her bow up drew her akinakes and rode right up to the side wall of the great pavilion bion picking his way among the spiderweb of supporting stays when she got there she reached out and slit the walls of the tent from top to bottom so that they folded away on their supports and then she was in the tent she let the knife dangle from its wrist strap nocked an arrow and watched a man chasing a boy a little younger than her brother a bronzehaired boy with a sword he turned and slashed at his attacker just kill him sophokles shouted melittas first arrow hit sophokles in the side just below his pointing arm he never saw the shot and he went down in a heap and then her second arrow was in the man chasing the boy come with me she shouted at the boy she dropped her bow into the gorytos at her waist and extended her left hand her brother would have known what to do but this boy just looked at her who are you he asked sophokles was up again holding his side her light bow hadnt put an arrow through his thorax who the fuck are you he said he was two horselengths away up melitta said to the boy now do i have to do everything myself sophokles said stepping over the body of the other man two more men came into the tent at his shoulders he scooped a spear off the floor he was distracted for a vital second when a third man pushed into the huge tent from the largest side corridor with a struggling woman in his arms i have her just kill her sophokles called ares are you fools finally after a hesitation that seemed to melitta to last for aeons the boy reached up and took her hand his eyes fixed on the struggles of the woman bion moved under her and she gave a heave and he was up grabbing her waist and almost pulling her off bions back bion backed a step and another she grabbed at her bow her own dangling knife cutting the top of her thigh sophokles cocked back his spear that boy is not for you he said hand him over ill pay you gold gold understand he pointed at a gold armband he wore gold you stupid barbarian aside he said fucking barbarians oneeye said to capture the woman and her son a macedonian accent said one of the men behind the athenian assassin he was armoured like an officer with fine gold bands on an iron cuirass do not kill her sophokles looked around like a man who has suffered one indignity too many fuck you macedonian he said he whirled and plunged his spear into the neck of the officer downing him instantly melitta got her bow in her hand she caught a flash of movement from the far doorway and there was philokles with a sword in his hand he kicked a man in the back of the knee and the man went down with a curse of course philokles had no idea who she was he glanced at her and grabbed the woman on the ground my son she shouted im rescuing you you stupid bitch philokles said at the word rescue every head in the tent turned and the action seemed to melitta to speed up sophokles and philokles recognized each other enter the drunk the assassin said hes trying to kill them because he works for olympias philokles called out not for oneeye kill him hermes you are a pest the false doctor said he cocked back the spear he held and threw it philokles managed in one athletic twist to let go of the woman bump her with his hip hard enough to knock her flat and deflect the spear damn you sophokles cursed you have the luck of tyche herself he said melitta shot him in the back of the knee it was the least armoured part of him that she thought she could hit and the man had turned his back on her then with the surge of elation that came with a really good shot she backed her gelding out of the slit in the tent wheeled her horse and rode satyrus took too much time a subjective eternity to realize that his horse was thrashing like a mad thing because he was almost surrounded by elephants they were in two long columns each of twenty or more beasts and he was between them however he had managed that there were men around him on foot skirmishers or psiloi or just men who had lost their way as he had and none of them offered him any threat he passed a median peltastes in spotted trousers so close that the weary mans shoulder brushed his horse he got his horse under some semblance of control just as the elephants obeying shouted commands began to shamble from their deep files into an open line his gelding broke into a panicked run headed past the elephants and there were bellows of rage elephantine rage monster noises from legend in the dust that frightened him as thoroughly as they spooked his mount he had no control of his charger and the big gelding passed elephant after elephant before bursting through their line so close to one great beast that satyrus had he been less afraid might have touched the legs of the behemoth as he went by to his left a pair of the animals were fighting both creatures on their hind legs tusks locked blood weeping from their hides the men on their backs clinging for their lives as he watched one serpentine trunk grasped a mahout coiled around his arms and ripped him screaming from his perch on the head of the enemy elephant satyrus watched in horrified fascination as the mans body was dropped at the elephants feet and meticulously trampled he galloped past and his fears changed from terror of the elephants to concern that his gelding had started to move heavily starved of air his flanks heaving and shuddering despite his panic satyrus got his mount clear of the last elephants and then pulled him in to let him breathe off to his right he could see the flash of bronze and steel and hear clear as a play the desperate rage of another kind of monster the two phalanxes grinding away at each other satyruss mind began to function for the first time since he escaped the bactrians he felt deeply ashamed at his own panic but he knew that he had no hope of finding eumenes in the dust on the other hand diodorus and the hippeis were just on the other side of the phalanx the phalanx had sixteen thousand men at the normal fighting depth they were a thousand wide or three thousand podes at battle order five stades philokles had said that diodorus needed to know about the camp he rode around the shoulder of the phalanx pushing the poor gelding as hard as he dared the horse was used up the elephants had caused it more fatigue in five minutes of terror than the rest of the ride put together but he was safe for the moment he was riding down the back of the army and he was surprised at how empty the battlefield was a few bodies lay on the ground and a few men cried out for water but his chargers hoof beats hid the worst of the sounds and he detoured around the biggest piles of bodies as best he could in the thick salt dust which bit at his throat and his eyes he was so thirsty he thought of plundering a corpse for its canteen it took him too much time to realize that he had a canteen he cursed his own panic and got some water in his mouth even as his mount stumbled from a canter to a slow trot he could feel the change in the battle line here he could no longer see the back of the phalanx and the sound of the shouting to his left was more triumphant he turned his weary horse towards the shouting hoping he had ridden five stades it was hard to measure time in the battle haze ahead in the whitegrey clouds there was a trumpet call a familiar trumpet call that was andronicus with the silver trumpet of the hippeis wasnt it at his feet there were smiling men with crescentshaped shields they were loping forward and pointing and they ignored him he rode past them farther on he saw more peltastai all moving forward and he guessed that the enemys flank was crumpling the men he passed were drinking water or shouting to each other or plundering bodies what they werent doing was turning into the open flank of the enemy phalanx he thought about what philokles had said about men who had won a fight being hesitant to enter a second fight and he kept his horse moving because he suspected that when the big gelding stopped he wouldnt move again they kept moving east or what seemed in the haze to be east roughly parallel to eumenes original battle line as best he could tell in the heat and the haze then there were no more infantrymen he heard several trumpet calls one of which might have been familiar satyrus couldnt see anything and he couldnt hear anything except the sounds of the fighting behind him so he turned his horse further to the left hoping that diodorus had continued to win on his flank and thinking that he had heard the trumpet in that direction if diodorus had lost the initial cavalry action satyrus reasoned the peltastai would hardly have pushed so deep into the enemys lines the sun was enough past noon that he began to become confident in directions even with the haze the sun was a hard round white disc in the sky and he could reason out north and south east and west the phalanx fight was now west diodoruss trumpet was east and north probably the longer satyrus rode the less certain he became by the time his canteen was almost empty he had again begun to wonder where he was the solidity of the phalanx was long gone the haze rose like a live thing choking him and limiting his sight to a few horselengths and the noise of the phalanx was so far away that he might have been off the battlefield the median peltastes arose out of the dust like a mythological creature stabbing with a javelin trying to unhorse satyrus satyrus took the first thrust in the centre of his abdomen where his cuirass was strongest and he lost his seat his gelding stopped kicked out weakly at the peltastes and stumbled a few steps forward then the horse came to a stop and with the slow inevitability of winter avalanche in the mountains he fell satyrus kicked clear and rolled to his feet tangled in his cloak when he got up his side was wet where his clay canteen had broken and the peltastes was on him stabbing twice with his javelin fast as the strike of an adder satyrus stumbled back stunned with sweat and salt in his eyes he got his right hand under his left armpit and drew his sword and the mede hesitated satyrus wiped his eyes with his damp cloak the mede measured him and looked at the dying horse stepped back and threw his javelin like a thunderbolt but he miscast and it tumbled and the shaft struck satyrus a heavy blow on the tip of his left shoulder and a lance of pain shot down his arm then the man turned to run and hesitated again satyrus stepped forward pulling his cloak over his left arm and cut at the man before he could flee the mede jumped back a look of panic on his face and they both heard a trumpet quite close now that his horse wasnt moving satyrus could hear the sounds of fighting just to the north horses and men somewhere nearby a maddened steed gave a trumpet of rage somewhere else in the murk men were wounded and screamed their pain in a matter of heartbeats the sound was all around him and so were phantoms of battle movements in the opaque curtain of salt the mede came back at him a knife held high in his right hand and his small shield of wicker and hide thrusting from the left satyrus had time to think he has no training whatsoever it was a thought that gave him a feeling of calm and superiority and he sidestepped and cut the mans knife hand at the wrist he was too weak to cut through the bone but the mans weapon went flying and the man fell to his knees clutching his maimed hand like a mother with a sick child in two beats of his heart the mede was transformed from a monster of violence to a helpless victim satyrus left him he stepped past to the body of his horse but there was nothing for him to take and the feeling of success of survival left him as fast as it had come his breastplate weighed on his chest like an iron anvil and he was soaked in sweat and his mouth was dry as sand and his head ached his left shoulder hurt as it had after a fall from his horse as a child and he was afraid to look at it to see if there was blood and he was still lost his father had been famous for his ability to navigate a battlefield on sound alone tears stung his eyes i will not cry he said aloud and started to walk forward towards the sounds of combat he kept his sword in his hand more for the symbolism than for any use a sword would be to a dismounted man in a cavalry melee a riderless horse ran out of the curtain eyes white with fear and knocked him flat he rolled from under the beasts hooves and there were horses all around him rally on me a voice shouted sound the rally the trumpet rang out a trumpet he had heard a thousand times as a child in tanais and he pushed to his feet heedless of the hooves flying around him rally on me form a rhomboid phylarchs sound off diodorus shouted the trumpet rang out again a long call the horses around satyrus were jostling for position every man struggling to get his mount to the right place in a haze of dust and a crowd of animals satyrus was crushed between two horses and he ducked to get under a belly and got kicked in the back of his head by a rider hey he said hey help the last came out more like a squeak he was that close to finding his uncle and he was going to be trampled or crushed a spear point glittered wickedly in front of his face stand where you are hama said hama its me he yelped back hama reached out and grasped his wrist sword and all and hauled him up on his crupper men die on foot when horses are this thick the big keltoi chief said little lord what for fucking gods are you here satyrus got his leg over hamas horse i will not cry he said aloud the relief was so great that his eyes filled and his throat hurt from more than salt dust the trumpet sounded again anyone have a clue where the fuck we are phylarchs sound off diodorus said file one two men missing file two all present file three one man dead file four four men missing file five all present hama shouted file six two men missing lord satyrus on my horse he pushed his own horse forward and men made way for him off to the left file seven and eight reported hama got his horse next to the hyperetes diodorus glanced at hama satyrus opened his mouth and his uncles hand came up like a blow demanding silence file nine all present file ten three men missing diodorus nodded sharply thirteen are missing out of a hundred thats bad he looked around anybody see crax or andronicus no sir came a chorus of answers the salt dust swirled dion take file one off to the right dont go far ten horselengths a man return on one trumpet blast see if you can find anybody paches take file ten and do the same to the left go he turned to hama and antigonus where the fuck are we without waiting for an answer he turned on satyrus what are you doing here child satyrus took a breath and concentrated on having his voice level i came with a message he said what message diodorus was all but kneeling on his horses back trying to see over the dust but first you are about five stades beyond the rightmost point of the enemy phalanx uncle and all the peltastai have been driven off i rode from there diodorus looked at him for a long breath you are sure mens lives depend on this satyrus choked a little no he said hesitantly im not sure hama steadied him with a hug but pretty sure yes satyrus met his uncles eyes pretty sure uncle diodorus nodded sharply if youre right ill never doubt you again hama get paches back in and put him in front we feel our way along the path satyrus indicated one troop of horse behind our own phalanx would panic them in this crap one more trumpet call hyperetes he took satyrus from hama his hard grey eyes locked on satyruss eyes message he said he held out his hand and a canteen was put in it there are saka and bactrians in the camp satyrus said his uncles beard was grey it had once been red ares balls boy diodorus looked around i have a hundred men less what the fuck a flash of gold and crax cantered out of the dust you called he said his armour flashing diodorus laughed tyche is smiling he shouted and there was an answering roar from the rank behind him you have fourth troop six missing crax said with a salute ill get them lined up with you satyrus says were on the flank of the phalanx and that its that way what do you think crax diodorus handed the canteen to the getae officer crax took the flask drank deeply and put the wooden stopper back sounds right to me crax said with a wink at satyrus a wink that satyrus appreciated suddenly there was a great weight on his shoulders the burden of everyones lives crax was gone into the salt and diodorus shouted remount anyone have a horse a trooper that satyrus didnt know pushed forward here strategos satyrus went straight from his uncles crupper to the back of a dark bay with a beautiful animalskin saddlecloth and silver mounts on the bridle thank you he said you owe him for the horse boy diodorus said and the tack he gave a wicked smile then he got his horse under him and motioned to satyrus someone get him a spear and a helmet right up with me boy youre the guide if we fight get your animal in behind mine and keep your aresaddled head down put that toy sword away now which way satyrus found to his immense joy that he could feel which direction the phalanxes were if they havent moved he muttered his heart raced and felt a very different fear from the fear of being torn to pieces by elephants this was the fear of disappointing his friends of being a child he nudged his horse into motion this way he said march walk diodorus called and the trumpet rang out satyrus sat straighter he was actually leading a troop of cavalry men rode up to diodorus and then rode away and there were more trumpet calls and more orders satyrus an armlength from the man he called his uncle understood that diodorus was trying to get his two troops aligned while still searching the battlefield for his two missing troops you know what youre doing boy diodorus asked after a few minutes riding listen satyrus said he could hear a low roar to the front and right halt diodorus shouted no trumpet paches get out there and tell me what you find go a stade or two no more they were halted in a vast rolling cloud of white and grey there were bodies under their hooves and as satyrus watched a pair of thracian peltastai emerged from the white dust they were so shocked that they stopped eumenes one asked he gestured at the chaplet of roses he wore over his foxhide cap satyrus nodded eumenes he called by his shoulder crax rattled away in a barbarian tongue and the two thracians turned and ran off into the salt i said we were about to charge crax said ive found some troopers from second troop but theyre lost maybe ten men diodorus took his helmet off i fucking hate this somebody could smack us silly and wed never know they were coming this dust could hide anything canteens empty crax said he spat worst dust ive ever seen fucking salt paches came out of the swirl boys dead on he said with a salute towards satyrus whose heart filled with joy less than two stades the back ranks of their phalanx nothing in our way the man continued his voice rising with excitement diodorus looked around well he said pulling his helmet back on and tying the cheekpieces this is where we all get to be heroes he looked at satyrus get in the middle boy so i can get you home alive he turned his horse everyone get it into the shieldless flank dont fuck around get in deep and cause panic stay with me till you hear the trumpet when they break let someone else kill them go forward to our lines understand if you lose me rally on the ravine the camp is gone ready two hundred parched throats found the energy to shout yes march walk no trumpets they were off now satyrus was pushed back and back until he was in the sixth rank the very centre of the rhomboid he knew the drill but it was different in the dust he was between two complete strangers but the one on his left turned a pair of bloodshot eyes from deep within a thracian helmet nothing to worry about kid he said safe as being home first time he asked yes satyrus shouted over the rising noise of their passage careful with that spear then his new filemate said dont hit kalyx with it hes not the forgiving kind the other men laughed half a stade passed very quickly paean said his uncles voice make them hear you the paean of apollo began with four beats of carefully measured rhythmic silence and andronicus beat his trumpet with a knife hilt crack crack crack crack and the paean bloomed like a flower in the rising dust an offering to a god who valued more than just slaughter satyrus sang with them and he was so moved his voice choked and he felt as if he was one with all these men around him one pair of arms and legs in a beast with a hundred arms and legs like the titan of legend they began to trot close up shouted the man on his right satyrus was embarrassed to see that he had lost ground his horse responded beautifully closing the gap in a few anxious heartbeats and they were at a canter the files a little spread from the speed and then in an instant there were men all around him shouting screams of terror and panic as if the gods had rendered every man witless satyrus couldnt see anything there was no one to fight and then out of nowhere a sarissa head slid past his knee the sharp edges cutting his thigh where one enemy soldier at least had tried to change his front then they were plunging through the enemy phalanx satyrus hoped that it was the enemy phalanx among hundreds of men in heavy armour but they were casting their sarissas to the ground and running or dying under the hooves there were men on foot all around satyrus and his horse had almost stopped he stabbed overarm with his spear at the first hand to try to seize his bridle these men were desperate and terrified most of them werent even fighting back just trying to push past him but some either intended to die fighting or simply wanted his horse a blow in the back nearly unseated him he punched back with his spear on reflex and almost lost his seat again as he failed to hit anything it looked to him as if the cavalry had lost all of its momentum and cohesion in the impact and now spilled out along the rear face of the phalanx but the centre of the rhomboid had penetrated deeply and satyrus was in the part that had penetrated lost in a sea of enemies for no reason he could discern satyrus was now a fileleader he saw mounted men behind him he managed to lock his knees on the dark bays back and he obeyed his uncle and put his head down so that oncoming foes had only his helmet to attack the best armoured part of him and the charger responded by pushing forward through the press twice he reared his charger to clear the men in front and the second time she lost her footing on a corpse and they fell heavily the horse rolled off uninjured and a spearbutt rammed into the earth inches from satyruss nose he had lost his spear but he got the sword out from under his arm rolled to his feet ignoring the pain from the old wound in his side and parried the next blow lifting the mans sarissa shaft high and stepping in under it as philokles had taught he cut out almost blind and his short sword bit into the mans hand and he screamed and then satyruss filepartner the man in the fancy thracian helmet spitted him on a spear get your horse he shouted the charger with the fancy tack was standing obediently just an armlength away and satyrus swarmed up her side as if he was getting onboard a ship she was a tall horse the man in the thracian helmet knocked another fleeing macedonian flat and then satyrus was up sword in hand helmet askew but otherwise none the worse come on lad thracian helm called and they were off into the dust then there were more horsemen and more men in blue plumes and cloaks and then satyrus had crax at his shoulder and then there were other men men with bright white shields shouting and laughing and waving all around him an officer was yelling for his men to open a file and let the cavalry through satyrus reined in his charger and simply breathed he was pressed up hard against the white shields but they were grounding their spears pushing the bronze buttspikes into the salt sand ares a macedonian voice said look at this child satyrus peered down at the dustcovered face eumenes he asked yeah the macedonian panted yeah eumenes kid who are you guys hippeis of tanais crax roared by his side satyrus nodded proudly the man behind him slapped his back well done little lord he said the trumpet sounded off in the dust fucking dust hama said the keltoi had appeared as if by magic try being down in it horse boy the macedonian said then the whitecaked face creased in a smile thanks horse boys another macedonian called out first fucking greeks ive ever liked you saved our arses they were moving again because the macedonians were shuffling to the side opening a lane satyrus followed hama who was now apparently his fileleader all the other men who should have been in between were gone hama shush lord was his reply listen for the trumpet melitta could see the length of the main avenue of the camp and there were saka coming in her direction she hesitated as long as it took to push her bow deep in her gorytos and then she was riding towards them at a smart trot her male burden bouncing like a sack of potatoes this is embarrassing he said dont talk she replied look terrified she rode right at the lead group of saka four men and a deeply tanned elder she raised her whip and called one word in saka mine she said pointing at the boy across her lap the elder smiled she rode past them without a challenge she rode the length of the street without so much as a question at the far end the avenue was plugged with a roiling mass of saka who couldnt decide what to loot first she pushed forward her boots rubbing against their boots the red and yellow tent she called gold and silver her sakje had the western accent but that didnt bother anyone she turned and pointed her whip all the way through the market cousins thanks little bride shouted a warrior with tattoos of dragons twined up his arms sauromatae warrior maidens were often called little brides because in war they earned the right to choose their husbands voices laughed but again no one raised a hand against her much the opposite men moved their horses to let her pass and she left the crush with nothing bruised but her feet once free of the press she urged bion to a trot and then a canter and when she was beyond the rows of cook fires dangerous pits in the murk she gave the big gelding his head and his legs opened into a long gallop that ate the ground its like flying the boy at her back said are you really a saka im assagatje my mother is the queen of the assagatje of course shes not really a queen sakje really dont she was babbling she cut herself off he was very warm pressed against her back and calm in a way she liked solid like her brother my mother is srayanka she said im herakles he said my mother is banugul and my father was a god banugul she said thats good its nice to know i rescued the right boy try to move your hips its easier on the horse the gully was just beyond the bluff on her left she could see the loom of the bluff passing her shoulder and she began to swing the horse wide to the right to avoid the inevitable calamity the ground changed and she slowed bion and pulled his head ever further to the west as she felt the horses weight change she was riding right along the edge of the gully she was just picking her way south again when she was challenged who are you called a voice with more fear than authority she could see riders and carts melitta of tanais she called with herakles women gathered around her what the fuck crax croaked the dust was not subsiding theyd been an hour in one place just a stade from where theyd shredded the enemy phalanx for no reason that they understood they were waiting near their starting position in the battle line of the early morning diodorus had ordered the halt and told men to dismount and other men to get out and scout and then hed left crax in charge and ridden off with hama stragglers wandered in both their own and other mercenary cavalrymen whod been in diodoruss command or philips when the day began dismounted men prowled the ground around them stripping the enemy dead of loot and water other parties searched the salt flats for their dead and buried them a young trooper from olbia went down with heat sickness and suddenly the phylarchs were everywhere demanding that men empty their canteens andronicus spoke up to crax the horses wont last much longer he said satyrus wondered what his eyes looked like all the men around him had the eyes of mourners redrimmed redcreased with red blood in the corners the salt was vicious he wiped his eyes on his arm again and felt the burn on his eyelids and his hands and winced did we win he asked the man next to him we won son that doesnt mean the whole army won the man cackled got any water no satyrus admitted i do he said cleitus he said extending an arm satyrus he answered clasping the mans hand he felt like a grown man the other man offered his water and satyrus took a swig and then another before he could stop himself he handed it back there was wine in the mans water it tasted divine as if dionysus had blessed it himself weve found most of our dead and buried them he said we didnt need to ask for a truce to do it either in my book thats a victory we plundered their dead too another man said here comes the strategos crax called stand by your mount diodorus came up in a new cloud of salt call in the scouts hyperetai satyrus on me everyone not actually doing anything get the fuck off your mount now he turned to crax report most of second troop is in but not eumenes crax said he vanished in the first melee otherwise weve buried our dead diodorus shook his head hes been with us since we started he said well almost he looked around not finding his body is hard crax nodded since the first winter in olbia he said maybe hell turn up anyway otherwise second is down seventeen were down nine and first is down thirteen third is nowhere to be found and i swept all the way back to where we hit the medes in the first hour the getae officer looked around the hyperetai of all three troops were shepherding the dismounted men into a column every man leading his horse beyond them the phalanx was seething as if it was still in combat and the settling salt dust revealed an angry agitation crax pointed at the activity this looks bad he said how bad is it did we lose rally point diodorus said tersely and we walk to save the horses its bad crax looked back again men in the phalanx were shaking their fists and cursing at each other how bad he asked the macedonian fucks just handed eumenes to oneeye alive diodorus said bitterly i was too late to stop them the treasonous cunts there were shouts from the phalanx behind them and then more shouts and an ugly murmur just keep moving boys diodorus said march crax shook his head how can such men make their peace with the gods he asked diodorus shook his head antigonus took our camp he said the argyraspids traded eumenes for their loot from years past can you imagine he went on if theyd stood their ground we could have had it back at spear point in the morning that army was beaten listen every man in our phalanx knows that theyve been robbed crax swore expressively in getae diodorus walked silently and satyrus kept his head down to avoid being sent away the column of troops set off they were short of men missing or dead but they had also collected several dozen cavalry stragglers and crax formed them into a fourth troop many of them protested against walking in the salt dust and a few mounted their horses and rode away in disgust refusing to accept discipline that they felt was foolish the rest obeyed obviously glad to have someone to follow another lesson that was not lost on satyrus although he was now so tired that he couldnt remember what he had done or the order in which it had happened or whether he had been brave or cowardly but only that he was alive word of the betrayal of eumenes the cardian by his own officers began to filter down the column so that men shook their heads or cursed the sun was well down in the sky and satyrus couldnt account for all the hours of the day next to satyrus his uncle gathered his officers and issued orders as he walked when we get to the gully water the horses by troop fast as you can crax you cover us while we water then we retire past the gully in column till we find the girls and camp every man grooms his mount before he sleeps well fight again tomorrow and weve lost all our remounts this is what we have lost our remounts antigonus said zeus soter strategos thats bad worse than you think brother diodorus spat dont let anyone stop dont let anyone fall out use force if you have to we cant spare a man even the lost sheep back there understand the hyperetai and the troop commanders all nodded saluted and walked back to their places in the column and a litany of close up and move your arse started to roll up and down the small column uncle diodorus satyrus asked quietly the strategos turned his head and raised one saltcrusted eyebrow did we win satyrus asked diodorus shook his head i dont think we won enough he said the stream at the bottom of the gully flowed clear and bright despite the events of the day and satyrus and his new bay drank greedily satyrus washed his face and hands in the crisp water and found that the burns around his eyes were far worse than hed expected and he poured handfuls of water over his eyes until a keltoi trooper pulled him firmly from the stream he collected the reins of his mare and led her up the far bank of the watercourse that horse looks like she has some life in her diodorus said he had a fig in his fist and was eating it between bites he gave orders boy take that nice horse and go and find the baggage should be less than a stade over the ridge then double back and tell us where they are satyrus took two tries to get himself up on the big mares back his arms were too weak to vault but he got up and he pleased himself immensely by giving his uncle a salute then he pulled his broad felt petasos hat off his back where it had rested uselessly all day while his face burned raw and pulled it down over his eyes the water made a difference he set his mare at the slope and she got up it with style her haunches pushing powerfully as they climbed he patted her neck good girl he said all her tack was mounted in silver with silver belt ends and sakastyle buckles the greeks seldom used buckles but they looked wonderful and the leopard skin made him smile as soon as he emerged from the gully end he was in the midst of a horde of camp followers and there were more all along the trade road going south hundreds of women some with children many crying and more walking in a worse silence they shied off the road as soon as they saw an armed man except for a few too tired or too victimized to flinch a stade past the eastern end of the gully he saw pickets a dozen cavalrymen in three posts he rode towards them urging his mount into a canter she responded easily crossing the low scrub grass like the wind the very wind that was dispersing the clouds of salt dust so that for the first time in eight hours the plain of gabiene was again visible satyrus rode up the ridge to see tasda a tanaiskelt hed known all his life greeting him from the picket tasda he called and his voice cracked he clasped hands with the man who removed his helmet your sister will rejoice tasda said soberly keep going over the ridge we have a laager is antigonus here satyrus asked and eumenes our eumenes that is were all thats left of our cavalry tasda said soberly satyrus grinned through his fatigue diodorus and the rest are right behind me he said and all the pickets turned their heads and dercorix another childhood acquaintance came trotting over the strategos lives he called ill be back satyrus said and turned his horse down the hill in a quarter of an hour they were all together the officers strained their voices and their authority to keep men from embracing their women and their comrades and despite the trials of the day the hippeis got enough eudaimonia from the discovery of their missing comrades to get their horses groomed and their tack stowed before they collapsed to lie sprawled on the ground and be fed by their equally exhausted slaves and followers satyrus and melitta embraced while theron berated them they ignored him i rescued this prince herakles melitta said proudly indicating a blond boy smaller than satyrus who stood behind her the son of iskander no less satyrus grinned and hugged her again i didnt manage anything so heroic he said but i got to ride in a cavalry charge he looked around wheres philokles theron spat sitting with the women basking in admiration he said you are all insane satyrus couldnt stop smiling although he found that he was sitting and couldnt get up you came with us of your own free will he said theron shook his head so i did he said melitta tugged his arm come and meet herakles she said i like him just for a moment satyrus was jealous he had never heard his sister like anyone with such fervour he cant be much if you had to rescue him satyrus said melitta gave him a look that indicated that he didnt know much he was as smart as you she said he didnt lose his head satyrus was mollified by the comparison he hugged his sister again zeus that was stupid sister what possessed us the oath silly she replied we swore right so every time we have the ability we have to fight they came to herakles standing alone and selfconscious he was a tall boy blond like his father but gawky his features too sharp and his shoulders too narrow to be the child of a god some of the olbian veterans were watching him a few staring openly he was after all alexanders son i hate being stared at by common people herakles said satyrus felt an immediate contrariness for this awkward boy an unfair dislike he succumbed to it anyway as he was tired and beginning to lose the daimon of war and to feel the collapse that followed no common people here he said that big man staring at you is carlus he was my fathers bodyguard when he defeated your father at the jaxartes river my father was never defeated herakles responded hotly have you ever met anyone who was there satyrus asked with lazy contempt shall we ask diodorus hama he put a hand on the boys shoulder my father is a god herakles said you are just a decadent greek something about the boys defiance made satyrus smile hey herakles its okay were alive and a lot of people arent assassins didnt get us relax herakles looked around why wont my mother let me in the tent he asked i hate it when she does this melitta rolled her eyes behind her new friends back and satyrus shook his head lets go and get some kykeon he said taking the boy by the shoulder and leading him away melitta shot him a look of thanks and he shook his head it was odd having a younger boy to support because satyruss feeling of disorientation vanished when he had to lead the boy he walked straight up to crax who was surrounded by soldiers and asked where he should put his blanket roll and whether he and the boy could get some food and crax dealt with him as if he was any other soldier do i look like a hyperetes crax said then he scratched his dusty blond beard and relented your baggage and your sisters is in first troops row theres wine and saltfish stew at the head of every street he grinned your aunt sappho did well for us satyrus walked down the rows of blanket rolls and packs that littered the street there were no tents of his troop he felt like a man he found his sisters red wool pack and then his own opened his leather bag and removed the carefully wrapped gold cups he also pulled out a wooden plate and a horn spoon lets eat he said walking back towards the head of the camp all around him men were eating and then going straight to sleep in the evening sun there was little talk and less laughter most men prayed and many libations were poured in the white sand by men who had felt the hand of a god keeping them alive why are they so quiet herakles asked suddenly soldiers are usually so boisterous satyrus looked at the other boy and felt old they fought a battle he said you did too or so my sister says he looked at melitta who was walking with them being silent and a little gawky not herself at all nobody feels like talking after a battle right i do herakles said i never get to talk to anybody he said and i didnt get to do anything your sister rescued me melitta was starting to look uncomfortable you helped she said you didnt lose your nerve my father would have killed them all and laughed herakles said miserably you need food satyrus said trying to sound commanding he scooped his wooden bowl full of kykeon a rich porridge of soft cheese barley meal and in this case wine eat philokles walked up to the fire filled his bowl and sat down good evening he said formally good evening satyrus replied he was a little shy of the spartan aware that he was guilty of gross disobedience the lady banugul is concerned for her son philokles said herakles you should go to her she told me to leave the tent herakles said between spoons of porridge she has just been made a widow philokles said your stepfather i have no stepfather my father is alexander the god my mother should never touch another man herakles spat the phrases as if he had learned them by rote philokles took a deep breath young man you are not my pupil but if you were and he gave satyrus a significant look i would tell you that your fathers godhood is neither here not there for you that you are responsible only for your own acts and need have no concern for your mother or your father and condemning your mother to a life of celibacy is unfair easy for you to say you just want to fuck her like every other man herakles turned his head away i assure you that i have no interest in sex with your mother and if you were my pupil i would now proceed to beat you to obedience philokles shot satyrus a look and satyrus sighed why did you rescue her then herakles asked men only do things for her for one reason she says it herself philokles smiled a look that neither satyrus nor melitta had seen in a long time once he said your mother made a poor decision and tried to kill satyruss father and me he raised an eyebrow at herakles this is an adult explanation are you prepared to be an adult young man herakles looked around at melitta most of all yes he said your mother tried to kill us instead we killed all her soldiers then satyruss father gave her an escort and let her go i wanted her killed philokles sat back herakles swallowed hard when time had passed i saw how kineass how satyruss fathers mercy had been the right decision for gods and men and then i decided that if i in my turn could ever do her a service then i would gain honour with the gods he nodded brusquely in this way i share in the honour of my friend satyruss father understand melitta nodded and you have she said yes philokles said herakles if you have finished that bowl you should give it to satyrus so that he can eat and i will take you to your mother herakles rose to his feet and handed satyrus the bowl thanks he said come back and sit with us melitta said herakles smiled thanks lita he said philokles was only gone for as long as it took him to walk to where sapphos slaves had pitched a small tent for banugul and back have you eaten philokles asked satyrus yes satyrus said come with me philokles said he didnt say a word as they walked through the camp until they came to a third troop mess where theron sat stirring fish stew theron looked at satyrus and then looked away well philokles asked satyrus hung his head master theron i come to beg your forgiveness for my bad behaviour theron nodded lad i am going to offer you the same choice that a tutor once offered me i know that your actions and your sisters saved lives i also know that the gods must have worked extra hard to save you from death and that i gave a year of my life in worry you understand boy yes master theron good here is your choice a beating now or i leave your service theron stood up he was very large satyrus didnt hesitate ill have the beating he said head up both men nodded obviously pleased theron had a switch cut from poplar he hit satyrus ten times it wasnt a particularly savage beating satyrus had had worse from philokles but neither was it symbolic it hurt and then it was over afterwards he lay down on his blankets face down because his whole back hurt and melitta cried a little why dont they beat me she said it was my idea satyrus laughed through a sob youre a girl he said stupid greeks she said after a while theron came and massaged his back and helped the twins put a pair of cavalry javelins up like an x with a third for a tent pole you were both very brave today theron said despite the pain in his back satyrus went to sleep with a smile on his face i n the morning satyrus was so stiff that he could only rise to his feet by grasping the pole of his impromptu tent and even that caused his stomach muscles to protest but he rose when ordered stumbled out into the near dark and found his beautiful new horse he made sure she was fed and walked her all the way back to the gully with the watering party before he got a handful of dried figs from his sister and a slice of honey cake from sappho for breakfast melitta was astride bion eating her breakfast in the saddle and casting a great many glances at the small tent where banugul lay he repicketed his horse and sat with hama and dercorix to eat sharing the honey cake with an appreciative audience you have to pay apollodorus for that horse hama said or give it back and well find you a remount satyrus rubbed his chin which felt weirdly itchy i dont have any money he said melitta came and sat with her back to his handing out dates were not poor brother diodorus will give you money that beasts worth a talent of silver hama said poseidon satyrus said really shes wearing a dozen mina of silver on her harness boy he was watching something theres trouble hama said pointing a tattooed arm at a clump of saka sitting on their ponies across the gully two of them turned and rode away in a spurt of dust now satyrus asked hama he looked around dont we need to do something about the saka the keltoi man nodded not really lord no one wants more killing right now and they have had a taste of bronze from our pickets now no time like the present just acknowledge the debt lad thatll be enough satyrus wiped his sticky hands on his sisters barbarian trousers arousing her indignation but he skipped out of range and trotted off she didnt follow because herakles came out of his mothers tent wearing a shining white chiton and a diadem of gold most of the hippeis had camped in the same order that they rode so each file became a mess and sat around their own fire apollodorus was in third file of first troop satyrus found him drinking camomile tea is a talent fair satyrus asked walking up all the men in the mess group stood as if he was an officer apollodorus frowned a talent of silver lord he couldnt hold the frown thatll have to do herald coming in another trooper said shovelling barleyporridge into a bowl cant be good news he handed the bowl to satyrus barley lad it was full of honey and satyrus ate the whole bowl with more appetite than he thought he had while the herald dismounted and exchanged words with andronicus beyond the wagon laager clean your bowl lord a woman asked the camp was almost besieged by women not their own women who were inside the laager but hundreds of hungry refugees from yesterdays disaster begging food for their children grimfaced pickets kept them outside the wagons but many of the troopers handed out their scraps a few single men simply walked out of the gate and chose companions they and their children changed status instantly coming in past the pickets satyrus watched his uncle who in turn was watching the process with a jaundiced eye he shook his head gathered a couple of handfuls of grass and wiped the bowl clean and handed it back to the owner then he walked over to diodorus who stood alone looking thunderous satyrus wanted to continue being a soldier not a boy he hoped hed be allowed to ride with the troop again good morning strategos satyrus said diodorus finished his wifes honey cake nice piece of work yesterday boy he said dusting his hands on his chiton i told you not to get honey on that chiton sappho called the strategos looked sheepish and stepped away from his wagon we need to move he said the refugees will get desperate tomorrow antigonus the strategos not our troop commander has demanded a parley the hippeis seemed to get an unending amount of mirth out of the fact that they had both a eumenes and an antigonus among them satyrus was delighted to be addressed in such an adult manner it seemed to promise well what will you do he asked diodorus nodded you and i will go and meet the great man he said while eumenes and crax get our people out of here you ready to move satyrus was wearing the same chiton as yesterday and no boots may i have a few minutes sir he asked heart pumping hard five no three hurry diodorus was already turning away to crax who looked clean neat and golden satyrus had missed some change in orders because all around him men were tying up their kit wrapping spare gear in cloaks and tying them in bundles handing things to slaves satyruss gear was the last in his area of the camp to be lying on the ground under the hasty shelter he pulled it all down and tried to roll his cloak as tightly as he saw the soldiers doing but his sister stopped him dont be silly she said ill get slaves to pack you get your corslet on and your boots his thracian boots were crusted in salt and dried hard but he got them on feeling the beating in his back and the fatigue in his abdomen his corslet was soaked through with sweat and clammy the cord that held his sword was almost broken and he tied it hurriedly and tossed the scabbard over his head and made sure it was in his armpit and then he made himself trot to his mare although he didnt want to trot anywhere melitta didnt look exhausted and his uncle and crax looked as fresh as the new day of course neither of them had been beaten by their tutors for disobedience it took him three attempts and some ungraceful squirming to get a leg over the mares back she stood for it though and he was up only then did he realize that he didnt have his petasos hat or his helmet zeus soter he swore and regretted his impiety too late to get his hat he rode around the camp to the gate pushed his horse through the crowd of women and children and reined in by his uncle melitta ran up clutching his hat he smiled at her what would i do without you he asked get even redder she said she clasped his hand and then his uncle was up on a charger and they were riding out of the gate through the women past the pickets and past the gully andronicus came with them his trumpet on his hip and twenty troopers led by hama on the far side of the gully they saw the band of saka the chief motioned with his hand as if beckoning the tanais troopers to come across the gesture might have been well meant but it might also have been mocking ill go satyrus said i can talk to them hama grunted diodorus sighed nothing less threatening than a twelveyearold hama spat they could kill him diodorus looked around carlus go with him do it satyrus our goal here is to waste as much time as possible diodorus patted him on the shoulder satyrus glanced at hama and rode forward he angled off to avoid the gully and then rode straight at the saka who came to meet them surrounding them and calling shrilly to one another carlus towered over him right at his shoulder his spear on its throwing loop whose band is this satyrus called out in sakje and the man with the most gold reined in his pony and laughed astlan of the river foxes he called i am satrax of the cruel hands satyrus responded my mother is srayanka who fought with your queen zarina against iskander astlan raised his hand in greeting names of story he said you do not look like a son of the people he said he shrugged but you talk the peoples talk we intend to make parley with antigonus satyrus said will you let us pass the massagetae chief shrugged you are no enemy of mine son of srayanka ride free the saka whooped and rode off in a thin veil of dust satyrus rode up the ridge towards the bluff carlus at his shoulder a couple of the saka paced them and a young woman waved at him greetings cousin he shouted she grinned greetings cousin she shouted back and rode in closer she had gold plaques on her tunic and gold in her hair and gold foil wrapped her braids you are just a boy she said when she was closer i thought you were a spearmaiden satyrus blushed with embarrassment but she smiled again her eyes had an odd shape im darya of the golden horses she said i killed a greek yesterday yiee satrax of the cruel hands he called to her i maimed a peasant and cut down some fleeing men who wanted my horse she paced him up the ridge good hunting she called and wheeled away waving her bow nice fucking horse my sister would have made her a friend for life satyrus thought he sighed carlus grunted my shoulders are tight he said i wait for the arrow in the back he gave satyrus a gaptoothed grin like riding with your father eh at the top of the ridge were a dozen horsemen and satyrus was surprised to find that one of them was the young officer hed outrun the day before hail lord he said slowing his mount i come to speak for diodorus of tanais the young man had a blond beard and bright blue eyes i am demetrios he said in a tone replete with selfimportance bring your diodorus to me he looked down the ridge you seem friendly with my saka im surprised they did not eat you for breakfast satyrus kept his face as neutral as twelve years could manage i will go and find my strategos dont keep me waiting boy demetrios called his breastplate and helmet were newly polished his eyes were on the horse satyrus was riding satyrus bowed from the back of his mare and turned away where did you get that horse demetrios shouted after him satyrus affected not to hear and rode down the ridge and around the gully passing back through the loose line of massagetae they paid him no attention at all although darya waved at him he cantered back to diodorus and saluted demetrios awaits you at the top of the ridge satyrus shook his head i dont like it i dont like it either lord carlus said he has a hundred men around him and hes a hothead boy he didnt offer us laurel or olive or safe passage demetrios is antigonuss son diodorus said he honours us in a backhanded way and were buying time he motioned over his shoulder where a distant curl of dust indicated sapphos wagons rolling out heading south and east they started forward around the gully riding slowly never faster than a walk you know what happened last night diodorus asked satyrus satyrus wondered if this was about his punishment he looked at the strategos no he said anything to keep his uncle talking we didnt lose the battle yesterday antigonus lost his phalanx heavy casualties our leader eumenes rallied his beaten cavalry at the end of the day and antigonus retreated diodoruss voice was grim and he held his horse to a walk although demetrios was plainly visible on the skyline so we won satyrus asked listen boy late afternoon and eumenes summoned all his commanders to meet him remember i rode away diodorus looked at him and satyrus could see the fatigue in his eyes yes satyrus replied as i rode up the fucking macedonians seized him they tried to get me his own officers betrayed him diodoruss face was a mask there are no rules any more satyrus no honour zeus soter they call us mercenaries faithless he shook his head so be ready for anything hear me satyrus wanted to ask why hed been brought but he decided to let it go astlan and a pair of riders rode up looked at them from a few horselengths and cantered easily away they had bows in their hands but no arrows on the string yet satyrus turned out of his uncles small column and trotted over to darya feeling bold he reached into his quiver and took out an arrow one of his own redshafted arrows fletched in heron feathers here he said she smiled she had dimples and jetblack hair she gave him one of her own arrows the massagetae of her band began to tease her and she swatted another girl with her bow then she flashed a smile at satyrus who returned it with interest and cantered back to carlus i thought that id lost you for a moment carlus said try not to do that again give the boy some respect diodorus said his sakje may be all that is keeping us from their arrows demetrios displayed his impatience by cantering down the hill away from his entourage can we get this done he said my father offers you all your lives you will take service with us there its done you boy thats my spare horse hand it over shes a nisaean the silverhelmeted young man reached for satyruss reins satyrus backed the mare away leaving the blond officer grasping air spearwon he said delighted with himself for remembering the right word at the right time you lost you stupid greek give me my horse demetrios became aware that he was surrounded by enemy cavalry touch me and you are all dead diodorus caught the enemy boys bridle and turned his horse youll be worth a pretty penny he said ride for it they thundered away through the surprised saka and across the ridge past the gully satyrus didnt start breathing until they were within the circuit of their own pickets not an arrow flew their way demetrios was all but raving you are all dead men you have broken your oaths you fucking greek mercenaries you scum his escort hadnt pursued them past the gully diodorus handed the blonds reins to hama i couldnt resist listen boy we swore no oaths you offered us no safe conduct your herald didnt have a staff and you did not win the battle now speak your piece then maybe ill let you go back to your father demetrios didnt lack courage he looked around him as if assessing the situation youre the boy who shot past us yesterday he said to satyrus he grinned suddenly and looked like the statue of a young apollo my father offers you wages and demands the return of any booty you have taken and the handing over of certain people i am not to discuss this in public he looked around him satyrus admired his coolness because the golden boy was smiling as if hed just been given a gift dad says im a hothead ill never live this down you will let me go he really will kill you look at the force hes putting together demetrios pointed at the mass of cavalry already gathering on the ridge beyond the gully what people diodorus asked eumenes widow and her bastard son demetrios said we will not mistreat her diodorus looked south along the valley from the top of the ridge that had held their pickets all night he could see that sapphos wagons had made fifteen stades and were still rolling the answer is no diodorus said after a moment no we wont take service with your father and no we wont return any booty and no you cannot have banugul although i wish you fucking had her already he said shaking his head as to being fucking greeks and mercenaries i was overwrought demetrios said cheerfully i have a temper your father arranged with the argyraspids to have my employer murdered did he not diodorus was watching as more macedonian cavalry crested the far ridge the mutinous troops killed eumenes demetrios said what you say is a very serious accusation go and tell your father that if he wants us he can try and catch us diodorus said now get off your horse this is my best horse demetrios said it is about to become my best horse diodorus said think of it as the cost of a little lesson in war you still have a great deal to learn next time you offer someone a truce keep it demetrios dismounted he turned to satyrus who are you he asked satyrus son of kineas he said demetrios gave him a goodnatured smile and tossed him his silver helmet you might as well have this to go with the horse that way ill know you next time he grinned turned away and started to jog across the grass to the north there goes fifty talents of gold hama said bitterly we got a horse diodorus led them back south towards the vanishing column of dust antigonus oneeye would follow us to the ends of the earth to rescue his son he said i hope it wont be worth his while to pursue us otherwise they really murdered eumenes crax asked someone did i saw them grab him yesterday argyraspids and some cavalry officers diodorus shook his head he deserved better where in hades do we go now asked eumenes the olbian who rode up from the head of his troop hello young satyrus he reached out for the silver helmet that satyrus was still holding thats quite a piece of kit satyrus hugged him eumenes eyed the helmet well id be careful where i wore it he said laughing young apollo over there will probably want it back he said something of the sort satyrus admitted diodorus looked around has this outfit lost any semblance of discipline you people have troops to command i believe where are we going crax asked tanais is gone and eumenes the cardian is dead were out of employers diodorus gave them a tight smile aegypt he said down the hills to the euphrates up the euphrates until we can cut across the desert to the jordan and down the jordan to alexandria crax shook his head thats five thousand stades he said by hermes strategos we dont have remounts we dont have food and were surrounded by enemies we dont have a bronze obol amongst us twenty days should see us to ptolemys outposts diodorus said well buy remounts or take them look i have the first one under my hand we couldnt buy a donkey crax said remember how oneeye was asking for our loot back diodorus asked smirking at eumenes crax grinned that was a good one what loot the loot i got eumenes said while you folks were gallivanting around the battlefield i lifted oneeyes treasury he shrugged at craxs disbelieving look all tyche brother i got lost in the salt haze and i tripped over these packhorses they all laughed and satyrus now one of them laughed too when they rejoined the column they found banugul sitting on a white nisaean with her son on a black mare she looked like a queen her paleskinned beauty scarcely aged she wore a considerable amount of carefully applied cosmetics more than satyrus had ever seen on a free woman and she had a clothofgold scarf tied over her hair her purpleblue eyes sparkled under the shawl and she was obviously angry herakles looked deeply unhappy diodorus rode up in a swirl of dust and embraced his sappho beautiful job he said she gave him a lopsided grin men she said birth a baby and theyve nothing to say but get a column moving i wish to go to oneeye banugul said diodorus gawked at her what he tried to kill you yesterday she shook her head i am not going to aegypt with a column of mercenaries she said her tone softened there are many men here with no reason to love me or alexanders son either diodorus i will never forget that philokles saved me nor that kineass daughter saved my son but i am the satrap of hyrkania and antigonus oneeye is now my lord i will go and make obeisance to him sappho laughed banugul glared at her diodorus rubbed his chin he asked for you and the boy right enough the strategos said he might just kill you banugul smiled it was an easy smile a light smile and it undid fifteen years of ageing and rendered her aphroditelike he will not kill me he needs my father and my brothers and my son will give him legitimacy i want to be a king herakles said suddenly not a pawn your father started as a pawn banugul said and then in a kinder way she said your turn will come i want to stay with satyrus and melitta he said satyrus rode over to the boy and clasped his hand as men do we will be friends he said diodorus looked at sappho and then at eumenes the young olbian gave a slight nod so did sappho youd be doing us a favour and no mistake lady diodorus acknowledged if you were to to go to him oneeye might just let us go he looked at the northern horizon but weve got hades own jump on the bastard i think we can outrun him banugul smiled her aphrodite smile again so many brave men but not today diodorus exchanged one more look with his wife fine ill send a herald banugul nodded by leaving you i return the favour that philokles and kineas did me sappho turned her head away satyrus could tell that his aunt didnt like the beautiful queen melitta came up the column already covered in dust from riding around visiting apparently unaware of her condition she rode into the command group herakles is leaving she asked yes sappho answered say your goodbyes his mother feels shell do better with our enemies the men who just murdered her husband banuguls head shot around and her glare had the power of a thousand courtly confrontations and sappho met it full on better for all of us really diodorus was heard to mutter hama take a file from first troop and andronicus as your herald melitta embraced a startled herakles who then hugged her back with sudden fervour she kissed him which got a grunt of disapproval from his mother sappho exchanged her frown for a smile anything that displeased the blonde persian woman pleased her i wont forget you herakles called as he rode away satyrus waved to him and then pressed his heels to his mount galloped up by the other boy and handed him a javelin one of his own a nice heavy one now youre armed he said then he made himself say something personal remember what philokles said yesterday dont try to be your father just be yourself herakles gripped his hand so hard it hurt and satyrus was shocked to see tears in the boys eyes they clasped hands again and herakles rode away when satyrus rode back to his uncle the strategos was frowning at the dust raised by banuguls party i should have sent more of an escort you should have sent her alone sappho said you are not helping diodorus said through clenched teeth satyrus rode away from them back along the column to his sister who cried for a little very quietly i really liked him she said satyrus didnt have much of an idea what to say so he gave her a quick and clumsy hug from horseback and they rode on without speaking silence was the order of the day and a lot of glances back past the dust of the column theyre all worried about the escort satyrus said hed just worked it out if antigonus murdered eumenes the cardian he could do anything including murdering banugul his sister sobbed what did i say he asked the gods just the fucking obvious you are so useless melittas voice trembled crax went out with the prodromoi to find a campsite and still there was no sign of hama or the escort crax returned long after melittas tears had dried and she and her brother were reconciled and still there was no news they made camp a cold and hasty camp which consisted mostly of picketing horses and unrolling blankets and cloaks the mountains rose all around them and it was cold and in the last light of the late summer evening it began to rain melitta pressed hard against her brothers back i really liked him she said herakles i mean i know who you mean satyrus said of course you did theron said kindly from the other side of the sleeping pile he was a nice enough boy for the son of a god go to sleep philokles ordered they all slept fitfully the intermittent rain and the cold making real sleep impossible melitta shivered and satyruss hips were hurting from sleeping on the ground he pulled his thracian cloak over his face to keep the rain off of it and managed to slip away he smelled the lion skin first and then he saw the club you have done well said a voice deep enough to raise the hairs on the back of his neck satyrus snapped awake with the scent of wet cat fur in his nostrils he lay awake a long time listening to his heart race and to therons snores until the reality of the dream slipped into the next one and he relaxed and slept they were all stiffer and older in the morning and the horses were tired but just after first light when the sentries were calling men to wake a young trooper rode in weary but obviously full of news and went to the cluster of tents that stood in the centre of the camp by the time satyrus was sharing a bowl of yogurt and honey with his sister the news was spreading from fire to fire and the sound of laughter could suddenly be heard and fatigue began to fall away philokles came over having been to diodoruss tent melitta oneeye welcomed banugul as a queen with open arms and his escort hailed herakles as the son of alexander he smiled at her she nodded excuse me she said slipping away a little thats good to hear satyrus said just to say something philokles and theron both nodded oneeye sent diodorus a safeconduct philokles added zeus soter theron said so were going to live eventually hes going to discover that we have his pay chest philokles said not much later the whole escort came in with another dozen troopers who had been accounted dead they were stripped of their armour but they were mounted and glad to be released most of them had been taken prisoner while wandering lost in the dust cloud diodorus finished with other business strode up you dont have to live like soldiers you know that you can all stay with us he said we have an empty tent he added pointing at the tent where banugul had stayed it wasnt meant to be funny but for some reason it made all the men around the fire roar with laughter satyrus looked at his tutor philokles nodded i think it is time my charges learned to live like soldiers he said diodorus smiled well he said looking at the horizon theyll have all the way to aegypt to learn it they all laughed together glad to be alive and their laughter rose to heaven like a sacrifice and just for a moment satyrus could smell lion skin part iv grinding bc i have no intention of fighting oneeye if i can help it cassander said he was dressed in a magnificent purple chlamys over a chiton that would have looked rich on a king fighting oneeye is foolish he eliminated eumenes and now hes on top but hes vulnerable i want oneeye to fight ptolemy while i take ptolemys soldiers away from him cassander was visiting athens in state he came with an extensive entourage that taxed the best efforts of demetrios of phaleron and all his political allies to support him as menander joked it was as if the man ate gold they were gathered in demetrioss house a palace in all but name cassander was surrounded by macedonians but there were other greeks in his train and important allies like eumeles of pantecapaeum demetrios of phaleron had brought his own allies the men he trusted to run athens and then men whose gold helped keep cassander fed stratokles lay full length on a kline and fingered his beard more salt than pepper in it now and exchanged a glance with the only men in the room that he trusted the scarred mercenary who called himself iphicrates and his own lieutenant the big italian called lucius how will you persuade antigonus to attack ptolemy philip son of amyntas asked he was just the sort of fool who asked such questions indeed stratokles counted on him to ask such questions he was not the only officer in the room to wonder every macedonian officer wondered the same and stratokles wondered if cassander the murdering regent the ally of athens the rapist of greece was finally losing his touch never you mind cassander said his chuckle was syrupy almost flirtatious antigonus and i go back he said with a wicked smile hes old and his son is a fool i can control them coming from the man who had assassinated olympias alexanders mother and her principal rivals the statement didnt seem to hold the hubris it might have held from a lesser or greater man cassander was no fool on the battlefield but in the world of politics and assassination he was the master i think that you underestimate ptolemy demetrios said perhaps cassander smiled but i doubt it a man with a reputation for plaindealing called farm boy by his troops is hardly a candidate for survival in this world stratokles couldnt help himself hes done pretty well so far he said cassander turned and looked at him always an unsettling experience most men flinched from the physical reality of stratokles face but not cassander with my allys permission you seem perfect to go to aegypt on my behalf my duplicitous darling as athenss ambassador craving freedom from tyranny cassander smiled because the greek citystates and their prating about freedom made him laugh but anyone with a brain at ptolemys court will see that you are from me tell him im desperate get him to fill his ships with his macedonian regulars and send them to me ill strip him of real soldiers and then antigonus can have him and aegypt too stratokles rubbed his beard his eyes went to menanders and the playwright nodded slightly a simple enough piece of deception i can do it stratokles said but im not sure he added prepared to make an honest summation of his hesitancy largely based on how many enemies he had made in the athenian factions im not known here as stratokles the informer out of the love of my fellow citizens athens the things i do for you do it cassander laughed my dear viper you can do it and make the farm boy like the taste of the poison i have no doubt he looked at demetrios can you spare me your snake but if antigonus has the revenues of aegypt hell be invincible said diognes demetrioss lover the handsomest man in greece demetrios of phaleron had hard grey eyes the eyes of athena men said he ignored the beautiful young man on his couch and his eyes flicked from cassander to stratokles i can spare him but i doubt your wisdom in this cassander better you than me demetrios stratokles said to himself he too thought it a fools errand but as usual cassander was the one driving the chariot and athens was only along for the ride diognes my dear beautiful and rather emptyheaded boy this is why you are an ornament at parties and im the regent of macedon if antigonus takes aegypt hell use more of his precious macedonians to garrison it thats all that matters dont you see soldiers real soldiers they come from macedon our only export but just now the most valuable export in the world no one but a macedonian can hold a sarissa and fight no infantry in the world can beat us he smiled at them uncaring that hed just offended every greek in the room well take ptolemys veterans as our tax and next year well use them to break antigonus oneeye or perhaps lysimachos it hardly matters once i have the phalanxes i can go where i want the regent raised his heavily lidded eyes from the pretty athenian and they dropped on stratokles as if his glance had real weight you my viper are the tool i need to move this particular rock stratokles thought that it was a bad sign that the macedonians were starting to believe their own propaganda it was less than ten years since the hoplites of athens had broken a macedonian phalanx he caught the eye of his friend iphicrates whose face was mottled red and white with anger it was his turn to shake his head even though any outburst would have been supported by every athenian present even menander a notoriously unmilitary man was offended the insult from the regent viper a term no man could bear was almost a compliment from cassander athens the crap i take for you stratokles thought when the time comes ill bury these arrogant barbarians in their own guts eumeles everyone called him heron the socalled king of the bosporus pushed forward past the macedonians ptolemy still harbours my enemies he said cassander glanced at stratokles with a grimace that was hidden from the euxines tyrant he made a motion with his hand as if to say what can i do the regent of macedon rolled over to look at eumeles and no grain will reach my enemies your word on it eumeles bowed my word on it he glanced at stratokles but id like the ahem unfinished business wrapped up cassander nodded thats right stratokles the two children olympias wanted them dead heron here wants them dead and you missed them eh dont miss them again understand stratokles shrugged heron over there he wanted them dead and olympias made it her business but its no part of an embassy to murder brats he looked to demetrios of phaleron for guidance demetrios had been a follower of phocions as had the childrens father kineas although stratokles had no real love for demetrios he was an athenian demetrioss hard grey eyes narrowed he took a breath to speak and then shook his head and took a drink of wine cassander pursed his lips it was always dangerous to confront cassander on any subject and demetrios the most powerful man in the room save cassander had refused we must be pretty desperate stratokles thought very well he said ill try and put the children down before i leave but not until then if my hand is seen ill be expelled or worse then dont be caught cassander said then he relented i see your point hire someone to do it and make sure my hands cant be seen he smiled how about your doctor hes been useful before cassanders golden good looks and his eyes heavily lidded like an opiumeaters were all deceptive hes a good deal uglier than me stratokles thought i think its time we changed horses he thought to himself later in a private room he made the same point to menander i agree the poet admitted but demetrios says we need him right now things are bad succeed in this aegyptian thing and perhaps well get a breathing space stratokles took a deep breath and rubbed his nose i hate him enough to consider tyrannicide at his friends startled look he said not our tyrant menander i mean cassander but he packed his bags for alexandria nonetheless he took the time to send a letter to the doctor in athens offering the man a place in his embassy and providing in addition a list of members of the assembly of that city and their various transgressions and he brought lucius to run his bodyguard he had many enemies and the judicious use of force would be required he changed the emphasis of his reporting system so that reports from alexandria took priority he listened to a great many reports from spies before he sailed away in his own trireme for alexandria the newest city in the world stratokles informants were capable men and women he paid informers from the euxine to the pillars of herakles to provide him information so when the new city rolled up at the edge of the horizon he knew where leon lived and who lived with him he knew the names of leons ships and the names of his factors this was routine information because leon and stratokles had brushed up against each other in the pursuit of their own interests sometimes in conflict sometimes in alliance for ten years and he knew that ptolemy had an aegyptian mistress and he knew that amastris the daughter of dionysius of heraklea was due to return to alexandria any day the richest heiress in the hellenic world from a city vital to athenss interests he knew that the court was looking to hire a doctor for the palace he even knew that sophokles the athenian standing at his side had been bribed by cassander to watch him the thought made stratokles smile at the smoothfaced man at his side you always worry me when you are so palpably amused the doctor said he reached down and rubbed the scar on his knee stratokles smiled and slapped him on the back plenty of work for you in alexandria my friend he said my pleasure sophokles said the sand of the palaestra was cool on his cheek but he shifted his weight and rotated his shoulders and his trainer rolled off him and backpedalled swiftly regaining his feet in the motion satyrus rose a little more slowly with his hands up and his arms well extended there was some scattered applause from other men who had stopped training to watch that used to get you every time theron said he smiled of course you didnt always have shoulders like an ox satyrus was three years older and heavier taller and wider a young man in peak physical condition with long dark hair and shoulders as wide as many alexandrian doors but he still hadnt beaten theron they circled and more men gathered to watch they were army officers and senior courtiers macedonians most of them although a few were greeks they knew a good fight when they saw one and some quiet wagers began satyrus spun on his right foot raised his left a fraction and faked a blow at therons face with his left hand theron caught his jab and went to hold the arm and satyrus had to abandon his feint combination and backpedal to avoid the humiliation of giving his opponent an easy win he felt the skin abrade as he ripped his left hand free theron stepped in following up his advantage and shot his right fist out catching satyrus on the ribs a bruising blow but it was only pain the younger man moved his hips to the right the same way hed spun out of the last two holds and then went left theron was caught by the move and satyrus managed to land a weak left jab to his coachs head as he moved and then he did it again faking a third sliding step and then kicking out with his right foot at therons left ankle his blow went in and the corinthian rolled with the pain put his weight on his good right foot and shot a fist at satyrus catching him high on the side of the head and rocking him back before losing his balance to the left and stumbling both of them backed away and every man in the gymnasium breathed as one and a few cheered the betting thickened in athens betting on two gentlemen citizens in a public gymnasium would have been bad form but alexandria was a different city a different world theron circled warily favouring his left foot satyrus thought that he was lying faking injury was part of the massive repertory of tricks that a good pankrationist had to master and theron did it well given that his left foot is fine what should i do satyrus thought he wiped sweat from his eyes and fought a temptation to attack just to cut the tension he had landed several good blows the leg kick would have put most of his friends down on the sand theron feinted and satyrus stepped back declining the engagement and both of them went back to circling satyrus considered a feint based on the false assumption that therons foot was hurt in a few heartbeats he assessed the possible blows and holds and chose two simple obvious moves a faked kick at the same ankle should draw theron into committing on the very foot he pretended was injured after that weight change he would step in for a grapple no sooner had he seen the combination than he allowed his body to flow into the routine not a sudden attack but a graceful sway of a body feint followed by the real blow no more real than therons fake injury a low sweep with his right foot against his opponents weak left leg theron obliged him by putting his weight on the injured leg and striking like lightning satyrus was quick too and he took therons blow on the point of his shoulder the pain was a spike of lightning in his skull but he was under much of it and he butted his head straight into therons jaw and then stepped on the mans left instep and just barely avoided the instinctive planting of his left knee in his coachs crotch a killing blow combination that they practised for war but not for the palaestra in that hesitation therons left arm wrapped around his neck pinning his head to the corinthians chest the second he felt the pressure satyrus pushed with the full strength of both legs attacking into the hold and spilling the corinthian backwards as he himself twisted to avoid the hold both of them rolled as they hit the sand and there was a flurry of prone holds and blows and then both of them scrambling like wounded crabs rolled apart and got slowly to their feet applause hearty this time at least a hundred men satyrus made himself smile hed had the fight there just for a second and somehow hed missed his shot and now his confidence was ebbing and his coach was rising blood leaking from a big gash on his thigh but otherwise unimpaired lord ptolemy came the shout men scurried to get out of the rulers way and many not all bowed stop that ptolemy called dont stop the pankration hades is that theron he had a white chiton trimmed in purple and a diadem in his hair he was one of the ugliest men in the room with a nose like the prow of a ship and a forehead that rose into a naked egg of baldness satyrus liked him he clamped down on his fears and willed himself back into the fight theron was smiling he stepped in and launched his usual strong right emboldened by the kings appearance satyrus didnt step back instead he tried the same trick that theron had used earlier in the bout he reached out to trap the corinthians blow theyve been at it five minutes and not a single fall a courtier said you should have seen hush the king said theron was not surprised by his attempted trap he let his pupil grasp the arm and then he reached out with his other arm and grabbed satyruss right shoulder halfrotated him on impetus and tripped him over an outflung leg but satyrus still had the arm as he went down he tightened his hold virtually the same attack hed tried as a much lighter twelveyearold theron tried to spin with the hold and satyrus tried to keep his feet both of them failed and down they both went to a dogfight on the sand they fell too close for either man and satyrus got an elbow in the face that blinded him and a foot in the gut that took his wind and then he rolled clear hed landed at least one hard shot himself in the scrum he got to his feet on training alone theron was slower rising with his right arm cradled in his left but he shook his head to clear it and got his hands up to guard satyrus exerted every mina of his will to raise his arms into the guard but his left arm didnt want to obey it didnt hurt it just wouldnt move he shook his head and the room swayed nonetheless he had enough grasp of the fight to see that theron was as rocked as he and he stepped forward to try a right overhand blow to end the fight stop the king said the men roared satyrus rocked a little frozen on the edge of his blow you are both on the verge of serious injury and i need every man the regent of aegypt said he grinned his farmers grin it was beautiful though who wins called one of the many philips an officer in the foot companions we have bets ptolemy looked at both of them for some beats of satyruss heart draw bellowed the lord of aegypt and the crowd roared again ptolemy came and clasped hands with the contestants before they went off to the baths he and theron exchanged a smile theron occasionally trained him then ptolemy turned to satyrus you are a very promising young man he said that set tongues wagging throughout the court satyruss family his uncles diodorus and leon and philokles were important men ptolemys words suggested to satyrus that his turn was coming and his heart soared he clasped the lords arm and beamed at your service lord he said afterwards after the hot bath and the cold bath and the massage they went out together with a crowd of satyruss friends down the steps of the public gymnasium in a tide of adulation you may yet defeat me theron said with a grin i doubt it but i begin to think it is possible satyrus shook his head i had a moment today he shrugged his neck hurt and his left eye would have a bruise like badly applied henna in an hour or so i still have a lot to learn music to my ears boy theron said a cup of wine with you master satyrus asked no go and drink with your cronies boy theron put a giant arm around him and gave him a squeeze your uncle leon is home tonight his ship is already in with the lighthouse and when hes home youll be worked like a dog and no more playing with flute girls leon had taken satyrus on a dozen voyages satyrus had rowed he had served as a marine and he had served as a supercargo counting amphorae leon believed that boys needed to work this summer he had sailed twice as helmsman under instruction of course satyrus loved girls and wine but so far the greatest love of his life was the sea satyrus grinned already being tugged away by his friends ill be there and ill sacrifice to poseidon for his safe return see that you have a safe return boy theron called over the crowd and then they were away crossing the great agora where the four districts met you dont believe all that shit do you satyrus dionysius asked dionysius was a year older the son of a macedonian in ptolemys service he was handsome well bred and intelligent and he could quote most of the plays of aristophanes and every new work by menander propitiating the gods thats for peasants satyrus wasnt in the mood for a philosophical quarrel the more so as dionysius for all his airs wasnt nearly as well educated as philokles my tutor says that respect for the gods cannot ever be wrong he said youre such a prude dionysius said if you didnt have a beautiful body no one would speak to you satyrus had learned enough from his sister to sense that dionysius was unhappy at having satyrus at centre stage because of his neartriumph in the gymnasium well fought youngster called timarchus one of the macedonian cavalry officers and eumenes far above him on the steps waved satyrus waved back so much attention from a lot of washedup old soldiers dionysius said they were my fathers friends and mine satyrus said you look a lot less like a prig with a flute girls lips locked around your cock dionysius said some of the young men laughed satyruss somewhat spartan ethics made some of the young men uncomfortable and they loved to be reminded that he was as human as they but abraham a smaller boy with rich dark curls and a wrestlers build leaped to his defence youre a godless lot abraham said youll pay mark my words he laughed as he said it because it was one of his fathers favourite remarks satyrus blushed and pulled his chlamys a very light garment indeed in alexandria over his shoulder nonetheless he said to all his friends im going to the temple of poseidon bah no temple girls to ogle no wine shops to trash no actors whats the point ill go to cimons and wait cimons was their current addiction a house that stood on the edge of a number of districts both physical and legal it was a private house that served wine all day the wine was served in the form of an ongoing symposium where a great many women and not a few men disported with the patrons the house stood on the long spit of land where ptolemy was building the lighthouse and it had a remarkable view out over the sea the inscription over the lintel said that it was a house of a thousand breezes which dionysius translated as the house of a thousand blow jobs at every opportunity to cimons apparent delight the owner cimon was a former slave who had risen to prominence running a brothel satyrus knew that he was one of leons men and that leon owned the tavern at several removes he went to cimons because he knew it was safe whereas dionysius went there because he thought it was dangerous satyrus wondered how dionysius would deal with a storm at sea or a fight despite the young mans prettyboy airs satyrus suspected that he had a serious backbone ill meet you at cimons then satyrus said ill save you a flute girl dionysius said her cunny will taste of salt like the sea perhaps you could make your sacrifice to poseidon inside it satyrus blushed again and smiled abraham swatted the macedonian you jest too much about pious things he said and this time he was almost serious the other young men were divided evenly between the two favourites and their differing errands theodorus laughed no contest he said if i go to the temple of poseidon with satyrus my father will shit himself with happiness if im caught at cimons again ill get the opson and dissipation lecture and you wont see me for a week poppy he said and a small boyslave came up to him poppy run and tell pater that im on my way to the temple of poseidon to sacrifice get him to provide some cash the other young men laughed xenophon coenuss son and satyruss best friend shook his head none of you will live for ever in elysium he said youll lose interest in religion when your pimples clear dionysius said he mimed picking at one perhaps they are a gift from the gods xenophon stepped up close to the macedonian fuck you boylover asscunt ooh dionysius said very religious he waved slipping languorously out of xenophons grasp another time darling and i only love boys with beautiful skin satyrus for instance satyrus felt the flush even as the macedonian went off into the crowd with a dozen howling youths i want to kill him xenophon said his face was splotched red and white with fury stop acting like a child abraham said you let him get at you far too easily you have pimples big deal im a jew satyruss father is dead its all grist for dionysiuss mill the darkhaired young man gave a practised shrug to be honest xenophon he doesnt even mean harm and he is always surprised at the strength of your reactions my father says that when a man offends you you fight xenophon said my father says that when a man blasphemes i should kill him abraham said he raised an eyebrow xenophon allowed his rage to evaporate under the other boys humour he shook his head ruefully can we go to the temple now satyrus asked abrahams right xeno dionysius is like that to everyone you just need to roll with it like a blow on the palaestra easy for you to say xeno spat you have beautiful skin temple of poseidon satyrus said like a battlefield command and he started walking from the steps of the temple he could see leons darkhulled ship with its deepgored golden sail the ship was hard to miss with vermilion paint on the rails and vermilion oars flashing in the sun so close to the temple as he weathered the point that satyrus could hear the chant of the oar master and see leon himself standing by the rail satyrus had often imagined commanding the golden lotus hed made two voyages in her one just to cyprus the other the length of the sea to the coast of gaul serving under the helmsman peleus one of the heroes of satyruss adolescent pantheon uncle leon he shouted across half a stade of water leon closer to the call of the timoneer and the creak of the oars didnt hear him as the beautiful ship swept on even as she passed the temple her deckhands were getting the sail down and the whole rowing crew was settling on to their benches for the last pull into the harbour uncle leon he called and his friends took up the cry their combined efforts got the black mans attention and leon waved leon had been up the aegean to the euxine seeing old friends and avoiding enemies he had been all the way to heraklea or perhaps sinope trade was hard all the contestants in the great war had fleets and every side had authorized pirates to seize shipping in their names athens rhodos and alexandria still tried to keep trade going all three cities required trade to flourish behind his uncles flagship came a dozen merchant ships and then the triangular sails of heavy triremes six of them leon was rich even by the standards of alexandria and when he put together a convoy only a fleet could take his ships look at that xeno said my father says that when im sixteen i can go with leon as a marine satyrus smiled he had already gone as a marine and hoped to go again soon as a helmsman the thought was never far from his mind but there was a rumour in the villa that leon was going to take them home i loved being a marine satyrus said id love to do it again to get to sea even as an oarsman abraham chuckled rumour is that you sir are a prince lord ptolemy isnt likely to let you ship out again as a marine xeno here wellborn geeks are an obol a dozen satyrus shrugged not an obol a dozen if they were ptolemy wouldnt be so desperate to get settlers from greece abraham tugged his beard well argued he said one of his most endearing qualities was that he was open to reasoned argument and he conceded gracefully the young jewish man stopped at the edge of the temple precinct ill abide by jehovahs precepts and keep my body clear of your idolatry he said his smile took the sting from his words satyrus nodded alexandria was home to twenty religions and hundreds of heresies all of which fascinated his sister most citizens had learned to accept other religions even if they were not entirely respected abrahams people were monotheists with a few exceptions and a complex set of beliefs about a feminine embodiment of wisdom sophia and they didnt hold with temples and statues not much difference from socrates satyrus thought enjoy the view satyrus said and went inside xeno at his heels and theodorus close behind just as they found a priest theodoruss little slave caught up with him and handed him a purse gentlemen were in funds theodorus said shall we have a ram that would be noble xeno said with enthusiasm satyrus reached into the breast of his chiton and extracted his purse i couldnt cover my half he said dont be foolish satyrus my pater is paying theodorus turned to the priest and said wed like to sacrifice a white ram for the safe return of lord leon you can just see his golden lotus rounding the point the young priest bowed certainly sir the priesthoods at the new temple of poseidon were easy to acquire and most of the priests were social climbers this one was no different he looked them all over and decided that theodorus the one with the purse and the silk chlamys must be the one in charge let me choose you a fitting animal he bowed again satyrus winced he represents the god surely he ought to have a little more spirit xeno nodded and theodorus laughed you two deserve each other listen lads if he was anybody hed have been at the gymnasium do you know him no my money is that like all the other priests his mothers a local girl and hes trying to make his way by being as oily as possible all the gyptos are greasy the priest came back leading a white ram a very attractive animal my lord he said to theodorus my friend is actually making the sacrifice theodorus said dismissively i am merely attending satyrus took the halter of the animal and led it up to the altar the ram began to buck and shake as he smelled the blood but satyruss arm was too strong for him and satyrus got the lead rope through the ring on the altar before the young animal could set his feet to pull satyrus wrapped the rope twice around his left arm drew his sword disdaining the offer of the priests dagger and pulled hard on the rope cinching the rein tight against the bolt so that the ram was stretched out almost on tiptoe in one blur of movement he slashed the animals throat and then pivoted away from the gush of blood the priest came up and put a bowl to catch it that was well done theodorus said would you teach me my father satyrus grinned although both of his shoulder joints hurt from the fight he turned to the priest and handed him a silver coin a second sacrifice is never amiss is it he winked and the young priest bowed a goat lord yes satyrus said he stepped off with the young priest whats your name he asked namastis the man said he was a couple of years older than satyrus and his beard was wispy namastis lord listen namastis satyrus said his sister was better at his sort of thing but he could hear theodoruss comments playing over and over in his head youre as good a man as any of us and the priest of a great god greek men never call each other my lord priests are famous for their disdain satyrus smiled i appreciate your lack of disdain but you should never call us lords namastis narrowed his eyes unsure if he was being mocked satyrus met his eye and held it very well namastis said ill find you a goat shall i exactly satyrus said im satyrus he said extending his hand the other man took it he tried a cautious smile his hand was limp now squeeze satyrus said egyptians never got the greek hand clasp the squeeze was cautious but satyrus smiled and nodded zeus pater satyrus must you make friends with every halfcaste in the city is your house full of stray cats theodorus asked satyrus grinned at him yes he said now do you want to learn this or not namastis came back with a goat a healthy specimen with a plain brown coat then he set to work with his knife butchering the first sacrifice will you take the meat he asked after a glance at theodorus satyrus shook his head no keep it he looked back at theodorus its all in your left hand theo the animals know what happens at the altar they can smell it right too right theodorus said shaking his head at the feast of apollo i had to sacrifice a heifer for my family i fucked it up completely my fathers still not really speaking to me a heifer is tough satyrus said in sympathy and a little more upperarm strength wouldnt kill you can you carry the weight of a shield who cares theodorus asked pater has people to do that for us satyrus raised an eyebrow but said nothing very well heres my trick i pass the lead through the ringbolt with my right hand then i take it with my left and draw my sword with my right all one move and pull and cut he pulled the goats head hard against the ringbolt but only tapped the animal with his hilt thats how my father taught me xenophon added always use your own weapon it adds dignity to the animals death and keeps your quick draw in training theodorus shook his head its like hanging out with achilles and patroclus he said he stepped up and made to take the lead from satyrus but satyrus stripped the lead out of the ringbolt he stepped away dragging the goat well clear of the altar he pulled his sword belt over his head try this see how it hangs xeno shot him a look as theodorus pulled the belt on it was clear that the rich young man had never worn a sword satyrus stepped up behind him and tugged the hilt until it was under theodoruss arm right under his armpit draw it he said satyrus still carried the short blade hed got in the gabiene campaign and theodorus drew it easily but satyrus caught his wrist tip the scabbard up so that the hilt is down and then pull see that will work no matter what size sword you carry satyrus released the other young mans wrist theodorus shook his head you take all this as seriously as my father he said if i started wearing a sword dionysius would mock me satyrus considered a number of responses while he was thinking xenophon beat him to it so only wear a sword on feast days he said practise in private satyrus looked at the two of them realizing that his friends didnt always think the same way as he did or you could just ignore dionysius he said he could tell from their reactions that while his views on drawing a sword were valuable his views on dionysius were not so theodorus drew the sword tilting the scabbard each time in a manner that satyrus found theatrical but it worked ready satyrus said handing theodorus the rein the goat immediately began scrabbling with his hind feet namastis looked up from butchering the ram theodorus dragged the goat up the steps and put the rein through the ringbolt righthanded but when he switched the rein to his left he gave the animal too much slack and the goat ripped the rein right out of the bolt and ran xenophon stopped the animal within a few feet of the altar caught the lead and brought it back to theodorus he couldnt hide his grin its all in the hand switch he said all in the sword draw all in the hand switch i need more muscle theodorus said this is like spending an afternoon with my father when he has time for me no well go to cimons when were done satyrus said and got a smile from his friend come on try again he knew instinctively that he needed to get theodorus to succeed he caught a smell of burning hair from another altar and then his spine prickled as he smelled wet cat fur close satyrus looked around feeling the presence of his god xeno ignored him and handed the other young man the rein through the ring step in like a lunge pull cut xenophon said he was about to say more something like i was six when i learned this but satyrus kept him quiet with a look theodorus was hesitant in his approach to the altar and he managed to slip on a step and lose the rein satyrus stepped on it his sandal slapping on the marble floor he smiled at theo who took the rein back he had to drag the goat up all three of the altar steps his eyes were on his friends keep your eyes on the animal all the time satyrus said start concentrating on where youll place the cut and think of your prayer i think today you should pray to give a good sacrifice namastis was watching his eyes narrow theodorus passed the hemp rope from his right to his left too fast he pulled on the rein and the goat stumbled the luck of the gods and its head came up against the bolt theodorus swept the sword out nicking his ear in the process and cut a little too hard but accurately enough blood fountained catching him across the legs and the lower folds of his chiton i did it he said he didnt seem to care that he was drenched in hot blood there was more flowing down his face from where hed overdrawn the sword satyrus was prepared to glare at xeno if he mocked him but coenuss son smiled well done theodorus he said yes well done satyrus said i cant wait to tell my father theo said thanks im going to do another namastis satyrus said i only have a small goat left namastis said there was a twinkle in his eye thatll have to do theo said with some relief satyrus gave namastis a secret smile having found that the priest had a brain his second animal a little smaller was better yet and he didnt need the hand of the god to get the kid up the steps this time he made a better job of stepping clear of the jet of blood you two are the best theodorus announced namastis is it ill mention you to my father how many animals do you pagans plan to kill abraham asked from the base of the steps namastis came up close to satyrus do you truly believe he asked do you truly pray when the stroke goes home satyrus nodded i do he said he turned aside so that the halfaegyptian priest couldnt see his friends i am a devotee of herakles i feel him at my shoulder i have seen him in dreams namastis grinned like the aegyptian hyena god you make my heart rejoice satyrus he said seriously sometimes i think that all greeks are atheists or posturing fools but you are greek yourself satyrus said the other man gave a grim smile too greasy to be all greek he said mimicking theodorus im sorry you heard that satyrus said he offered his hand to the priest who clasped it grip he said namastis gave a weak pulse of a squeeze and satyrus sighed better he said theodorus washed himself in the public fountain he managed to tell three different passersby that he had been sacrificing at the temple then he sent his slave to fetch a clean chiton and a new chlamys be sure my mother sees that it is blood he called standing naked from sacrifice he turned to the other three is it right to go straight from the temple to cimons he asked suddenly inspired by religion why would it be wrong satyrus asked poseidon does not disdain wine nor good company xenophon hung back he gave a shy smile i should go home he said satyrus knew the trouble so he said nothing but theodorus shook his head for what nap time for a youth who had been worried by impiety a moment before he was suddenly lecherous you can have a nap at cimons with a nicer set of pillows on your couch xenophon turned salmon pink under his tan cant afford it he muttered coenus had lost everything when the sauromatae and the men of pantecapaeum took the kingdom of the tanais he had survived a bad wound to rejoin his friends and now served as a phylarch in diodoruss hippeis but he was no longer a rich man theodorus shook his head on me xeno he said the least i can do really listen he said and he put an arm around the other two boys and kissed abraham on the cheek by way of apology listen will you guys teach me to fight pankration and the sword your father can afford the best pankration tutor in the city satyrus said theodorus shook his head no theron is yours besides if i ask my father hell want to watch he shook his head its hard to explain sure xenophon said ive got your back theo theodorus glowed listen if you teach me all this hero stuff ill see to it that you drink and fuck like a gentleman deal xenophon looked at satyrus who shrugged and nodded it was quite a fair deal xenophon was excellent in all the warrior skills a better spearman than satyrus and already being watched for the olympic games as a boxer deal xenophon said do i get control of your diet too melitta sat in the shade of the old towns largest acacia tree the priestess was a little younger than the tree but not much hathor does not need the worship of a greek girl she said melitta bowed silently her hands clasped i come seeking only wisdom she said the priestess nodded and glanced at philokles who sat quietly wrapped in just a chlamys egyptian women coming to pray for love or for children glanced at him the nudity of greek men never failed to amaze the natives of the oldest land one young matron probably younger than melitta tittered to her friend and stared at the spartan but she got no reaction from him instead he sighed and opened a purse reaching inside he took out a number of silver coins and offered them to the priestess of course in return for proper respect hathor will teach all who come before her the priestess said are you a virgin melitta flicked a glance at her tutor no she said good the priestess said she smiled greeks can be such prudes philokles coloured slightly when they had taken their leave philokles fetched his staff from where he had placed it against the temple wall and glared at her you are not a virgin he asked she shrugged no woman can go to hathor a virgin she said my servants told me as much so you went and lay with a slave boy you could be pregnant you will never marry philokles was biting his words swaying slightly as he walked drunk and now angry you dishonour oh philokles melitta said for the love of all the gods be quiet when have i had the chance to get a man in my bed really i lied how will that old priestess ever know do you think will she put a finger between my legs eh dont be gross philokles said his relief was obvious i am not a greek girl i am a sakje even here in the desert and i will lie with whoever i please and neither you nor my brother will gainsay me she was going to go on about what age her mother had first copulated but she held her tongue philokles was dangerous when drunk how many priests will i have to pay off so that you can explore divinity child philokles asked wasnt it you who proposed that i should explore all the religions of the delta she asked her corksoled sandals were getting to be too small everything was too small her chitons risked scandal and her legs were too long and she was so obviously a girl that it took a major conspiracy of her uncle diodorus and her uncle coenus and her brother to get her time to ride in private which was unfair she visited temples because it was a pastime allowed to women and it let her be out on the street walking in the heat and the sun and the flies today they had walked twenty stades to reach the old temple of hathor and now they would walk twenty stades back to the new city dont be cross philokles she said he walked along next to her trailing fumes of wine and garlic its boring i have a brain i have a body id give anything to be a boy and spend an afternoon at cimons drinking wine hearing the news and getting my precious dick sucked melitta philokles snapped its not fair satyrus gets everything she walked along more quickly snuffling away a tear she could hear the thump of his staff as it hit the road behind her you were given too much liberty when you were young philokles said donkey piss and to think that i tell other girls that you are the smartest man in alexandria donkey piss philokles let me go back to the sea of grass sakje doesnt even have a word for virgin but they have twenty words for smoking hemp which you have forbidden me she had the bit in her teeth philokles stared straight ahead only slaves smoke hemp it is unseemly slaves drink lots of wine too she stood and faced him in the road and a twowheeled donkey cart laden with rice from the delta side of the port bumped past her just missing her outflung elbow let me have your wineskin ill drink as much as you no more philokles shook his head we have had this discussion before and you are drawing a great many stares melitta blew out a great breath men she said to the hundreds of passersby then she turned and walked on are you calm enough for some news philokles asked some time later yes she said her good humour restored by the sight of a troop of aegyptian acrobats performing by a beerhouse your uncle leon will be back today he said kallista told me as much when i awoke she said youll have to do better than that philokles smiled that girl has sources of information she can get blood from a stone and no mistake melitta said with great satisfaction your uncle ran up the coast to the euxine to see how the ground lies philokles said we hear that heron is losing his grip on pantecapaeum and ataelus has made great strides in the east he grinned at his charge ataelus has spent years harrying the sauromatae and raiding heron if there is any resistance to herons usurpation its because ataelus keeps it alive we all owe ataelus he was silent and then he said and leon will be bringing amastris back from heraklea oh she clapped her hands together will she still be in love with my brother philokles appeared stung amastris of heraklea is in love with your brother melitta looked stricken oh she said i shouldnt have mentioned it wait that means were going back melitta said and clapped her hands together no more alexandria back to tanais philokles looked around this is not to be shouted on a public thoroughfare girl but i wont have you make a mistake that can warp your life because you dont know whats in the wind leon and diodorus and i we see a time coming when it would be worth trying melitta clapped her hands together again stepped in and kissed the spartan i knew you were the best i must have armour she pointed at her breasts my old corslet wont even cover my chest i cant imagine how hard it must be to fight with those things philokles said waving vaguely at her chest but you do it well enough philokles still gave her lessons in private as did her brother theron had reverted to the greek code that no girl needed to know pankration i wish that someone would attack us melitta said looking around a beautiful girl like me and an old man like you why dont these people see us as easy meat philokles rolled his eyes melitta continued a pity about olympias and her assassins she grinned they would have attacked us philokles shook his head she lost us in the desert and now shes dead good riddance melitta said with a shake of her head shes one we didnt need to use the oath against or perhaps i should say that artemis got her before i could olympias had so many enemies that the gods needed no tool to bring her down philokles shrugged already nostalgic for the brave old days of age twelve and a half he asked i used to do things she said in reply now i just lie around watching my breasts grow philokles relented listen honey bee when your uncle leon is home youll hear but if antigonus makes his summer campaign in macedon well hire two thousand infantry and sail for tanais melitta stepped up close to him and her eyes bored into his although he was a head taller promise me by all the gods that im going she said philokles met her gaze without flinching you are going he said she threw her arms around him in the middle of the road heads turned philokles blushed may i tell satyrus she asked best to wait leon will be home tonight philokles started to walk again i dont like all the company your brother keeps melitta was quick to spring to her brothers defence who you cant object to xenophon never in life my dear no nor abraham for all that his father is a zealot but theodoruss father would sell his mother for gain or social prestige and that dionysius philokles bit off his words melitta had a different use for dionysius who for all of his effete airs had a beautiful body that he seldom hid and a wicked sense of humour dionysius wrote a poem about my breasts melitta said philokles quickened his pace i know so does every man in the city melitta stuck her tongue out so theyre right here everyone can see them why not read a poem about them she bounced along almost skipping despite forty stades of walking what about that beautiful boy herakles just saying the name gave her a little tingle if my brother can have amastris perhaps i can have herakles honey bee banugul is the last woman on earth that you want as a motherinlaw all she wants is to make her son king of kings philokles stopped to get a pebble out of his sandal need i remind you that they are with antigonus banugul is no doubt busy scheming and yet you saved her master philokles suddenly the bouncing gait was gone and she eyed him appraisingly we saved her my dear and i did it as did you because the gods told us yes philokles raised an eyebrow i remember she said when philokles was in the mood to teach satyrus lessons he liked to say that the greeks were used to colonization and cleruchy rapid settlement and rapid building athens had dropped forts everywhere when she was queen of the seas and miletus had spread colonies the way a profligate spreads bastards greeks could move to a place build a temple or two run up some houses with the regularity of a marching camp and before the architect could say parian marble there was a new city or so the spartan said but alexandria represented cityfounding on an unprecedented scale as if someone had desired to create a new athens or a new corinth some said that it was the will of the godking alexander and others that it was the solid administration of ptolemy and the fifteen thousand talents of silver he drew from the treasury of aegypt every year philosophers and there was no shortage of them gathered in the agora or in the shade of the new library so far just a pile of materials and some gardens and debated the virtues and vices of mixing religions and races of trade of kingship but a new city lacks traditions and in their absence often creates new habits in athens or corinth men from the highest classes never drank in wine shops they worked from their homes held business meetings in their homes threw parties wild or decorous in their homes virtue and vice were practised in the confines of the home satyrus had experienced it had visited athens repeatedly until demetrios of phaleron became the defacto tyrant of athens and kineass son was one of the casualties of his regime in athens where satyrus owned a house he might give a party or he might go to a party but if he were seen to buy wine or flute girls for his own use alone he would be mocked and the thought of going to a wine shop would be enough to label him a thetes a lowclass free man and not a gentleman philokles theorized that in athens the will of the people in the assembly even under a tyrant had the effect of minimizing private display of wealth if you showed that you had too much the people would vote that you should give an expensive entertainment or maintain a trireme or something equally ruinous alexandria had a king not an assembly despite the fact that ptolemy had not yet assumed the title or the formal honours of a king the thousand richest men in the city competed to demonstrate the extent of their wealth and the beauty of their lives many competed in an old athenian way by raising monuments even by maintaining a trireme for the service of king ptolemy uncle leon was one of these he maintained a squadron his money had laid the foundation of the temple of poseidon he was always in the public service other men however used their money in different ways to keep beautiful mistresses to give lavish parties on a scale unknown in athens to dress in silks brought overland from serica a hundred thousand stades or in the finest wools from bactria dyed in the most elaborate colours from tyre and asia philokles despised all this display and often spoke against it and he said that the outcome was places like cimons because if men had clothes worth twenty talents of silver they needed a place to wear them and that the kind of man who spent twenty talents on a chiton was not the kind of man to maintain the perfection of his body in the gymnasium or the perfection of his mind in the agora philokles said that in sparta or athens two cities often presented as contrasts but satyruss spartan tutor said they had more in common with each other than either had with alexandria a man went to the gymnasium and to the agora to show that his body was ready to serve the state in war and his mind ready to serve the state in peace satyrus loved it when philokles spoke in such a fashion and he could quote the spartan at length and he often thought about his words when he walked even when he walked to cimons cimons stood among a row of hastily built private houses backing on the sea the low bluff on which they were built allowed the owners to catch the sea breeze after the rest of the city had lost it and the houses had been built in the first flush of the citys wealth back in the decade after the founding but fashions change when ptolemy began building the royal palace complex the western end of the city became unfashionable the home of warehouses and workers a few wealthy macedonians hung on but most moved if only to be close to the seat of power many of them had never finished their houses and few of them had ever been landscaped or had gardens planted so that the neighbourhood appeared ruinous as if a conquering army had swept through stealing mulberry bushes but cimons was an island of green the first owner had gardened himself importing plants from the interior of africa and from all over the sea when he died and cimon the public slave purchased his property cimon had purchased the gardeners with the land inside the former owner had arranged for expert painters to render scenes from the iliad and odyssey from alexanders conquests and from the tales of the gods in brilliant gesso work so that a bored patron might feel as if he watched the siege of troy or in some rooms the rape of helen satyrus understood the philosophical reasons why cimons was bad for him and bad for the city but he loved the place the quiet green alcoves the hardedged mirth of the pornai and the flute girls the acrobats and the broiled tuna and the art the gossip and the fights what can i get the hero of the hour asked thrassylus the former slave who acted as the steward of the house you could always gauge your status in a heartbeat with thrassylus and the oiled phrygian seemed to know every nuance of gossip from every quarter ptolemy clasped your hand and sacrificing for your uncle what splendid piety young master wine a spartan cup was put in satyruss hand other cups went to abraham xeno and theo and wine was poured from a silver pitcher while they all sat in the entrance hall two children a boy and a girl twins he could see washed his feet arent they adorable thrassylus said i bought them today the girl washed his hands she had a serious expression on her face and her tongue showed between her teeth yes satyrus said with his usual unease about slaves kline thrassylus asked referring to the long couches on which welloff greeks reclined to eat and drink i have the whole of the seaward garden open young master satyrus nodded and his party was escorted past the two main rooms where dozens of young men and a few past youth cavorted with each other and with the houses numerous offerings may we have phiale thrassylus satyrus asked phiale was a genuine hetaira a free woman who sometimes acted as an escort and sometimes as a hostess in addition to her beauty a particular squarejawed beauty that was not the typical fare among hetairai she played the kithara and sang often composing mocking songs to tease her clients phiale had consented a year before to deprive satyrus of his virginity satyrus suspected that his uncle had paid her for the service as she was very choosy about her clients and ever since she had treated him with warmth and a certain reserve as if she was a distant cousin he had joked to abraham i will see if she is at leisure thrassylus said with a bow she is with us this afternoon abraham laughed shes a little over our heads dont you think he asked xeno beamed he liked phiale and she didnt make him uncomfortable the way the pornai and the flute girls did an aspect of his friend that satyrus understood perfectly theo on the other hand pouted i want a flute girl to play my flute he said phiale drives them all away satyrus allowed a boy to take his sandals and his chlamys and he reclined arranging his chiton as well as he could he didnt love phiale she was after all a hetaira but he didnt want to let her down or perhaps he really did seek to impress her he sighed and arranged his chiton again he met abrahams raised eyebrow and laughed you greeks abraham said shes old enough to be your mother i heard that samaritan phiale said she was laughing and she slapped abraham on the shoulder and sat on the edge of his kline im no samaritan abraham began and then threw his head back and laughed you are the wonder of the city madam you even know how to tease a jew i can do more than tease a jew she said leaning over him somewhere between seduction and threat i can flirt with one abraham mimed panic and terror ahh ahh he cried clearly delighted at the attention the other young men laughed flirt with me theodorus pleaded no no youre all bad boys im with another party and i just came to visit the hero you went three falls with theron and came up in a draw that must have been beautiful to watch satyrus just the way she used his name made him feel older stronger and more handsome my party are all cursing that they missed the fight one of them a stranger asked if you were by any chance from the north from the euxine i said that i thought you were from athens dear me satyrus i find myself shockingly underinformed about you she said she put a hand on the side of his face a lovely touch personal and intimate and warm and your uncle is home tonight she asked we sacrificed for him theo said satyrus winced a little at his friends adolescent selfimportance we saw his ships from the temple and we saw him standing with the helmsman on the golden lotus it was the first time that phiale had ever asked him a direct question and her manner seemed odd i will send him a basket of flowers with a note to nihmu phiale said many wives would resent a basket of flowers from a hetaira but nihmu was different she stretched her long legs flexing the toes and then shot to her feet like an acrobat i really cant stay satyrus was bold enough to place a hand lightly on her side not possessively not holding on but not hesitant either might you come back and sing for us phiale made an actors bow i might she said if i dont find a dozen flute girls already playing your instruments and she winked at theodorus who blushed she walked off drawing every eye in the garden and was replaced by a pair of laughing wine attendants well be invisible now said the elder a darkhaired aegyptian with full breasts and a face that was nearly round nobody wants to flirt with a wine girl after phiale saunters by much less give us a tip said the younger a cypriot who was as sylphlike as a nereid how is a girl to buy her freedom she asked rhetorically sucking a fingertip wine anyone the boys laughed patted drank wine and ogled as a troop of acrobats pirouetted a pair of africans did a war dance that impressed satyrus and a single olivecoloured girl danced alone with a spear in a way that caused all the young men to consider the green arbours at the back of the garden theodorus winked at his companions i dont want to offend phiales delicate sensibility he said so im going to oil my lampwick in private xeno blushed abraham laughed was that good theo said pausing really i got it off one of my fathers slaves its not as dumb as some of the phrases i hear abraham said go and find a sausageeater theo nearly choked with laughter and hurried away a group of middleaged men came in stopped by satyruss couch and paid their compliments they were all men satyrus knew officers who served with diodorus panion a taxeis commander and a rising star let his eyes wander over satyruss body until the young man was uncomfortable come and see the drill of the foot companions panion said i hear that lord ptolemy made much of you satyrus felt the heat rising on his face panion was the leader of the macedon faction the men who felt that mere greeks and jews must be kept in their place but he had never hidden his admiration for satyrus satyrus thanked all the men politely as a younger man he rose and attended them to their own couches before returning to his own flushed with praise and the embarrassment of panions obvious advances macedonians didnt flirt that was a flutegirl saying but one with a great deal of truth to it slaves appeared and dusted his kline scraping away breadcrumbs and cheese i should go home satyrus said not until i sing for you phiale said appearing suddenly and dropping on his couch satyrus immediately brightened i thought that you were busy silly boy she touched his face again youre not really a boy are you satyrus her hand stroked down his arm her thumb following the line of his muscle and his groin stirred half and half he admitted her eyes were as big as cups her lips had minute ridges and were so rich in colour that they were almost brown her nipples were the same he could remember them vividly may i sing something of my own she asked the three young men all nodded she stood up and faced them and then sang no buildup with phiale her arms spread as she sang a simple unaccompanied song of a girl whose love had gone off to troy and who wanted to follow him or die when she was done they were quiet a minute the whole garden was quiet and then all the circles of couches began to applaud sometimes with men standing up by them you didnt sing for us a young man said he didnt sound angry just bored should i have paid more satyrus knew him everyone did gorgias was the youngest rich man with his own fortune in the city the death of his father and uncle had left him a massive amount of wealth and no adult supervision philokles used him as an example of dissolution because he ran to fat and disdained philosophy his friends were always older men who he used and was used by he had a soldier with him a bigger man with a red line all down one side of his body from his jaw to his right knee and another man that satyrus couldnt quite see though the crowd a shorter man of perhaps forty years i might have paid for more than a song said a barbarian voice with an athenian accent the big man gave phiale a wry smile i dont pinch every obol either he laughed when a man is as old as i am he prizes a song and a singer satyrus couldnt really see past phiales hips from his couch but he could see by the set of her back that she was unhappy in alexandria phiale said we dont discuss the prices a hetaira might charge if you have to discuss them you cant afford her she gave the men a hard smile but i owed my friend a song for his exploits and i always pay my debts being as you must understand a free woman and capable of choosing my clients she laughed lightly but satyrus thought that she was nervous hed never seen her like this she also clapped her hands a girls signal that she needed the house to intervene the big foreigner frowned obviously offended all prostitutes like to be called hetairai he said but the only difference is the price he said the last in a tone of contempt a man who was used to getting his way and didnt like being mocked in public by a mere woman they both look the same when their lips are around my dick he said and several men nearby laughed satyrus swung his legs over the far side of his couch and stood up in the same motion he reclaimed his sword from the peg where it hung from its cord now he could see the shorter man he had only seen him two or three times but he knew him in a glance the athenian stratokles this isnt your fight boy the big foreigner said he put a hand on satyruss chest just an uppity girl who needs watch it stratokles called his attention had been divided between xenophon and phiale and he hadnt seen satyrus past phiales hips he saw him now satyrus put one hand on the mercenarys shoulder gently as if ready to remonstrate one of therons lessons about fighting was that when your life was on the line there were no rules no manners and no requirement for announcing your intentions and satyruss adventures at the age of twelve had convinced him of the truth of the corinthians assertions so he didnt posture or shout or work himself up like a young man he reversed his hold and turned the scarred man under him rotating his arm in the socket and making him scream with pain even as he struck body running on trained responses from the palaestra satyruss mind ran on like a philosophers automaton stratokles he thought what in hades is he doing in alexandria satyruss head was flooded by the daimon of combat and he had to concentrate on the strength of the foreigner he went down clutching satyruss arm and growling and satyrus reckoned him tough enough that he paused to spend a fullweight kick to his head that took him out of the fight then satyrus drew his sword stratokles was for once in his life caught unprepared he leaped back trying to get his chlamys off his shoulder and into his hand and producing a sword from under his arm grown up quite a bit havent you he said and then i didnt recognize you you planning to kill me in cold blood he asked backing away satyrus stepped across the fallen soldier undeterred call the watch he shouted at the patrons hes a murderer in the distance thrassylus was approaching with two big slaves but he would be too late to save stratokles he started into a simple combination a feint to the head and suddenly phiale caught at his arm satyrus stop she said the athenian used the pause as his opponent was pinned by the hetaira to cut at satyruss legs satyrus with nowhere to retreat managed a clumsy parry that allowed the athenians sword to clip his shin and phiales she screamed and went down her hands on her leg clear of phiales obstruction satyrus leaped to attack the athenian their swords rang together edge to edge and sparks flew satyrus was stronger but not faster he almost lost fingers on the next exchange only a clumsy desperate parry with his cloak saved his hand sword fighting without armour was merely pankration with a blade it was something on which satyrus prided himself he growled and stepped forward stratokles changed his guard raising his sword hand slightly and satyrus pounced wrapping his cloakclad hand around the athenians sword in a carefully timed grab the athenian stepped in and grabbed his sword satyrus headbutted the other man catching him under the chin and rocking him back at the same time stratokles swung back with his blow minimizing it and punched with his cloaked hand up between them catching satyruss shoulder and knocking him back the athenian fell satyrus planted his feet on either side of the downed man and cut at stratokles head but despite the blow to his head the athenian wasnt done yet their blades rang together and satyrus grabbed his opponents sword hand at the pommel a dangerous move that theron had made him practise a thousand times he ripped the blade from the athenians hand just at stratokles landed a heavy left this time to the side of his ankle which made him stumble back stratokles gasped for air grabbing at a couch and getting to his feet then satyrus stepped in to finish him by apollo hes unarmed abraham caught at his left hand stratokles raised his hands ho young herakles he croaked and stepped back again if you cut me down unarmed even your bloody uncle cant save you the mans grin was so offensive that satyrus ripped himself free of abrahams restraint and punched the pommel of his sword into the mans forehead laying him flat in one blow choking on the tiled floor phiales cry hes the athenian ambassador stopped the descent of his back cut into the mans neck gorgias stood aside and then slowly subsided on to a kline oh zeus he said all my guests are dead lets get you out of here abraham said that was illconsidered my friend he shrugged but spectacular to watch as the soldier shook and mewled on the floor satyrus looked at phiale trying to discern if this had been what had it been an assassination attempt they happened every day in alexandria she had tried to pin his arms he tried to kill me and my sister when we were children satyrus said it sounded pretty weak with two men bleeding on the tiles hes the ambassador of athens phiale said again he brought the king a message from cassander they are allies are you insane abraham had his arm argue later he said xenophon already had their cloaks at the door fights were not uncommon at cimons but the two rich foreigners lying prostrate on the marble floor were attracting a great deal of attention satyrus looked back again at phiale who was looking at the men on the floor and who then lifted her eyes what did he see there confusion or complicity argue later abraham said again come the garden was starting to return to life noisy shouting life as they hurried down the steps lets run abraham urged what are we running from satyrus asked he was already moving at an easy lope i dont know abraham said satyrus ran in through the business gate past the sailors and into the courtyard uncle leon was by the fountain issuing unpacking orders to a phalanx of slaves and servants and retainers and some sailors who had carried his most precious cargoes up from the warehouses theron had an armful of serican silk hangings and looked as if he was afraid to move i just halfkilled the new athenian ambassador satyrus said welcome home uncle leon leon wasnt tall but he had piercing eyes of dark brown and his brown skin was perfectly tanned to an even leather colour he looked like a darkskinned god a mature apollo abraham coming in behind him bowed his head respectfully to one of the citys richest men and xeno looked sheepish i heard you were sacrificing for my return leon said he took satyrus in a hug we dont usually sacrifice ambassadors then he caught sight of the other young men is this serious he said every time i come home you have something stupendous to announce dont you its stratokles satyrus panted remember him from heraklea oh leon said fuck theron said he was still holding the silk did you kill him kill who philokles asked he pushed his way past the crowd of young men at the entrance to the garden courtyard and melitta came with him ignoring xenos sudden blushes of confusion as she rubbed against his back satyrus filed that little scene away for further consideration the new athenian ambassador to the court of ptolemy is your former nemesis stratokles leon said having taken in the whole sweep of the problem with his usual acuity why didnt anyone tell me he asked looking at his factor pasion pasion bowed it was in the mornings reports he said sheepishly i missed the importance of the fact too late to unspill the wine philokles said demetrios of athens let that cur be his ambassador put a suit against him leon said im sure we can make a deal with him hes a man of business philokles pulled his himation closer ill do it this instant exactly leon nodded go philokles despite three years of heavy drinking and endless agora debates could still move quickly when required he was out of the gate before leon was done thinking out the next step tell us what happened leon said satyrus related the incident with some hesitant description of phiales role you put two grown men down theron asked then you let them live thank the gods he did leon said he rubbed his chin and his shoulders slumped killing an ambassador would make any political career here impossible theron stood his ground being dead is worse listen satyrus the next time you have an enemy under the edge of your kopis push the blade home then hes dead and your story is the only one in the law courts leon shook his head thats evil advice to give a boy theron always leave your opponents dead melitta came and put her arms around her brother you have all the luck she said i was just wishing for assassins careful what you wish for theron said this alliance with cassander means a lot to our ptolemy leon said he tugged his short beard i think you are best out of the city lad pasion summon peleus the helmsman to keep his crew in hand one night on the waterfront and on duty by sunrise in the morning move he turned to look at theron i have a hundred pieces of news for all our friends he said ill try and get through it all at dinner one of the many ways in which satyruss uncles differed from other men was the manner in which they lived leon and diodorus were both rich men yet they had built their houses together so close together that they shared doors and gardens nihmu leons sakje wife and sappho shared womens quarters theron philokles and coenus all lived in the same houses and the establishment four times the size of most houses was run on military lines with common meals and a certain regular discipline the other thing that set them apart from other men of property was that leon philokles coenus satyrus diodorus theron and the women sappho melitta and nihmu all took dinner together with leons upper servants in a manner not unlike the spartan mess system except that the food was superb and women ate with men these communal dinners had been a feature of life in tanais before its fall and leon had transferred the system to alexandria diodorus added some of his officers eumenes was almost always with them for dinner and crax and leon added his senior helmsmen and his business friends and the tribal leaders he used to keep his caravans moving when they came philokles brought philosophers and divines from the agora and the temples and coenus added an occasional barracksmate and once the king himself who knew coenus of old dinners were sprawling affairs of twenty or thirty klines food wine and debate dinner was where they all came together especially now that leon was back dont leave the house leon said to satyrus you boys were there he said to xenophon yes sir xenophon said you had best stay then until i know more leon nodded to abraham and called to a slave run and tell ben zion that i have his son at my house for dinner as a guest and that i will send a message home with him the slave nodded ben zion son for dinner message later good leon said go pasion came back from his last errand both men are alive he said leon nodded close the gates no admittance without my express permission ask crax for hamas file as guards on the gates we arent overreacting are we theron asked i wasnt there theron ive tangled with stratokles and done deals with him and i find he has a tendency to focus very hard on success if memory serves he tried to kill both of kineass children leon raised an eyebrow he stormed a private house in heraklea yes theron bowed his head point taken he looked at satyrus see you should have killed him satyrus satyrus felt himself growing angry i we took an oath melitta said this criticism was the last straw thats not fair he said stratokles is the ambassador of athens that makes his person sacred and when exactly did stratokles get included are we killing every flunky or just the people who ordered mamas death melitta bit her lip i she began dont turn into medea satyrus said he squeezed her hand sorry satyr she knelt and touched the blood on his leg youre wounded theron raised an eyebrow hes good satyrus said you know im pretty sure that putting down two trained fighters would be cause for praise in most households leon stared off into space rubbing his short beard perhaps he said satyrus looked around chewed back an angry response and crossed his arms he stood silent and angry as leon dispatched messengers to various quarters and sat in his garden saying little and his silence was more ominous than his orders nihmu and sappho came from the womens quarters and sent everyone off to the baths before dinner by the time that satyrus feeling disoriented in his own home had towelled off he could see hama setting a pair of armoured cavalrymen at the front gate men of olbia or tanais absolutely loyal that settled him nonetheless he hung his sword over his chiton a servant came in through the curtain at his door and bowed leon asks that you dress in your best lord the man intoned i am to help you off came the sword and the chiton satyrus opened the chest under the window and poked through the folded wool there looking for his favourite a plain white wool chiton with a minute stripe of tyrian purple he found it as much by feel as by sight the wool was superb how about this he asked the servant certainly sir the servant replied this time he was oiled his hair carefully arranged and the chiton adjusted so that every fold fell as if it had been sculpted by praxiteles closed by a girdle made of gold cord satyrus added a knife that hung around his neck from a cord vanishing into the folds of the chiton the servant made a face hardly required sir he said satyrus was always annoyed by talkative servants ill be the judge of that he said and sat to have his best sandals put on his feet when he was shod he nodded thanks he said to the servant yes sir the servant replied and retreated through the door not for the first time satyrus wished he had a servant or a slave of his own a comrade someone who would understand his own needs all of leons freedmen treated him like a child caught up in all that was the thought that he had treated phiale badly he sat at a table in the courtyard and scribbled a note searching for a nice bit of poetry to use to express himself but finding none so he wrote that man is my enemy and has been for years i am sorry that you were injured in our squabble if i can be of any assistance please send to me he sealed it with his herakles ring and sent it with a slave it occurred to him as he walked down the cool marble halls towards the garden that he hadnt asked why he was dressed like a prince melitta was still lying naked on her daybed trying to will herself to calm and coolness in the evening breeze when a senior woman servant came to her chamber i am to ask you to dress your best the old woman said with a smile you have an invitation from the palace kallista also naked rose from the balcony and clapped her hands amastris it must be i heard that master leon brought her home melitta smiled thanks dorcus ill be ready dorcus turned to kallista it wouldnt be amiss to pack a wrap for morning she said laying a finger along her nose the palace messenger suggested that the lady amastris might wish to entertain our mistress overnight dorcus be a dear and tell the steward that ill be out for dinner and does uncle leon know oh its his homecoming perhaps she paused amastris is going to use me to see my brother isnt she melitta asked the older woman dorcus shook her head slightly she was a woman of consequence in the household and melitta knew that every rumour came to her ears master leon has an invitation of his own she said as does your brother from the king himself if the princess wishes to see your brother she will have to scheme very quickly indeed dress well young mistress she paused given the incident this afternoon all may not go as the princess imagines understand me despoina kallista didnt need a second admonition she had melittas best greek gown laid out on the bed wool so fine as to be transparent carefully oiled to a fine finish the colour a dark purpleblue with gold stripes there were also the artemis brooches that kinon had given her three years ago and a dagger and a wicked bronze pin in her hair the knobbed grip hidden by an enormous pearl that matched the strings that held her long black tresses kallista slipped long dangling gold earrings into her ears and clasped a necklace at her throat her hands rested on her mistresss shoulders you are beautiful she said she held up a silver mirror so that melitta could admire herself not as beautiful as you melitta said her slave was like an avatar of aphrodite in fact some men called her that very title melitta had been offered sums of up to twenty talents of silver for her slaves favours hmm kallista said she put her head down next to melittas so that the two were side by side in the mirror dark and fair you are more the image of hera or artemis a colder beauty but no less beautiful flatterer melitta said she poked kallista in the side and made the other girl squeal not with you kallista giggled every mans head will turn when we walk in the palace hah i feel like a cat among mice when i go there freedom has not made you modest melitta said kallista lowered her eyes in a parody of virginal modesty has it not my mistress how was amyntas melitta asked amyntas was one of ptolemys macedonian officers he was supposed to command the phalanx and he was a famous soldier but he spent little time on his duties he had offered kallista ten talents of silver for a single night adequate kallista said with a shrug for the money no transports of joy melitta asked i can buy all the transports i wish for ten talents of silver mistress kallista smiled you make love sound so mercenary melitta complained mistress im a hetaira the older woman shrugged men started mounting me when i was eleven theres never been a great deal of romance involved she stroked melittas shoulders it will be different for you ill see to that a boy your own age a beautiful boy melitta smiled your lips to aphrodites ear she said she rose to her feet complete from her gilded sandals to the tiny touch of rouge on the tops of her ears and the long tendril of black hair that seemed to have artlessly escaped her diadem one of kallistas best contrivances mind you dressed like this i might as well be a hetaira obligingly kallista walked to her household altar to aphrodite of cyprus like most hetairai and knelt she fingered the ivory statue and spoke quietly to it as if the statue were the goddess herself and then kissed it and put it back in its place shall we she said melitta walked to the door leon was waiting in the foyer we are expected at the palace he said even as he spoke philokles came from the garden with coenus talking about hunting at his side diodorus came in the main gate he was in armour and philokles was wearing a plain white chiton and the long himation of a scholar coenus and leon were dressed well although their clothes were more befitting merchants than leading aristocrats leon addressed them all together satyrus and i have been ordered to attend the king melitta has been invited to visit the princess of heraklea he looked around at them after todays events we cant be too careful surely you dont expect that ptolemy will do anything foolish philokles said leon raised an eyebrow i wish to ensure that he does not he said so i would like you gentlemen to accompany us philokles rubbed his jaw do i need a sword he asked if it comes to that therell be no saving us leon said diodorus nodded lets get this over with then he said id like to see sappho before the day is over hello there satyr lita you look like like a particularly seductive nymph and to think that i watched you being born coenus rolled his eyes in my day young lady you would never have been allowed out like that arent you even going to cover your hair kallista muffled a squeak of outrage melitta put a hand on her companions wrist troy has fallen uncle she said with a smile penelope is cold in her grave in the modern era young women of good family are allowed out of their houses coenus made a noise between a grunt and a laugh leon waved them all out through the garden and on to the street like a dog herding sheep goodness kallista murmured are we going to walk if leon heard her he gave no sign he strode off and eight torch holders arranged themselves around the party satyrus knew them immediately although masquerading as house slaves in simple chitons they were all soldiers troopers from eumenes squadron they walked along the streets only one such group among dozens although melitta and kallista drew attention like a new vendor in the agora satyrus watched the crowds as they walked annoyed that his best sandals might be stained by the rubbish in the street while simultaneously fascinated by the scenes around him as he always was in the city women waited at public fountains with jars for water on their heads or hips men stood in the cool evening air and grumbled heckled and bartered or discussed the new citys politics criminal factions eyed each other from opposing street corners couples mooned in dark corners or fought in tenements and a late caravan of camels from the red sea stood in a long row on the central avenue liberally decorating the clean sand of the street with droppings as they waited for slaves to unload the incense of the southern arabian kingdoms their torchbearers watched everything and their eyes went everywhere the man closest to satyrus was the giant carlus and satyrus wondered how anyone could take him for a slave his eyes were moving appraising watching he looked up at the rooftops and down in the doorways see anything carlus satyrus asked by way of conversation the big keltoi shrugged no he said lots of bad men but they dont want us he glared at a beardless aegyptian on a street corner who stood with his arms crossed over his chest he was small and light and young but he met carluss stare with cool indifference id love to come down here with some of the boys and clean up he said forced loans prostitution extortion arson these scum do it all satyrus looked at the aegyptian as he passed him the young man didnt even raise an eyebrow are you sure he asked carlus grunted leons villa was comparatively close to the new library and the palace precincts and it dawned on satyrus that leon was parading his group through the most public thoroughfares for a reason after half an hours walk they climbed the low hill that led to the palace gates still under construction as far as satyrus could see the palace was in a permanent state of construction bored macedonians greeted leon gave perfunctory salutes to diodorus and ogled melitta and kallista their comments loud enough that satyrus became offended on his sisters behalf soldiers leon said putting a hand on satyruss shoulder calm yourself slaves led them from the gate to the main hall and female slaves came and took melitta and kallista away greek women might walk the streets and even sometimes attend a party but at the palace many of the old ways were preserved and women were received in womens rooms satyrus kissed his sister on the cheek while amastriss personal attendant waited patiently her shawl over her head he had a sudden premonition as if an icy hand had rubbed his back watch yourself sister he whispered she looked back at him and squeezed his hand and you brother then the women were gone and they were walking up the steps of the central megaron ptolemys greek steward was waiting for them and he bowed lord ptolemy wishes to greet you in private he said please follow me your torchbearers can wait he snapped his fingers and a pair of slaves emerged from the portico and gestured to the torchbearers i understood that we were to have an audience leon said lord ptolemy wishes to speak to you in private the steward insisted leon looked around and then nodded very well he said he turned to follow the steward the greek shook his head just you and master satyrus he said my regrets to these gentlemen philokles snorted gabines take us to ptolemy and stop pontificating the greek steward looked more closely at philokles he gave a short and rather discontented bow master philokles i didnt see you philosophers are always welcome in our lords presence diodorus and coenus pressed closer in the gathering gloom perhaps you shouldnt have been so quick to send the torches away gabines now take us to the king diodorus said gabines looked around as if expecting help satyrus checked to make sure that he had his knife it was absurd to feel physically threatened in the palace but he was on edge walking as if he expected ambush and he noted that diodorus and coenus were the same starting at shadows philokles on the other hand pulled his chlamys back over his head and walked with the calm of a priest they walked down the back of the megaron and across the central courtyard to the royal residence reliefs of alexanders victories decorated every surface on the exterior meticulously painted so that the horses seemed to ride out from the walls and on the peristyle were ships under oars satyrus stared and stared even leons villa had nothing like this for sheer display leon wasnt looking at art but at the guards he motioned with his chin where more macedonian guards waited on the portico and yet more inside hes got half of the foot companions on duty diodorus said something is wrong leon shrugged we already knew that something was wrong he said he climbed the steps nodded at the guards and entered satyrus followed him up the steps he noticed that the colonnade was full of men and he saw the white glimmerings of the new quilted linen armour that the guards wore his shoulders prickled as he passed them and then he was in the residence directly under the fresco of herakles that filled the entryway arch up on the ceiling the gods sparkled their faces adorned with real jewels as they seemed to watch both living men and the deeds of the demigod the floor was five colours of marble inlaid in a complex pattern that baffled the eye at the centre of the arch herakles was carried by chariot into the heavens to become a god your majesty master leon of tanais his nephew prince satyrus master philokles the spartan and strategos diodorus as well as phylarch coenus of olbia to see you the steward gave a deep and very ungreek bow and as he said their names led them into the main hall a sort of roofed garden in the middle of the building up on the ceiling gods disported a burly apollo forced his favours on a not very unwilling nymph while smiling over her shoulder at athena it looked blasphemous to satyrus and very beautiful leon you brought an army to visit me ptolemy was running to fat and his high forehead and straight nose made him so ugly he was almost handsome he rose from a heavy chair of lemonwood and ivory to clasp the numidians hand it was not the tone of a king about to murder one of his richest subjects satyrus felt the blood retreat from his face and his pulse slowed we all thought it wisest to come together diodorus said meaning that you feared my reaction to this young scapegraces attack on the athenian ambassador and well you might boy what in hades or earth or the heavens above moved you to attack the athenian ambassador satyrus looked at leon and received a nod of approbation so he told the truth he has tried to murder me before and my sister i want to kill him despite this lord ptolemy i took no action against him his man attacked me and i dealt with him he bowed his head i am conscious of the religious obligations of a man towards a herald or an ambassador ptolemy smiled his wide eyes appeared guileless when he smiled giving him that look of pleased surprise that had earned him the nickname farm boy those who knew him well knew that the look was utterly deceptive in other words you are the outraged innocent and he is a viper at my breast the king asked leon stepped in front of his nephew yes lord that is exactly so ptolemy fingered his chin and sat back down in his chair seats and wine for my guests im not some fucking persian to keep them all standing for awe of me boy youve put me in a spot and no mistake i need cassander i need athens stratokles is the price i pay for it and he brought me news i need him he glared at leon you and this athenian have a history dont deny it gabines is a competent spymaster and i know things leon remained closest to the king when stools were brought is it nothing to you lord ptolemy that i have finished my summer cruise and that i too have news credit me with a little sense leon i invited you here no one has been arrested ptolemy pointed at a side table with a wine cooler on it and closed his fist at the signal a squad of slaves appeared and began to pour wine leon took a phiale from the side table and poured a libation to hermes god of merchants and wayfarers and thieves he said it was a curious gesture the host usually poured the libation satyrus thought that his uncle was telling the king something he just didnt know what it was since you are all three of them the king said with a smile leon shrugged heraklea is buzzing with rumours of war he said antigonus is planning a campaign against cassander and hes put his son in charge of an expedition somewhere no one knows where the golden boy is going he had already marched when i left the coast he looked around and his fleet is at sea and we dont know where it is going rumour is hes going to lay siege to rhodos ptolemy nodded exactly what stratokles says he cocked his head to one side cassander has asked me to send him an army dont do it lord diodorus said ptolemy glanced at the redhaired man wily odysseus why not call me what you will lord cassander has the whole of macedon to recruit if we send him our best hell buy them as well with farms at home if nothing else and well never have them back were far from the source of manpower and hes close let him raise his own levies and perhaps send us some he looked around were recruiting infantry from the aegean and asia and soon well be reduced to aegyptians ptolemy nodded i may send him some ships he said but i regret to say that i have summoned you to forbid your expedition into the euxine leon leon nodded slowly i had your promise lord he glanced at satyrus satyrus held himself still no one had told him anything directly but he had felt the expedition must be close philokles had dropped hints he wasnt sure whether he was angry or relieved ptolemy put his chin in his hand and nodded circumstances change eumeles and his kingdom are allies of cassander i cant afford to have you making trouble there just now i need to know that antigonus and his army are going to europe and not coming here then ill let you go with my blessing which will have a very tangible effect you and your nephew ruling the northern grain trade would be of the utmost value to us to aegypt and to our allies in rhodos but not this year leon gave a faint shrug very well lord im sorry leon i need better than that your oath and your nephews that you will obey me in this ptolemys voice hardened for the first time and suddenly he wasnt a genial old duffer he was absolute ruler of aegypt even if he didnt call himself pharaoh yet yet diodorus one of ptolemys most valued men nodded the closest to a sign of submission that an athenian aristocrat ever made to anyone he glanced at the guards lord you know us he said ptolemy nodded you know that we coenus me leon philokles and a few others follow the pythagorean code he spoke forcefully if quietly satyrus leaned forward because all his life he had heard from his tutor about pythagoreans and it had never occurred to him that his tutor and his mentors were all initiates ptolemy gave a halfsmile i know it we do not lightly take oaths lord in fact we avoid them as binding man too close to the gods but if you require our oath we will keep it for ever is that what you want satyrus had never heard diodorus sound so passionate yes ptolemy said get on with it leon took a deep breath very well lord i swear by hermes and by poseidon lord of horses by zeus father of the gods and all the gods to obey you in this my hand will not fall on eumeles this year though he betrayed my friendship and murdered satyruss mother though his hands are stained in innocent blood to the wrists though the furies rip at me every night until he is put in the earth enough the king cried rising from his seat enough i know that you have reason to hate him i have reason to demand your oath and you boy satyrus stepped forward i have sworn to the gods to kill every man and woman who ordered the death of my mother he said the laws of the gods protect stratokles and now you my king order me to preserve eumeles can you order me to break my oath to the gods ptolemy nodded i carry the burden of every oath i ask my subjects to carry he said obey satyrus took a deep breath by zeus the saviour and athena greyeyed goddess of wisdom i swear to wait one year in my vengeance against heron who calls himself eumeles he said by herakles my patron i swear not to take the life of stratokles for one year ptolemy raised an eyebrow at leon one year is the boy attempting to bargain with his lord satyrus made himself meet ptolemys heavy gaze lord yesterday i didnt even know that there was to be such an expedition i can wait a year if the year passes perhaps i can wait another year satyrus felt the greyeyed goddess at his shoulder guiding his words perhaps we can renew the oath like a truce philokles you have nurtured a rhetorician the king said satyrus has grown to manhood at this court philokles said he sipped his wine and the essence of the teaching of pythagoras has apparently slipped into his blood the spartan gave satyrus a smile that made satyrus feel as light as air theres more leon said you wouldnt have summoned us merely to prevent the expedition you mistake me leon ptolemy said he held out his cup for more wine or perhaps you dont yes there is more i am going to exile young satyrus for a few months to placate the athenian good gods leon said he shot to his feet and his anger rolled off him in waves you get my oath and then exile my boy ptolemy gave a grim smile got it in one send him to sea leon later i will of course allow my erring young prince to return he shrugged im sorry satyrus but i need the athenians right now and i need cassander sweet and bearing the brunt of oneeyes attack he shrugged its a hard thing ruling i suspect that stratokles the viper intends to kill your charges ptolemy shrugged and grinned if i exile you and you take your sister well he can hardly complain and hes unlikely to find a way to kill you either everyones equally unhappy ptolemy looked around i dont intend to let him kill these children but neither frankly will i imperil an alliance that i need that aegypt needs to preserve two teenagers however wonderful coenus stood up listen to me ptolemy you call yourself lord of aegypt i remember you as a page and as a battalion officer is that what you learned about loyalty and command what is this hephaestions style you know what they say about you in the army that antigonus will take us any time he wants because hes a real macedonian understands duty and honour and loyalty to his own the big man shrugged half the men in the city saw what happened today at cimons you know yourself that the boy is guiltless when you exile him its another sign you wont protect your own watch yourself old man ptolemy said diodorus stretched his legs in front of him i remember a campfire in bactria he said dreamily you owe us o king and were your friends ptolemy nodded yes he said yes i do think that you men are my friends and so i believe that i can ask this of you i call you in private and i ask for this exile so that i can preserve appearances and so you can preserve the boys life im not a fool leon i told you that i know that this stratokles will try for the boy and the girl too because cassanders stupid ally needs them dead leon raised his face and the scowl dropped from his dark features oh are you asking lord ptolemys face underwent a remarkable set of changes anger puzzlement amusement laughter ive been playing at royalty too long he said yes im asking if you decline ill find another answer ah leon said thats another thing entirely if you ask he glanced at satyrus as a favour then we will of course do it for you ptolemy nodded as for the army he said to coenus i know that they are discontented what can i do send them to fight in nubia pay them better make them feel noble coenus said they want to be heroes not bodyguards ptolemy sighed do they even remember how fucking miserable life in macedon was he asked or the campaigns in bactria zeus soter that was hades risen to fill the middle world tartarus incarnate leon rose to his feet lord it occurs to me that i can send a cargo to rhodos as early as tomorrow they are our allies and they are virtually under siege every mina of grain will count it will do us no harm to see if demetrios has laid siege to rhodos or tyre or gone elsewhere and what armament he has i must go and make my preparations he glanced at coenus is xeno ready to ship out coenus smiled now theres at least one man happy in all this ptolemy rose and clasped hands all around im glad you all came to put me in my place he growled he turned to coenus how bad are the macedonians coenus coenus drained his wine and handed the cup to a slave do i look like an informer ptolemy eh satyrus thought that the gentlemantrooper had to be one of just a handful of men who called lord ptolemy by name all the time then the megarans face changed softened and he shook his head no but listen they dont hate you some still love you but the word in the ranks is that any contest with antigonus is a foregone conclusion ive heard men in the foot companions say that the phalangites wont fight theyll just stand ten yards apart and watch coenus shook his head again of the officers theres rot there but you know it as well as i ptolemy drained a cup of wine gabines the steward hurried forward from behind the throne it is much as he says lord gabines looked apologetic i could bring you wit nesses i have all the witnesses i need standing in front of me leon listen to me you and a dozen like you are the pillars that support this city understand me and tell your friends the nabataeans and the jews and all the other merchants we cannot afford to fight i know my army has rot all the way to the officer cadre i know it and that means that i have to rely on guile to keep cassander and antigonus off me philokles raised an eyebrow he raised a hand to speak opened his mouth and fell silent his lips moving like a fish it was rare for philokles to behave so but such was his power at court that the king waited and on the second attempt philokles managed to speak it seems to me that it is time to try an alternate source of manpower philokles said ptolemy nodded what do you suggest spartans philokles frowned aegyptians a citizen levy like the hoplites of any greek city ptolemy scratched under his chin eyes on his guards some of whom couldnt stop themselves from mutters as the idea was broached they make awful soldiers he said they once conquered the world or so i understand philokles said besides i rather intended to suggest the citizens of this city greeks and hellenes and nabataeans and jews and native aegyptians and the whole polyglot crew you have been generous in granting citizenship now is the time to see if these people are citizens in fact or only in name by the gods philokles listening to you is like having an ephor of my very own who will command this mongrel mob ptolemy asked silence fell over the room ptolemys eyes met satyruss and the young man couldnt look away it was odd to have the eye of the ruler and want to be out from under it why is he looking at me the macedonian army has a nice tradition ptolemy said the author of a great idea is considered to have volunteered to lead why dont you raise this city levy spartan i know you are the hoplomachos of all spearfighters in the city you can train them to be spartans philokles got red in the face you mock me he said careful there spartan you pythagoreans are supposed to avoid anger ptolemy grinned but i do not mock you its a fine idea and i can afford it money we have find me a taxeis of locals and ill arm them if nothing else it offers me he hesitated and then smiled options lord ptolemy didnt describe what his options might be philokles nodded and pursed his lips satyrus knew him so well that he could feel the oncoming rebuke the skin over the spartans nostrils grew white and the philosophers grip on the staff he usually carried grew whiteknuckled and then his face softened and he gave a faint smile very well philokles said i accept good gentlemen for all that you are the very foundation of my rule in aegypt it is late and i have had too much wine ptolemy rose leon and satyrus bowed gracefully diodorus philokles and coenus nodded and clasped ptolemys hands like the old friends they were whatever his power my chair is always filled for any of you even the boy listen boy i saw you fight theron today i liked what i saw go away for a while and ill have you back in style heres my hand on it satyrus took the kings hand then ptolemy smiled around at all of them like a conspirator and vanished into a screen of soldiers and they withdrew it seems to me that for all your complaints you got exactly what you wanted philokles said quietly to leon youre the dangerous one leon said a taxeis of locals suddenly youre going to have political power and enemies welcome to my world i expect i will philokles said should that deter me from an action that will help to balance the disaffection of the macedonians and will render all of us safer stratokles is here leon in this city we need to gather our friends outside in the darkness they all gulped lungfuls of smoky alexandrian air satyrus was old enough to realize that they had all been as scared as he where will we go satyrus asked rhodos really we leon asked you will take the cargo as my navarch youll have excellent officers who you will listen to as if they were your uncles you can sell a cargo and buy one i hope satyruss heart swelled to fill his chest ill be navarch myself he asked diodorus slapped him on the shoulder you keep telling us youre a man he said a slave approached from the shadow of the megaron guiding a woman with a shawl over her head lord satyrus she called quietly before his uncles could restrain him satyrus responded here the young woman took his hand your sister intends to stay the night she said in a whisper and requests that you visit her for a moment before you go leon shook his head im afraid that i cannot allow my niece to spend the night in the palace he said she has urgent duties to which she must attend the young womans face was white as tawed leather under the shawl oh oh dear she said then you must come with me lords she led the way to the womens quarters where are my torchbearers leon asked the palace slave i dont know lord ill find them and meet you on the portico of the womens wing the slave turned and ran the womens palace was well lit and sounds of laughter and music carried out into the night a kithara was being played two kitharas and melitta was singing with kallista satyrus grinned this wasnt supposed to happen this way said the young woman at his side she caught at his hand come with me she said her hand was remarkably smooth and soft for a slave he looked at her and in the increased light of the portico he realized that she was amastris the princess of heraklea his nereid he had seen her dozens of times at court they had shared long glances but he hadnt touched her hand since well since he was a supplicant at her uncles court amastris he said shh she said my beautiful plan is in ruins i wanted to see you she smiled her lips red in the torchlight she glanced past him where leon was sending a slave in to fetch melitta i thought that your sister would stay for a few days ive been on a ship for three weeks and trapped in my fathers politics for the summer you wanted to see me satyrus breathed he leaned a little closer theres a rumour in the womens quarters that you are to be exiled amastris was standing very close to him in the darkness of the columns oh i feel like a fool satyrus knew with his usual sense of doom that in three days or so hed think of the words he should have said i have to go in amastris said im sorry that satyrus felt his breath catch and cursed his cowardice his knees were weak his elbows felt weak but he reached out anyway and caught her to him amazed that years of training in pankration should have prepared him so badly for this vital grasp he missed her shoulders in the dark and his right hand brushed her waist she turned towards him just the way an opponent would turn to get inside the reach of his long arms he felt her hands on his upper arms the press of her breasts against his chest his own breath rasped in and out and his heart pummelled the inside of his ribcage like a dangerous opponent trying to fight its way out as he lowered his mouth on hers her hands locked behind his neck like a triumphant wrestler her mouth her lips soft as lotus flowers and yet tough and pliant his lips on her teeth and their tentative opening like the gates of a garden and the ecstasy of the softness of her tongue the dispassionate part of his mind noted that his composure was far more affected than it had been while fighting stratokles his heart was going like a galloping horse then he stopped thinking and lost himself in her satyrus leon said in a voice of command find him amastris was out of his embrace before his heart could beat again her fingers brushing down his arm as she fled and then she was gone into the dark here sir satyrus called emerging from the darkness of the colonnade kissing a slave girl carlus growled approvingly i saw her the torchbearers were coming up out of the darkness satyrus leon said we have enough troubles without you assaulting palace slave girls by all the gods keep that thing under your chiton diodorus laughed melitta came to the door and embraced another girl satyrus strained to see if it was amastris and came outside uncle i was to spend the night she said in a tone that came close to a whine come my dear philokles said putting an arm around her were sorry oh hades and persephone its true then satyrus is to be exiled melitta looked around for him and then drew him into a hug she whirled on leon who was arranging the torchbearers im going with him yes you are leon said that left melitta speechless while she stood staring kallista emerged from the womens quarters and threw her chlamys over her head the torchbearers closed around them and they walked for the main gate gabines ptolemys steward met them on the way sometimes a man has to take sides gabines said without preamble you are all in danger now tonight men i will not say who informed stratokles as soon as you were summoned understand and theres a faction you know them as well as i of macedonians here who would love to see you all dead he looked around i think you are all the kings friends ive doubled the kings guard and im sending three groups out of the gates to confuse them now go philokles stepped out of the group and took gabines by the arm they spoke in private rapidly the way commanders speak on a battlefield then both of them nodded sharply in obvious agreement even in the torchlight and gabines hurried away the guard was being changed and they took several minutes to get clear of the construction platforms and the smell of masonry minutes that coenus diodorus and leon spent in whispered consultation with philokles who then took a weapon from one of the torchbearers and walked off into the night and another pair of torchbearers doused their lights and ran off into the night with instructions from diodorus the gate guards watched this with some alarm and satyrus noted that one of them also left the guard post at a run diodorus barked an order and they were out on the darkened streets they were well out on the posideion when philokles reappeared at a run his chlamys wrapped around him he made a gesture and carlus raised his torch and swung it through a broad arc we are being followed philokles said breathing hard there was a line of blood on his hip be ready he looked at satyrus and shook his head im old and fat boy melitta didnt turn her head carlus she said to the man behind her im unarmed the big barbarian scarcely a barbarian after fifteen years speaking greek but his size still stood out reached under his armpit and produced a blade as long as a mans foot the blade sparkled in the torchlight one of my favourites he said melitta took the blade and slipped it under her cloak they turned suddenly off the posideion into an alley that ran behind the great houses and temples and the whole group moved faster and then diodorus had satyrus by the shoulder and turned him south away from their route carlus had melitta right behind them and the rest of the torchbearers continued on as if nothing had happened the twins were swept along by the big keltoi and diodorus down the narrow gap between two courtyard walls and into a back gate satyrus had a dim recollection of having visited this house by daylight buying spices with leon and he saw an arab man standing in the courtyard wearing a white wool robe thanks pica diodorus said i see nothing friend the nabataean replied he laughed then they went out of the front gate and found themselves down by the docks they were almost opposite leons private wharf now we need some luck diodorus said they ran from warehouse to warehouse along the waterfront this is living melitta crowed satyrus saw men moving just one alley to the north and a shrill whistle sounded hermes diodorus said hes hired every cutthroat in the city uhh carlus grunted i could go and thin the herd do it were going for the lotus leon says there ought to be six boatkeepers aboard uhh carlus said i find my own way and then he was gone they dashed across the open road to the gate of leons wharf open up diodorus called nothing running feet behind them and a whistle like the cry of a falcon open up in leons name diodorus cried he had his sword in his hand a wicked kopis with a long heavy blade he banged the backbone of the weapon on the gate and started to look up along the wall searching for a place to climb satyrus was several seconds ahead of him up and over the wall and then drawing his own weapon the rush of feet grew louder bare feet mostly and then there was a sound like an axe hitting soft wood or like an oar slapping water in the hands of an inexperienced oarsman and another the same and then a third and this time the sound was accompanied by a shrill scream that cut across the night like fabric being ripped asunder satyrus got the gate open and looked out past diodorus as the man pushed in carlus no one else was that big was killing men silently the victims were not so silent but there were more whistles after the scream sorry lord said a voice at his elbow the house porter it sounds like murder get the gate shut help me melitta and satyrus helped the porter shove the gate and it made a clang as it latched they were in leons precinct is there a boat party on the lotus diodorus asked no that is yes lord the man got the beam back across the gate alarm lord diodorus nodded better have it he said the man at the gate was short broad and had the slightly stooped look of the professional oarsman he picked up a billet of wood and started to hit an iron bell alarm he called diodorus took the twins by the shoulders melitta was still facing the gate unwilling to be dragged towards the ship what about kallista or carlus by athena diodorus they are in a great deal less danger for not being with you my dear well not carlus i think he has sacrificed himself be brave girl this is the real thing diodorus paused to tighten his sandals stupid things never wear anything you cant fight in i dont want to run she said then youll die diodorus had no more patience listen to me girl in a minute a dozen paid thugs are going to come over that wall on ropes theyll kill everyone here were getting on a boat and getting out understand the moment to stand and fight will come another day melitta was silent what about the men who are here she asked diodorus started to run figure it out he called as he dragged her towards the looming bulk of the golden lotus satyrus followed them sword naked in his hand he hailed the deck from the pier and the watch was awake what news called an athenian voice leon told me to ask for diokles diodorus said here mate what do you need diokles was apparently the man coming down the plank we need the boat under the stern and two men to row us around to lord leons right now and therell be armed men coming over the wall any moment diodorus punctuated his speech with glances over his shoulder diokles didnt hesitate he grabbed a rope and pulled and in moments they were in a light boat lovingly painted in red and blue a display piece that nonetheless had serviceable oars he pushed four men into the boat kleitos row them round to leons im going to cut the hawsers and pole off robbers wont swim to get to the lotus and if they do the mans teeth shown white in the dark ill just gaff em like fish save the slaves diodorus said sure diokles laughed they brought the wine and then they were rowing four pairs of arms pulling hard so that the low boat shot across the harbour listen as they would they heard no sounds of fighting behind them diokles shouted and the slaves and workers on the night shift ran aboard the lotus as if drilled to it and then nothing the row home was uneventful and then they were going up the watersteps to the back of leons villa and into the dining hall where nihmu and sappho and many of the households older servants were already dining satyrus seated himself on a couch and untied his sandals his feet were filthy her mouth had tasted of youth very different from phiales cinnamon and clove despite the nearness of death or because of it amastris was at the surface of his thoughts she found you didnt she melitta asked lying carefully on the couch they shared she was careful of the covering because her beautiful chiton had a long smear of something that looked to be tar and another even worse i can smell her scent even now and you look as if youve been struck by lightning or aphrodite kallista came up beside him and made a show of picking up his sandals even as she did so she dropped an oyster shell in his lap a scrap of papyrus curled out of the corner of the shell and satyrus rolled on to the couch while scooping it up thanks lista he said you made it back always happy to help the goddess kallista said primly and then flashed him a smile weve been back half an hour and then soberly master philokles killed a man i saw it and master coenus killed another leon was outlining the terms of satyruss exile to his wife satyrus glanced down at the papyrus all it said was stay safe and return satyrus was grinning like a fool nihmu met his eyes and smiled you look very happy for a boy who has just been attacked on the streets and exiled she said satyrus attempted to modify his expression youll have to send her a response melitta said she poked him in the soft flesh over his hip so that he writhed in ticklish agony kallista can carry it while we pack no i cant kallista said perhaps tomorrow master leon says no slave is to leave the compound for any reason until further orders what can i tell her anyway satyrus asked in a breath he began to see the complications of kissing ptolemys ward the daughter of the euxines most powerful tyrant men had tried to kill him in the city hed come to think of as his own he felt disoriented as if the world had slipped off its axis tell her you love her melitta said and poked him again im to go as a marine xeno called from an adjoining couch who cares if youre exiled youll be a navarch well fight pirates im going too melitta said xenos smile was rapturous well protect you despoina he said then his face fell as he realized how badly this comment had gone down satyrus rolled over and saw his sisters anger i dont want to be protected you overgrown boy melitta spat if you had as many brains as you have pimples youd understand crushed xeno rolled on his couch and faced the other way the flush on his face spreading right across his back by artemis goddess of virgins may i kill a pirate before that snotfaced boy melitta proclaimed nihmu leaned over towards the younger people you wish to go as an archer perhaps my husband could set a new fashion she smiled her enigmatic smile as a girl nihmu had been an oracle among the scythians on the sea of grass her oracular powers had left her a serious young woman with a head for figures and she had married leon after his second expedition to the east amazon crews eh she asked nihmu as the only other sakje woman was melittas special friend a bridge between the world of alexandria and the sea of grass melitta laughed why cant i she asked once at sea who would know the other archers leon called from his couch take this seriously friends we are at war as of now melitta stood up and raised her wine cup we were always at war uncle leon we just forgot sappho shook her head as if denying this assertion but philokles coming in with his whole midriff wrapped in linen nodded shes right he said life is war spare us the heraklitus sappho said where are we going uncle satyrus asked to have kissed amastris and be going as a navarch all in one day seemed unbearable joy despite everything and thoughts of revenge on his mothers murderers slipped farther away we arent going anywhere lad leon said you will take golden lotus up to rhodos and drop a cargo of grain they need desperately then if the helmsman agrees you will go north around lesvos to methymna and across to smyrna drop some hides and some odds and ends and pick up a cargo of dye and then home on the wind three weeks if you are quick a month at the outside by then i predict that the king will be your friend again melitta was consuming broiled squid at a rate that made satyrus dizzy we have to pack she said what if he is not our friend then satyrus asked what if the king learns that ive kissed his ward diodorus finished drinking a bowl of soup he rubbed a hairy forearm across his mouth and sappho made a gesture of resignation then well have hyacinth meet you in the outer harbour and you can take her to cyrene he laughed and reached across his wife for wine she scowled he looked around listen friends weve grown soft now we go back to being hard we here have a month to do stratokles all the harm we can we need to destroy him and his power base in this city that goes for every servant every slave if you see one of the athenians slaves getting water beat him or her understand the servants in the hall nodded some looked eager and others looked scared you make mighty free with my people and my triremes brother leon said to diodorus but then he shrugged that is of course what well do keep the twins moving until the problem is solved and fight stratokles in the shadows he shrugged apologetically to his wife it will be hard here and the macedonian party wont just stand by satyrus ate some bread and fish sauce but philokles will come with us he said and then he understood wont he he added sounding weak even to himself philokles shook his head time for you to fly on your own lad he said theron satyrus asked theron lying with philokles raised his head and shook it philokles and i are apparently raising an army to defend you my prince he said satyrus recalled that earlier that day he had dreamed of commanding the golden lotus lamplight and melitta standing by his bed carlus came in she said alive but wounded philokles is with him satyrus rolled to his feet with the ease of practice and followed his sister down the dark corridor and out across the courtyard between the two houses he could sleepwalk the route to philokles rooms carlus took up the whole of philokles oversized sleeping couch and still his lower legs dangled off the end i must have sent a dozen of them to hell he said in his thick accent and they broke but there were more and more fifty the big keltoi shook his head weakly zeus soter i was afraid and then they left me gone like a herd of deer running in the woods they werent paid enough to go chest to chest with you titan philokles said if it makes you feel better i think well be going into those neighbourhoods you wanted to clean soon uhh the keltoi grunted and fell asleep will he live satyrus asked look at the muscle on that chest philokles said shaking his head yes none of these dagger blows got through his muscle those were brave and desperate men satyrus contempt for your opponents is always a waste of time imagine facing carlus in the dark two men got close enough to mark him imagine hes passed out melitta said poppy hes so full of it he should bleed poppy juice philokles said so we all made it home that makes me feel better there was a moment in the dark when i thought we were all going down ares im not as young as i used to be i wish you were coming with us melitta said me too satyrus said he found that he was holding his sisters hand philokles got up wincing and favouring his left side listen he said putting a hand on each of their shoulders pythagoras teaches that there are four seasons to life as there are four seasons to the world spring when you are a child and summer in the full bloom of adulthood then autumn when a man reaches his full power and a womans beauty fades and winter when we age towards death yes yes the twins chorused i pronounce that you have passed from spring into summer philokles said melitta you are a woman and satyrus you are a man what is the first lesson together the twins spoke almost one voice to your friends do good and to your enemies harm that is the lesson philokles said see that you live it it was still dark when they were rowed aboard the golden lotus which had been brought around from the yard and stood just off the beach her oarsmen keeping her steady against the predawn breeze melitta went up the side and then satyrus swung his leg over and dropped to the deck amidships peleus the rhodian leons helmsman stood with his legs apart braced against the roll of the deck welcome aboard navarch he said he put special emphasis on the word but it wasnt mockery quite peleus satyrus said he clasped the older mans arm and his clasp was returned he stepped back this is my sister melitta despoina peleus said and turned his back on her grasping satyrus by the arm lets get the lotus clear of the land and then well have time for girls and orders and all the crap that the land brings eh first time out in command feel any butterflies boy yes satyrus admitted he looked at melitta who had the look of a woman withholding judgment peleuss comment hadnt escaped her he had to make peleus whose dislike of women at sea was legendary accept his sisters presence he had to make his sister well toe the line banish the butterflies peleus said oars there do ye hear me a chorus of affirmatives and the rhodian turned to satyrus ready for sea sir he said satyrus had been to sea since he was nine years old but his heart was beating as if he was in mortal combat he took a breath and made his voice steady carry on he said as if it was nothing to command a warship at sea like wings the oars rose together and dipped and suddenly they were in motion as close to flying as satyrus was ever likely to achieve two stades away across the port of alexandria a scarred man leaned on the rail of a trireme head swathed in bandages watching under his hands as the familiar shape of the golden lotus gathered way as the first fingers of dawn stretched across the sky there they are said iphicrates kineass brats he growled the latin lucius shrugged frankly boss i think the gods love em i think we should just let em go and good riddance i couldnt agree more stratokles said despite which i want you to find them at sea and kill them it is probably better this way he said after a moments hesitation last night was too bloody and too obvious and sooner or later that fat parasite gabines will know we did it fucking public service lucius said the sheer number of street thugs who died last night has got to make this city a better place to live he laughed iphicrates shook his head we should have had them last night and diodorus and fucking leon into the bargain they were on to us from the start of the evening gentlemen stratokles said i dont like losing a contest any more than the next man but it is a pleasure to be up against men of worth youll have to be on your toes iphicrates golden lotus is the toughest ship in these waters or so im told the scarred athenian mercenary stretched and shook his head ive been fighting at sea since i was twelve stratokles and ive taken a few rhodians in my time and they are never easy but if i have a clean chance ill take em the new engines will give me an edge they cant be ready for engines lucius asked he had quite a bit of intellect but most of it was reserved for war like big bows with ratchets to hold em cocked shoot a bolt the size of a sarissa goes right through a triremes hull despite which stratokles added your first duty to me is information i need to know what oneeye is up to on the coast of syria and cyprus and what rhodos is doing golden lotus is bound for rhodos need i say more no sir iphicrates said go get them then stratokles said and slapped the mercenary on the back ill take care of business here ive fomented a fair amount of treason he said macedonians are the most perfidious race on the face of gaia and they call greeks treacherous he laughed then he turned back to iphicrates and put a hand on his arm dont loiter out there i know you have piracy in your blood but i need your reports and i need to know i have a way out of here when gabines starts to follow up on the tags ive left i cant help it hes going to be after me like a pig on slops and leon will strike back after last night count on it hurry out take the lotus check rhodos and syria hurry back anything else iphicrates shook his head tall order and no mistake thats why im sending the best stratokles said t wo hundred miles northnortheast of alexandria and the helmsman peleus had made a perfect landfall at salamis of cyprus the islands beaches just a heat shimmer while the headland temple to aphrodite lophos shone in the sun peleus you are the very prince of navigators satyrus said he had the steering oar under his arm peleus was not looking ahead at all but watching the wake the golden lotus was a triemiolia a threeandahalfer that carried an extra half bank of oars and a permanent sail deck and the crew to manage her sails even in a fight pirates loved the smaller version the hemiolia and so did the rhodians the best sailors in the world golden lotus was rhodianbuilt and peleus was rhodianborn a seaman from the age of six his current age was unknown but his beard was white and every sailor in alexandria treated him with respect when you talk theres a notch in the wake the helmsman said with the grim determination of youth satyrus gripped the steering oar never had a boy your age train to be a helmsman peleus said but he had half a smile when he said it and the curl of his lips suggested that maybe just maybe satyrus was the exception if i tell you to steer north by east whats the first headland youll see satyrus looked back at the wake open sea until we see mount olympus of cyprus rising on the port oar bank he said peleus nodded maybe he said its the right answer but whats wrong with the order satyrus hated questions like this he stared out at the blinding white of the distant temple i dont know he said after a gutwrenching interval thats a fairenough answer and no mistake peleus answered its true boy you dont know and you cant heres the answer were too far in with the land to keep the sea breeze so our lads would have to row every inch of the way he was watching the land i aim to make for thronoi for the night the beach there is soft white sand and the villagers will bring us food for a little cash i used to have a boy there he gave a smile that creased the long scar down his face what happened satyrus asked he was in love and so wanted to hear about the loves of others he grew up and got married to some girl peleus said gruffly mind your helm boy theres a notch in the wake he looked behind him across the water and almost straight into the sun we have companions satyrus looked back until he saw the dark smudges right on the edge of the horizon and almost invisible in the sun dazzle i see them he said peleus grunted thronoi stood well back from the sea no unwalled village could afford to be too close to the water and the first men to approach carried spears and javelins but they knew golden lotus and they knew peleus and before the sun became a red ball in the west the crew was cooking goats and lobsters on the beach drinking local wine and discussing their chances with the navarchs beautiful sister who excited comment even wrapped from head to toe in a chlamys big enough for philokles she had pleaded to be allowed to ship as an archer but peleus had put his foot down and she was merely a greek lady of means with her maid the oarsmen couldnt see her as anything but a beautiful mascot they competed for her glance and peleus had told satyrus that hed never seen such powerful rowing in all his days at sea every ship needs a beautiful woman peleus allowed standing at satyruss elbow like every other man on the beach he was watching melitta she was standing apart watching some archers shoot at a mark satyrus knew she had her bow in her baggage and he also knew she could outshoot most of these men her posture was defiant her maid stood behind her muttering dorcus was the middleaged freewoman leon had sent in place of kallista whose seasickness was as legendary as her beauty dorcuss beauty lay in her practical application of the back of her hand that friend of yours is going to break his face staring at her peleus said pointing at xeno coenuss son was stripping off his cuirass but his eyes were on melitta satyrus shook his head what do i do he asked peleus pursed his lips shes artemiss avatar boy peleus said with a pious glance towards the temple of artemiss heavenly rival aphrodite nothing you can do but hope that she doesnt tear anyone apart they slept in watches they did everything in watches because all the major states hired pirates to pad out their navies and piracy was the biggest business in the aegean that summer satyrus slept alone because he was the navarch technically in command with a tent of his own melitta slept on the other side of the tent with dorcus he awoke with the sun noted that his sister was absent from her bed cursed the stiffness in his shoulders from sleeping on sand and threw himself into the ocean as the sun rose and swam down the beach and back from the water he couldnt see the sentries but he could see his sister swimming on the other side of the headland i thought i saw the flash of oars she called out to him naked he climbed out of the water and climbed the cool rocks of the headland to the sentry post both of the sentries were sound asleep it was understandable as theyd had three days at sea and too much rowing but it was unforgivable too dawn was the time that pirates attacked satyrus looked off into the rising sun with his hand up to shade his eyes while he was still considering how to waken the two offenders he saw the flash of low sun on oar blades to the north beyond the headland at korkish twenty stades at the most his heart rate surged alarm he called melitta took up the cry and ran down the line of sleeping oarsmen ignoring her own nudity to kick each man and shrill the alarm as she ran alarm peleus was out of his sheepskins and bounding up the rocks like a much younger man satyrus watched the distant flash of oars afraid that he had it wrong and equally afraid that he was correct the beach was full of movement this was a veteran and wellpaid crew the oars were already going back aboard the marines were forming on the beach led by their captain karpos he watched melitta run by with an appreciative glance while checking his mens readiness xeno stood in the front rank his aspis on his shoulder and a pair of heavy javelins in his hand behind the marines the archers formed there were only half a dozen of them with scythian bows and quivers that held two dozen arrows and some surprises as well peleus kicked one of the halfasleep sentries in the crotch fear the evening agathon he spat at the other one ill have the hide off you you whores cuntwashing he looked under his hand and turned back dead right boy coming out of the eye of the wind at dawn no honest sailorman would do such a thing he looked at the beach fight or run satyrus wasnt sure his opinion was even being asked but curiosity got the better of him surely we could just wait for them on the beach the men of the town would stand with us peleus nodded yes but wed lose the lotus if we were lucky theyd just beak her and leave her to sink more likely theyd board her over the bow and row her away hard to hold a boat on a beach not impossible he shrugged thanks to you weve got the jump on em i think we should run run satyrus asked cant we take them peleus curled the corners of his lips down listen navarch this is your call your uncle put you in charge of the lotus and that makes it your decision but were merchants we have a full cargo and your sister too and fighting pirates is soldiers work the old helmsman pointed at the beach how many of them are you ready to lose so that you can have a hack at some pirates and what happens to your sister if we lose the man frowned or you for that matter point taken helmsman well run was it cowardice that satyrus felt better already good lad you may yet make a sailor peleus sprang off the rocks like a man in his prime and started bellowing at the oarsmen xenophon already had his armour on and melitta had her gorytos out of her deck baggage and an aegyptian corslet of white quilted linen and a small pylos helmet on her hair pirates she asked her eyes gleaming put that away satyrus said xenophons grin was just the same let her fight he said from the ranks shes a better shot than timoleon were running satyrus said were what melitta asked are you joking she went from elated to angry in a heartbeat running satyrus shrugged were merchants lita were running he hated the looks on his sisters face and on xenophons this is amastriss noble warrior melitta asked him how will you tell this story to her eh brother lita mind your manners satyrus turned away because peleus was calling to him melitta wouldnt let up she followed him down the beach peleus told you that you couldnt risk me right fuck that brother lets get em think about the ones theyve sold into slavery think about whoever they catch tomorrow all on our heads she glared at him youre afraid ill be raped fuck that youre as pretty as i am no satyrus said a little too loudly are you afraid brother she shot back and she said it so loud that every man left on the beach could hear her fuck off sister were running satyrus was up the plank in three long strides peleus pulled melitta up behind him and then kept her hand pinned in his if you were a man id beat your fucking head against the steering post he said his face was red dare to question the officers he asked with murderous quiet angry men did not intimidate melitta only when they make bad decisions peleus those are pirates we should kill them you may yet get your wish peleus said if you want to impress me youre going about it the wrong way girl now get to your station not with the archers missy she went sullenly to the amidships awning with dorcus glaring at every man in sight you should discipline her peleus said you first satyrus said and drew a quick halfsmile and then the halfdeckers and the sailing crew were pushing on the stern and the lotus hissed down the last of the shingle and her stern bumped the beach again causing a little restrained chaos among the rowers for two strokes and then they were clear of the beach and lotuss bow was cutting the breakers the bowram showing copperred on the rise in the red morning sun left one of the cauldrons the sailing master said pointing at the beach well get it next time if we live poseidon stand with us peleus said and he tipped a phiale of red wine into the sea the pirates came around the last point two black ships crammed with men both were the size of the golden lotus one a trireme of the old athenian pattern and the other a heavy phoenician and as soon as they saw their prey afloat they sprang forward their oar masters calling for the fighting stroke and getting it with a speed that showed that these crews knew their business nope peleus said looking astern we dont want a piece of that boy steady on that tiller were heavier with our cargo and theyve got weed and those hulls havent seen a drying shed in years thisll be close should you be at the tiller helmsman satyrus asked peleus shook his head with his halfsmile no you can handle it the old man rubbed his beard for several breaths and then pointed aloft get me the boatsail you bastards he called and the deck crew sprang to their stations they already had the sail spread on the deck satyrus couldnt help but notice that agathon had led the men in putting the sail out trying to make up for his lapse satyrus felt the change under his hand before they had the whole sail aloft lotuss stern rose as the boatsail pressed her rambow deeper in the waves but she also sprang forward steering became easier as speed increased a big ship like lotus went straight very easily at speed theyd cleared the beach with just the lower bank manned but now peleus ordered all the banks manned and they pulled easily supporting the sailing speed and adding to it then the helmsman came back to the stern and stood with his thumb covering the enemy just even he said just want to tell you navarch if we dump the hides well run away from them in an hour satyrus shook his head would you peleus scratched his beard probably not not yet anyway fair enough satyrus said no well there was a crash from aft and a spear the size of a boatsail mast shot by the stern satyrus ducked he couldnt help himself shit peleus said one of those newfangled engines where the fuck do a pair of cypriot bumboys get an ares engine they lost ground because the rowers were as confused as satyrus the black ships gained steadily and then the engine fired again this time satyrus had the time to see the whole flight of the lance it vanished in the waves well to starboard of the stern now id dump the hides peleus said if he gets a bargepole into our rowers were dead he was watching the sea good time for a chance rhodian patrol he said under his breath usually a ship out this way or off the beach round the point it was my station once satyrus felt curiously light he shook his head poseidon stand with us he said we can do it akrotirion promontory was close just a dozen stades away on the starboard bow and satyrus knew that the moment they weathered the point theyd have deep water in the bay and a wind change one of the engines fired with a wooden crash that was audible over the water and the lance flew true straight on for the lotus but aimed too high so that the whole shaft passed down the main deck missed the mast and vanished ahead of them get me timoleon peleus called in seconds the archercaptain was standing with them peleus waved astern can you hit the men on the engine timoleon shook his head only if apollo draws my bow he said but without any further complaints he took a shaft from his belt and drew it until the bronze head was on his fingers before he loosed satyrus lost the flight in the rising sun but peleus shook his head well short the engine in the bow of the phoenician fired but the bolt went short fired at the wrong moment as the bow swung with the waves they were coming in with the shore at a rapid pace as both sides tried to weather the point as close as possible put the starboard oars right in the surf boy peleus said theres more water there than you think shave it close to the archer he said try again this time timoleon waited for the height of the rise of the waves under the stern and he drew so far that the head almost dropped off his thumb before he loosed again satyrus couldnt follow the flight of the arrow better peleus said shoot these melitta said she ignored peleuss look of anger sakje flight arrows cane shafts allow for the wind they dont weigh anything and theyll blow around timoleon picked one up a handbreadth longer than his longest arrow made of swamp cane with iron needle points nasty he said he grinned at melitta thanks despoina melitta smiled at him poison she said timoleons hand froze in the process of reaching for the point fucking scythians he said respectfully and drew the shaft across his thumb he pulled the shaft to the head and loosed at the top of the roll even satyrus saw the eddy of disturbance in the bow of the pirate good shot he shouted timoleon beamed apollo held my hand he said never shot so far in all my life he nodded to melitta thanks despoina care to have a go she shrugged i could never get an arrow that far she admitted the lighter of the pirates now thrust ahead but they didnt fire their engine as the promontory grew to fill the horizon their own archers fired and with the sea breeze behind them their arrows carried easily one oarsmen was pinked the broad bronze head of the arrow slicing his back timoleon returned fire but he used up melittas supply of cane arrows without scoring another hit each arrow blown to the right or left as if made of feathers melitta watched with a look satyrus knew well a look that said that she could have done better let me have a shot she said when timoleon was down to her last cane arrow be my guest he said she got up on the very tip of the stern platform balanced a moment lifted her bow drew and shot in one fluid motion her arrow vanished into the nearer triremes rowers a little high to get the crew of the ares engine but she was rewarded with a thin scream and then a rising shriek she clapped her hands in delight timoleon slapped her on the back the phoenicians engine fired the bolt ripping along the port oar banks with a noise like tearing linen it hit several oar shafts bounded about inside the loom of oars and then fell into the sea without breaking anything satyruss hand on the steering oar was like iron he didnt feel fatigue and he was not particularly aware of the missile exchange he watched his wake and adjusted his course cheating the bow towards the open sea and allowing the incoming waves to push his hull a little further towards the promontory just so he thought and held his course he was in another place in his mind a place where being the helmsman drove out room for any other fear melitta slipped down the stem followed by timoleon peleus watched her with pursed lips but when she was gone amidships he said she bought us a ships length there they weathered akrotirion promontory as close as they dared the starboard oars in the surf with the black hulls half a dozen stades behind every pair of eyes on the lotus that were above deck level strained for the bay of kition in hopes of seeing a couple of rhodian warships riding at anchor the pirates lost a stade because the big phoenician wouldnt come in as close to the beach they made a dogleg out to sea and satyrus breathed a little easier almost sure that he could beat them in a dead sprint and then all that careful helm work was by the board because sure enough there was a rhodian threeer riding high her crew still at breakfast on the beach rhodos was a free port independent of the wars of alexanders successors but she protected ptolemys trade because that suited her own interests and the threeer in the harbour deterred the pirates instantly even as the rhodian crews raced aboard the pirates were already running for the open sea their ares engines silent the rowers on board the golden lotus cheered the rhodian skipper came aboard with his trierarch and his helmsman and peleus hugged him a handsome man with skin like old leather and hair so blond as to be almost white his trierarch was like a reverse image of his captain pale skin and black hair and the helmsman was as black as a nubian an exotic trio from the most famous navy in the world peleus i knew the lotus as soon as she rounded the point and juba here says shes moving mighty fast eh and i watched your rowers he pointed at the tired men on the benches and we all yelled alarm together and we were still too late by poseidon the pale man said he was the youngest of the three and his face was burned red and he wore a purple chiton like a kings this is my navarch hes satyrus peleus motioned and satyrus stepped forward on the deck and smiled leons nephew any ward of leon is a friend of rhodos the nubian said he offered his hand and satyrus clasped it im juba the boy who cant stand the touch of helios is orestes and our fearless leader is actis arent you a little young for a navarch peleus pursed his lips he was at the helm as we came around the point he said juba gave satyrus a long look not bad old man is he serious or another aristocrat peleus shrugged i dont know yet he said they shared dinner with the rhodians and breakfast and then they were away rowing hard along the south coast of cyprus until the wind was fair for rhodos they touched at xanthos and all the news was bad antigonus oneeye had his fleet at miletus and rhodos was all but closed the rhodian navy was bold but it was small peleus sat across from satyrus at a benched table in a wine shop on the waterfront in xanthos so close to the lotus that her standing rigging cast a net of shadows in the setting sun a slave rose on her toes to light the oil lamps along the back of the wine shop peleus watched her without interest the wind is fair for rhodos he said if it doesnt change id say we crew her at the first blush of dawn and have a go lotus will be faster than anything they have at sea as he spoke he touched the wood of the table and then made a sign to avert ill luck melitta came down the board from the ship wearing a decent womans chiton the wine shop slave shook her head no women she said melitta raised an eyebrow and went and sat with her brother the slave followed her over please mistress no women it is the law of the town only slave women in the brothels and wine shops the watch will arrest us both melitta sighed she and satyrus exchanged a look and melitta rose and walked back up the plank to the stern of the lotus and vanished into the hull she reappeared as a somewhat androgynous archer in a pylos cap and the slave submitted for a few bronze obols i hate asia melitta said peleus raised an eyebrow athens would be worse despoina he said whats the verdict melitta asked peleus thinks we should try for rhodos satyrus said melitta drank some of his wine i knew you werent a coward she said the comment was tossed off not meant to wound but satyrus felt his temper flare he turned away peleus sighed ladybird fleeing pirates is not cowardice and frankly your whoring after a little glory is going to get people killed you act like a boy a particularly stupid boy this is the sea we have different rules here we follow poseidon not athena and not ares the sea can kill you any time it wants you think a battle is a wonderful thing a test of your courage try a storm at sea despoina ive seen a hundred aye and another hundred fights melitta nodded so much of your store of courage is used up she said with half a smile mine isnt peleuss face drained of blood you risk angering me he said slowly thats a risk i can stand melitta said satyrus sighed shut up melitta youre being a fool last time i looked its me whos the young man i should be the hothead and you should be the voice of reason he made her smile and turned to peleus ignore her my sister has to be braver than achilles all the time its the problem of having to represent all of the female half of the race xenophon appeared at the bow and sprang ashore in a fresh chiton and a light chlamys well he asked rhodos satyrus said first light any objection youre touchy tonight xenophon said and shook his head may i sit next to your sister you mean that archer there be my guest give him a good hard shove as you sit down thats from me xenophon obeyed melitta yelped and satyrus laughed peleus wasnt mollified i dont like being made fun of by children he said directly across the table to melitta leon says you ship with us its a mistake you have no discipline and no obedience and youll let us down if i see you get a man killed ill throw you over the side understood girl then he turned back ill sleep aboard and have orders for the men to come aboard with the sun anything else no peleus satyrus said he rose with the rhodian and followed him out of the wine shop into the dark she means no harm she wants your respect if she were a man a boy id have spanked her bloody the ignorant pup peleus shrugged shes a fine shot that doesnt make her special women have no business at sea ill have a hold on my temper tomorrow but i want her sent home from rhodos not on my ship he stomped off satyrus sighed he went back through the bead curtain to the wine shop just in time to see xenophons head jerk away from melittas he jumped as if hed been stung they both looked guilty his sisters skin was red as the setting sun he sat across from them framing his comment but he wasnt sure had they been kissing was it his business satyrus was used to his sister being the calm one the steady one and the brave one something had changed suddenly he was the calm one she leaned forward eyes bright well she asked her tone was aggressive satyrus made himself smile im for my cloak and whatever insects share it with me he said at least im not lying by a smoky fire on an open beach peleus intends to sail with the first brush of dawns fingers theyre holding hands under the table apollo is this my buisness satyrus sat back his head against the greasy wooden partition that separated this shack from the next one and suddenly swung his sandalled foot up between his sister and his best friend so that his foot caught hands melitta go to your bed he said she shrugged her face suddenly splotchy with anger why you cant make me if i reveal you as a woman i can have you held at a temple for the rest of your life you stupid fool whats got into you and xenophon you going to marry my sister eh better talk to me about it friend because if i see either of you touch the other again before rhodos blood will flow my promise on it i am not your chattel melitta spat heads were turning satyrus took a deep breath no he said you are not but neither am i yours lita i have the responsibility not you for the ship for the cargo and for your virginity when you have the responsibility do as you please when you have taken charge have i obeyed you xenophon sat silently while the siblings glared melitta put her hand in her mouth and bit her palm until it bled it was an ugly thing to watch then melitta shook her head you obeyed she said sullenly then she burst into tears and fled to the ship im sorry satyrus xeno said i i love her i think i always have satyrus shook his head not on this boat understand me there is no love on this boat shes a passenger and you are a marine ill try xenophons tone carried no conviction satyrus summoned up his best imitation of philokles dont try he said rather enjoying using the line he dreaded most from his tutor just do it then alone he sipped the last of his wine and watched the waterfront his best friend his helmsman and his sister were all equally angry alone in the dark he grinned and finished his wine when the red ball of the sun was fully above the eastern horizon they were well out from xanthos running almost due west as if fleeing the chariot of apollo sunset found them on the same heading running straight into the sun the headland of rhodos the city itself shone like a beacon in the sun and the head of the statue of apollo on the headland burned as if the very god was crowned in sacred fire behind them in the gathering murk of evening a pair of shadows were visible hullup and almost hidden by the coast of asia but revealed by their sails peleus watched them under his hand same two bastards he said thats not right were not worth that much effort that big fuck is down from tyre he ought to have stayed on the east coast of cyprus satyrus was trying to keep the wake as straight as an arrows flight so he answered with a grunt ships on the port bow came a cry from forward a highpitched cry melitta peleus looked around and then ran down the central decking ducked under the mainsail and vanished from satyruss view satyrus saw a flash and then another the pirates were starting to row as the breeze lessoned theyd be making distance peleus came back moving so fast that his bare feet slapped on the smooth deck not rhodian he said tersely give me the helm im giving you the helm satyrus said formally and he waited until peleuss hands were on the steering oar before he let go you have the helm i have the helm peleus said theres a lesbian freighter just clear of the headland peleus said swinging them a few points to the north im going to turn away from those ships i dont know who may be blockading macedonians or may not and offer the pirates behind us if they are pirates a nice fat lesbian merchant satyrus ran forward to watch the ships off to the south and west were just a line of marks against the sea black hulls and no sails but the flash of their oars as they rowed was rhythmic and predatory four five six ships a column of ships to the north a big roundhulled merchant under sail made to cross their path broadreaching on the wind and trying to hold a course as far west of south as he could get out of his sails satyrus watched him for a moment and then ducked back under the mainsail and ran back along the deck those are warships to the south he said aye peleus said that they are the two dark shapes behind them began to gain in resolution as they rowed harder peleus watched them as the distance closed poseidons mighty dick those are our friends with the machines he said his voice now certain how can that be satyrus didnt have an answer for him what should i do he asked peleus swung his lips from side to side pursed and unpursed them and looked aft again pray he said he smiled and swung the tiller a fraction more man the topdeck oars he called the oar master sounded a bronze drum once and then called ready most of the rowers were in position on a ship with fewer than two hundred men news travelled fast ten stades and were safe peleus said out loud he cheated his helm another fraction to the north oar master give us a touch of speed the oar master started to call the beat and the upperdeck oarsmen gave way with a will rowing carefully so that the drag of their oars wouldnt fight the last push of the breeze sail down on my command satyrus sang out and got a nod from peleus and the deck master had them all lined up with agathon handling a rope despite the stripes on his back hed been punished in xanthos that morning beaten with a rope the breeze was failing them as they came in with the land it was a matter of judgment as to when the oars were of use and then again when the sails became a liability the sort of fine judgment that could make all the difference in the world lower decks ready the oar master called mainsail down satyrus called at a nod from peleus the deck crew released lines at the rail and the sail folded to the deck in a gleam of red the pirates if the dark hulls were pirates were coming up fast their bows shone clear the phoenician had a pair of eyes painted above his ram something flashed astern out of the sun and splashed into the sea well astern and then there was the sound of a distant thud there they are peleus said same fucking ships he pulled the steering oar a little farther to the north so that their course lay opposite to that of the lesbian merchantman on the southern tack all oars he roared best speed boys off to the south the warship squadron was at full speed now but peleus had fooled them by steering farther to the north of his course every stade they were coming on in a column led by the two heaviest ships and despite having the advantage of the tide and fuller galleries of rowers they werent gaining ground but there they were like breakers or a lee shore a threat that couldnt be ignored macedonians some corinthians and maybe an asiatic peleus said antigonuss fleet he shook his head you cant see it but were already past them theyll give up in a minute theyd better or were in a lot more trouble the boltthrower astern fired again and the bolt skipped over the waves to pass them before it sank poseidon i hate those things peleus swore a new calf smoking on your altar wavetreader if you will see me safe into rhodos one more time as they heard the protests of the lesbian peleus moved the steering oar and pushed the bow north so that they were now on the opposite tack to the merchant ship almost at right angles to their initial course and the two pirates astern had to fetch their wake to make distance they were no longer losing the race and the angry merchant ship which had to turn south to avoid collision with the madmen aboard the lotus called insults as they shot by and will the pirates take the easy prey peleus asked and how dare they come so close to rhodos satyrus shook his head sure enough away to the south and west the military squadron had abandoned their chase dark was coming on and they needed a beach look at that peleus said astern the two pirates ignored the merchant ship which actually passed between them with another chorus of insults theyve been paid well peleus said ready to take the helm satyrus walked over ready to take the helm he said and took the oar into his hands the living ship moved under his grip you have the helm peleus said i have the helm satyrus said on my word were turning ninety degrees off our course and running for the harbour peleus left him and ran forward calling to the oar master satyrus grinned suddenly understanding because the macedonian squadron was pulling for its night beach theyd opened a different road into the harbour in effect the lotus would pursue them and the pirates would once again have lost ground too much ground this time to overtake everyone together steering oar keep her steady and the oar banks will turn us ready all ready on my command peleus shouted heads came up as all the bench leaders showed that they understood the ship rowed another stroke north peleus was watching the pirates satyrus didnt even turn his head that was peleuss job now hard to port peleus roared instantly the oar master translated the order into rowing orders in three heartbeats the port oar banks were backing water the steering oar bit deep and every sailor and deckhand on the halfdeck ran to the starboard side and threw themselves outboard and forward the marines and archers did the same satyrus eyes on the bow saw his sister and dorcus throw themselves on the outboard lines like deckcrewmen every bit would count the lotus turned from north to west in twice her own length and raced on her way virtually undiminished aft the predators couldnt even get their engine to bear they rowed on for precious seconds as their prey jigged like a rabbit chased by dogs and then they took too long to make the turn the heavier phoenician trireme took so long to make the manoeuvre that she was almost a stade north of her prey and lost several stades in distance the big phoenician chose to lose more ground and fire his machine again it was his last throw it cost more time and more manoeuvres lie down peleus shouted and got his back against the stem he looked stricken as he realized that satyrus was standing up with nowhere to hide a longstretched moment as satyrus saw the bolt leap from the engine in the last of the sun but it passed harmlessly off to the south mistimed and the older man straightened up with a wry look for his own worries as the last fingers of the sun reached across the winedark sea lotus shot past the headland at ramming speed and into the outer harbour the pirates already turning away in their wake down on the beach below the temple of apollo a small crowd of onlookers cheered them as peleus ordered the rowers to crashstop the ship putting their oars into the water against her momentum peleus rubbed his back and straightened alls well that ends well he said he shook his head too damned close for an old man i never saw your trick coming neither did the pirates satyrus said peleus just shook his head your sisters right he said my nerve aint what she used to be they unloaded a hidden cargo of finer things amulets engraved seal stones and superfine aegyptian linen and the real cargo aegyptian emmer wheat leons factor had already arranged buyers for every item and satyrus as the navarch received a small bundle of papyrus notations indicating the value of the cargo and the final sale not an obol changed hands the money stayed on paper where pirates couldnt seize it athenian tanned hides to smyrna satyrus said already loading the factor said smugly glad you know your business boy but we know ours nestor the gaul is factor in smyrna land him the hides and hell have a load of stuff for you to carry back to aegypt wool and oil thats my guess the short man smiled for the first time he must love you boy trusted you with the lotus satyrus smiled in confusion and let that comment go peleus took him from the factors office to the rhodian navys offices by the temple of poseidon just above the ship sheds every officer is supposed to report in peleus said if you plan to stay in this business youll do well to be one of them satyrus went up the steps with peleus by the time they were abreast of the courtyard of the temple a dozen scarred veterans had greeted peleus with the utmost respect they went in through a row of painted wooden columns and joined a dozen men in weatherworn chitons and oilsmeared cloaks gathered around a pair of older men on wooden stools peleus said the oldest a gnarled man with a beard as white as the snow on olympus i heard a report you were inbound here i am this young scapegrace is leons nephew satyrus a passable excuse for a navarch satyrus the two old men are timaeus and panther they command the fleet this year peleus walked around clasping hands with the men his own age thats satyrus son of kineas of athens eh boy panther looked like his namesake with a shock of whitegrey hair unthinned by age fierce eyebrows and a mighty beard that failed to hide the furnace that burned behind his eyes when are you going to rid us of that poxed whore eumeles eh boy satyrus cleared his throat my sister would have killed him already he said im giving it some thought lord of stallions i can hear his balls clanking together from here panther said he turned to peleus we were just talking about your pirates after you came in guess what they did peleus shrugged hauled their wind and rowed north satyrus smiled may i guess sir panther growled have a go boy they sailed south and coasted along looking at antigonuss fleet he said timaeus narrowed his eyes he looked at panther and panther grunted peleus smiled smart lad he said so why they arent pirates satyrus said or rather they arent just pirates theyre out to get melitta and me for stratokles and athens maybe as part of a wider deal he shrugged stratokles the informer is just the sort of man to have a safeconduct from his own opponents and to want to spy on them he shrugged give the man his due hes good at what he does athens has no great love for cassander and thats a fact panther looked around to peleus he said when antigonus comes at us will ptolemy back us peleus nodded he has to hes building a fleet its not a fleet the way you or i would have a fleet but its better than nothing timaeus grunted part of oneeyes fleet is on our beaches blockading us he rubbed his chin eyes on the floor satyrus looked down and realized that he was standing on a chart of the inner sea his sandals were on the coast of rhodos with helioss rays detailed in gold and smyrna was two steps away the rest have vanished panther said pointing vaguely at the coast of asia for all i know demetrios took them straight into alexandria to burn the place hes a bold one timaeus shook his head we put all our cruisers to sea to avoid blockade and then they made their move and were blind our harbour is empty if you didnt notice we dont have any more ships to send as scouts your lading says you are bound for smyrna will you scout the coast of palestine on your way back panther spoke urgently to peleus our need is great peleus looked at satyrus its his call to make gentlemen palestine is well off our course and we couldnt get the news back here you could get word to our station on cyprus peleus were hardpressed and were on the same side timaeus rose from his chair peleus shrugged im as rhodian as the rose timaeus but i serve an alexandrian and im an honest servant last year you sent ships to serve antigonus oneeye panther shrugged it was expedient you know who we prefer welcome to the olympic games of politics boy peleus said to satyrus satyrus stepped forward will you find a merchant to take lord leons hides across to smyrna timaeus nodded we can do that he shrugged eventually so well pick up some luxuries to pay the oarsmen and ship empty for the palestinian coast satyrus said peleus nodded and well fly that pair of wolves will be on you as soon as you leave harbour panther said peleus nodded they almost caught us when we were fully laden he said unless the gods will our doom empty well be over the horizon before they can get in range with their infernal engines satyrus took a deep breath we need three days he said the crew needs a rest fair enough timaeus said perhaps one of our cruisers will come in and we wont need you at all satyrus turned to peleus and my sister stays aboard he said peleus shrugged done he said a day of debauch and a day of rest and the golden lotuss crew mustered on the beach surly or smiling depending on their natures many of them had acquired companions most of them temporary and a few of them had gained or lost possessions satyrus could see a younger oarsman with what appeared to be a clothofgold chlamys wrapped around his shoulders standing next to an older man with his head between his knees who appeared to be completely naked but none were late or absent and every man of them had his rowing cushion whatever the state of his dress peleus stood up wearing a bronze breastplate and carrying a helmet this is a war voyage he shouted anyone want to sit it out i have a pair of javelins for every man and ill add an owl to everyones pay but we wont ship much of a cargo and that means no shares kyros the oar captain spoke up what about captures peleus nodded right enough but were scouting an enemy coast boys not much time to make a capture if we do shares by the custom of rhodos kyros nodded and went back to squatting on his haunches peleus turned to satyrus thats what passes for a council among men who use the sea he said weve got the tide satyrus nodded lets use it then the two wolves were aware as soon as the golden lotus passed the temple of apollo and left the inner harbour peleus watched them under his hand as they threw their oars aboard and then pushed their sterns down the beach but they didnt have the wind and their rowers were slow to respond and the lotus drew away effortlessly good riddance peleus said staring under his hand heavy metal in their bows and no mistake i wont be sorry to see the last of them the last they saw of them were their masts slipping away under the horizon as the coast of asia came up on the port bow satyrus could see the first of the telltale headlands that would lead him into xanthos i guess were not going into xanthos he said peleus shook his head beautiful day crew hard as old wood lets use this fine west wind while it blows and see if we can make the beaches of pamphylia if the weather holds he said and made a horn sign with his hand we might coast into paphos on cyprus and well never see those cocksuckers again kyros took a dipper of water from the butt amidships and raised an eyebrow at the helmsman i wont mention that to the boys i guess peleus barked a harsh laugh maybe when the moon rises he glanced at satyrus itd be something to tell your grandchildren that you went from rhodos to paphos in a days rowing he came and stood by satyrus for ten strokes of the oars and then they felt the true west wind at their backs peleus gave one of his rare smiles he turned to the deck master hoist the mainmast kalos get the cloth on her mainmast and mainsail aye kalos answered short hairy and scarred his name spoke for what he was not beautiful he was perhaps the ugliest man satyrus had ever seen stratokles included but he had a sense of humour and often claimed that he had been an avatar of aphrodite in a former life and was paying the price now of course he was also a highly skilled seaman in less time than it took to pull an oar a hundred times the mainmast was up and roped home and the mainsail was drawing taut as a board and round as a cheese navarch peleus said gruffly if youll have my advice id say that we could make the run to paphos satyrus nodded a few times considering then carry on satyrus said its only that it is open water all the way no landfalls and no refuge peleus raised a shaggy eyebrow for one day are we sailors or not satyrus asked rhetorically whats the heading years since i did it peleus squinted at the sun and the sky south and east no more south i like that hold that course he looked at the wake for long enough that satyrus thought he might have changed his mind deepwater sailing is where we find out if you can mind your helm or not he said no landmarks no seamarks your wake is straight or he aint hear me lad satyrus was growing weary of a life that seemed to consist of nothing but an endless series of tests but he bit back on his first answer and managed a grin do my best he said notch in your wake when you talk peleus said when the sun was high in the sky melitta walked down the raised deck between the rowers most of them were sitting comfortably and a dozen of them were busy rigging a long awning on the port side against the sun while the sailors did the climbing wherever she walked silence followed and stares and some quiet comments life on shipboard had brought home to melitta how very stupid men were her body was capable of ending argument discussion religious affirmation really it was a wonder that men managed to do any work at all whereas by contrast there were naked men all around her and none of them moved her by so much as an iota some had fine bodies her brother for instance or old peleus in his way xenophon if you ignored the pimples on his face had the physique of herakles the marine captain was exercising naked gleaming with oil and obviously trying to attract her attention it was a fine body but as melitta had already commented to dorcus there wasnt much inside it she swept her ionic chiton under her with one arm and gathered her chlamys with the other before sinking on to a bale of sheepskins that acted as the sternseat for the helmsmans visitors im tired of being stared at melitta said to her brother im tired of being tested trade you satyrus said with a wry smile deal she said and spat in her hand they shook without his unwrapping his arms from the steering oar now youve put a notch in my wake he said she laughed youre pretending to be a sailor while i pretend to be a greek woman she said when do we get to stop pretending satyrus watched the horizon over the stern for a long minute i remember when i thought that you were so much older than me he said now i think maybe ive passed you for a while because i learned something last year and i learned it again after i kissed amastris you kissed amastris not some slave girl in her clothes melitta leaned forward was she chewing cinnamon just before she summoned me satyrus asked melitta gave an enigmatic smile so you kissed her was it beautiful satyrus sighed it was beautiful lita thats what i mean it wasnt like kissing phiale at all kissing phiale made my member stiff kissing amastris made me soften youre killing me my brother has a poetic soul while im left with all this chaff she waved around her at the men on deck then seeing that peleus was coming up the central deck she leaned close tell me what you learned were always pretending he looked at her eye to eye so close that he could see the flecks of colour in her iris and she could see her own reflection in his she could feel his breath on her face i pretend to be brave when im afraid i pretend to be interested in sex when im interested in impressing my peers i pretend to be religious when i go to temple i pretend to be obedient when i steer the ship she cast a glance at peleus and he grabbed her arm listen melitta because thats what every ephebe knows but what i know is that the pretending becomes the reality melitta looked at him as if shed never seen him before but she made a face satyrus why cant you be like this all the time satyrus furrowed his eyebrows what melitta raised her arms as if supplicating the gods at sea you are as wise as philokles as subtle as diodorus on land youre often well my notquiteaman brother thanks i think satyrus said after a second he shrugged i dont know at sea im in command at least this trip command well its like a dose of cold water when youre asleep and i keep seeing people do things i know that i do xeno does stuff that makes me tremble and so help me he laughed and melitta joined him if you two was sailors id expect a mutiny peleus said he spared melitta a smile may i offer the despoina an apology for my rude ways when we was running from pirates melitta gave him the full weight of her smile eyes flashing teeth a hand sweeping back her hair if these were all the weapons she had to use as a greek woman shed wield them ruthlessly were you rude helmsman i thought that you were doing your duty she swept by him down the deck heading for her own awning with dorcus under the boatsail mast she heard his grunt as she moved away and smiled again in satisfaction they werent her weapons of choice but they did cut well past midday and the sea rose blue and blue out to the rim of the horizons bowl the sun rode the sky above them heading west and the handful of fleecy clouds were more ornament than threat nothing more frightening except a storm kalos muttered he squatted in the stern out of the wind he kept his eyes forward as if he didnt want to see the empty rim of the bowl unmarked by even the hint of land in any direction dont be a woman peleus said the boys do as you do i hate not seeing a coast kalos said he got to his feet stretched like a big ugly cat and glided forward light on his feet and unaffected by the roll i hate it too peleus said he gave satyrus his secret smile but cutting across the empty sea is what makes us better sailors lad and you have to look like you know your way like theres a path of gold hammered into the surface of the water for you and only you satyrus thought of his advice to his sister i pretend im not afraid all the time he said we have a name for that lad peleus said slapping his shoulder we call that courage do you know where we are satyrus asked peleus looked around no he said but give or take a thousand stades were west of cyprus i draw some hope from that bank of low cloud that just came up under the bow see it satyrus stretched his neck to see under the mainsail i think i do ill go forward and look slowly so it doesnt look bad notch in your wake lad peleus went forward adjusting sheets and cursing the oarsmen most of whom hadnt touched an oar since midmorning and were so much human cargo satyrus watched him go and stood looking at his sister and thinking of amastris thinking that like the flower of the lotus amastris was probably something that would be bad for him in the long run what if he endangered their chance at revenge at having their own kingdom in his minds eye he could see ataelus just to name one man the small sakje had been with his mother when she died hed escaped to raise his clan in revolt and he had worked tirelessly at rallying the former coalition of the eastern assagatje to fight against the sauromatae and against eumeles supported by leon or lykeles who spoke against heron every day in the assembly in olbia what if he incurred her fathers real displeasure or ptolemys he watched his wake life he thought is too complicated he enjoyed being a helmsman he enjoyed the simple yet endless task he enjoyed the trust and the responsibility and the palpable success at the end of the day if you piloted a ship well it came to port task complete kingship seemed to be much worse his thoughts wandered off to the moment when she slipped into his arms the surrender of her mouth the quickness of her tongue planning to sail back to rhodos lad peleus said he pointed at the long curve of the wake oh ugh satyrus brought the ship back on course with a perceptible turn that made heads come up all along the deck he was irrationally angry at himself at peleus at always being tested again girl peleus asked yes satyrus answered almost inaudibly dont think about any of that when youre at the helm mind you youve been at it without relief for a watch and a half ill take the helm im fine satyrus said no you aint ill take the helm navarch if you please peleus was suddenly very formal satyrus stood straight and managed to get the oar into the helmsmans hand despite the shame of his burning face you have the helm i have the helm go and lie down and dream of your girl boy you earned a rest dont fret despite this last admonition satyrus knew that hed made an error a bad error one that in a normal young man would have been punished by a blow or worse he walked to the awning in silence and the deck crew made way for him as if he was injured sailors were very perceptive to social ills they had to be living so close and hed seen before how a man who had been punished was treated with consideration that verged on tenderness now that same blanket surrounded him and he hated that he had failed them he collapsed on a cushion of straw next to his sister dont say anything he said she raised an eyebrow but said nothing and after a long bout of recrimination he managed to fall asleep evening came a beautiful evening satyrus woke to find his head pillowed in his sisters lap with the first star aphrodite just rising above the ships side you were tired his sister said hermes ive slept for hours satyrus bounced up and found that his whole body was sore and that his mouth was dry and he was cold kyros came aft and passed him a water skin drink he said you got too much sun today old bastard left you too long at the oar hes got no skin left to burn just hide the water skin no sooner touched his lips than he drained it right down to the eviltasting swill in the bottom where the resin and the goat hair and the water made a disgusting brew he spat over the side and kyros laughed get some more navarch youre sunsick and no mistake cold yet he asked satyrus nodded guiltily wrap up youll be colder tonight glad you slept good pillow i expect he said with a sidelong glance at melitta satyrus climbed down past the oarsmen in the bilge which stank of piss and worse where amphorae of clean water stood point down in the sand of the ballast he lifted the open one clear of the bilge and filled the leather bucket and then refilled the oar masters skin punishing himself with the task with the bucket he refilled the butt on deck so other men could drink and then he passed the skin back to the oar master only when the whole smelly job was done did he present himself to the helmsman sunsick i hear peleus said yes sir satyrus answered you dont call me sir lad youre the navarch i left you too long at the oar and thats no mistake im a fool mind you you stood there like a fool without asking to be relieved he shrugged youll live i can smell the land can ye smell it satyrus took a deep breath no but i see the gulls right you are and land birds before the sun sets now comes the hard part where on poseidons liquid plain are we eh because well want a beach as soon as we can get one fresh water and a place to cook in the morning the boys can only slurp kykeon so many times before they rise up and murder me he nodded as if talking with a third party you want me to take the helm satyrus asked no into the bow and watch the horizon landfall any time now bring me word i could climb the mainmast satyrus asked he was gushing in his eagerness to be forgiven only in an emergency peleus said makes the whole ship lean a nice trick on a merchantman not on a trireme eh into the bow aye satyrus headed forward scooping his heavier thracian cloak as he went past his sister most of the men on deck were naked but satyrus was chilled to the bone and yet the last rays of the sun seemed to flay him when he emerged under the mainsail into the bow behind him he heard peleus order kyros to begin clearing away the oar decks as the wind that had carried them all day was now dying away to a breeze in the bow the low clouds of midafternoon were now well up in the sky and catching the sun in a wall of pink and red satyrus had to look at them and away twice before he was sure then he ran back along the central deck between the topdeck rowers dropping his cloak in his rush aft land right on the bow no points off peleus took the news as if he had never known a moments doubt he nodded ready to take the helm navarch he asked satyrus put a hand on the oar i have the helm you have the helm peleus said and slipped from the stern to move forward he vanished under the sail kyros came up with kalos in tow satyrus nodded land he said both men looked relieved kalos stopped when kyros turned away sorry to be so scared he said your first time at the steering oar across the blue water we could end in hades understand then he slapped satyruss bare back making him cringe and notching the wake but you didnt he said and went back to organizing the lowering of the mainmast melitta brought him his cloak while peleus watched forward he pulled it on gratefully feeling more like an old man on a winter night than was fair everyone says i have sunsickness he said youre as red as tyrean wool she answered you mind your oar and dorcus will rub some oil into your skin together she and her maid rubbed a mixture of olive oil and wool oil into his skin and he felt better warmer and less as if his skin would be flayed off by morning thanks sister he said now whos all grown up she asked i have the sense to stay out of the sun he was testing you i failed satyrus said bitterly youre an idiot melitta answered fondly she stood with him in companionable silence until peleus joined them and then she slipped away the rock of akkamas is just under our ram peleus said appearing from under the mainsail your course may be as erratic as a newborn lamb but you are poseidons son lad were bang on course so fine that well weather the headland to the north and have the north coast and the west wind tomorrow louder he turned and addressed the sailors and oarsmen in the waist of the ship perfect landfall thirty stades of light rowing and the white sands of likkia will be under our stern with a quiet cheer the oarsmen settled into their benches with a will before the moon was full on the swell they were turning the ship just off the beach the long hull broadsideon to the whispering surf and then the rowers reversed their directions and the lotus backed up the beach until the curving stern kissed the shining sand and they were safe satyrus slept late the next morning and hid his face from the sun as they set out and dorcus rubbed him down twice that day as the west wind carried them down the north coast of cyprus with peleus pointing out the promontories and the best beaches where a helmsman could slip ashore for an unlicensed cargo of copper where the food was cheap they landed for the night at ourannia with a rested crew and peleus paid for meat the oarsmen had a feast tomorrow we cross over to the coast of lebanon peleus said pirates everywhere privateers rovers socalled merchants and maybe just maybe advance squadrons of oneeyes fleet i want our lads in peak shape you want them in peak shape i didnt see a ship today satyrus said you were asleep all afternoon lad and i was glad to see it sunsick is a hard way to go but you missed the three big phoenicians deep laden heading west with an escort satyrus thought it over for a moment so anyone chasing us will get a nice little report thats right and the rhodian cruiser wasnt on his station off makaria thats not good peleus rubbed his nose were cruising a sea thats too empty by half he shrugged anyway well sleep late again and have the last of the west wind across to the shore of asia then the weather will change he rubbed his beard i n the morning the worst of satyruss sunsickness was off him he took the steering oar as they cleared the beach at ourannia and turned the bow back to the east into the rising sun kyros brought him a broad straw hat like a cavalryman would wear youre a hippeis he quipped a girl was selling them on the beach satyrus smiled ill buy it from you he said see how it has a good linen cord so it wont blow off kyros said nah boy thats for you from the oarsmen luck is luck all that dicking about with the oar and you landed us on the rock of akkamas like a whore in piraeus lands on a sailors cock kyros smiled over his shoulder kalos leered boys think youre lucky navarch and you paid the price in sunsickness kalos said he pointed at the hat a tiny silver trident was pinned to the crown deck crew threw that in pilgrim badge he smiled so you stay lucky so satyrus wore the hat what are you smiling at melitta asked coming into the stern how smart people are even when they seem ordinary or slow or just plain dumb he shrugged sometimes i wonder if i ever fool anyone she nodded and stood there watched by a hundred eyes as the stades flowed away under the keel the sun was setting and peleus announced that their landfall was twenty stades north of hydatos potomai on the north coast of syria that night they pulled down the coast under oars until peleus and kyros both liked a beach and landed by moonlight sending the marines and a dozen deckhands in the boat to land and search the sands and the hillside beyond the lotus waited on their word satyrus had shipped as a marine and hed done the drill for camping on a hostile beach but hed never done it for real and he felt his heart pound while he watched their white corslets in the moonlight melitta quietly strung her bow they were all poised riding their anchor and with the topdeck rowers giving the occasional stroke to keep her steady bowon to the open ocean in case she needed to run there were lookouts all along the hull and a man up the mast watching the moonlit open ocean where the sky was still salmon pink a long whistle from the beach all peleus had to do was nod satyrus could land the ship himself ready on the oars backstroke on my command give way all the lotus slipped in grounded her stern and the oarsmen were over the side as fast as they could every man racing for the lines as he hit the beach simultaneously lightening the ship and helping haul him farther up the beach until satyrus called hold and belay and looked at peleus not bad the rhodian commented then very quietly he said theres something wrong satyrus had assumed it was his own fears rising in his throat yes he said he stood straighter made himself be alert something smells wrong he said with sudden realization he looked at peleus in the moonlight smell death peleus said he nodded and walked to the side karpos i need you to scout north smell it something died we all smell it peleus karpos called back then he was off at a run with a pair of marines behind him the archers went south fires were lit and food cooked cauldrons of heavy stew with yesterdays lamb in an hour they were wrapped in their cloaks the marines all together in the middle and a double watch on the promontories that rose like towers at either end of the beach the dog star was high when satyrus awoke to find karpos kneeling in the sand next to peleus he got out of his cloaks and knelt next to them in the moonlight this isnt for everyone lad go ahead karpos tell him what you saw ships a fight karpos shook his head breeze fooled us the next beach south is covered in corpses and a hull turtled in the swell breaking up he shook his head rhodian cruiser she took a ram amidships but only after she wasted a macedonian trireme three or four hundred corpses karpos sank on to the sand shit satyrus said without meaning to peleus rubbed his chin sleep while you can so old panther isnt as foolish as i thought some of oneeyes fleet is on this coast and they attacked a rhodian to keep that news a secret we should sail with the first finger of dawn satyrus said thats the truth lad peleus lay his head back down so sleep while you can karpos got up why not run now he asked peleus didnt answer so satyrus did what if we have to fight he said we need fresh rowers karpos nodded i wont sleep coming across that in the dark fuck me he turned away ever seen a battlefield in the dark lad yes i have satyrus said too bad for you then karpos said and he lay down rolled in his chlamys and pretended to sleep the next satyrus knew kyros was clasping his shoulder still a little tender from the sunburn it was dark as tartarus and the oar master was pulling him to his feet youre to launch us he said master peleus is climbing the headland he swallowed some hot wine and some porridge and then he was standing in the stern and the ship was sliding down the beach into the waves his sister was standing in the bow a heavy cloak over her and satyrus knew her well enough to know that she was wearing armour under that cloak and not a chiton he heard rumours around him in the first blush of light that the lookouts had seen a squadron pass in the dark that there were fires on the next headland the stern was free he felt the change in weight a sea he shouted and the last oarsmen and all the sailors came up the side almost swimming while the foretopdeck rowers gave him enough way to keep the bow on to the waves all oars he called cruising speed give way all he waved at the oar master the way peleus did and his chant started up and they were clear of the beach in the time it took for an early gull to circle them once and give a cry the light boat came off the headland before theyd pulled their oars a dozen more times and once they were out of the surf satyrus had his oarsmen rest the shafts crossed amidships while the boat came alongside and peleus leaped up the side kalos pulling the light boat brought it up under the stern caught a rope and tied off before swimming aboard peleus was naked he shivered as he came into the stern and satyrus handed him his thracian cloak thanks lad he said he shook his head and lowered his voice we should do well enough he said winds from the north well sail until we have to weather the big headlands theres a big force somewhere on this coast aristions rose was a tough nut and she wouldnt have stayed to fight unless she was trapped he shook his head im shaken boy in rhodos we say we can outrun everything we cant fight and outfight anything that we cant outrun but roses become a turtle on that beach youll see her in a little while and young aristions so much fish bait how long ago two days or three long enough for the corpses to rise peleus shook his head what is oneeye doing on this coast i thought he was going after cassander satyrus shrugged thats what he wanted us to think maybe and maybe stratokles wanted ptolemy to think the same nasty thought lad if thats the case why then hes going to have a go at aegypt could already be over i worried about that last night satyrus shook his head and other things youre a worrier and thats a fact make you a good helmsman except that your steering oar will be a sceptre wont it lad this is just an adventure for you eh timaeus told me who you are sort of knew all along of course anyway you could be a helmsman peleus sounded rueful why thanks in a few years peleus said with a glint early afternoon laodikeas beaches shining to the east in the hazy sun and the wind rising to a scream and then falling away to a fitful breeze that somehow failed to clear the haze an athenian grain merchant sails flapping barely making headway he was a huge ship with something like a full load heading south along the coast lay me alongside peleus said that was the only order he issued and the oar master and the sailing master did the rest the merchant ship needed wind to run away and the wind was not cooperating rising and falling on the swell grappled to the athenian satyrus waited with the archers all on their toes eager to shoot and all the marines away on the giant merchant ship with peleus and then the boat came back the marines all shaking their heads and finally peleus coming up the side his chiton soaked through from climbing the side of the grain ship grain for demetrios he said shaking his head grain for his fleet he assumed we were rhodians surrendered i told him not to be silly were not at war peleus shrugged we cant tow that behemoth id like to let him go satyrus stared up at the towering sides of the great ship i see your point wont he report us only as a friendly merchant ship that paid him a ship visit and he gave me a chestful of information peleus stripped his chiton over his head and pulled another from the leather bag he kept under the sternpost satyrus waited as did kyros and karpos the marine captain had his cuirass open to catch any air that happened to brush past him and his attic helmet was tilted back on his head demetrios oneeyes golden son has two hundred ships of war on the beaches south of here hes got half his fathers army and theyre on the march heading east into nabataea peleus nodded into the silence its a money raid hes going to rape the nabataeans for gold and use it to finance the war in the west against cassander see satyrus waited patiently not an easy feat for a sixteenyearold but he wanted to let the grown men speak first in case he was wrong so were done karpos said slip away to seaward and we can be in the bay of kyrios tomorrow afternoon and find the rhodian cruiser make our report he slapped his hands together and sailed one away over the horizon of the other and home kyros shook his head its clear youre not a rhodian karpos my lad no rhodian captain will take a report like that we need to see this fleet peleus nodded fraid so karpos karpos shrugged lets get at it then satyrus stepped forward theyre not raising the money for the war on cassander he said the other three turned to look at him its all a deception listen i grew up with this stratokles came to get troops out of ptolemy now theres an army in nabataea and the whole of oneeyes fleet is two days sail from aegypt the target is aegypt cassander has made a deal with oneeye satyrus looked around at them conscious that he had pounded his fist into his palm in his eagerness to convey his conviction peleus rubbed his beard not saying i believe you lad but not saying i dont it could be that way aye and that makes the risk all the worse if were wrong karpos pursed his lips spat and then said i may not be a fucking rhodian but i can tell you that what we need is a prisoner a good one somebody who knows this crap how do you propose we get one peleus asked karpos glanced at the towering sides of the grain ship due to the fitful wind the grain ship was still less than a ropes length away peleus rubbed his chin i gave my word he said were not pirates satyrus said and were no worse off than we were this morning down the coast on the lookout if we can find a prisoner fine otherwise the moment we see the ships on the beach were away for cyprus and then straight across the great blue to alexandria im happy to help rhodos but its ptolemy who needs this information i think peleus began satyrus nodded pleasantly and cut the older man off happy to listen to your council helmsman in private peleus looked stung but only for a moment then he gave a grim smile well youre the navarch right enough as if to confirm their decision the wind came up first two strong gusts that laid them over and then a long hard blow from the north that swept the athenian away he had bigger yards and a stronger hull golden lotus had to brail her boatsail strike the mainsail and row to keep her direction and the merchant ship was gone over the horizon in an hour storm coming peleus said he had the steering oar and wind change true to his word half an hour later and their sails were hanging limp again it was all satyrus could do to stay awake he was trying to decide how long he could sweep this hostile coast before he had to turn back north or out to sea just to find a beach for the night that would be safe midafternoon and they were cruising the coast of lebanon north of tyre a coast so empty of shipping that it was as if the gods had swept the seas clean they were coasting on their boatsail the oarsmen resting under awnings the water gurgling down the side with just enough way on the lotus to give the steering oar a bite on the water peleus was cursing almost without ceasing every new headland and every bay they passed without seeing a merchant ship or even a fishing smack brought new invective as soon as we open laodikea satyrus said finally forcing himself to decide we turn west into the open sea whats the matter melitta asked as they ate new bread and goats cheese at midday the longer we dont see anything the worse it looks all the way around satyrus translated the bigger the sweep was the bigger the fleet thats here and the longer it endures the longer ago it got here and thats bad too he looked out to sea if we could find a ship to take wed get a prisoner and be gone right we dont want to find oneeyes fleet ourselves we want to hear about it she nodded obviously craving some excitement and not in complete agreement melitta listen to me alexandria may already be blockaded perhaps under siege there may have been a battle see its that bad satyrus shook his head why dont we run down the coast and help tell them whats happening she asked because we dont know satyrus said we can guess but until we see a hundred triremes or find someone who has were just making stuff up to scare ourselves melitta nodded while she watched the water mama used to talk about scouting just this way she said i was listening satyrus said he was watching laodikea head beyond the great beach ran for a hundred stades but he wouldnt see it for half an hour and the light was changing as afternoon gave way to golden evening he needed sea room if there was to be a blow better yet he needed a safe beach he rubbed his chin in unconscious imitation of peleus the breeze was dying to nothing time to have the oars out ships ships on the horizon to starboard came the call from the mast where the sail hung almost still satyrus came awake without being aware that hed been napping he looked aft and then over the side to the west and saw one on the horizon and then another he nudged peleus and pointed peleus grunted he opened his mouth to speak and the bow lookout gave a cry like a man drowning poseidon the beach is full of ships he shouted after a sputter peleus had the oar so satyrus ran forward past his sister still wrapped in her cloak to where he could see once there he didnt wait for advice from his helmsman kalos get the mainmast down rig for fighting he ran back the length of the ship fleet fills the beach youll see yourself in two shakes of a lambs tail peleus nodded look west he said the two nicks in the horizon were defining themselves a heavy trireme and a lighter one ares and aphrodite satyrus swore just then the north wind gave a gust and then backed good order getting the mainmast down peleus went on because the north wind is about to be a south wind and then were going to have to fight at least well fight until all those macedonian cruisers see us and then were all fish bait he leaned close dont let your sister be captured lad do it yourself it you have to satyrus swallowed but his eyes were on the hundreds of hulls on the golden beach unmoving peleus shook his head with your permission satyrus im going to release the lower decks and row with just the top deck until the pirates are firm on our wake satyrus nodded look whos standing off the bay he said he pointed at the big athenian grain freighter off riding out in the deep water of the bay just fifteen stades down the coast no difference to us boy peleus said does laodikea have a harbour satyrus asked open beach peleus answered if were going to lighten ship nows the time with a rattle and thump that satyrus had come to dread the engine fired but the two pirates were well astern and the changing wind was blowing across their path the bolt never became visible they rowed two stades peleus taking them as close in to the headland as possible in a belated attempt to remain invisible to the macedonians on the beach satyrus nodded straight across the beach he said if they cant get a boat in the water were clear he spoke as much to hearten the deck crew in earshot as anything else the changing wind favoured the deep hull of the heavier phoenician galley who was pulling away from his lighter brother ship the second bolt flew as if it came from the hand of zeus and struck their sternpost square on an impact that could be felt throughout the ship poseidon were sunk the oar master said peleus punched the man hard enough to make him writhe in pain dont be an ass he said a hundred of those spears wont hurt us as long as they hit the works its rowers they can kill he went astern and climbed the rail with an axe and cut the lance free nice piece of bronze he said now about dumping some weight do pirates read thucydides do you think satyrus asked his eyes were on the merchant ahead i doubt theres a man in those ships who can read a word lad peleus said something on your mind have you read thucydides satyrus said peleus shook his head ancient history cant say as i have whatd he do satyrus felt his stomach turn over in fear and he made himself smile i have an idea he said there were hordes of macedonians on the shore and as satyrus watched he saw oarsmen forming in long lines by the sterns of a dozen triremes and worse a heavy quinquereme the biggest warship on the beach satyrus prayed to herakles god of heroes he prayed now i will roll the bones with fate stand by me the athenian merchants were also watching standing on the high stern of their ship some of their crewmen were already ashore and others were lying on pallets of straw on the deck cheering as if they were watching a race from their shouts satyrus could tell that they thought the end was near the lotus was dumping what little cargo he had in the outer roadstead and he shot ahead but throwing his cargo overboard took time and effort and men off the benches and he couldnt keep the pace the lotus began to labour his rowers apparently exhausted and illtrained or perhaps their morale had collapsed the pirates increased their efforts sure of their prey and their engine of war fired bolts the size of a sarissa two of them stuck in the stern of the fleeing galley satyrus was up on the halfdeck with the sailors while peleus steered as close as he could i want it to come down in one go he said for the third time because sailors could be stubborn make it look like the boatsail mast went can you do it his sister was right behind him trying to get his attention he ignored her like enough said an aegyptian mate with a thick accent like we was winged eh satyrus nodded just so he said he glanced aft prayed to poseidon and tried not to flinch as the next bolt sank four inches into the planking of the stern he looked forward judging the distance and aft next one can you do it the sailors all shrugged and looked uninterested and satyrus couldnt decide whether to scream or cry to starboard the athenian merchant ship a giant tub with high sides and a towering mainmast stood alone in the deep water just half a stade off the beach he rode so high out of the water even with a full load of grain that his bulk screened threequarters of the beach from sight now that satyruss orders were given the whole idea seemed absurd his throat was so tight that he didnt think he could speak but he smelled the damp lion skin and suddenly he felt as if hed been filled with ambrosia what the hell are we doing brother melitta asked peleus was ordering the archers and marines into the bow which seemed to be against all reason as they were almost at long bow shot over the stern let me take some long shots melitta said maybe i can kill some crewmen on that machine she had her bow in her hand were going about lita satyrus said were going to fight the way you wanted he couldnt manage to be angry and he hugged her briefly get your armour on and join the archers peleus glared satyrus shrugged wait until you see her shoot he said by way of apology she hugged him back fiercely dont be captured she said nor you he said and then he could see the men on the enemy bow cranking at their machine the arms of the bow coming back melitta was leaping down from the halfdeck into the bow ready satyrus called out his nerves receded mostly another part of him said they had enough of a lead to run the bow up the beach and leap clear and surrender to the macedonians he couldnt imagine going back to his uncle without the golden lotus was that cowardice too steady peleus called every man on deck hard in on the port rail now you whores at peleuss command all the men on deck without other orders ran to the portside rail tilting the ship an awkward angle to port less than a stade aft the engine fired and the bolt aimed high ripped across the deck at head height the oar master died instantly his head exploded like a ripe melon so that his brains showered the halfdeck rowers and one of his eyes smacked satyrus in the cheek and splatted on the deck at his feet satyrus gave a squeak of pure fear and stumbled back the boatsail fell in rush of heavy linen that filled the deck so that satyrus was covered swathed as if in a burial sheet and the boat seemed to steer wildly the stern shooting out to the port side and the heavy bow pivoting as the helmsman seemed to have lost control of his vessel satyrus grasped at the heavy linen swimming through it in increasing desperation there was a man screaming and then he was free of the cloth and they were screened from the rush of the pirates by the high side of the merchantman towering above them as they turned and turned their deck crew stiffening the ship by leaning far out on the port side while their rowers pulled or backed at peleuss direct command because the oar master was a headless corpse whose blood continued to be a spreading stain on the boatsail pull port drag starboard halfdeck racing speed peleus called and satyrus was out of the cloth and jumping on to the steering platform take the helm boy peleus said its your plan where are you going satyrus asked in the bow he could see his sister nocking an arrow his palm slapped the steering oar and he spoke automatically i have the helm he said you have the helm peleus responded he grinned we need an oar master he jumped for the platform amidships before he was up on the halfdeck he called give way all and then his voice swelling in power ramming speed satyrus had never in his wildest dreams of heroism imagined steering a ship in combat this was the art for which helmsmen got the highest pay right between them boy peleus shouted dont get fancy fuck them in the oars that made it through his fearaddled brain an oarrake he took a moment to breathe really breathe all the way in and all the way out one glance at his wake and then he steadied down they had turned all the way like a hairpin around the athenian merchant ship their whole manoeuvre screened from the two pirates by the grain ships high sides the bow swung clear of the merchantman using the big hull for cover and even as a fulcrum the lotus had turned all the way around losing very little of her speed and now with all banks pulling with the expertise that leon paid for they shot out from the merchants stern like one of the bolts fired by the enemys machine the two pirates were abreast close to their prey and eager to cut off escape the apparent success of the last bolt had made them cocky a ship steering wild with her oars all over the place was no threat to anyone in heartbeats the situation was transformed and the big hemitrieres emerged from the stern of the grain ship less than a stade from them their combined speeds of closing left the pirates only heartbeats to react oars in peleus roared and all along the decks the oarsmen grabbed their oars and hauled them inboard sometimes fouling each other sometimes injuring themselves desperate to get the oars clear of the imminent collision they practised this the oars began to come in all eighteen feet of oak coming across the benches until the handles rested under the opposite thwart satyrus stood straight a wild grin plastered on his face the smell of cat fur streaming off the wind and he flicked the steering oar as he had seen peleus do so that lotuss bronze beak kicked a few feet to the starboard side without a major change of direction and then their own archers fired all together his sisters body leaning into the shot like the goddess herself she nocked and shot nocked he flicked the oar back and lotuss bow moved and crashed into the oar box of the top deck of the older athenian boat so that lotuss heavy cathead ripped the light outrigger right off the side of the smaller boat and oarsmen screamed as they were snuffed out by thousands of pounds of wood and metal driven by three hundred arms inside their hull their own shattered oars ripped them to death the sharp fragments of the wood lashing like spears in the hands of giants shards of hardwood filling the hull the ends in the water driven up and up into the decks breaking bones and slashing skin while the ram crushed the outer hull and the men who had been rowing there a moment before lotus passed between her enemies and left the former athenian hull a drifting wreck while she caught many of the phoenicians oars in the water the heavyhulled phoenician didnt take the damage that the athenian did but he was labouring and before his oar master could make corrections he was turning because his starboard oars were undamaged they could hear the oar master screaming even as peleus rose to his feet oars out he roared blood in the water and silver in our hands boys and the oars shot out of the ports like the legs of a live monster as the lotus continued to coast on and on her momentum almost unchecked by the oarrake down the side of the opposing ships melitta graceful as an acrobat leaped up on the portside gunwale balanced a heartbeat and shot the phoenician oar master as he roared orders satyrus saw the other deck officers on the stricken ship staring their mouths open as his sister jumped down avoiding with athletic contempt the shafts aimed at her on my mark peleus called port side give way starboard side to reverse your benches ready about pull you bastards pull for hearth and home he raised his stick and hit the mast pull like the legs of an enormous water bug the oars dipped and pulled each side pulling in opposite directions and the deck tilted absurdly satyrus could see that the archers in the bow had stopped shooting and were hanging on to avoid being tipped over the side the heavy phoenician was wallowing in the beach swell his rowers paralysed with fear their oar master dead with a sakje barb in his voice box peleus looked down at satyrus as the ram seemed to cross the beach they were turning so fast that satyrus was afraid that they might capsize and even as he watched the marines and the archers began to pull themselves outboard to stiffen the ship led by xenophon who jumped fearlessly for the outrigger as if unaware that a missed jump meant drowning in his armour but satyrus could again feel the change as soon as his friends weight went outboard of the rail and again as other marines joined in they were above the waterline and outside the hull and still the bow came round the phoenician was almost broadsideon to them now the two ships parallel if the archers had stayed in the bow they could have fired again but all of them even his sister were hanging off the portside rail and still lotuss head came around and the beach swell caught the phoenician again and pushed her bow back men were trying to get her around but no one seemed to be in charge peleus waved to get his attention you going for the kill boy he shouted satyrus nodded his eyes fixed on the enemy ship marines get back in the bow peleus shouted we need to get the bow down and clear prepare to backwater on my command all decks satyrus wrapped both arms around the steering oar against the shock and watched his sister roll inboard like a sea nymph and bounce to her feet racing for the bows and scattering arrows from her upturned quiver and then the bow began to slide across the phoenician and peleus called the stroke the whole ship rocked as the starboardside oarsmen reversed their benches and he had to put his breastbone against the oar to keep it steady and then the first stroke fell like a hundred axes and the bow leaped forward and down as the marines dropped to the fighting deck and the rowers led by peleus began to sing the paean melitta was right in the bow pressed flat against xenophon crushing him against the breastwork of the bow where all fifteen of them were crammed in a little wooden box to weight the ram and be ready to board suddenly she had another view of the fight she had lusted for since the day began because over the scaled bronze of xenos shoulder piece she could see the white faces of the panicked foe and dead men and sharks fins already cutting the water the men in the phoenician knew they were dead and for the first time death was real to melitta their deaths and thus her own and her throat filled with bile karpos the marine captain raised his head from his forearms when we hit he said calmly you archers shoot and the rest of you dont fucking move until we know whether the ram is stuck or not i dont want any of you left behind when we pull our bronze dick out of that fucker got me he asked his voice as rough as gravel and then he was down an arrow right through his armour melitta froze in the moment of nocking an arrow lock up xenophon bellowed the marines got their heads down and the archers pressed on top of them and melitta put her cheek on the smooth bronze of xenos shoulder piece trying not to vomit because blood was spitting out of karpos on her legs the paean rose to drown his cries driving all thoughts from her mind sweat in her eyes hot moisture on her legs an arrow almost forgotten in her fingers the longest loudest crash she had ever heard the ship seemed to stop dead under her and the pressure on her gut was intense as she crushed xenophon beneath her bounced and slammed into the wooden partition at her back archers xenos voice cracked as he yelled again higher pitched but still firm archers melitta nocked without any conscious thought and her bow arm swept the deck until she saw a man in armour trying to cross the deck loose the arrow went into his shield and she had another on her string the man next to her shot and his arrow went into the shield and then there was another man in armour their own ship still pushing forward their ram under the other ships spine so that instead of holing her they were tipping the heavy phoenician over driving her starboard gunwale under the water every armed man on the pirate was surging for their bow stroke roared peleus and satyrus together fuck fuck fuck xeno said and melitta leaned past him and shot the first armoured man just a few fingers below his shield and he sank slowly to one knee the arrow buried in his thigh and then flopped into the water xeno looked back over the halfdeck and then his eyes met melittas repel boarders he yelled looking at her dont move a fucking foot off this deck he roared at an older marine the marine grinned back leaned forward and hurled a javelin at the first enemy to reach across the enemy deck was tipping fast and water was rushing to fill the phoenician he was tilted at a wicked angle and there was no hope for him and the marines javelin a heavy oldfashioned lonche went through the pirates bronzefaced shield and through the bones of his arm he bellowed and fell into the sea but there were a dozen men behind him javelins flew both ways a volley and a counter volley and then the fighting deck was full of men melitta backed away and away again using her arrows like a sakje shooting men in the face and groin when they were close enough to touch xeno who fought from behind his heavy aspis and covered her she lost track shot and shot and saw xeno take a heavy blow to his helmet she shot his opponent between the cheekpieces of his ornate thracian helmet and reached for her next arrow to find that she had none there was a scream rage and triumph and horror and when she flicked a glance to see what had happened she saw the enemy trireme turn turtle right over their ram his other rail falling on their ram with a heavy thud and a hollow sound like a temple bell so that they rocked deep men falling flat but she kept her feet xeno fell backwards into her and the last attackers desperate men surged forward and she was pinned against the back rail of the fighting platform she went for her akinakes got her hand on the horn of the hilt and knew that it was too late as the pirates axe went back a heavy bronze axe that her helmet would never turn but she pulled the knife anyway it seemed slow and the axe paused as xeno rose into its path got a hand on the haft and butted the axeman in the face with the bronze of his helmet then he fell into the space at her feet his body across karposs she had her knife out and tried to stand and then a spearhead flashed past her and caught the axeman in the throat and suddenly there was no more fighting her brother was balanced on the rail behind her weaponless and peleus stood below him with an axe of his own good throw boy peleus said his voice was hoarser than usual but otherwise he seemed calm then he crumpled like an animal at sacrifice and she could see the arrow that transfixed his lungs front to back her brother pitched forward on to the enemy dead xeno he cried xeno got his head up oh he said he was bleeding melitta looked back at the oarsmen who were cheering as they backed water satyrus she yelled into his ears youre the navarch peleus is down satyrus hadnt seen he stood up whirled his face crumpling as he saw his hero lying on the deck in a pool of lungbright blood he fought a strong desire to sit on the deck and go to sleep he sucked in a breath see to the wounded you there he pointed at a marine dont kill their wounded i want prisoners understand yes sir the marine looked ready to fall over but he stood up satyrus leaped the rail and ran down the amidships deck i need an oar master he shouted whos the man the oarsmen were not used to having their opinions asked even as they rowed heads turned and the stroke suffered satyrus didnt know the oarsmen as well as a real navarch should but he knew kleitos who though young was often sent off in the light boat kleitos had rowed with him that night in alexandria two weeks ago which now felt like another world kleitos he called he pulled the mans arm then pushed a deckhand on to the bench you are the oar master me the young man asked his jaw worked silently his eyes wide i want to turn to starboard in our own length all the way around the way peleus and kyros did it satyrus looked out over the stern plenty of room now backing water for fifty strokes had them well clear of both wrecks the lighter athenian trireme was limping away only a dozen oars going on her port side and she was turning involuntarily out to sea starboard oars kleitos said louder satyrus said starboard oars kleitos shouted he had good lungs when he used them backwater on my mark theyre already backing lad kalos said the deck master was standing by kleitos portside oars switch your benches the man called his voice was tentative and many of the oarsmen looked at kalos before obeying satyrus winced hed made a bad choice kleitos was not ready for the job but satyrus didnt have another oar master under his hand the ship tilted as ninety men shifted their weight and reversed the way they sat port side give way on my mark give way all kleitos seemed to be getting the knack of it although his orders came a little too fast and the execution was slow it didnt matter because the athenian galley hadnt made a stade since they started their turn satyrus ran aft to where a deckhand held the steering oar petrified with responsibility i have the helm he said go and see to master peleus the sailor ran off bare feet slapping the deck master kalos satyrus called ill do my best to lay us alongside that athenian i intend to come up from her stern and take her you will prepare the deck crew to board her you will go aboard with all our marines and all our deck crew and get her boatsail on her is that clear kaloss grin filled his ugly face and showed all his missing teeth youre going to take her aye navarch with the sails down satyrus could see the whole run of his deck xenophon was standing and there were three prisoners stripped of their armour being bound to the mast peleus lay in his own blood with two deckhands standing ineffectually above him master xenophon satyrus called his voice was cracking every shout he wanted to sit down and rest but they were not done yet xenophons bare feet slapped the deck as he ran to the stern sir take all the marines who can fight and support master kalos in boarding the athenian satyrus corrected his course even as kleitos ordered the starboard side rowers to pull forward again they were around perhaps the ugliest manoeuvre in the golden lotuss history but they were around satyrus leaned forward xeno can you do it secure that ship kill their oarsmen if it comes to that do i need to put another man in charge try me xeno said he grinned i got us through the boarding party so you did they embraced spontaneously a certain hard joy flowing between them and then xeno turned away and started calling for his marines and satyrus felt better suddenly he stood up aware that his shoulders had been hunched since hed thrown the spear right then he said to himself lita he called and his sister ran down the central deck he had some time in hand perhaps a hundred heartbeats until he would have to give the next order he was flying on the daimon that came to men in war and sport so full of it that his hands shook and his knees trembled but his head was clear and the world seemed to slow melitta sprinted to his side sir she said she smiled when she said it you and dorcus are the closest i have to doctors see to the arrow in peleuss lungs and the other wounded quietly he said see that he goes easy if thats what it takes lita melittas nose was pinched in an unaccustomed way and she had a tendril of snot across part of her face and blood on her forehead she used her sleeve to wipe her face ill do it she said and turned away shouting for dorcus satyrus still had time in hand and he turned to watch the macedonians the quinquereme was in the surf with her oarsmen aboard and two triremes were coming off the beach but the wind was rising from the south and west and the helmsmen were being careful satyrus felt that he had time in hand still just ahead and to port the athenian wallowed in the growing swell oarsmen beating the water ineffectually master kalos get me that boatsail rigged before you go off he said slow the stroke oar master he felt very much in control he looked at the sky and back at the beach the sailors got the boatsail rigged the stain of kyross blood like a blossom in the centre of the sail the moment it filled the golden lotus leaped forward like a warhorse changing gaits a smooth acceleration that made some of the sailors grin with pleasure while aboard the athenian trireme men pointed over the rail at them in panic satyrus put a second sailor on to help steer because at this speed she could veer wildly and he kept four of the sailors back from the boarding party to manage the sail oars in satyrus roared the athenian turned away yawing wide at the last minute but satyrus had seen the helmsman move his hands and he was on the athenians stern his ram under the athenians port side in a few heartbeats and the athenians rowers panicked fleeing their benches to avoid the second oar rake and in the confusion xenophon leaped across the narrowing gap alone on to the enemy deck he landed rose to his feet and knocked the enemy helmsman unconscious in one continuous motion and then faced the enemy trierarch grapples flew from all along the lotuss deck and the sailors were over the side flooding the enemy rowing deck just a few feet away the enemy trierarch and xenophon faced off xenophon made a simple fake and then cut overarm at the top of the athenians shield his opponent took the blow on his shield and pushed forward knocking xenophon to the deck effortlessly he towered over the prostrate young man and raised his spear melitta shot her arrow rose on the breeze a shot that had to pass the length of the ships past ropes and rigging and hulls and rails and fell from its apogee as if guided by athenas hand to bury itself in the mercenarys thigh a handspan above his greave the man fell to one knee and xeno was up the mercenary parried parried again using his spear with desperate skill he tried to rise to his feet and failed fell in his own blood and still managed to block xenophons death stroke he rolled over red blood from his thigh wound dripping from his fine bronze cuirass and got back up on one knee xenophon stepped back and saluted him and the mercenary laughed and returned the salute then turned it into a cut xenophon parried but now he had a long red line on his sword arm during the pause kalos had stepped up behind the athenian with a deck maul after the salutes were done kalos struck hitting the athenian hard in the side of the head the man went down satyrus was able to breathe again and under his breath he offered a prayer to athena and to herakles for preserving xenophon who for all his skill was clearly outmatched after the athenian trierarch went down the athenian ship offered no fight at all the swell was increasing out away from the beach and it was all their portside oarsmen could do to keep them bowon to the waves which were twice the height theyd been ten minutes before satyrus dropped back and then put his ram under the athenians stern with a far more threatening crash than he had intended but he got it done and the rest of the marines and sailors were across in a single long peal of thunder follow me and may poseidon send we make it satyrus called try and keep their navarch alive kalos waved and satyrus could hear him bellowing orders could see the athenian marines being disarmed in the bow xeno with his helmet off pouring water on a wound he ranged alongside with the wind in his brailedup boatsail alone and his archers covered the decks there was no more resistance kalos had the athenian boatsail mast up before the waves turned to whitecaps and then he was scudding away the athenian trireme was damaged but with the wind now directly astern she went well enough and kalos had time to reorganize the rowers captives now satyrus watched the quinquereme come off the beach and start to pull into the waves two unemployed oarsmen brought peleus to sit in the stern he was as white as newscraped parchment and blood dribbled from his mouth but he was alive melitta and dorcus had washed him and cut the arrow shaft at the wound so that he could rest against things the fact that the shaft hadnt been withdrawn told satyrus everything master peleus satyrus sat on his heels holding the oar trying to hear the helmsman as his lips moved peleus raised his head beautiful he said then he said need to get on the beach now if you were hale master we could have a go at the big ship satyrus found that his cheeks were wet what do you mean on the beach storm peleus said satyrus looked out to sea and knew that the helmsman was right fucking beautiful peleus said he had himself up on an elbow and he could just see over the stern two to one under the eyes of the enemy he laughed and the laugh turned to a gurgle and a spray of blood peleuss eyes caught satyruss and the younger man could see that the older was going could all but see his shade pulling free of his body storm coming peleus said then with enormous effort tell rhodos he slumped then and satyrus thought he was gone he turned to watch over his stern the storm was coming from the sea moving so fast that he could see the bowshaped front and feel the drop in temperature out to seaward there was a line like a line of fog but satyrus knew it was a squall line landward the quinquereme had already abandoned the chase he was backing into the heavy surf even as they rounded laodikea head and the beach full of macedonian ships vanished around the point they were sailing fast so fast that a moments inattention caused the hull to tremble like a dog on a leash and sway they were overhauling the captured athenian hand over fist now that they had the sail well set they passed within an oars length and sailed on the edge of the storm carrying them as fast as a galley dared to sail they cleared the rocks north of laodikea head and then the next bay to the north in minutes im going for it satyrus said he was speaking to peleus whose eyes still had life in them there was no one else to talk to kleitos was busy with his new responsibilities and melitta was forward with the archers im going to try to beach right here and make it through the night peleus nodded startling him good boy he said satyrus hadnt been at sea his whole life but hed seen storms he prayed that this one would follow the usual pattern a lull just before the front came in master kleitos he called kleitos came up i intend to beach us stern first on the next beach see her satyrus pointed over the starboard bow and kleitos looked blank when i order the boatsail down you must have all the oarsmen ready one quarter circle turn to port and then back oars for their lives satyrus mimed the manoeuvre with his hands kleitos nodded but his eyes showed no understanding repeat it to me satyrus urged when you drop the boatsail quarter turn to seaward and back him into the surf kleitos said he didnt sound as if he believed it pass that word to every man no relying on orders at the last minute got me aye navarch kleitoss eyes were dull he was already exhausted by the effort of command satyrus grabbed an oarsman whats your name man diokles lord satyrus started recognizing the man from the night in alexandria diokles can you take the steering oar satyrus had seen diokles with peleus often enough if they were friends the man had to be competent hed been in charge of the watch diokles reached out and took the heavy oar i have the helm he said his voice was thick foreign and raspy he looked down at peleus who gave a very short nod heartbeats until they were in the surf so much to do you have the helm satyrus said and went forward he found the four sailors on my command bring the boatsail down down flat understand nothing to catch the wind too much information he could see it on their faces we know our business navarch the oldest said he gave a lopsided smile no worries lad he whispered hoarsely he went back aft found that diokles had been cheating the bow in towards the beach a nice job of steering they had a great deal of way on them in fact satyrus wasnt sure but that this was the fastest hed ever moved in his life satyrus watched the shore so close and took a deep breath he glanced at the athenian galley did they have a chance of duplicating his motions they were both angling towards the beach just short of the breakers the rising increasingly angry breakers satyrus ordered golden lotus parallel to the beach waiting for the lull praying for it the squall line was ten stades away and coming like a cavalry charge a flaw in the wind the sail cracked and swayed drop the boatsail he called then he watched as diokles leaned his whole weight on the steering oar and satyrus stood amidships willing the bow to turn out to sea to get headon to the swell poseidon let us live drop the wind the rowers response was as crisp as could be they turned the quarter circle in the time it took for two breakers to roll under their stern so much pressure on the backing oars that satyrus could see the shafts bend under the strain and then they were backing water oars dragging on the gravel of the beach and the stern was carried high and came down with a heavy thump the whole manoeuvre was near perfect but now the trials of the day showed the lotus had almost no deck crew to leap ashore and steady the stern and the sea pounded the bow relentlessly kleitos called a stroke on his own initiative so that the bow oars that could still bite steadied the ship sternwards oarsmen started to leap over the sides which lightened the ship so that he drove higher up the beach and the bow caught a wave and almost swept in but there were just enough oars in the water and just enough strong backs in the surf to drag the hull a few feet higher and then a few more the ship was diagonal across the grain of the beach but now the hull was empty and before the next breaker could seize the ram and push it in to break his back two hundred men and two women were pulling and the whole blacktarred hull shot up the beach half his length it wasnt pretty in fact the whole manoeuvre swirled at the edge of confusion chaos and failure but then the lotus was on the sand and upright and there was a strong cheer the athenian wasnt so lucky he made his turn with style and his oarsmen knew their lives depended on their rowing and kalos had redistributed rowers and oars to get men on both sides but their backingwater was clumsy and the athenian ship came in on the crest of a heavy breaker just as the storm hit a wave broke over the bow pushing it up the beach out of control exhaustion and broken spirit cost them precious seconds as the rowers lost their stroke and the ship flooded amidships but kalos had friends ashore he had the deck crew they had ropes over the side before the trireme could broach and the two hundred men ashore were not willing to lose their prize to poseidon when they were so close and they pulled and pulled again hauling the damaged ship ashore and out of the clutches of the storm the ship fell over on its side spilling the water it had taken and dumping rowers in the surf but the howling wind gave the stern a push and the next wave lifted the bow as kalos roared heave like poseidon come to life and the balance changed the athenian hull groaned but he went up the beach the length of a horse and again on the next wave as the last of the oarsmen scrambled out and once more lifting the ram clear of the waves three hundred men pulling together drenched by the lashing rain and then they sank to their haunches on the wet sand they were ashore and alive satyrus lay panting on the rainslick sand a rope end still clutched in his hands he was ready to go to sleep but a crisp voice in his head said not through yet boy he forced himself to his feet and walked to where peleus lay the helmsman had died during the last manoeuvre satyrus closed his eyes and whispered a prayer then he stood up and pulled his cloak around him in the rain master xenophon he called secure the prisoners lets get a sail up in the lee of he looked around there was no lee they were on a beach that swept from horizon to horizon and only the towering cliffs a few stades inland promised any cover at all melitta took his arm there are caves she said pointing sail up to cover the cave entrance melitta will take you there injured men under cover first the orders flowed out of him like water from a spring as if peleus was giving them kalos was calling his men to action kleitos was kneeling in the sand shaking his head diokles gave satyrus a look punctuated by lightning and satyrus nodded all right you lot diokles shouted satyrus stayed upright until the last men were in the caves the sand underfoot was dry and the fires of driftwood were roaring and it was all he could do to speak his cloak was heavy with water and the wind howled and if the surf came up any higher they would lose the trireme and he couldnt do anything about it he wanted to keep on moving keep on commanding because now that he had time to think all he wanted to do was weep he stood there alone in the storm water streaming off his face and his sodden chlamys lightning pulsed and flashed and thunder roared louder than a hundred rams hitting a hundred hulls kalos came up to him inside sir he shouted over the wind and the thunder he pulled satyrus by the arm and they went through the flapping boatsail that covered the caves entrance and suddenly it was warm satyrus stumbled and almost fell the whole cave was full of men lying so close that they looked like the amphorae that a merchant ship carried as cargo the fire not the first this cave had known and the heat of more than three hundred bodies made satyrus shed his cloak try this lad kalos said diokles came up and pushed a heavy blackware mug into his hands it was too dark to see what was in it so satyrus took a sip kykeon full of cheese and wine the wine went through him like an electric shock the taste of honey and the tartness of the wine were the finest things hed ever had finish it diokles said in his raspy voice he smiled briefly and then as if that smile took too much effort his face went blank again satyrus slumped into an open space near the cave mouth he fell asleep with the mug still warm in his hand farther down the cave melitta was entwined with xenophon wrapped around him for warmth and for the emotional protection of his familiar body she wanted to sleep but her thoughts ran around and around her head the way an exhausted child will run around and around screaming she saw her brother come into the cave and she knew in the flicker of firelight what he would look like when he was thirty or perhaps fifty you saved my life xenophon said out of the darkness his voice sounded different and he didnt make it like a flat statement but as if he was trying to make out a puzzle you saved mine too she said she shrugged but it was single combat xeno said he was better than i melitta wriggled seeking to get a stone out from under her hip he misinterpreted her wriggle and wriggled back no it wasnt melitta said you had to face the helmsman he was in armour and the mercenary and perhaps half a dozen sailors so it was a general action i shot because it was my duty to shoot it was a wonderful shot xeno said this time it was he who shrugged and she who thought that it was a wriggle and she wriggled back i was lying on my back waiting for death so like homer and i saw the arrow go into his thigh just above my head and i thought melitta shot that this was the praise that melitta wanted it had been the best shot of her life i killed a few men today she said somewhere between bragging and sobbing unsure what to make of those deaths feeling mortal herself me too xenophon said he rolled over to face her in a moment she rolled over too and at some point when most of the oarsmen were snoring their wriggles of discomfort and embraces of support changed rhythm and became something else it wasnt the romantic idyll that melitta had imagined with her buttocks trapped against a stone and three hundred possible witnesses and yet it was we shouldnt do this xenophon said when it was far too late to change their minds part v polishing bc t he athenian trireme had seen action and his expensive phoenician consort was missing but he was rowing strongly as he passed the foundations to the new lighthouse and his owner might have been forgiven for feeling a twinge of pride hed watched for that ship for two weeks and there he was one more piece falling into place stratokles leaned on the stone wall that edged his rented garden fondling the scar tissue at the end of his shortened nose as he watched the familiar athenian shape fold his oars to meet the harbour boat he nodded well pleased the ship had been at sea long enough to temper the oarsmen and now they responded like professionals then calling to his slaves he dressed in a plain chlamys called for lucius and his guards and headed for the waterfront i need some luck the problem with spying with almost all forms of subterfuge is that it was hard to trust anyone and harder to find the person who could be trusted and still be clever enough to carry out orders his guard captain lucius was a capable fighter but not a thinker or not the kind of thinker who could compete with leon and diodorus i need news he needed to know that the olbian boy was dead hed seen this sort of thing before where a minor issue in a plan began to develop a life of its own satyrus had become such an issue stratokles shook his head because the children were such a side issue i need iphicrates stratokles had spent long days negotiating with macedonians hard men who despised ptolemy only a little more than they despised cassander or antigonus oneeye they despised stratokles utterly and they didnt always hide their contempt iphicrates can deal with them i shouldnt even have met them even as he walked stratokles made a gesture with his hand a sort of peasant gesture to avert evil but in his lexicon it meant that he was conscious of having made a mistake i hate macedonians iphicrates might be sullen and secretive but he was a brilliant fighter and a man who the macedonians would accept as a negotiator fools and thugs every one and he needed iphicrates to fight back against leon and his minions that black bastard has everything stratokles thought good subordinates time money fuck him im smarter and ill pull this thing off with my bare hands if i have to stratokles had endured a month of humiliations as his household servants were hounded and beaten his slaves stolen his house vandalized a punitive raid by leons mercenaries had all but destroyed one of the criminal associations he had hired and now only a handful of desperate men would take his coin dont go soft shortnose he told himself the endless friction of the job was getting to him and he stopped on the wharf to take a deep breath and look around him he was close very close to suborning ptolemys senior officers no time for selfpity now his plan and the future of athens needed him to keep a steady hand on the tiller and it wasnt all doom and gloom despite growing frictions between cassander and ptolemy he had lulled the court with his tales of a summer campaign against cassander by oneeye and managed to convince the lord of aegypt to ship a full taxeis of his veterans away to macedonia and he had demanded and gained a declaration of independence for the citystates of old greece a political statement that would muddy the waters at home and help athens in fifty different ways demetrios of phaleron would smile in delight the oligarchic bastard athens i will yet free you he thought then he grinned out loud he said athens i will free you if i have to sacrifice every one of these bastards to do it that made him feel better it was time to repay cassander for two years of slights and indignities time to play his hand for himself and athens cassander was losing his touch and he wasnt going to be the winning side stratokles needed athens to be on the winning side powerful on the winning side to get what he needed and make athens free so he had begun carefully to exchange letters with antigonus oneeye ensuring himself a soft and feathered nest when he jumped when athens jumped he would take a satrapy preferably phrygia phrygia would make a useful springboard for athens a capable ally a market for goods and he had an eye on the perfect wife for the satrap of phrygia a fine child the only heir of the euxines second or third most powerful city amastris of heraklea all he needed was one last brilliant thrust and a little astute kidnapping in most ways an easier mission than playing all three corners between cassander oneeye and ptolemy the mutiny of the macedonians that would paralyze ptolemy whether the doctor was successful or not always have a second line of plans stratokles thought while fingering his beard and a third line if you can manage it then hed board that ship and leave before ptolemy discovered how thoroughly he had been bought and sold the athenian grinned and thought again of his employee the doctor if cassander was paying the doctor stratokles thought that he might do well to avoid the man even if he had been the doctors patron because soon enough cassander would realize that stratokles had changed horses and then the doctor would come after him and then it came to him the master stroke that would sweep the board he actually stopped walking in the middle of the posideion and stood still as the wonder of the idea filled him shortnose youre the smartest bastard in all the circle of the world stratokles beat his own ship to the piers and spent an uncomfortable ten minutes waiting around for the trireme to come alongside he couldnt afford to draw the attention of the guards at this point he didnt mind if people associated his ship with the death of the olbian boy but he didnt want the link too plain he felt the frustration of a man on the edge of a great success who has to depend on the whims of fate but the guards on the piers were busy checking bills of lading or collecting bribes from merchants none spared him a glance finally the athenian trireme turned in for the pier her oars shot in a beautiful manoeuvre and she coasted along just barely moving so that her helmsman only had to make a single turn to spend the last of her momentum stratokles didnt know that voice he froze the athenian trireme embraced the pier like an old friend with scarcely a sound iphicrates had never handled the ship with such elegance or without a lot of swearing somethings wrong stratokles said to his guards he walked quickly to the sternward edge of the pier iphicrates he called show yourself he waited a moment as marines put a plank over the gunwale back to your places he called best let me go first lucius said stratokles shook his head no he said i need to know whats going on if iphicrates is hurt he shook his head fuck this he leaped on to the plank whos in command here momentum carried him two steps up the stern after the shock of recognition struck him those were not his officers standing in the stern he reached for his sword and that boy he leaped back on to the docks rolled without tangling his cloak and came to his feet secure that man xenophon the boy barked stratokles owed his life to the fact that the men on his ship his ship were as stunned as he he gathered his guards and ran and the marines didnt get another sight of him all the way back to his house stratokles tried to see how this could have happened and what the ramifications were the loss of his ship was a serious blow that ship meant mobility and freedom and a last bolthole if things went spectacularly wrong just short of his gate stratokles shook his head as if hed been in a conversation with another man he put his hand out and stopped his guards lucius wait stratokles pointed at the house we dont know thats safe he rubbed his chin no they cant have got word here yet have to move fast get all the slaves all the chests and the cash load it on the slaves fast as you can go lucius was a man used to obeying and he leaped into action barking orders at the other guards most of them keltoi or iberians in less than an hour they stripped stratokles residence of cash and belongings made a train of his slaves and some hastily hired porters and vanished to his bolthole that is to one of his boltholes stratokles fought for calm acceptance but he was angry what the fuck could have happened he asked lucius more important what do i do now lucius shrugged anything that got old iphicrates he muttered and shrugged weve got horses lets head out across the desert you said yourself that most of your damage was done and that gabines was on to you stratokles stood still in the street breathing hard but then he shook his head no he said no we wont cut and run not yet im this close to burying ptolemy for ever ill stand my ground for now lucius shook his head well im with you then he said lets get this done when he was standing in the courtyard of his safe house a shithole taverna hed purchased in the unfashionable southeast quarter he breathed easier despite the stink of the tannery next door think it through he said to himself terrified slaves put bales of his goods down in the courtyard stratokles snapped his fingers and two of his guards stepped forward pay them well stratokles said the expense was ruinous but he couldnt afford the betrayal of a slave at this point a young gaulish woman with a yellow bruise that covered the left side of her face turned and bolted fearing something in his voice and guessing incorrectly she ran out of the courtyard a sixyearold child at her side two of his best went off in pursuit athena stratokles protested to the heavens zeus soter i intended no impiety he stopped imploring the heavens as it scared the slaves to lucius he said see to it we have no more runners the rest of the slaves huddled together as if by closeness they could achieve protection against the swords like the sheep in the tannery luciuss men herded them into their new quarters and put a bar across their door before the shadows grew longer the smaller of his guards returned from the chase with a smug look on his face and a head in a sack a head with blond braids and the child stratokles asked the man looked around never saw a child he said stratokles shook his head she had a child the man blinked never saw a child he said maybe dolgu saw the brat stratokles stifled his annoyance fine send dolgu to me when he returns in the meantime go and buy me two new slaves in the market and get this courtyard cleaned and arrange to send this note to the doctor the usual way the doctor was comfortably ensconced at the palace and would only communicate via codes he had a new plan it lacked the endless vistas of beauty of the former plan but it would serve its simplicity was its beauty he would continue to foment the mutiny that was too easy cassander wanted the macedonians in macedon and they all wanted to go home no need for deep planning there the new wrinkle was that he would use his tools to kill ptolemy and then when antigonus strolled into the ensuing chaos stratokles would use him to free athens you want me to take the boys and have a go at leons men lucius asked the big italian was eating an apple no stratokles said no leons a sideshow the children are a sideshow if the doctor can get them well and good but im done with such stuff we work the macedonians and then we decamp lucius finished his apple right down to the seeds for what its worth i agree we cant fight everyone thats just what i think stratokles said y ou have a prisoner leon said where welcome home nihmu said she smiled sleepily diodorus came through the adjoining house door with a sword in his hand in the name of all the gods he said and then he lowered the sword coenus was right behind him satyrus he grinned then carefully like a man who fears to speak a bad thing lest it become true is my is everyone well xenophon is standing in the courtyard with a file of marines and one of stratokles people wrapped in a rug satyrus grinned he couldnt help it then sobered he nodded to leon peleus is dead leon threw a chlamys over his naked shoulders while sappho ordered torches and lamps lit i dont suppose you could have warned us you were coming and youre still under exile young man he gave satyrus a hug so youve taken a ship on the sea and lost me the best helmsman on poseidons blue waters i assume theres a story philokles appeared from the darkness of the doorway coenus your son is outside with a rug on his shoulder he said satyrus smiled at philokles and then looked at the man again the change was profound for having been gone just a month the spartan had lost weight he moved differently he stepped up and put his arms around satyrus i missed you boy he said theron came in from diodoruss house pulling a chiton over his head i should have known that it was you he said by way of greeting do you know what hour it is but he too had to give satyrus a crushing hug all together they went out into leons broad courtyard where six marines stood easily with their shields resting on the ground and their spears planted buttspike first in the gravel when they saw leon they all stood straighter xenophon put his burden carefully on the ground and bowed sir he said leon crossed his arms lets hear the story he said satyrus started telling it servants brought wine while he talked and he was on his second cup by the time he got to the fight off syria and the long night of the storm the next morning demetrios could have had us with ten children and a sling he said he shrugged and handed the wine cup to xenophon who took a slug and gave a belch we slept late and all the guards went to sleep three hundred of us in a cave with the ships out on the beach like a signal he shrugged but the gods protected us or demetrios is a fool he motioned at the rug none of the prisoners know much they worked for this athenian mercenary they had orders to find us and take us this one seemed to be in command kalos hit him hard and hes been comatose for days he needs a doctor philokles motioned to xenophon rolling an injured man in a rug is not actually a way to heal him lets see him xeno placed his burden on the ground he was a fine fighter id like him to live together with philokles he unrolled the rug philokles gazed at the unconscious man in the torchlight for a long moment well well he said diodorus stooped over the man and then stood up look what the cat dragged in he said i thought he was dead coenus added hera protect us all put him in my room we need a doctor philokles said this is beyond me leon looked puzzled i dont know him he turned to his steward fetch us diodorus shook his head wait clear the courtyard he turned around trust me get everyone out of here marines to the kitchens get yourself some wine he looked back at leon and made a sign friends only he said xeno can stay coenus said and the twins sappho said satyrus thought that he was on the edge of some great secret all his life hed seen them act like this as if some sacred bond called them all together demetrios is in nabataea melitta said out of the air and none of his ship commanders had the balls to come out after us she reached out and took the wine cup from xenophon they glanced at each other for a moment too long a moment as far as satyrus was concerned what in hades then she looked at diodorus who is he nabataea leon asked he was standing like a man about to run a race let me make sure i understand this demetrios son of oneeye is on the beaches of syria with two hundred ships and his army is in nabataea and you can prove these things melitta was being embraced by all of her uncles and she was in sapphos embrace when she said prove it we have two hundred witnesses if leons oarsmen can be trusted leon and philokles could be seen to exchange a long look philokles shook his head in answer to some unvoiced question from leon we need to go to ptolemy right now every heartbeat counts what about the athenian leon asked he was rubbing his beard who is he hes leosthenes philokles replied in a low voice he led the revolt of the mercenaries against alexander and helped beat antipater in the lamian war hes dead leon said then in a whisper is he one of us philokles shook his head diodorus disagreed he was too political to take the oath but he was a friend of kineas a fickle man i heard that he survived the lamian war and changed his name but im still surprised what the hell was he doing working for stratokles coenus asked diodorus shook his head i can only guess that when cassander took athens five years back leosthenes went with what he thought was the lesser of the evils say what you like about stratokles gentlemen hes a loyal athenian we chose ptolemy coenus said nodding sappho bent over the prone man we could ask him when he recovers in the meantime leaving him to lie on the stones of our courtyard is unlikely to save him we almost had stratokles on the docks satyrus said he didnt really understand who the unconscious man was but he thought that they needed to know the whole story that took more explanation when they were done barking questions at him philokles rubbed his chin stratokles will bolt he said into a hole diodorus said regardless this is the moment to crush his influence at court and sting the macedonian faction into action leon said except that we could be fighting demetrios any moment coenus said wheres the lotus lad leon asked satyrus south coast of crete she ought to be homeward bound by now satyrus said i thought that i could surprise well everyone if i came in the prize and peleuss last wish was that the rhodians be informed leon nodded fair enough ill order that athenian trireme into the yards not a bad hull if a little knocked about and get to sea myself in hyacinth im for the coast of syria ill come with you satyrus said philokles shook his head no he said i have work for you here im in exile satyrus said we need to go to ptolemy anyway philokles said are we done plotting sappho asked she waved at the slaves peering out of the door come along my dears gently with the poor man we have to keep him a secret diodorus hissed nihmu gave him a raised eyebrow and his wife poked him in the side as she went by keep who a secret dear she asked we need to go to ptolemy now philokles said or its all rumour in the morning tonight well have his whole attention grumpy attention diodorus put in philokles frowned his face like an actors mask in the torchlight weve heard about all this for a month but no firm evidence and always stratokles whispering to ptolemy that its all a feint he raised an eyebrow and looked at satyrus we have even started training the new phalanx satyrus is still in exile leon muttered as if just remembering the fact now philokles said we have to go now herakles deified tit ptolemy growled this had better be good leon shuffled satyrus had never seen his uncle so nervous and it suddenly struck him that this was no easy triumph if leon was frightened then there was something about which satyrus should be frightened the ruler of aegypt was wearing a chiton of transparent wool that showed far too much of his ageing body he had a garland of drooping grape leaves around his head but his gaze was steady you boy he asked looking straight at satyrus gentlemen i thought that we had an agreement philokles stood forward i think you had best hear this story yourself then judge us ptolemy nodded on your head be it who tells the tale leon shuffled and satyrus started forward but philokles held his ground we sent satyrus to sea stratokles of athens sent ships to follow him philokles was a trained orator and his arm came up and his stance changed subtly and his diction became slower and clearer he dropped his voice and the hall became quieter and men leaned forward to hear him speak satyrus took the golden lotus to cyprus and stratokles ships followed him there he fled to rhodos and the pirates followed him rhodos is under blockade by oneeyes fleet thats news but what follows is worse satyrus saw the fleet of young demetrios on the beaches of syria two hundred ships of war and as many transports even the guards behind the throne made a noise silence ptolemy roared he had been standing now he sat on the pear wood and ivory chair that he used for informal receptions he held out his hand and a slave put a silver goblet into it how do you know that these ships belonged to the athenian ambassador ptolemy asked for a month many voices have told me that oneeye was coming here always the same voices ill add now you have found hard evidence satyrus didnt want to be stopped lord we fought and took the athenians galley anyone in this room will know it in the harbour if that is not evidence enough we have his sailing master and his marines and his oarsmen too since the room was still silent he said everywhere my ship went he followed me ptolemys eyes widened he nodded you wouldnt lie to me boy he asked with deep cynicism i swear it on my fathers grave and on on the lion skin of herakles my patron satyrus wondered what had moved him to say that the god at his shoulder he hoped ptolemy turned to his guards get me the athenian he said lets see what he has to say for himself diodorus stood forth ill bet you a silver owl to an obol that hes gone bag and baggage and slaves philokles began to fidget and leon grimaced and stood his ground it was a long halfhour diodorus yawned over and over stop that ptolemy insisted yawning himself he laughed when he said it and the tension dropped a little a pair of guards came back into the megaron and whispered to gabines who whispered in ptolemys ear so ptolemy said he rubbed his chin hes gone just as you predicted unless you did him in yourself dont tell me you aint capable of it odysseus ptolemy was looking at diodorus who nodded i am diodorus said but i havent fuck ptolemy said it wasnt very regal he looked around the room clear the room he said to gabines they stay and you and seleucus seleucus satyrus whispered to leon another player in alexanders funeral games leon whispered he lost his army at babylon fighting antigonus and he came here and offered his sword to ptolemy the man called seleucus went and stood on the raised platform by ptolemys chair a pair of the cavalry companions the hetairoi ptolemys most trusted troops came in from the barracks and stood by the chair satyrus knew both of them men diodorus liked so ptolemy said he looked around demetrios is coming gentlemen were not in good shape no one said anything to deny this assertion gabines how reliable are my macedonian troops ptolemy asked i wouldnt risk a field battle gabines replied although if i may be so bold lord it is demetrios an unknown youth not old oneeye in person he would be a far greater threat both as a general and as a figurehead seleucus nodded he was a short man with the legs of a cavalryman and the speech of a macedonian noble oneeye has the king that is young herakles and cassander has the other unless hes murdered him most of your macedonians wouldnt face herakles or alexander iv in battle but young demetrios has neither of the kings how many troops will demetrios have ptolemy asked twenty thousand infantry forty elephants seleucus answered good cavalry so if we could make our infantry fight we could outmatch him ptolemy said he looked at diodorus youre awfully quiet for you diodorus yawned again im just old ptolemy but it seems to me that if we launch our army at demetrios we roll the dice if we sit here in alexandria he rolls the dice seleucus nodded i agree the disappearance of stratokles will panic the extremists in the macedonian faction gabines said expect defections ptolemy shook his head as if to clear it cassander was doubledealing me i still find that hard to stomach if i go down antigonus and his golden child get aegypt how on earth can that profit cassander seleucus shrugged i dont waste time worrying too much what a man like cassander thinks he said demetrios is here now if we can keep your army together he may make a mistake how do we keep the army together diodorus looked at philokles by pretending nothing has happened except the news that demetrios is marching here that by itself should drown all other noise in the agora where is leon ptolemy asked putting to sea to keep watch on demetrioss fleet philokles said ptolemy nodded sharply and stood you boy he said pointing at satyrus keep your head down understand me boy i have work for him with the phalanx philokles said ptolemy nodded i can accept that he looked around no talk of this anyone if stratokles surfaces we deal with it otherwise let the plotters plot eh when any of them is ready to defect i wish to know gabines nodded ptolemy looked around well then i suppose well try to fight this golden boy and his forty elephants athena of the victories be with us he turned to seleucus ready to march in ten days pass the word and see how they react diodorus saluted as did coenus satyrus slept for a whole day and then the reaction hit him the killing the fighting left him feeling nothing and then it left him feeling like a stranger his body seemed strange his thoughts or lack of them seemed strange the accomplishment of commanding a ship seemed a small thing the death of peleus loomed large his sister came and went she babbled about riding and said something about xeno as if her infatuation for his best friend needed to be discussed he listened to her without hearing a word said what he hoped were the right things in return and she went away the third morning he felt no better so he drank some wine and that seemed to help he just kept reliving his decisions when to turn the ship when to fight he saw too many ways he could have done it spurofthemoment improvization was revealed as boyish bravado his sister came and he listened to her and then drank more wine and that helped too kallista came closed the curtain at his door and kissed him he stiffened immediately and she caught his erection with a practised hand have your attention she asked mmm he answered she was not melting into his arms philokles has been around several times asking for you and everyone in this house is girding for war and you are sulking like achilles she relinquished her hold on his body and he pawed at her and she shrugged him off with a laugh and walked out through his curtain leaving him feeling like a boy he sat on the floor depressed and ashamed of all his many weaknesses and then he found another amphora of wine and then philokles came stand up philokles said he was taller than usual at least viewed from the floor hed added muscle to his chest and his paunch was almost gone satyrus obeyed im a little drunk he slurred youll understan im sure theres work to be done philokles said his voice was kind satyrus couldnt meet philokles eye i am sorry because you slobbered at kallista or because you got peleus killed philokles was clean and sober most men would grab kallistas tits if they could and any man worth his stones would have to think hard after he ordered men to their deaths thats good however your time for such thoughts is over stop wallowing get up the worlds going to hell and we have work to do youre the philosopher philokles and the hoplomachos the best spear in alexandria and im just a boy there it was said he felt better and took a little wine philokles went and sat on the bed he had military sandals on and a chitoniskos the undergarment to armour he was dressed for war he rubbed his chin and then nodded im here to get you moving and bring you out of this its tempting to tell you a couple of lies and get your heart beating again he shrugged and raised an eyebrow but youre a man not a child twenty men died peleus and nineteen others i want satyrus bit his lip i did not do much of the fighting he said you want to be forgiven philokles face was the mask of ares there is no forgiveness satyrus none just the next task you are as brave as you need to be and your fears about your courage are foolish philokles said but you can prove yourself brave if you like come and stand your ground with me in the phalanx beside me in the front rank satyrus nodded yes he said willing to try he drew a breath very well he said it came out pretty well so thats the next task i took that for granted as you dont appear an ingrate and you are a citizen it will mean that you wont ride with the hippeis frankly youre not a trained cavalryman and it will help me keep you hidden i believe that stratokles will hunt you and the factions itll be open fighting soon anyway but you have friends dozens of friends young men who go to the gymnasium fight on the palaestra run the races i want them you want them are you the commander satyrus thought that philokles would make a very good commander hmm i am the real commander alongside a dozen old mercenaries right now some of the macedonian faction have managed to put a man over me i need your friends i need two ranks of spirited brave athletic young men you have a week philokles smiled some of them will die he said satyrus took a deep breath how many philokles sneered how many will die ask a prophet how many do you need satyrus shot back philokles rubbed his chin and deflated a hundred more or less satyrus laughed thats every prosperous hellene in alexandria the whole young set at cimons philokles nodded i rather expected you to start at the gymnasium satyrus took a deep breath leons marines philokles nodded ours as soon as they return theyre watching the approaches at sea thats where i expect to get my fileclosers satyrus interested reached into a cedar trunk for his own chitoniskos sailors philokles scratched his cheek he didnt look at all like the mask of ares what are you some kind of democrat you have aegyptians right satyrus took a sponge from a basin and tried to clean himself he was still partly drunk but he felt that if he stopped moving he would fall back into the pit philokles shrugged some sailors but right now every ship with a fighting ram is at sea watching for oneeye or his son satyrus brushed his hair roughly forcing the horsehair brush through his own as if to punish his transgressions he put on short thracian boots and a cloak put a straw hat on his head and picked up a hunting spear first he said i need to apologize to kallista philokles nodded that might be a virtuous act he said we drill all day at the sea wall not that we accomplish much the aegyptians have had all the war spirit beaten from them they go through the motions like slaves philokles came and suddenly embraced satyrus then he stepped back with his hands on the younger mans shoulders fighting in the phalanx is messy he said everything depends on the first two ranks everything satyrus nodded ill be there right next to me can you keep my spear side safe philokles stepped away you trained me spartan satyrus grinned the expression used muscles in his face he hadnt used in days see you dont embarrass me then the spartan said satyrus walked into his sisters rooms announced by dorcus he embraced his sister and apologized all at once i didnt listen to a word you said he pronounced she looked terrible pale and worried but she smiled for him im your sister stupid i dont need apologies she hugged him nonetheless satyrus kissed her and they leaned their foreheads against each other for a moment thanks to the gods melitta said i really thought you were gone the veritable black pit of despair part of me is still there he said quietly but philokles gave me something to do acting is so much easier than thinking he hoped that didnt sound too bitter actions have consequences she said her eyes flicked away i keep learning that he said she was hurting too he could see it but he couldnt imagine what it was about im off to cimons to recruit an army a drunk lecherous army she said brightly nice of philokles to find something for you ill just sit here and weave or something youre not a lot better off than i am satyrus said no im not melitta said and now that youre back from the land of the dead i may just go there come and talk to me promise id be happy to help satyrus said in a whisper and then louder wheres kallista he already smelled her perfume right here said the avatar of aphrodite dressed in white and perfumed she was almost too much to look at she offered him an embrace but he took one of her hands pressed it to his forehead and bowed my apologies kallista i was weak and behaved badly hah kallista drew him into an embrace men she smiled and gave him a very unsisterly kiss one of these days young man he flushed but she embraced him again and then gently pushed him away he found that he had an oyster shell in his hand i should go he said hurriedly fooling no one go then his sister said something going on there she looked caged almost desperate and he owed her whats wrong he asked nothing she said get out of my rooms before you burst relieved he went only when he was outside in the courtyard did he think of her look at xeno and how close the two of them had become on board ship but then his whole mind went to the oyster shell in his hand the message inside the shell said lord ptolemy speaks highly of you and your sister and i will soon be moved to invite her to visit the man who brings her might receive a reward he went out of the courtyard singing a hymn to aphrodite the fear of pregnancy stalked melittas sleep and her every waking hour the loss of her virginity troubled her very little sakje girls did as they pleased and she laughed at the posturing of greek women but the consequence loomed and she listened to the music of her body with the avidity of a newcomer to the world of the body and it carried tales every rumbling of her stomach frightened her every itch every feeling in her genitals every change in her skin a chance comment in the market your hair is richer today my lady sent her into depression her lover xeno was worse than useless vacillating between fear and wonder at what he had done and a strong desire to do it again and she had a hard time recapturing any of the feeling of the ship about him in alexandria he seemed a strong boy with a tan and she feared that his obvious looks would give them away and that the consequences would rule their lives she wasnt going to marry xeno she was going to be queen of the assagatje while her brother was still drinking himself into courage after coming back such a fuss for so little xeno went away again when the hyacinth went to sea to watch for the enemy fleet and she was left in peace until her brother walked out with a foolish oyster shell in his fist and kallista turned to her are you pregnant she asked in a materoffact voice she did wait until dorcus was clear of the room in a matter of minutes she told everything she wept in kallistas arms until the hetaira made clucking noises not the lover id have chosen for you but hades at least hes clean and your own age by your own will melitta had to smile at that i did all the work she said kallista shook her head i can imagine boys all the same was it fun melitta shrugged yes no yes it was didnt hurt at all none of that but so little for so much worry kallista made a face dont say too much of that honey bee men hate that she frowned i wish i could tell you that you were safe but i dont know how many days seventeen melitta said promptly the whole scroll of her fears rolled into that one number kallista nodded we course at the same time so that means nothing you should see blood in a week aphrodite you did this at the wrong time girl did i teach you nothing early or late in the month and you can make mistakes and if i dont melitta asked she had hoped hoped against hope that when she told kallista the hetaira would know and calm all her fears then you have a baby theres no need to borrow trouble by discussing all that now thats for a month from now maybe more girls miss their courses i still do sometimes late early nothing its like philosophy honey it never has the answer you need im afraid kallista smiled nothing to fear are you some streetwalker or a slave in a rough house go and tell sappho and nihmu today get it done people here love you you understand me girl they even love me and it took me time to get that but you are the lady of this house sappho will throw me out melitta cried sappho was a hetaira kallista said and shes been a better mother to me than my mother ever was get your head out of your arse or wherever it is and tell sappho do you love him no melitta said in a small voice kallista laughed thats a mercy satyrus went to abrahams house first because cimons was something he couldnt face alone or because he missed the man xeno had turned very strange these last few weeks and seeing abraham seemed like a return to a better time a safer time whereas xeno now lived in a world of war and xeno was probably in love with his sister his stomach turned over and he was standing in a public street the intersection of two great avenues constructed by the conqueror to allow the breezes to move freely through his chosen city he leaned against a building master asked the slave whod come out with him young smoothfaced and useless whats your name lad satyrus asked cyrus the boy said sullenly again satyrus thought that he wanted a servant he could trust someone of his own its nothing satyrus said he rubbed his brow then he turned on to the alexandrion and walked along it passing the temples and the nearpalaces of the macedonian upper class many of them were poorer than uncle leon and few of them had the political or military power of uncle diodorus but they lived lives of the most reckless ostentation because apparently that is how they lived in macedon then past the posideion with its merchant houses and their public and private wharves more and more of abrahams fellow hebrews were moving into the posideion which had a certain logic to it as twothirds of the lots were empty and most of the new arrivals from palestine were merchants ben zion had one of the larger houses a utilitarian building on the greek pattern with little outward decoration like the man himself ben zion tolerated leon but the man was reputed to be a hebrew zealot and he dressed in the plainest of tunics and always wore elements of his canaanish or israelite tribal clothing as if disdaining the hellenic world in which he lived satyrus had only met him twice both on errands to fetch abraham from his lair like this one avoiding a man lying dead in the central gutter and fastidiously wrinkling his nose as a specialist butcher disposed of the unclean parts of an animal watched by a hebrew priest into the very same gutter satyrus moved past them smiled at a knife sharpener because the man was doing such a careful job and caught a glimpse of a pair of eyes looking out from behind a curtain in the exedra of ben zions house satyrus smiled to himself because for all the black clouds in his mood he was still moved by those eyes a pair of eyes he was quite sure he would never attach to a voice or a body hebrew women lived in even more seclusion than greek women the street door to the courtyard was open and labourers a mix of races were standing with their backs against the courtyard wall panting there was a heavy crate on the marblechipped ground and ben zion stood with his hands on his hips a heavy wool robe over his vaguely hellenic tunic no visiting during working hours ben zion barked catching sight of him satyrus recoiled then forcing a smile he stepped forward i need your son sir public business ben zion had a heavy beard like many older greek men and he ran his fingers through it both hands a foreign gesture public business he asked you are a citizen satyrus asked in his best helmsman voice ben zion actually smiled recognition lit his dour face yes young nephew of my partner leon i am a citizen satyrus bowed your son is a citizen ben zion nodded i call on your son to serve in the phalanx with panoply and arms against the common foe in defence of the city satyrus ground the butt of his hunting spear against the marble chips i hope youll have better spears than that ben zion said leon said you would come so and so benjamin fetch my son he motioned at one of the labourers may i show you a wonder young warrior or do thoughts of armour fill your head to the exclusion of everything satyrus didnt know why people didnt like ben zion he was in some hebrew way just like diodorus and leon id be delighted satyrus said seeing the wonder seemed to involve stripping his chlamys and helping the labourers raise the crate off the marble chips god send it not be damaged fools and carrying it the heaviest load satyrus had ever put his shoulder to around the corner and deeper into the house ahh softly god witness that i have done all i can to get this precious thing into my house you there master satyrus you have strong arms see to it that you have a light touch as well mind the loom a thousand imprecations some in greek and many others in a language that satyrus didnt understand except that it had to be hebrew past a kitchen whose smells made satyrus want to eat he was now carrying the crate with the help of one other man passing through arched doorways too narrow to admit more hands and he was unable to do more than walk and carry he was sweating like an olympic athlete in the final stade and the wooden supports by which the heavy thing was carried were beginning to creak and bend just on top of this here hold it up up now down slowly perfect my children perfect ben zion actually clapped his hands get the crate off you lot master satyrus you are ever welcome in my house you are as strong as my strongest servant and i might not have got this done without you satyrus stood up for the first time seeing where he was a handsome round room quite large with the feeling of a temple scrolls in pigeonholes as far as the eye could see and the crate now rested on an elegant dark stone plinth against a tiled wall satyrus rubbed his back looking around the ceiling was like the vault of heaven the first mosaic hed ever seen when did my uncle say i was coming he asked to indicate that he was not altogether foolish ah today of course what can i say young master when one has the repute of a famous hellenic athlete a poor trader must make what use can be made yes ben zion handed him a steaming cup quaveh an acquired taste nabataean i have sent a note to your uncle that my sources from nabataea say that oneeyes son invaded them looking for tribute money and suffered for it satyrus nodded at his carrying partner an enormous man who wore the same tribal marks as ben zion the man nodded back comrades in fatigue and accomplishment then he sipped from the cup and almost spat the stuff was bitter put some honey in it abraham said from behind him i see my father got his moneys worth out of your visit he sounded a little contemptuous it was a tone that satyrus would never have taken with leon but ben zion merely smiled honey is abrahams answer to everything eh greeks will love jews if only we add a little honey ben zion shrugged nonetheless he helped satyrus himself using a heavy horn spoon to add honey a woman appeared with a tray an attractive young woman unveiled who smiled right into satyruss eyes as if they were old friends miriam up the stairs this instant and no more of your sluttish ways ben zion was angry how dare you thats my sister abraham murmured drink your quaveh and look imperturbable satyrus cast a smile at the retreating miriam who seemed unbowed by her fathers anger a female voice was raised from the exedra miriams mother satyrus had no doubt he didnt understand a word of hebrew but he would have bet a dozen silver owls that the words what will the neighbours think had just been shouted ben zion turned back with a shrug that seemed at odds with his display of rage all an act my daughter the apple of my eye beautiful is she not come be frank hellene esther ruth hannah all fine girls but miriam is like sophia incarnate except for the lack of wisdom abraham whispered bah i heard that listen my atheist scapegrace this hellene has come to my poor shop to require your service in the phalanx of the city eh he looked at satyrus abraham grinned like a fool really i thought id have to beg to join very humiliating for our people asked to join totally different i would be delighted to serve delighted enough to find ten more like you satyrus asked who can furnish their own panoply to philokles standards ah armourers will grow rich all over the city ben zion said both hands tangled in his beard how lucky that leon and i own most of them he nodded it is as my son says young master we hate to beg but invited i doubt youll find fewer than fifty philokles in command thats a frightening thought abraham laughed satyrus smiled and then frowned you could die he said suddenly unsure how to approach the matter this is real ben zion nodded curtly war causes death in greece this may be news in israel we already know what war does he nodded to his son see to it that you do us honour abraham nodded he bowed respectfully to his father i will i know ben zion said he turned away suddenly your hellene friend should see this since it is the triumph of our two peoples working together he had turned away to hide emotion and abraham busied himself with the cups leaving an embarrassed satyrus to fend for himself he and the giant hebrew lifted the crate straight up over their heads and then carefully off the gleaming bronze that lay beneath before the box was clear of the thing satyrus had an idea what it was a machine he said in awe more than a machine ben zion said indeed it looked like two great tablets of bronze but on the backs there were hundreds of gears and cogs and several different handles that could be pulled the sheer complexity of it boggled the mind what does it do satyrus asked ben zion shook his head it calculates all the festivals and holy days he said see the stars see the moon do you know your astronomy well enough to handle a boat satyrus said ben zion paid him the compliment of a glance of respect that is an accomplishment for a boy your age you greeks are not as ignorant as some peoples so what star is that i assume this is orions belt satyrus said and then they were exchanging star positions and turning levers a button was pressed and the calculator whirred gears moving inside gears and then the dials moved by zeus and all the gods satyrus said enthusiastically its more than just a festival calculator isnt it it can predict where the stars will be a great navigator ben zions face darkened by the god and only the god he said softly this is a holy place satyrus bowed i mean no profanity lord many greeks too think there is but one god of many aspects and many jews think their one god has at least two or even three aspects abraham shot in before his father could reply i think we should go and recruit more men satyrus while you and my father are still friends in the courtyard ben zion bowed stiffly i meant no bad feeling to arise he said satyrus still a little scared of the older hebrew bowed formally none has i thank you for your hospitality and the sheer marvels of your machine who built it many men and a few women had hands in it aristotle of athens divined that the calendar wheels must needs have the same number of cogs as there were days in the calendar a pythagorean in italy worked out the elliptical wheel elliptical wheel satyrus knew his geometry but he had no idea what was being described another time satyrus the curious i find your company surprisingly erudite for a young barbarian idolater and would welcome your return ben zion bowed satyrus returned the bow everyone is someones barbarian idolater he said and thanks for the quaveh i shall send a bag to your house have a care of my son hes the best of the lot ben zion bowed again abraham coloured as they went out of the gate accompanied by satyruss worthless slave ten courtyards further down the avenue abraham peeled off his wool robe and flung it to the slave now another bearded hellene to outward appearance thats the best thing my father has ever said of me he said in wonder i liked him satyrus said you stood up to him he likes that right up until religion enters the picture then he doesnt like it but you did well and im sorry for miriam theres nothing sluttish about her but shes starved for life the way a drowning man starves for air she claims shell go and serve as a hetaira to escape my mother and sometimes in her naivety i fear she will abraham looked around where are we going cimons satyrus wondered if he could do several people a favour at once would your father let miriam see my sister abraham raised an eyebrow your sister is not exactly a byword for genteel behaviour he said but she is the same age and she and miriam would probably start their own phalanx together he nodded ill try it on my mother i should have thought of it myself you liked her i scarcely saw her satyrus said not quite the truth hed seldom seen anyone he so instantly liked like amastris queens and jews satyrus thought to himself i really have to find a nice greek girl somewhere with abraham to guide him they made three more stops at hebrew houses where abraham was welcomed in a way that suggested that he was a man of more worth than satyrus a hellene had guessed and young men sprang to follow him and their fathers guaranteed their panoplies so that by the time they arrived at cimons they had twenty young men behind them and the porter gawked i cant seat all these he said but he smiled seeing a great evening and a pile of silver may i see thrassylus satyrus asked the porter and the great man was sent for and arrived in heartbeats master satyrus he asked thrassylus antigonus oneeye and his golden son are coming with a mighty army to burn fair alexandria to the ground satyrus declaimed i need to address your patrons from the stage thrassylus bowed your uncle had already mentioned something of the sort he said the stage awaits satyrus walked in followed by two files of jewish men most of whom were quite familiar with cimons he walked straight up the steps to the wooden stage where musicians and other performers were commonplace he stood on the stage and drew his sword and silence fell over the whole tiled room punctuate by a buzz of gossip demetrios the golden is two weeks march away he said every man in this room is a citizen demetrios means to destroy all we have all we hold dear our temples our hearths our homes demetrios will sell our women into slavery and we will be sent to foreign places if we preserve our own freedom satyrus had thought his speech out carefully like the orator he wanted to be so now he pointed at abraham and the men seated around him the jews will fight they know freedom and they know slavery look at them twenty of the richest boys in this town and they will go to be the front rank of the new phalanx satyrus raised his sword greeks macedonians hellenes are we the worse men the greater cowards i will go i will go with the new phalanx and you anyone out there one young man had the courage to stand up but im a macedonian he said he was amyntas son of philip enhedrion household officer at the palace what he meant was that if he was going to fight his father would find him a place with the other pureblood macedonians and arent you exiled satyrus shook his head sword still held out bullshit amyntas you are no more macedonian than abraham you sir are alexandrian now get off your arse and fight for our city in his head he considered that coming to cimons perhaps wasnt the best way to keep the low profile that lord ptolemy had required of him theodorus was sharing his couch with a flute girl and he suddenly rose up a little drunk and flushed my father will kill me dont we have an army to do this satyrus satyrus was still holding out the sword steady unwavering like a male athena the sword said symbolically that he was judging them and they were reacting as if they feared his judgment defend yourself theo this is our hour this is when we stand up for the city that nurtured us ive only been here three years but this is my home and when i see the foundations of the lighthouse from the deck of the golden lotus i know that this is the place that i will defend who will stand with me theo sneered who commands this phalanx is this the foreign phalanx that my father laughs at on his way to the sea wall young men were stirring on their couches foreign if your macedonian father means that the rank and file were born here then he has the right of it we will be the front rank of the phalanx of aegypt philokles the spartan will lead us and train us but you every man here you train at the gymnasium you can afford the fullest panoply better than any mercenary and better trained than some pellan farm boy who has never wrestled a fall stand up flex those muscles show your elders that we arent soft satyrus spoke to the room in general but his eyes were on dionysius the beautiful who flirted with him and wrote verses about his sisters breasts theo stood up he was swaying my father will kill me he said can i come and live at your house but when his hands were steady he said i will serve fuck ill serve too amyntas said and stood by his couch dionysius the handsomest young man in alexandria and one of the richest smiled and stood if im willing to put my body between demetrios and this city he said then the rest of you should be with me he smiled wickedly you all have so much less to lose dionysius was the deciding vote if it had been an assembly suddenly all the young men were standing and the older ones most of them already soldiers looked around muttering some applauded but others looked angry satyrus did a quick count and found that he had eightysix adherents he took them as a mob to the parade ground the keener boys attempting to march and failing utterly he handed them over to philokles who kept a straight face and made the spartan salute i need theo and dio and abraham he said for recruiting carry on said the voice of ares then philokles grabbed his shoulder i take it that every patron of cimons saw you yes satyrus said defiantly i told you i was going there you are a man now and not a boy but if they saw you they will start adding things together understand satyrus nodded i understand im at risk good lad watch yourself your uncles are probably all starting at shadows t heo knew the richest boys dio knew the handsomest boys and the athletes and musicians abraham knew the jews and some of the nabataean metics and other arabs they went as a group of four from door to door portico to portico palace to warehouse they gathered a hundred and forty more young men one and two at a time it took days precious days and every armourer in alexandria had orders for the finest armour the lightest corslets with the best iron and bronze scales it was curious work that left satyrus exhausted at the end of the day full of minor triumphs and equally minor snubs and rebuffs doors closed to him that hed always imagined opened a share of curses but worst of all the bored refusal of the rich men who mocked him for his recruiting campaign and men who questioned his sanity croseus the megaran for instance waited only to be told the magnitude of the threat before ordering his best things packed and taking one of his own ships for corinth i owe this city nothing he said neither do you stop being foolish you will not get my son to stand in the ranks thats for slaves and fools poor men who have to do such things men like us dont fight leon wont be in your precious phalanx ill wager no sir satyrus said see childhood fantasies myths like thinking that alexander was actually a god croseus shook his head master leon will serve with the cavalry satyrus said take your foolery and your rudeness and get out of my warehouse croseus said again he found his macedonian friends vanishing like startled gazelles in a hunt down the delta not all of them theos father was delighted to see his son in the ranks but others spoke quietly or openly with derision of the city and of ptolemy it was one of these meetings that showed that the war of the factions had reached explosive proportions sitalkes was a young man that satyrus knew from pankration his father was an officer in the foot companions a captain of ten files who shared the name alexander with most of the macedonian men of his generation sitalkes stood in his own courtyard enthusiastically nodding as dionysius and satyrus gave him the whole recruiting speech and then his father came through the courtyard gates well well he drawled boy are these your friends please introduce me unless we dont use such polite conventions any more sitalkes bowed pater this is abraham son of isaac ben zion this is satyrus son of kineas of athens dionysius son of eteocles theo son of apollion all of them whatever all of them did together was not something in which his father took much interest youre satyrus the famous satyrus the macedonian officer nodded he made a motion then he stopped and swallowed well he looked around his courtyard hold on a minute boys im eager to hear satyruss proposals as is every citizen im sure the mans heavy teasing had the same smell as his breath red wine and garlic he snapped his fingers and wine was brought and he sent the wine slave away but satyrus noticed that the slave went and spoke to one of the macedonian soldiers who loitered around the gate the soldier put his shield against the wall and sprinted off down the street wine the officer asked sitalkes appeared stricken he tried to speak and then shook his head no wine perhaps you are too young to have a head for it i hear you are a pankrationist go inside boy alexander ordered his son no wine thank you satyrus said im trying to convince sitalkes to join the phalanx of aegypt alexander smiled a false smile that made satyruss guts roll over well consider it he said abraham was already by the gate theo was on his feet having caught on that something was not right dionysius sneered macedonian debates must be like macedonian flirting come away dio satyrus said no stay the officer said i love punishing unruly children and when satyrus dragged dionysius away the officer roared close the gate abraham was ahead of the macedonian gate guard all the way he got his back against the gate and he was bigger and when the man went to grapple abraham gave him an elbow in the temple and down he went the officer thrust dionysius from behind go then he said get your foreign arse out of my house and dont come here again then he laughed and even the laugh was surly i imagine youll get all the chastisement you have coming to you greek satyrus swept up the macedonian shield by the gate and got it on his arm run he shouted cyrus his slave needed no further admonition theo bolted through the gate and dionysius seeing the gate guard put his hand on his sword hesitated and abraham shoved him the gate guard tried to knock theo down and satyrus caught the mans shoulder on the shield and turned it then kicked out under the shield and knocked the man sprawling and he was out of the gate what in all tartarus does that madman think hes doing dionysius asked when they stopped at the next corner he sent a man abraham said between gulps of air they began to walk as they all gasped for breath and then theo laughed what an idiot he said our fathers will bury him in court abraham shook his head he didnt seem very worried about court listen he sent a man i saw it satyrus said he was trying to think ahead we should go home by a different route then we my father will order him arrested dionysius insisted i dont think abraham said and then cyrus who was walking next to satyrus leaned forward to point at something on a roof and took an arrow in the neck the boy dropped like a sack of flour the main artery in his neck severed his blood splashing like a badly sacrificed bulls satyrus looked around cover he yelled and jumped under the overhang of the exedra of the nearest building abraham copied him and dionysius had the reactions of an athlete but theo had never been in real danger before and he froze in the middle of the street there was the rush of feet behind them and theo cried out and went down satyrus saw the man who killed him a mangy footpad who carefully put his sword in theos eye as the boy thrashed on the ground herakles satyrus yelled even as he shouted the gods name as a war cry he knew that theo was dead he threw himself forward at theos killer in a muddle of conflicting thoughts terror and a desire for revenge expiation some vague thought that with a shield he could cover everyones retreat that was his thought as he got his feet on either side of his friends corpse and punched the bronze rim of his shield into the mangy footpads face the man had no shield all he could do was step back one two just as he was taught satyrus stepped forward and drew his sword then cut the man down with the back cut the edge of his sword right in the mans neck and then satyrus spun ready for the next man as an arrow thudded into the shield where his back had been seconds before the other two murderers ran satyrus could see the archer up on the roof of the nearest house the man wore persian clothes all in the dullest of colours and he had a sakje bow he aimed carefully the oddest feeling satyrus thought to be so carefully singled out for death and shot satyrus moved the shield and ducked and the arrow clanged against the rim with a fullsize aspis hed have been immune with the smaller macedonian shield he had to react like a snake the man raised his bow again abraham was calling for help shouting at the top of his lungs for the watch and theo was still dead between his feet thump the man was shooting for his head relentlessly satyrus felt an irrational desire to stand his ground and not flee back to the exedra after all fleeing the first time had killed theo and perhaps dying would solve it all all the endless complexity thump he just barely caught that one shot for his knees his shield arm had no interest in death there were calls from the watch a dozen armoured men running full tilt down the alexandrion the archer shook his head in frustration cursed and vanished across the roof line listless angry at himself and the world satyrus was interrogated by the officer of the watch a macedonian of course and then again by theron when his coach arrived to take him from the clutches of the law and again by sappho when he arrived at home youre lucky the watch officer was an honest man sappho said or youd be dead satyrus sat looking at his hands he had blood under his nails theo was still dead they fucking killed him satyrus whispered diodorus came in resplendent in a bronze breastplate and a gilt helmet with a white horsehair crest and a pair of exotic blue plumes on either side of his head like rams horns he had a dark blue cloak embroidered in gold laurel leaves and the hilt of his long kopis was solid gold he looked like a king or a very great man satyrus theres no time for revenge how did theo die satyrus was aware that somewhere four troops of elite cavalry were training without their hipparch he shook his head and the anger choked him thugs twoobol thugs one of them got him thinking he was me he all but spat in disgust ares and aphrodite diodorus said pulling off his helmet his father is going to wreck whats left of the proptolemy faction sappho rose gracefully put a hand on her husbands golden armour and shoved get out of my rooms she said softly come back when you have the temper for it hes been through a great deal dio you are not helping diodorus grew as red as a piece of tyrian wool but he walked out through the door satyrus ran after him no i can do this he said they were thugs an assassination attempt organized on the fly we visited sitalkes a friend of mine from the gymnasium i could tell his father was turned already a traitor call it what you will he wanted to kill us himself diodorus put a hand on his shoulder its not your fault i know its not my fucking fault satyrus shouted i want this done over before they get you or melitta or sappho or the lot of us a slave handed him a cold cloth without being asked and satyrus put the cloth to his face with his eyes closed he could see cyruss body lying half in and half out of the gutter the blood running out of his neck and swirling away with the bilge water and the urine and the faeces and theos blood creeping along behind and then another stream from the almostsevered neck of the man hed killed theron came back with philokles and diodorus now out of his armour and with an ancient mastos cup full of wine sorry lad he said and you wife my apologies sappho nodded very well we need to know what happened lad philokles said satyrus had the force of will to make himself recover to avoid the indulgence in passions that marked a weak man or marked him any further he didnt sob he told his story as best he could again theos father has two other sons but hes ready to go to war personally on this matter hes got a reward out for this persian archer diodorus shook his head this is a bad time for leon to be away philokles was interested in other matters you did not kill theo satyrus listen to me lad your illogic is overwhelming and very much a piece with your age the assassins intended his death it was their actions dont treat me like a child satyrus said the assassins intended my death i failed to read the signals clear as trumpets on a summer day and then when the attack started i didnt help theo the youngest of us and the least trained and what of cyrus doesnt leon teach us that slaves are men too cyrus is just as dead as theo and his blood was just the same colour come to think of it theos killer bled the same when i put him down im sick of it im no good at it and it goes on and on and the bodies just pile up how many of my friends will die some fighting stratokles some fighting oneeye more to make me king of the bosporus perhaps fuck it its just violence on and on bloody slaughter to the end of the world silence greeted his outburst theron winced diodorus shrugged and turned away anger obvious on his face sappho wore an odd and somewhat enigmatic look philokles actually smiled you are growing up he said some men never do we tell children nice tales so theyll learn lies that often have truth in them fables some men cling to those lies all their lives satyrus lies about how one nation or city or race is better than another that justify killing death war he sat straight nothing makes killing right if you wish to live a life of pure righteousness i think you must turn your back on killing on violence on raising your voice when angry on hurting others to accomplish a goal satyrus made a noise and philokles raised a hand forestalling him killing is always wrong but many other things are also wrong oppression theft tyranny arson rapine on and on the catalogue of human wrongs when you turn your back on killing and violence you also surrender the ability to prevent wrongs to others because in this world we stop oppression when we stand firm in our ranks with the bronze he gave an odd smile you know what amuses me satyrus what i just told you is what the elders taught in sparta i have spent a lifetime reading and listening and studying and hating war and what it makes me become and all i can say is that life is a choice an endless series of choices men can choose to think or not to think they can choose to lead or to follow to trust or not to trust you may choose not to take life even not to fight that choice is not cowardice but that choice has consequences or you can choose to kill and that choice too has consequences when the blood fills your lungs and the darkness comes down all you have is what you did who you were what you stood for so whats the answer satyrus asked how do i he couldnt even enunciate his question how can i stop seeing the corpses how do i avoid the consequences shall i just give you an answer lad philokles got to his feet or can you take the truth like a man there is no answer you do what you can and sometimes what you have to so if i am to be your judge putting your steel in that mankiller was no sin before gods or men nor can any man hold you responsible for young theo not even his father whose grief is formidable philokles put his hand on satyruss shoulder and satyrus didnt shake it off and theron who had been silent because philokles had said everything he had to say came over and embraced satyrus diodorus grunted im glad to know that my life is immoral spartan what a fine thing philosophy must be he shrugged but the immediate problem is that stratokles or somebody like him is out there trying to kill the twins satyrus no leaving the house except with one of us understand no satyrus said he looked around at these men these heroes no if im a man i can do this you cant nursemaid me i can stay alive i think i proved it today philokles nodded he has a point he conceded the evening breeze whispered through the palm trees and the mediterranean surf hissed against the gravel of the beach behind the main wing of leons house and the north wind carried the smell of the sea rotting fish and kelp and salt a smell that could sink to a miasma or rise to a wonderful scent of openness blue waves and freedom satyrus had a porch off his rooms that opened on the sea and tonight he felt the need of it he took a cup of wine from a slave and walked out into the breeze out here in the dark the sound of the sea was much louder when we first came here i used to sit just like this and listen to the sea melitta said from a chair i used to imagine that the water coming up the beach was the same water that had passed out of the tanais satyrus sipped some wine i still think the same thing he said all the time melitta got out of her chair after the sea fight off syria i lay with xenophon its not his fault its mine im sorry i told sappho i didnt want you to hear it secondhand satyrus digested this in silence say something melitta said theo is dead he said killed by men sent to kill me i left him standing in the street i didnt do it i just let it happen its not all about you melitta said no satyrus agreed and drank more wine im learning that im sorry about theo what did his father say melitta asked nothing he was frightened frightened what is this city coming to satyrus took a breath and drank more wine why xenophon though i mean hes my best friend youve spent my whole adult life teasing him and telling me about his shortcomings and hes enough of a gentleman to feel things you wont marry him i assume satyrus wished he sounded a little more adult melitta was silent then she said i dont plan to marry anyone among the hellenes satyrus going to go to the sea of grass without me lita satyrus knew that hed had too much wine if i have to melitta said i want to be a queen not a girl satyrus shook his head thats just where we differ sister id like very much not to be a king you wallow a lot you know that its not all about you you didnt kill theo you didnt kill your precious peleus sometimes you make me want to punch you melitta shook her head you get everything i want and you dont even like it after this campaign satyrus began but melitta cut in savagely after this campaign after we sail to rhodos after we make war on antigonus oneeye how long do i have to wait now they were shouting at each other satyrus raised his hands spilling some wine in his frustration whats so bad whats so bad how did you spend the day recruiting to save the city from demetrios and his oneeyed father was it frustrating did useless merchants turn you down fighting for your life against assassins lost a friend she was shouting now i sat at home and wove some wool he was silent in my spare time i worried that i was pregnant she muttered i want to go and fight demetrios i want to ride free or be a helmsman or recruit young men to fight but most of all i want the attention of the men and women worth a conversation tonight i confessed my transgression to sappho do you know what she said best not tell satyrus until the battle is fought philokles treats me like a girl why because i have breasts and my body can make a baby why doesnt somebody recruit me demetrios is going to have forty elephants and we dont even have one and by apollo i may be the best archer in this city what are we doing about raising a corps of archers maiden archers satyrus said looking to win a smile and failing utterly is the loss of my virginity painful to you brother was our family honour strapped between my thighs melitta swelled with rage satyrus shook his head stupid joke sorry lita he made himself reach for her refusing to be cowed by her anger and believe that she really aimed her darts at him and she was in his arms her head on his shoulder and at the speed of their embrace they stopped being at odds melitta rocked back and forth for a little while and satyrus watched the stars behind her head blur with his own unshed tears and then return to normal she stepped back i know its not your fault but suddenly everyone in this house is treating you like a man whereas i get to be a perpetual child i cant get you a corps of archers maiden or not satyrus said but when leon lands his marines i know a ship that could easily land one more archer but lita this isnt a fair battle were the trapped dogs demetrios has everything his way melitta raised her chin i was there when we took two pirate galleys she said true enough satyrus said and kissed the top of her head why xenophon hes so nice hes going to follow you like a dog for the rest of your life she shrugged hard to describe really he knew that i had saved his life thanked me for it comrade to comrade even though he had fought like achilles and i was a mere girl she shrugged again and i saw things the same things gods you know as well as i i was dead when your spear put that man down i felt dead and then i was alive she hung her head i dont care a fig for my virginity brother but i agree that actions have consequences and i insist that xeno should not pay the price the bride price or any other price satyrus slugged back his wine when they were children they had fought and then one big hug and it was over tonight he felt the loss of that simplicity because she was closed to him on some level and because no he had not really forgiven her but his failure to forgive her weighed on him like a failed sacrifice she felt his hesitation she stared at him he stared back once they had been eye to eye now he was half a head taller will you really help me get away she asked yes he said he imagined her lying dead trampled by an elephant as he had seen back in the great battle on the salt plains he shook his head too much wine fuck it lita yes you have as much right to lie with a man as i do to lie with a woman i too have spent too much time with hellenes he smiled bitterly its going to be hard to talk to xeno imagine how i feel melitta said she rose on her toes and kissed his cheek thanks she said and went back inside she turned back and smiled i have a rendezvous for you with amastris i was going to throw it in your face if you played high and mighty with me she shook her head which you didnt so i feel like a fool she reached in her bosom and pulled out an oyster shell tomorrow night she said the slip of papyrus leaf had two lines from menander and satyrus smiled because the lines named the hour to anyone who had seen the play by the steps of the temple of poseidon melitta said do you love her satyrus looked at his sandals yes he mumbled and yet dont be foolish brother dont get caught i dont think i shouldnt say this i dont think youre amastriss first boy man what have you she shrugged clearly unhappy at having said what she had said what satyrus asked but im sure it is different for men melitta said listen dont go its not worth the risk this from my sister who wants me to smuggle her into the archer corps to fight elephants he said she smiled thats a hit and no mistake brother very well go if you must but she wont show not the first time the first time will just be a test of your devotion im her friend i know these things she turned and slipped away leaving him with an oyster shell and a feeling of confusion the next morning the wind still carried the sting of the sea in its tail and it blew hard enough to cool the sweat on two thousand backs and breasts as they drilled without shade panion the commander of the foot companions stood at the head of the taxeis with philokles and theron and half a dozen macedonian officers theyre absurd panion said loudly enough to carry into the first three ranks children and slaves oneeyes veterans will go through them the way his elephants will push through our cavalry his macedonian officers laughed ruefully or disdainfully depending on their faction philokles said something softly and panion shrugged work as hard as you like spartan ill put them in the second line or somewhere where their flight wont cost us much perhaps we can use them to carry baggage he laughed and the six macedonians laughed again philokles fingered his beard i need more sarissas he said we dont have enough ptolemy sent too much equipment off to cassander panion said with a shrug make do with what you have after all he said cheerfully if ptolemys kingdom relies on this lot were doomed philokles said something quiet and panion shook his head i think you forget your place i am a macedonian your people once had a certain reputation for war ill allow but i assure you sir that no amount of drill will make these slaves into soldiers and that i dont give a flying fuck for their morale panion looked around him and spat in contempt later he and his staff reappeared as philokles forced the phalanx through another wheeling movement badly executed like every wheel this time the macedonian went along the first two ranks he called every macedonian out of the ranks he stopped at satyrus you he said then when hed recovered his confusion he gave satyrus a smile you dont belong here with this rabble he said come with me satyrus could see amyntas shuffling nervously among the young macedonians what rabble satyrus said aegyptians panion shrugged good for farm work seems to work to train macedonians satyrus said yes panion said but theyre men not slaves these boys are macedonians satyrus wiped the sweat from his eyes not a one of them was born in macedon sir he said meeting the commanders eyes i recruited them here in alexandria for this phalanx panion narrowed his eyes another uppity greek he said very well swelter on boy revel in your remaining hours then louder you macedonians come with me when panion was gone philokles continued to drill the men and as the shadows lengthened he tried to provide the physical training that would allow aegyptians to go up against men in the peak of fitness they werent weak many of them had fine bodies and heavy muscles from labour but philokles walked around urging them to lift greater weights or run farther the men were listless worse than usual and when the sun touched the rim of the world philokles dismissed them obviously keeping his temper in check satyrus fell in next to the spartan as they walked back in the last light of evening half of them wont come back philokles said after they had walked a stade that fool that posturing ninny i should have put my sword up his arse on the spot philokles satyrus said master i have never heard you speak in this manner he managed a grin his first since theo died it had occurred to him that panion might have had something to do with that death you are not always a philosopher do you know what the macedonian officers discuss philokles said putting on a good show fighting long enough to get the best possible terms from demetrios remember what happened to eumenes when part of his precious macedonians decided not to fight its happening here lad another week or two and our taxeis would be worth something too they shape well better than many greeks strong backs these aegyptians but panion just told them that they are slaves to him philokles spat six weeks work for nothing and he took half of the cream of your boys every one of those macedonian boys knew which end of a spear to wield we still have the greeks and the jews satyrus said philokles gave half a smile and put a hand on his former students shoulder so we do he said i dont think theyre enough and i think that we need ranks and ranks of strong faithful and courageous aegyptians behind us or it wont matter but i should swallow my own medicine and deal with these troubles when they present themselves what do we do for sarissas theron leaned in for now the first three ranks can use their hoplite equipment all the hellene ephebes have them and even the jews came with heavy spears philokles agreed shorter spears in front is not a way to build the confidence of your front ranks lad do you know what it is like to face a macedonian taxeis unless theyre disordered every file has six or eight spearheads sticking out in front they move just from the natural movement of the men carrying them like the ripple of grass in the wind hard to face terrifying you told me yourself that with an aspis and discipline you had no problem penetrating the wall of spears satyrus had heard the tale of the fight at the fords of the borysthenes a dozen times or more from different men he knew that philokles and the elite men of two euxine cities had held and then beaten a macedonian phalanx philokles made a face veterans should know better than to tell such tales we were lucky and brave there were good men in that taxeis hard men and men in the very peak of athletic training i had ten olympians he looked out to sea his spearbutt making a rhythm as he tapped it on the paving stones i was a younger man myself look at me it has taken me six weeks just to get the lard off my stomach fifteen years ago id have had muscles like your cuirass like you have wrestler he pointed at theron who wore his chitoniskos off one shoulder showing the nearperfect musculature of his torso we have theron hes an olympian satyrus was interested by the fact that he was now cheering up philokles a complete reversal from the day before ahh theron philokles said they were at diodoruss gate which was the closer of the two properties to the drill field three days until we march where are you heading young man a nap satyrus said i have this magnificent physique to maintain theron slapped him on the back dont forget to appear at the gymnasium philokles said read something before bed i have never had a child of my own lad but when you speak of having a nap i suspect that you have somewhere to go tonight hmm blushing satyrus hung his head a complex rush of embarrassments flooding him remember what diodorus said i do not note order you to obey his stricture only to understand that disobedience will have consequences for you and for others understand me satyrus wasnt sure that he did understand but he nodded anyway gave a ridiculous smile and then bowed and retreated to his room where he spent half an hour inspecting his tutors comment from any number of angles moonlight would have helped both his mood and the physical difficulty of moving around but the moon was dark and the stars werent much help as a thin haze made the night as black as a priests cloak satyrus clutched his chlamys tighter and moved carefully back and forth at the base of the steps to the temple of poseidon deep in the temple precincts there was light and the soft sound of voices but out at the edge of the steps there was just a vague glow and the voices sounded like a haunting and he was afraid it was foolish for him to have come he saw assassins in every movement satyrus was beginning to feel a fool he walked back and forth again listening for any sign of another person above him or perhaps a boat out in the harbour but he heard nothing but the cry of a latenight gull and somewhere far off down the curve of the bay two voices raised in angry confrontation he looked at the sky if there had been stars the right stars he could have told the time the dark sky mocked his ignorance and the night seemed to move along far more slowly satyrus sat on a step feeling some lingering warmth from the heat of the day for the thousandth time he thought of amastris and then of melitta and then of the marvellous machine in abrahams house not that these thoughts were connected but only that one followed another and served to keep other thoughts at bay just thinking that unlocked them like pandoras cursed box and then he was seeing theo with the dirk in his eye and then the sauromatae girl he had killed and then he shivered why would amastris leave him waiting he rose to his feet and walked over to the sea wall the two voices down the coast were gone he could hear a kithara playing my lord came a voice from the top of the steps satyrus jumped yes he answered i have a message i think the voice said satyrus couldnt see anything the god might have been addressing him directly that seemed unlikely so satyrus climbed the steps he was careful and he found that he had drawn his sword without thinking i am here namastis said closer satyrus could recognize the grecoaegyptian by the sound of his consonants so am i satyrus said now he could see the priest outlined by the pale luminescence of the white marble portico and the brightly coloured statues that glittered with gold even on the darkest night good evening master namastis so namastis said he sounded amused a far cry from his daytime subservience i am asked to perform a task for the palace by a priest of hathor and look im running an errand for a greek he reached out and placed an oyster shell in satyruss hand i cant very well read it in the dark satyrus said namastis made a tapping noise and then a scuffing as if he was carrying a staff and tapping his sandals i can light a torch in the outer sanctuary he said come satyrus climbed up to the portico behind the blackness that was the priests cloak against the white of the steps and then he paused in the incenseredolent interior he didnt know his way and the priest vanished he wondered if this was an ambush he was behaving like an idiot in more ways than one and namastis was it just coincidence how would amastris know of their connection satyrus grasped the hilt of his sword and just then he heard a strong grunt as the aegyptian blew hard on a spark and in seconds a resinimpregnated torch burst into flame with the heady smell of burning pitch the scenes of the temple interior sprang to life in the flickering light of one torch but satyrus glanced around his head turning like a falcons or a hunting owls he sheathed his sword and his hand fell away from the hilt he was quite literally starting at shadows he went over to the priest and stood with the torchlight at his right shoulder while he opened the shell and read the note apologies satyrus shrugged let that be a lesson to me he said the priest shook his head saying nothing then he paused i could offer you a cup of wine he said were not supposed to he added in a tone that suggested that this rule was not widely obeyed satyrus shook his head no thanks he said i have been enough of a foolish boy for ten nights i need to get some sleep before philokles has me on the drill field in the morning namastis peered at him as if his eyes were weak you are with the spartan in the phalanx of aegypt he asked i hear news of you every day he smiled hesitantly satyrus shrugged if it is still there in the morning he answered namastis nodded yes the macedonians didnt want to arm any mere native and now they seek to drive them all away satyrus had to laugh i dont think its an organized plot friend he said macedonian arrogance is sufficient panion came today and in one speech undid four weeks of philokles work and your countrymen arent the worlds best soldiers either lots of obedience and not much spirit namastis rubbed his bare chin would a priest of poseidon be welcome in your phalanx lord he asked satyrus he said satyrus shrugged my father had priests in his phalanx in greek cities many priests serve in the ranks just like other men he made a face i have no idea what the tradition is here then i will come tomorrow namastis said as philokles had predicted fewer than half of the aegyptians returned to the ranks the next day and those that came were surly and often stood immobile instead of exercising why did you come if not to work philokles asked one the man carefully grounded his pike and walked off look at the bright side dionysius said now we have enough sarissas he shrugged dionysius was the least affected by the death of theo hed never liked the boy and didnt even pretend to mourn him satyrus was working with the young men practising with the hoplite arms most of them had heavy shields a handspan larger than the macedonian shields and much deeper so that they protected the whole body shorter spears with heavy heads and long bronze buttspikes like those carried by leons marines they were practising a marine tactic one that philokles admired a short burst of a charge from just three paces out from the enemy line on board ship this was all the deck space any marine ever had for a charge on the battlefield satyrus reckoned those three paces represented the length of the enemy sarissas he had bargepoles affixed to twowheel carts so that the spears stood out two spans past the poles of the yokes a line of these carts represented the enemy and again and again the young men practised flinging themselves forward three steps stooping low and shields held at an acute uncomfortable angle slam into the face of the carts hopefully avoiding the tips of the bargepoles and pushing the carts back every fourth or fifth time they managed it and the carts rocked back the other times they tripped and fell or someone got a bargepole in the head or lost his grip or the pace ugly accidents and reminders of what would happen when there were veteran killers at the other end of the bargepoles it was after one such disaster with theron berating a gaggle of jews as if they were slaves and not the sons of four of the citys richest citizens when satyrus saw that all the aegyptians were standing still refusing any further orders it was a curious form of rebellion the phalanx was voluntary and any of them might have grounded their pikes like the first rebel and walked away uhoh abraham muttered he pushed the helmet back on his head so that his arming cap showed white against his tawny skin why are we working so hard if all the gyptos are going to quit dionysius asked he took a pull from his elegant black canteen and then handed it around it had straight unwatered wine satyrus drank some anyway if philokles were here hed say that if they mutiny thats their decision and not ours about defending our city dionysius looked far more capable than he usually did he raised an eyebrow thats a nice argument for the schoolroom dear but for a man whos considering facing a line of spears it doesnt seem to me to carry much weight philokles was standing with his hands on his hips his face was red as if he was about to give way to anger the aegyptians moved as if a breeze was passing over a field of their own emmer and a sigh escaped from their ranks which were none too even and then a file of men in dark cloaks came on to the parade ground from the west towards the temple district most of them but not all were of mixed birth a few were marked by their features and their distinctive linen garments as aegyptian priests there were more than twenty of them and they came to a dignified halt behind philokles namastis stepped out from the gaggle of priests lord philokles the temple district sends its tithe of men who are citizens to serve another sigh escaped from the men in the ranks philokles returned the priests bow twenty willing men delight me but the favour of the gods would delight us all an older man wearing the curious long garment favoured by servants of the older aegyptian gods stepped forth i may not serve under arms he said but if i might address your men you might find them better soldiers philokles frowned and then stepped out of the command spot at the head of the square be my guest priest he said politely he walked over to where theron and satyrus were standing cant hurt us he said with a shrug perhaps hell help i know him temple of osiris a fine speaker theron shook his head strange like all barbarians priests who wont fight satyrus furrowed his brow you told me that in corinth the priests of aphrodite didnt fight but pimped for their priestesses who sold their bodies theron rubbed his nose and had the grace to look embarrassed um thats true philokles and satyrus exchanged glances even as the older priest of osiris raised his arms and began to speak some of the men in the ranks looked inattentive bored or even angry to be addressed by the priest but a great many more listened as if receiving the words of the great gods themselves and some fell to their knees until the priest was done speaking one by one five priests addressed them in aegyptian then all five gave a benediction in greek and in aegyptian and they went off to the side where a stand of date palms offered some shade the priests of the greek gods also offered benedictions but when they were done namastis clapped his hands and slaves brought them shields and linen armour like the aegyptians wore and good greek pylos helmets straight from the forges philokles looked around harmless he said he rolled his shoulders as if taking the weight of his responsibility back might even do some good it had done some good if the natives had ever intended mutiny and none of the hellenes knew them or their language well enough to know they meant no mutiny now most of them began to drill with something like enthusiasm and despite the fact that they were a thousand men short of their required size since the day before philokles led them through exercise after exercise with something like enthusiasm himself and dionysius shook his head in admiration at their first successful wheel all the way through a circle a difficult manoeuvre even for professionals of course it was easier with half the men but the spirit of the whole was different profoundly different when the sun touched the horizon satyrus sought out the priest of poseidon what did you do he said namastis shook his head i did very little it had already been discussed but meeting you last night stiffened my spine what did the priest of osiris say it was like magic satyrus said yes namastis replied he glanced at philokles he told them to act like men that the eyes of the entire lower kingdom were on them that they and they alone stood between the old gods and destruction satyrus shook his head well hes a fine old fellow dont patronize me greek namastis looked far more imposing in a linen corslet and a helmet than in his robes and dont patronize him satyrus bit back an adolescent retort and nodded i wont namastis shook his head its hard not to be touchy when you are halfcaste listen he also told them that philokles is the very avatar of the war god at least for now my tutor satyrus laughed but then he stopped a great many scenes passed before his eyes in a few heartbeats thats not altogether far from the mark he said namastis glanced over satyruss shoulder to where a knot of fashionable young men waited for their friend but were too polite to break in on the two of them or too disdainful of the gypto you hellenes are great fools namastis said he wasnt speaking in allegory satyrus he meant that philokles is the very avatar of the god of war here now the priest picked up his spear and swung it carefully erect the full length of the pike made any sudden movement perilous a prickle at the back of satyruss neck and then the smell of a wet lion skin and then nothing a sort of absence of sense you are godtouched namastis said reverently i forget hellenes are not all fools my apologies lord satyrus not lord satyrus said offering his hand namastis took it and clenched it hard too hard but a good try men are hunting you he said suddenly i know satyrus said he actually smiled like the hero in an epic although his smile was more selfmockery than dismissal of danger no aegyptian will help them namastis said that much i guarantee you but the macedonian faction intends your death they have hired men that is all we know satyrus favoured the hand all the way back to leons villa by the sea no more oyster shells came and no fights with his sister who was gone visiting amastris herself or so dorcus claimed satyrus went to sleep picturing elements of the drill and in the morning the ranks were full two thousand aegyptians halfcastes and hellenes stood together in the ranks their armour was a patchwork and their spears and sarissas were four different lengths and most men had neither body armour nor cloaks but the ranks were full philokles asked the priest of osiris and the priest of zeus to address the men each offered a brief prayer and then when the priest of zeus had intoned the hymn to the rise of day philokles gestured to abraham we have no priest of your god son of ben zion philokles said can you sing a hymn or some such this taxeis will use every shred of divinity on offer abraham nodded he was in the front rank beyond dionysius whose beauty included the kind of fitness that caused philokles to put him in the front he shuffled forward past dionysius no easy task with an aspis and stood in front in a deep voice he began a hymn hebrew of course fifty voices picked it up some sang softly as if embarrassed and some carefully as if forcing the words from their memories but they sounded well enough and they smiled selfconsciously when finished just as the aegyptians and the hellenes had done if all the gods are satisfied we need to do a great deal of work philokles shouted for the first time his words were greeted with the sort of spontaneous cheer he expected from good troops at supper back at leons philokles shook his head we were down he said now i see a glimmer of that fickle creature hope theron grunted and ate another helping of quail when do we march he asked and will we carry the baggage philokles shrugged i cant believe the delays ptolemy hasnt even decided on a strategy yet he vacillates so im told between offence and defence and he has twelve thousand slaves rebuilding the forts along the coast and six thousand being gathered to support the army we wont carry the baggage but if we have a defensive campaign these men will melt away priests or no priests and if the campaign flares into sudden battle before marching makes them hard again i dread it but after these words he brightened but i tell you gentlemen philosopher that i am something changed today i felt it i too will go to my task with a lighter heart philokles looked at diodorus when do we march strategos diodorus was lying with sappho he looked up when ptolemy is ready when the storm breaks when the macedonian faction makes their move he spread his hands or the day after tomorrow is your taxeis worthy to stand in the line no philokles said but give me twenty days of marching and i might speak otherwise diodorus shook his head ptolemy has all but given up if leon returned we might act all day long panion and the macedonians of his ilk pour poison in his ears im not sure that were any better off for stratokles being off the board if he is off the board philokles said the attack on satyrus might just have been the work of the macedonians diodorus said too well planned footpads stratokles philokles flexed his muscles reassured that they were returning trust me diodorus i know what the man does i did the same once for my part satyrus said id rather go and fight demetrios than be afraid of going out of this house ptolemy is afraid theyll sell him diodorus said like eumenes he finished his wine and lay on his back next to sappho shaking his head macedonians a slave came in and whispered to sappho and she rolled over coenus sends that our guest is awake she said it took a moment for that information to penetrate the gloom of the dining hall gods philokles said and headed for the door leosthenes returned to full consciousness without transition apollo having granted him life or so it seemed to satyrus the scarred man lay on coenuss spare couch and smiled at the men in the room friends he said coenus held his hand how did you come to serve that scum leosthenes shook his head stratokles for all his failings he is a patriot for athens i am an athenian philokles shook his head no wonder the macedonians own us all leosthenes if a man like you will serve a man like stratokles because he is a patriot he is a traitor twenty times over and hes trying to kill satyrus thats kineass son save your breath leosthenes said i will not defend him or cassander either im glad i have been taken by friends and i tried to kill kineas once myself dont try that argument on me nor will i betray the men who served with me either he managed a thin smile and shook his head stratokles thinks hes the smartest man in the world leosthenes was sinking again diodorus went and bent over him listen leosthenes your precious stratokles is getting ready to betray cassander i can smell it what does that make him we need to know where he is leosthenes shook his head glad to be taken by friends he said and subsided into unconsciousness apollo diodorus swore of all the useless fools to follow and a man like leosthenes too it is because men like stratokles can attract men like leosthenes that they are dangerous coenus he must be watched we cannot have him go back to stratokles now philokles took a deep breath and met diodoruss eye if he went back we could follow him diodorus said philokles shook his head there are limits to the duplicity a man can practise and not be tainted he said i have been past those limits and i will never go past them again diodorus nodded i thought youd say something like that athena send we march before long the sooner were out of this city and doing some honest fighting the better for everyone in the morning leon was back and the house was full of sailors and satyrus found that despite his sisters problems he had no trouble embracing xeno like a longlost brother demetrios has his army in syria leon said hes building up supplies in palestine and then hell come for us if he hadnt had his cavalry beaten up in nabataea hed be here now and wed be wrecked as it is weve hope in whispers xeno related how the lotus had ghosted up the palestinian coast and seized a message boat im off for the palace leon said diodorus the hipparch drank off his morning beer im with you brother listen i take it hes coming by land best i can tell leon affirmed hows ptolemy panicking diodorus said and then their voices vanished into the courtyard one hundred professional marines had a profound effect on the phalanx of aegypt as they provided fileclosers for every file and the drill smartened up immediately and forty sailors joined them most of them upperdeck professionals who owned some armour one of the sailors was diokles he attached himself to satyrus as soon as he came on the parade square displacing the greek boy who stood in the second rank behind satyrus with a polite nod and a gruff on your way then the greek whod been a little too shy of pushing forward for satyrus seemed happy to be moved to a place that was slightly less exposed satyrus rammed his buttspike into the sand and turned good to see you by all the gods he said he was surprised by the warmth of his own reaction so was diokles but he was visibly pleased his hand clasp was firm thought id try my hand at being a gent he said with a smile your uncle leon asked me to look after you he said really satyrus said fightingwise diokles said what did you think shut up and listen philokles bellowed and they were back to drill they faced to their spear side and they faced to their shield side they changed grips on their spears and raised and lowered their shields they marched to the sound of pipes and halted to the shrill blasts of a whistle in the afternoon a man was killed when they practised a fullout charge and he got a buttspike in the face from an incorrectly lowered pike anyone who was not sobered by that death was affected when the spartan stood them in ranks in the setting sun and marched them past the corpse even satyrus whose body was at the peak of training was ready to drop we march the day after tomorrow philokles roared his voice carried easily one of the reasons men trained in the arts of rhetoric phylarchs will attend me for instructions on what kit your men need to have water bottles hide or clay or bronze i dont give a shit but every man must have a water bottle a spare cloak understand the macedonians will have shieldbearers to carry their kit most of us wont that means we have to march light again phylarchs will attend me very well fall out by ranks and stack your sarissas carry on theron who acted as philokles second began falling out the ranks this process prevented the men from tangling the long pikes and becoming injured while being dismissed a real difficulty philokles gathered the three hundred men who led files closed files or led halffiles sixteen men to the file and read off for them a list of basic equipment every man had to have wool stockings heavy sandals a water bottle a spare cloak net bags for forage and a scrip or pack for gear and other things satyrus and abraham and many of the other phylarchs carried hinged wax tablets for notes and they pulled out their styluses and copied the lists but not all the phylarchs could write ill post it at the temples satyrus said theron who had overseen the dismissal of the phalanx shot him a grateful smile thatll save a lot of crap satyrus and no mistake make sure the priests know it too then men can ask for it abraham nodded ill take a copy for my father he can see to it that a dozen copies go around the market some men in my file may be too poor to afford all this one of the marines commented they seem like good lads but half of them dont even have sandals philokles shrugged i have to try he said abraham raised his hand sir i think that many of the merchants would help equip men from pride if they were asked philokles laughed well lad you seem to have volunteered figure out a way to discover which men cant pay and get them kit pick four men to help you abraham shook his head at satyrus me and my big mouth he said but he looked more happy than chagrinned busy i have to cover the temples satyrus said dionysius raised his hands in mock resignation then he smiled wickedly cimons should donate he said perhaps we could have the words house of a thousand blow jobs embroidered on our armour abraham put a casual elbow in dios side and then caught him thats enough from you you can write i assume youre not just a pretty face dio made a moue all i ever wanted was to be a pretty face he said in fact his face was red from sun and had the strange burn of a man who had been on parade all day in a helmet satyrus took diokles because the man was to hand and seemed determined to shadow him anyway can you write he asked diokles nodded sure hey maybe not my place but hades aint we supposed to go straight back to your uncles satyrus shook his head yes and no yes we are but this has to be done look its just a run to the temples he undid the wire that bound his tablets and handed a copy to diokles take this to every temple on the south side make sure it is copied fair and that you find some priest who has read it you sound like a navarch i knew once diokles said he looked at the alexandrion suspiciously but it was late afternoon and the streets were full of men and women of every stratum hardly a threatening crowd all right sir give it here where do i find you temple of poseidon last one before the sea wall on the steps satyrus wanted to be off the street as much as diokles wanted him off so he put his head down and hurried through the errand passing the list at every temple and watching as a clerk or an underpriest or an acolyte copied the list bouncing up and down as he waited watching the crowds from the relative invulnerability of manystepped porticos the temple of poseidon was last and he didnt see namastis which made sense as the young priest had drilled all day but the priest who copied the list was thorough and interested able to memorize without effort and satyrus found himself standing on the steps watching the crowds there was no sign of diokles and then he saw the man well down the street crossing from the temple of athena to the temple of demeter the shrine of herakles beckoned to him from across the avenue he had the time satyrus crossed the street as quickly as possible and went up the steps ignoring some acquaintance who called his name he gave his list to an acolyte to be copied and then stepped into the precinct of the temple searched his bag for a silver coin and found one and made a hasty but exact sacrifice under the gilt statue of the master pankrationist left arm stretched forward right arm back and holding a sword the lion skin of shining gold covering his back he felt nothing untoward except that the eyes of the statue seemed to be upon him and he dedicated his sacrifice to the dead boy cyrus theo would have his own sacrifices satyrus thought of the young mans eagerness to learn to sacrifice it seemed as if that was so long ago and he found that tears were running down his face then he was back out of the precinct and he went down the steps in a sombre mood master satyrus called a voice close at hand satyrus felt that something was wrong he felt as if the god had put a hand on his shoulder and turned him indeed he spun on the steps and stumbled when his right foot slipped off the marble step and his side absorbed an impact his ribs burned with fire only as the knife was withdrawn did he understand that he had been attacked hades a familiar voice cursed and satyrus got his hand on the attackers elbow they struggled for the knife and they exchanged blows satyrus took a blinding blow from the top of his opponents head and returned one with his fingers to his opponents eyes and then the man broke his hold in exchange for the loss of the knife and bolted down the steps satyrus was bleeding from his side he put a hand to it and it came away covered with blood and he felt queasy diokles appeared at his side i see him he said satyrus managed to get to his feet follow him he said see where he goes diokles hesitated but he said ill be safe in the temple satyrus said suiting the action to the word he dragged himself up the steps leaving a trail of blood diokles hesitated another moment and then raced away satyrus was helped by many hands in the end they carried him into the precinct and laid him on a bench his side hurt but the doctor who appeared in moments shook his head youre a lucky lad he said skidded off your ribs itll hurt for some days but the bruisell be worse than the cut he wrapped satyrus in the temples linen and hama came with four files of cavalry to escort him home hama was silent all the way home satyrus assumed that somehow he was going to be blamed but he had drawn the wrong conclusion youre hurt sappho said when he came into the courtyard diokles had managed to follow the wouldbe killer into the tannery district before he lost the man and he stood in the middle of a dozen of diodoruss cavalrymen describing the district while eumenes of olbia wrote his directions on a tablet i recognized his voice satyrus said remember sophokles philokles smiled ruefully who could forget he narrowed his eyes really here yes satyrus said dont tell me sappho put a hand to her throat wheres melitta she sent for dorcus speaking of armour diodorus said he shrugged this was supposed to be a dramatic moment but i think my thunder has been stolen somewhat dorcus returned in the bath my lady she said grimfaced sappho took a deep breath and let it out then another diodorus embraced his wife i think we have to let satyrus go his own way he said sappho raised her head very well she said how badly hurt are you my dear i assume that if you were dying someone would have told me satyrus managed a smile it shocked me when it happened but i assure you ive had worse in the palaestra eumenes stepped forward and saluted strategos with fifty men i think i could find him hold that thought diodorus said stay by me i need to consult with leon and with philokles before i send a troop of cavalry into the streets even for stratokles satyrus hadnt seen eumenes in weeks and he shook hands with the youngest of his fathers friends the gods keep you well he said eumenes grinned the gods need some help with you he answered diodorus stepped in i have a small surprise for you satyrus he shrugged i hope that you like it he led them all in from the courtyard in the main room there was an armour stand and atop it was the helmet of silver that demetrios had given satyrus three years before now under it was a fullsized cuirass of tawed leather and alternating rows of silver and giltbronze scales every scale a small disk so that the whole looked like the scales on a fish there was a gilt and silver vambrace for the sword arm and a pair of rich greaves i wish that melitta had as good satyrus said oh thats beautiful uncle who made it hephaistos much like diodorus agreed pleased that his gift was so well received philokles came in still in armour and glanced at the display goodness achilles is going to fight right next to me young man see that you dont blind me he turned to diodorus and eumenes so leons man followed the assassin diodorus said i think i can find him eumenes said i need fifty men philokles shook his head this whole city is right on the edge of a violent explosion he said the news isnt public but two of our senior officers have fled to demetrios this morning and just now ptolemy announced that he will march well set off tomorrow the phalanx of aegypt at the rear he smiled grimly if we send ten files of cavalry into the market the war will start right here diodorus nodded i agree what do we do philokles looked at satyrus we ask our aegyptian friends to find them for us the tannery district is almost entirely native the native populace is so disaffected with the macedonians tonight that they may rise against ptolemy himself foolish as that would be thats where they are satyrus any ideas satyrus was looking longingly at his new armour namastis the priest of poseidon hell help i wish i knew where to find him but the temple is the place to start accompanied by diokles and a dozen cavalry troopers whose military gear was inadequately disguised by borrowed civilian cloaks satyrus went to the temple of poseidon namastis greeted him from the top of the steps as if theyd made an appointment i heard what happened the aegyptian said thats what im hoping youll help with satyrus said listen my uncles say our city is on the edge of civil war aegyptians against macedonians namastiss face closed i wouldnt know anything about that lord satyrus call me satyrus by the gods by poseidon earthshaker priest this is about our city your city and my city men are manipulating the thetes alexandria cannot stand without lord ptolemy he is not the enemy the enemy is antigonus oneeye and his army if they come here they will sack the city no matter what promises he makes namastis nodded i know that but desperate men make poor choices satyrus shook his head these men who attacked me who are they and why no man of aegypt would do it i have let it be known that is to say it is known that you are a friend namastis looked deeply disturbed by his slip satyrus ignored it they serve oneeye understand the priest shook his head no i do not understand explain it to me satyrus had to smile to be honest im not positive that i understand myself oneeye is enemies with cassander the regent of macedon yes but it appears that they have a secret agreement to give aegypt to oneeye yes thats a common enough rumour why kill you namastis asked satyrus shrugged im an old enemy he said my father and mother left me a claim to be king of the bosporus the king of the grain trade namastis nodded ahh but then you are no more an alexandrian than the macedonians what do i seem to you to be an ingrate a barbarian i am a citizen no matter what my birth dont be as bad as the macedonians priest so what if i was born somewhere else namastis grinned the first honest display of emotion that satyrus had seen him show so he said and so how can this poor and unworthy priest help you king of the grain trade satyrus explained it to him the priest listened carefully and then nodded there are men who stand close to you all day he said and you dont know their names or where they live but they will spend the night searching on your behalf does that tell you something it tells me that i should learn their names satyrus said namastis grunted that would be a start he said he produced an oyster shell from under his robes im not sure that i should give you this given what you have told me except that now i understand why the lady of heraklea has to do with an upstart alexandrian gentle man satyrus snatched the oyster shell the conflicting emotions of the last one banished i am to say tonight namastis raised an eyebrow i wont ask if you will go satyrus took a deep breath thats right friend he said dont ask at the base of the steps he looked out over the sea wall and thought about his sister why cant you be like this all the time shed asked at sea he nodded and made the sign of poseidon eloping wasnt as difficult as it might have been for another girl first melitta wasnt afraid of the world outside sapphos womens quarters she knew the streets and she had clothes in which she did not look like a rich greek girl second she had weapons and a strong desire to use them third she had somewhere to go xeno had offered to meet her and be her escort but thats not what she wanted she dropped off her balcony on to the beach and froze as she heard movement to her left barefoot in the sand she moved slowly and carefully back into the shadow of the house at the same time drawing her sakje akinakes she saw her brother drop to the sand from his own balcony and she almost laughed aloud but she couldnt be sure that they were on the same side when it came to her running away she wondered where he was going and then she caught a glint of gold he was well dressed amastris she gave the superior smile of the sister crouched down on her haunches and waited for him to vanish up the beach when he was gone his footsteps lost in the noise of drunken sailors she picked up her armour and the leather wallet that held the rest of her boys clothes and ran off along the strand past the beached squadrons of ptolemys fleet until she reached some lower and thus less opulent houses where she cut inland she leaned against a stable to clean her feet before pushing them into thracian boots other expeditions in boys clothes had taught her that her hands and feet gave her away more than her breasts carefully bound and now almost flat under her sakje jacket just short of the northern agora she stopped straightened her clothes and began to walk purposefully like a man in a hurry not like a girl running away the agora was busy despite the darkness and she wanted to linger there were torches everywhere and the heady odour of burning pitch filled the air along with the reek of patchouli and the smell of burning garlic and unwashed people she wanted to be part of everything the night market was a strange world where the thieves and the pornai and the beggars ruled where soldiers were customers and slaves paid to be entertained in some ways it was the daytime world stood on its head as menander had so rightly observed menander was sometimes a denizen of the night market himself and his plays were full of nightmarket expressions she bought a skewer of meat probably rats or mice from a girl no older than five who took the money with the concentration a young child gives to an adult task while her mother serviced a noisy soldier in the booth behind her i couldnt i had to come xeno said beside her and she looked up into his eyes you found me in the night market you must be part dog she said she ought to have been angry but instead she squeezed his hand they wandered from stall to stall paid a blind singer with a kithara for his songs and watched a troupe of slave acrobats perform for free what their master charged heavily for them to perform at a symposium or a private house the archercaptain is sitting over there with his mates drinking wine and telling lies xeno said with a smile i told him a bit about you not about you being a girl of course about how you were small and you can shoot she kissed him on the nose as she had seen boys do with their men even in public i take back all those things i say about you behind your back she said xeno winced there was some fear in him some hesitation and it annoyed her lets go and meet this captain she said they wandered across the agora avoiding a deadly brawl so sudden and explosive that xeno was splattered in blood and melitta found that she had her akinakes in her fist before she thought to draw it this your little archer master xenophon asked a deep voice while xeno was still wiping the blood off his face he was looking at the body as if hed recognize the victim any moment but he turned captain idomeneus he said my friend bion melitta said offering her hand to clasp the archers he was a cretan by his accent and he looked like a caricature of hephaestos his face was handsome enough but he was short and wide with powerful arms and short legs indeed he only topped her by a couple of fingers she must have looked at him too long because he gave a fierce grin like what you see boy my dick is short and broad too hah he had a mastos cup in his hand and he drank wine from it no offence boy you can shoot anything melitta said ive been shooting since i was four years old i can hit a target seven times out of ten at half a stade i can you can string a bow avoid bragging boy its too fucking easy for me to test you tomorrow what kind of bow do you have let me see it he didnt seem drunk but a whole life spent with philokles had taught her that some men could operate efficiently through a haze of wine she took her bow from its gorytos and handed it over he whistled sakje maybe you aint so full of shit boy its your size made for you she nodded yes she said you sakje boy he asked people going to come looking for you there was something in his tone that she liked a firmness that showed his command skills so she told him the truth i have family here she said they might look for me even if they find me i doubt theyll make a fuss rich kid idomeneus asked melitta shrugged what do you think she asked trying to roughen her voice and sound tough the cretan grabbed her by the ear and pulled her face close to a torch she flinched grabbed his hand in a pankration hold and rotated his arm using the hand as purchase whoa the cretan called hold she let him go he rubbed his shoulder i think you speak like a boy who had a tutor he said i dont want to waste my time visiting magistrates and archons and he shrugged his eyes flashing in the torchlight if i didnt know better i might wonder if you were a girl not that i particularly give a shit you understand just that if an outraged father or brother kills me ill haunt you you as good as that bow says you are yes melitta said the cretan shrugged okay im desperate which this young animal has no doubt told you we need archers the way a man in the desert needs water youre on if your father comes for you though ill hand you over in a heartbeat understand me boy melitta stood straighter yes sir pluton none of my boys call me sir idomeneus grinned his teeth glinting in the torchlight can i buy you two a cup of wine to seal the bargain melitta wanted to accept but xeno shook his head i thought id go to the slave auction he said melitta flinched you know how uncle she reconsidered her sentence what do you want with a slave she asked idomeneus gave her a steady look xeno glanced around nervously i want a shieldbearer he said i have all my share from the ship all the rich boys have a shieldbearer a fool and his money the cretan muttered listen boys never buy anything at the night auction half those poor bastards were just kidnapped off the street and the other half are shills who follow you home just to help their allies rob your house i cant afford anything at the day market xeno said he was avoiding melittas glares go without the archercaptain said with all the firmness of age and experience oh fine ill go with you otherwise youll both end up on the block argon he called and another cretan stepped away from a big fire downed the wine in a cheap clay cup and handed it to another man with you humpback whos this boy argon was taller and handsomer and didnt look very bright bion just joined were going to the night auction come and cover my arse idomeneus grinned and the two men slapped each others backs the four of them made their way to the auction where a deep throng of onlookers many of them slaves themselves gathered to bid on the dregs of the dregs of the city of alexandria melitta was disgusted by the whole process she shared her uncles views on every aspect of the trade most of the people on auction were hopeless the kind you saw on the fringe of the agora in the daytime begging and stealing many scarcely capable of speech they were scrawny ill fed most had few teeth and all flinched whenever a free man came too close the only healthy normallooking specimens were children and their version of normality was abject terror at being sold one boy sobbed incessantly what kind of parent sells her child melitta asked in her head but the answer was plain before her as two of the children were auctioned off by a toothless bastard with an evil smile the two children he sold were bruised and silent watching the torchlit crowd with all the interest of dead souls watching the living melitta found that her right thumb was rubbing the hilt of her long knife she wanted to kill the man the next lot was a single boy the one who kept sobbing under his dirt and his scrunched unhappy face he was healthy blond and larger than most of the other children xeno was shifting nervously aware like most boyfriends that he had annoyed his lover and unable to think of a way to make it right without giving up his precious project of buying a slave melitta could read him so easily that it hurt her hurt her opinion of him but without weighing the morality of her actions she smiled up at him buy that boy she said he looks strong enough my aspis is taller than that kid xeno said but he looked at the boy again hes whimpering zeus soter hes big and in a few years hell be strong besides hes just the sort a certain uncle of ours tries to rescue dont be a git xeno melitta tried to whisper but the crowd was hooting for the next lot to be stripped two whores being sold for debt idomeneus caught something of what she said because he leaned in that boy he looks all right ill go and look him over the cretan shrugged boy that size is like having a kid though have to teach him everything but if he lives a good investment the crowd was so anxious to see the pornai that the hawker was having trouble getting bids on the blond child i fucking hate seeing kids sold argon said he spat at the man who had sold the two children now standing at arms length from them counting his silver coins the man felt the moisture and whirled in anger argon didnt move fuck yourself clod the clod flinched and backed away argon was a big man melitta nodded i wanted to kill him she said really argon asked want to melitta realized then that she was in a different world that argon meant just what he said three silver owls idomeneus said argon dont make trouble bion did you stir him up the stupid lout argon take a deep breath and back off the cretan shook his head hes the kind of man who makes other people call us cretans xeno handed the officer three big silver coins and idomeneus made them vanish never flourish money like that at night he said you boys should get some training in real life anyway boys yours he reached out and took a leash from the hawker xeno took it and pulled but the boy didnt move and the crowd was howling for the prostitutes to be stripped melitta put her arm around the boys shoulder come on boy she said he sobbed and hunkered down idomeneus picked him up as if he was made of feathers lets go somewhere bright and quiet and look at what you bought he said camp satyrus dropped from his balcony to the beach with a minimum of fuss except for the pain in his side over his ribs which burned anew as he hung from his fingers for a moment then he gathered the bundle hed thrown from the balcony moments before and sprinted off down the beach the sound of his feet covered by the shouts of the men and women on the beach the golden lotus was sternfirst on the beach between the hyacinth and the bow of apollo her bow awash ready for action in minutes and her crew were drinking and enjoying the company of hundreds of alexandrias waterfront whores who had turned the beach into an outdoor market with wine and food and other delights for the thousands of oarsmen from ptolemys fleet satyrus had no difficulty slipping through them in a plain cloak ignoring a few offers of companionship and his own sense of what he ought to be doing and seizing hold of the rope that led to the ships boat moored alongside the oar box he pulled off his boots and climbed aboard loosed the rope and rowed away satyrus rowed across the harbour in the light of a new moon the upsidedown crescent that the sakje and the aegyptians both called the maiden with her legs spread whatever powers sophokles and stratokles possessed satyrus didnt think they could track him across the harbour he rowed right past the guard post at the palace without a challenge not the first time and coasted silently into the tiny harbour scarcely larger than a courtyard where ptolemys own barge loaded and unloaded what he was doing was insane but he was smiling for the first time in days her directions were specific he was to come to the gate amastris had no way of knowing that the front gate full of macedonian guards was the last place he wanted to be he moored his boat at the trade dock and climbed the ladder to the pier which was empty ptolemy had problems of his own he was not going to fill his palace full of foot companions the night before he marched satyrus had bet on it and his bet was coming up at the top of the ladder he stripped off his chiton and pulled on the dun chlamys of a palace slave slaves seldom wore a chiton he looked longingly at his sword and then tossed it on top of his chiton one thing no slave ever had was a weapon barefoot like a slave he stole into the palace no one challenged him there were slaves in every corridor but they ignored him although he got enough glances to see that many of them knew he was not one of them neither however did they seem inclined to betray him he passed through the court and the megaron carrying a wine pitcher he found on a chest and then he went out of the main entry under the wall painting of zeus he left the wine pitcher in the entryway and walked with his head bowed across the great courtyard towards the main gate the gate guard tonight were cavalry companions the rulers own hetairoi and thus men he could have trusted many of them were friends of diodorus and although most were macedonians their fates were so tied to the house of ptolemy that they would never betray him or by extension satyrus he sighed for all his extra effort and in between the beginning and end of that sigh he spotted a slender shadow amidst the pillars and scaffolding of the new gate a man on guard laughed bitterly or well all die he said and his words carried clearly across the night satyrus moved as quietly as if he were hunting ibex in the south or deer on the tanais twice his bare feet touched gravel and he had to move yet more carefully and then we was in the shadow of the new portico in crawling under the edge of the scaffold he managed to get sand under his bandage nonetheless he was able to come up to the pillars without being discovered and he reached out just as she turned dont scream he said she opened her mouth put a hand on his chest and then put her mouth up to his you came she breathed her kiss was everything he remembered and nothing no shred of conscious thought entered his head for many heartbeats she kissed him for so long that he breathed the air from her lungs and she took it back from him and then she leaned back against the pillar as if all the strength was gone from her legs you are naked she said i am pretending to be a slave he answered besides my nudity shows my physique and my physique shows that i am ready to do my duty as a citizen gods he was parroting philokles in the middle of kissing amastris it shows more than that she said she ran a finger down his chest how did you get here she asked but her tongue didnt let him answer and her hand closed over his manhood and she laughed into his kiss a low laugh full of promise then before things got out of her control she took him by the hand and led him back away from the gate screened by the line of scaffolding until they slipped by a pair of torchbearers and under the columns of the main wing of the palace this is where you first kissed me she said that seemed to demand certain actions and then they were moving again just the sight of her goldsandalled feet seemed the most erotic thing hed ever seen and he followed her in a daze until they emerged from the line of pillars the gardens she said as they passed between the gateposts of entwined roses an odd observant part of his mind noted that she knew the gardens very well as she led him past the maze to an arbour adorned with a statue of a nymph possibly thetis of the glistening breasts i never thought that you would actually come she said into his ear and then licked it satyrus picked her up and carried her to the bench put me down she said but her voice was soft satyrus pulled the golden pin that held the shoulder of her dress and began to kiss down her neck over her shoulder and without pause up the curve of her breast even as he sat carefully on the bench training was good for many things oh she said satyrus no oh i never thought that you would come no he asked raising his head her eyes sparkled in the near dark reflecting distant torchlight like a thousand stars no she breathed not that sort of no or perhaps i dont know oh my dear he straightened she drew him down for a kiss and wriggled off his lap on to the bench wheres my pin she asked he produced it and she carefully thrust it through her gown without repinning her shoulder and then she turned back to him i dont want to lose anything she said her eyes as big and deep as night itself then she unpinned the other shoulder and put the pin in the same place and turned to him with a smile that took his breath away now she said gold pins do not grow on trees the sun streaked the horizon as he rowed back his mind buzzing his shoulders curiously tired make it possible for ptolemy to give us to each other amastris had said that phrase filled his head and he rowed across the harbour at a speed that might have won a race the beach was silent except for the snores of the oarsmen and their companions a pair of women bathed in the sea as he rowed up and one of them rose out of the water aphrodite she called coming out of the sea just for you satyrus laughed i have nothing left to give that lovely goddess he said and both the girls laughed nor have we they called his good humour lasted until he climbed into his room where philokles sat by his empty bed where the fuck have you been the spartan asked and without listening to an explanation philokles said we were attacked last night he shrugged i thought you were taken dead im sorry satyrus said dorcus is dead nihmu has a knife wound in her shoulder three men in through the womens quarters the spartan shook his head gods so you were gone all night and melitta too unless her note is forged she says she has eloped with the god of war so stratokles failed by the will of the gods satyrus ducked out of his room and down the hall scattering servants he went into sapphos wing past the guard auntie he called sappho emerged in a persian robe slapped him and then embraced him you were with a girl she said is this what we taught you you smell of sex you little fool she said but she hugged him all the tighter satyrus wondered why he ever thought that he could get away with anything thats quite the expensive scent kallista said from behind sappho were you with phiale by any chance why didnt we think of that he shook his head im so sorry he said now if we could recover your sister i could stop worrying sappho said melitta lay under the stars her two mens cloaks crossed over her and her legs entwined with xenos his new boy lay on the other side full of soup asleep the boy was a sadder case than melitta had guessed mother dead father dead killed by their own owner melitta thought about the boys story trying to piece together a sixyearolds account of his life something rang something was trying to fit with the rest of her head like a piece in a mosaic xeno was too adoring and in some ways his adoration was more difficult than anything but she had shot ten bullseyes out of ten at fifty paces by torchlight and even the archercaptain of the toxotai was impressed with her him she had a place among the archers who were training to face demetrioss elephants xenos adoration seemed a small price to pay melitta wondered what her brother was doing in her rush to get free of the smothering confines of leons house she hadnt thought about what it would be like to be separated from him despite his many failings he was after all her twin where had he gone xeno was already snoring she smiled at him the bulk of him so familiar and so unfamiliar and smiled at the thought that none of the other soldiers considered that there was anything remarkable in their sharing blankets and cloaks she wondered how long she could keep up her role as a man as long as she could t he army of aegypt was supposed to begin to march with the dawn their departure was marked with riots and protests in addition to all the usual difficulties and the sun crossed the height of the sky before the cavalry had marched the baggage train of wagons carts donkeys and porters filled the road before the first squadron departed and there were more and more noncombatants with every unit the feeling in the column was ugly and the feeling in the streets of the city was worse the foot companions were rumoured to have mutinied in their barracks but they did march sixteen files deep with shieldbearers sandwiched between the files of soldiers so that the men walked unencumbered while their slaves carried their armour their weapons and their food unlike the cavalry many of whom had worn their best for the departure partly to make a show and partly to overawe the populace the foot companions disdained to do the same they walked off in dusty red chitons grumbling there were gaps in their ranks and rumour said that some men had deserted or worse the other taxeis also marched each body with two thousand men formed four deep in huge long files followed by carts and slaves only lucky men in these less prestigious formations had a shieldbearer again there were gaps files where a man or two were missing rumours swept the column that there was a plot against ptolemy that the macedonians would rise and murder him that aegyptians would murder him wilder and wilder stuff the phalanx of aegypt continued to drill on their parade near the sea at the head of the parade was their equipment every man had a bundle to carry carefully tied and the phylarchs worked their way down their files inspecting every mans campaign gear before passing their files on to the captains who inspected them again when they were inspected and passed which took until noon with the poorer men scurrying to the market and back for lastminute donations they stacked their gear at the head of the square and did drill until the shadows began to gather and then diodorus appeared the strategos of the rearguard philokles said the very same diodorus replied saluting we wouldnt even make it to a campsite tonight my friend he said pointing at the bundles can your men camp here on the parade philokles shrugged i expected nothing less he said satyrus stepped up by diodoruss leg all day weve heard rumours he said he was lightheaded with lack of sleep whats happening the mutineers have gathered diodorus said but his eyes were on philokles and not his nephew as we discussed eh brother philokles gave a strange halfsmile just as we planned he saluted and then waved at rafik his trumpeter who came at a run he turned to satyrus lad get abraham and tell him to send for the food we discussed rafik sound phylarchs to the front the call rang out and then philokles bellowed on me satyrus found himself teaching a strange mix of men how to cook over an open fire most were city dwellers with no more knowledge of how to cook than they had of how to sleep comfortably on the bare ground as he discussed the best mix of cheese and barley in the wine and water the merits of an egg dropped in the mess and the taste of the result with a hundred new mess cooks he also gathered that the men were on edge excited too something was in the wind when the suns long rays welcomed the evening he found philokles standing at his elbow eating a bowl of barley soup and chewing on a piece of fish not bad phylarch your men eat well satyrus grinned dont look at me diokles brought spices pepper who brings pepper to war me diokles said bread and olive oil strategos philokles pressed close to his student diodorus has sent eumenes into the southern quarter with guides that namastis provided he said in an hour well know one way or another he kept his voice low your sister gods only know how sent a note with a slave boy to leon the slave boy told us where stratokles is he and all the macedonians who are bent on mutiny have gathered together they probably mean to attack the palace he looked around ate a mouthful of soup and then seeing the confusion on satyruss face raised an eyebrow its stratokles lad satyrus nodded fatigue forgotten may i come he asked if the quarry is all in one place if our information is right well strike tonight i mean to use some of our men aegyptians and hellenes together diokles grinned blood em a little thats the spirit so thats why we stayed behind satyrus said hmm more of an effect than a cause lad good soup pick three men and join me at the head of the square in an hour swords and shields only yes sir it was full dark by the time they were in the southern quarter the moon provided some light and there were guides aegyptians often men from the phalanx that satyrus recognized more than a few of them took his hand and shook it or pressed it to their lips he didnt understand why he had their devotion but he did that had a taste more bitter than sweet the tannery stank the smell was so bad that men sneezed and spat silence philokles whispered wait until you smell the dead on a battlefield he had xeno with him and xeno was holding a small child by the hand satyrus clasped hands with his friend whos the kid i bought a shieldbearer xeno said he looked pained he knew how to find that athenian tyche the boy was trembling satyrus knelt down next to the boy whats your name he asked the blond boy turned his head away and hid in the folds of xenos chitoniskos satyrus your sister is serving as an archer xeno said sappho will kill her satyrus said he shrugged every time he looked at the head of the alley his stomach turned over and the daimon of combat was starting to sing in his ears and his hands shook satyrus had no idea what his tutors plan was he led his file where he was told to the back gate of a warehouse where he saw hama an underofficer of diodoruss hippeis waiting with another armoured man hama touched his brow when he recognized satyrus lord he whispered what are we doing satyrus asked because philokles had vanished into the moonlit dark xeno and the child trailing along hama shrugged when the trumpet sounds we charge that gate hama said he shrugged again diodorus says prisoners hama showed satyrus that he had a persian horsemans mace so i brought this the night was full of men satyrus thought that philokles must have brought half the phalanx with the other half acting as guides ares and aphrodite as diodorus liked to say with the dismounted cavalrymen there were two thousand soldiers waiting in the dark philokles reappeared with his trumpeter the nabataean youth called rafik xeno and the child were gone what are all these men for satyrus asked im using a hammer to crack an egg philokles said its a good strategy to use if you have the option put another way more is more satyrus was going to ask another question but philokles put out his hand steady were going before they see us ready satyrus nodded philokles raised his hand and rafik put the trumpet to his lips satyrus ran for the gate with hama behind them a dozen phalangites with a log jogged along and satyrus felt foolish as he stepped clear to allow the ram to hit the gate it blew open as if zeus had struck it with a thunderbolt the courtyard was full of men dozens of men perhaps hundreds some in armour all with weapons they might have been formidable except that they were under attack from thousands of men coming out of the dark and they were taken completely by surprise that didnt affect satyrus who was the third man through the back gate the first was philokles who had a shield a huge greek aspis and a club and the second was hama with his mace each felled a man and then satyrus was facing a panicked macedonian who was screaming not that satyrus was listening he punched his shield into the man and knocked him down then headed for the building he fought a second man just heartbeats later turning the man away from philokles and then stabbing him in the chest as he tried to fight most of the men were trying to surrender but the phalangites had their blood up and they were breaking heads satyrus hesitated shouting at men he knew to spare the men surrendering and hama stepped in front of him and burst open the main door with his shoulder and got an arrow in his shield but this didnt slow hama by a pace he put the shield up and pressed forward virtually blind his speed a wicked surprise to the man behind the door then he stopped quick as a cat and cut under his shield breaking knees and shins satyrus followed hama through the door an arrow whispered evilly by his face and then he was facing a rush from a side room despite his strength he was shoved back against a wall and then the man who slipped past him screamed as one of satyruss aegyptian rearrankers spitted him on his long knife thanks satyrus said the man grinned and shook his head im with you lord he said then diokles pushed forward past the aegyptian lost you in the press diokles said they entered the side room some kind of wine shop and two more men rushed them from behind the trestle tables that marked the landlords portion of the shop one man had an axe but he hesitated when satyrus faked a cut at his head and then he was dead the other man fell to his knees diokles killed him anyway running the sharp point of his kopis into the mans neck at the back of the shop were stairs up to the exedra or so satyrus assumed the front door of the shop burst open and there was diodorus in full armour its me satyrus shouted hold diodorus bellowed he came in and a dozen troopers came in behind him satyrus knew most of them now or never easy enough to hesitate and let them go first diodorus or eumenes perhaps or diokles or his nameless aegyptian filepartner fuck that follow me satyrus yelled and went for the stairs he roared and his fear fell away inside he laughed with triumph there was an archer on the stairs satyrus got his shield up and felt the blow as the arrow went into his shield popping through the bronze face and the papyrus leaves and the poplar wood to prick his arm he roared again banished the flood tide of fear and his legs powered him up he thrust his shield into the archer and his sword under it over it everywhere until the blood flew and the man fell a nameless stranger not the athenian doctor who he saw in nightmares but some poor mercenary toppling off the stairs with his guts spilling free like an anchor chain then he turned as a knife glanced off his scale cuirass i surrender said the man who had just failed to kill him satyrus held his swing the man backed away dropping the knife i surrender he said and ran back through the door satyrus eumenes of olbia called from the base of the steps wait boy the man who had just surrendered fell backwards against him pleading please he begged help he squeaked phalangites and cavalrymen had used ladders to storm the exedra and were killing every man they found stop that satyrus said prisoners he roared in his best stormatsea voice men glanced at him and the madness left their eyes diodorus was shaking his head we have a hundred prisoners he said ares and aphrodite macedonians what in all the shades of tartarus were they doing here philokles shook his head i can guess brother but we do not have the men we came for satyrus pushed the prisoner from the head of the stairs forward gone an hour ago he said pure ill luck and his whole fucking household and all his guards lord the terrified mercenary said lord he left to arrange that is to kill lord ptolemy zeus soter diodorus said theron and eumenes began shedding their armour without comment and satyrus joined them running he asked and both nodded all the athletes satyrus shouted and the cry was taken up and dio came and a dozen other young men they stripped to their chitoniskoi threw their sword belts over their shoulders and they were off they ran in a pack through the darkened streets their own men slowed them for many blocks as the thousands philokles had employed hampered them curious for news and at one post insistent that they prove themselves good men obeying orders who cost them precious minutes until a hippeis officer verified them and they were off again they ran like sprinters up to the palace gate and found no guard there just a pair of dead slaves where in hades do we go eumenes asked satyrus was familiar enough with the palace he led the whole group across the courtyard to the entry to the megaron where a pair of cavalry hetairoi barred the way with bare steel stratokles seeks to murder lord ptolemy theron yelled his words echoed around the rows of columns and the courtyard and the garden the two cavalrymen faced them clearly prepared to fight hold hold i know that voice shouted a greek from within the megaron and then gabines came through the archway with more guards eumenes as the senior officer stepped forward lord he said i am one of lord diodoruss officers we have just taken a hundred of the mutineers more i think praise the gods gabines said we are told that stratokles the athenian means to kill lord ptolemy eumenes said we know gabines answered wearily you are too late he has already failed thank the gods satyrus said and behind him his companions gave a loyal cheer you may not thank the gods gabines said looking at satyrus lord ptolemy left today in secret disguised as a trooper he is safe gabines shook his head but stratokles the traitor has taken the lady amastris part vi flexing the blade bc s tratokles rode easily most of his attention concentrated on controlling his craving for water the rest of his attention fell on his captive who rode calmly her head up and occasionally favoured him with a smile her smiles disconcerted him around him rode the best of his hired killers lucius at their head and beyond just a few stades unless he had utterly missed his mark lay the army of demetrios the golden son of antigonus oneeye the youngest and handsomest of the contestants in the wars that men called godlike alexanders funeral games stratokles straightened his back trying to erase layers of fatigue and a dozen hours in the saddle and trying to arrange his thoughts to prepare for the interview to come he had failed so far to kill ptolemy best not to dwell on that hermes god of spies his mouth was dry how long did you plan my abduction the princess asked she smiled and dropped her eyes the very model of feminine dignity stratokles shrugged it was on the fly my lady he admitted he rubbed the stump of his nose why he asked himself did i say that surely a more elaborate fiction would have won more prizes than that single bare fact so having failed to kill the regent of aegypt you thought that i might do as second best she asked as if deeply interested in the inner workings of his mind he straightened his back again and cursed inwardly at his own lack of discipline his craving for her good opinion lady it is my intention to barter my services to antigonus for a satrapy phrygia lacks a lord you would make an effective ally even a consort or so i reasoned my my she said they rode in silence for more than a stade and she began to fall behind she pulled her shawl over her face and rode with her face covered and he alternated thinking about that face and about his desire for water then she pushed her horse to a faster walk and nudged the weary animal back to a position next to stratokles and he felt his heart rise with foolish happiness when she did because my father is the tyrant of heraklea you mean or because you observed some quality in me that would make how did you put it an effective ally stratokles considered answers from the offensive to the flattering but again despite years of practice he found that his mouth was spitting out the truth your father and his city of course although he said with a bow now that i have your measure despoina i know that i underestimated your qualities oh fairly spoken she laughed throwing her head back no falsity at all for a man as careful and as wily as you to admit that you underestimated me is quite a compliment that made him smile when had he ever smiled this many times in an hour you take my meaning exactly lady as they rode he found himself telling this lady the truth if for no other reason than that she asked and seemed content to ask riding by his side and talking as if he were an old and trusted advisor it made him feel foolish and old they were laughing together by the time they reached the first cavalry pickets its like speaking to pericles lady amastris said stratokles glowed you tried to kill old ptolemy demetrios asked he was sitting on a plain wood camp stool in the midst of a circle of his companions but the simplicity ended there his golden hair and his matching golden breastplate contrasted with the leopard skin he wore in place of a cloak and his feet were encased in magnificent opentoed boots of tooled and gilt leather indeed he looked like an image of one of the heroes theseus herakles or a burly achilles stratokles had seen him before but never been confronted with all his charm and charisma face to face yes lord stratokles said well high marks for the attempt but id rather defeat him myself hand to hand if i can do it thats the stuff that myth is made of athenian demetrioss youth shone from him like light from a lamp stratokles was still struggling with his shoulders both of which wanted to slump down lower and lower until he lay on the ground and slept hed had a hard week and he disliked how the golden boys eyes slid off him it was a reaction men had always had to his ugliness cassander didnt do it cassander could at least meet his eye you will certainly master ptolemy my lord in combat or any other way but those that love you will do their best to ease your path he said pericles couldnt have put it better in the privacy of his thoughts stratokles was already doubting his commitment to this arrogant pup perdikkas son of bion one of demetrioss young officers with curly hair and an equally curling lip that promised arrogance snapped his fingers what of the macedonian officers he demanded stratokles shrugged i arranged for the leaders of the mutiny to meet and i made sure that they were armed in preparation for the attack on ptolemy in any event they didnt come my fault perhaps perhaps they got cold feet we hear a rumour that they were massacred demetrios said his eyes no longer rested on stratokles he was assessing the qualities of the young woman who sat quietly behind stratokles swathed in wool one demure ankle and foot the only clue to her age and vitality stratokles felt more than protective towards the girl he stepped forward to draw the commanders eyes i doubt it wouldnt you spread such a rumour if you feared a mutiny lord is ugliness like a disease that can be caught demetrios asked and all his companions laughed im sure that youve done me good service athenian but it wearies me to look at you what did you bring me is that a present briseis brought to my tent stratokles couldnt resist briseis was taken from achilles lord nothing more fitting then although i have a hard time casting you as achilles lets see you girl demetrios rose from his throne she is the daughter of the tyrant of heraklea she is a modest girl stratokles moved swiftly to her side she moved back to put stratokles between her and demetrios no other action could have tugged so firmly at the shreds of stratokles sense of honour a tattered garment but one with more body to it than he himself might have expected demetrios found himself reaching out towards stratokles men behind him put their hands on their sword hilts dont be foolish ugly man the golden boy said just give him the girl stratokles political sense a daimon finely honed from a generation of athenian politics with a voice of its own told him that he could have anything he wanted with this golden boy if he gave him the girl or better yet the voice suggested the more you struggle before giving this new master the girl the better this new master will value her and her giver for the first time in some years stratokles ignored the dispassionate daimon that ruled him on affairs of state his flexible wit sprang to his aid im no fool he said calmly and neither are you lord to offend the tyrant of heraklea when your father depends on his ports and his shipping she has the ankles of aphrodite demetrios said he put his hands on his hips i dont give a fig for the tyrant of heraklea i imagine that youve used the aphrodite tag before stratokles replied amastris laughed at his elbow and he felt like the king of the world then she allowed the folds of her himation to fall back off her head and she stepped forward you may care nothing for my father she said and she smiled at demetrios but i promise you that he will have a care for me the sun of her smile overwhelmed her words and demetrios clapped his hands together have her conducted to a tent throw the occupants in the sand see to it that she wants for nothing demetrios bowed low let me rescue you from this toad amastris turned the sun of her smile on stratokles she shook her head he is my toad she said i trust him and i do not know you something hot boiled up in stratokles heart his face flushed and his nose hurt i will protect you he said thickly the wrong words he knew and said the wrong way he didnt care she flipped her himation back over her head but her eyes remained on his he hadnt noticed how dispassionate they were before yes she said you will her smile was visible only at the corners of her eyes but it was for him it was a long time since he had seen eyes do that for him it made him wince then she stepped back his guards surrounded her we will be pleased to occupy any tent you see fit to give us stratokles said no toad she is mine ill see to it that you are paid a talent or two for your betrayals but she is mine perhaps ill add to your reward for bringing her really she makes the conquest of this strip of sand almost worthwhile demetrios laughed and all the companions laughed with him aphrodite goddess of love you didnt imagine that she found you anything but horrible the man who abducted her have you ever looked in a mirror while i the golden one chosen of the gods will save her from your venomous clutches demetrios laughed shes moist for me now toad that last made all the companions roar with laughter stratokles had the strength to smile he stood straight i am the hero of this piece he thought not you boy me the toad this is not how your father deals with men lord stratokles said above the laughter schoolboy insults insult only schoolboys demetrios turned suddenly his eyes narrow you dare to tell me what my father would or wouldnt do you call me a boy his companions fell silent your father offered me the satrapy of phrygia i have done my best to honour my part of the bargain and i still have agents in place now slowly carefully as if the words were dragged from him now you call me names and take from me my ward and offer me a few talents of silver stratokles shrugged kill me lord for if you dont i will tell your father that you are a fool my father demetrios began then he stopped as if listening to someone speak demetrios stood like a statue staring off above his friend paesanders head and then he turned back you are right to upbraid me sir the alteration in demetrios was so total that stratokles still in the grip of his own acting felt that he had to step back before the power of the gods demetrios bowed to the athenian it was ill of me to call you names although you must confess that you will never model for ganymede some of the companions laughed but the laugh was nervous because demetrioss voice sounded odd stratokles inclined his head in a token of agreement i have never bragged about my looks nor have i ever sought to model myself on ganymede he said pointing the barb at the handsomest of demetrioss companions a beautiful boy who stood next to paesander although i gather that some do demetrios laughed theres more to you than that ugly face he acknowledged we are on the edge of battle the battle that will give us aegypt then we shall reward all of our faithful soldiers it was wrong of us to speak in terms of a few paltry pieces of silver please accept our apologies demetrios bowed and stratokles had to fight the urge to forgive him out of hand that is power he thought and the girl he asked demetrios smiled let it be as she wishes stratokles led her away with demetrioss friend paesander as a messenger the daimon hectored him that he had fallen prey to a pretty girl the pursuit of stratokles didnt last out the night midnight had come and gone before they found the means he had used to leave the city a boat waiting off the palace and his head start was sufficient to guarantee his success hell run to demetrios philokles told satyrus the young man was dryeyed tired wrung out and incapable of further emotion subsequent days did little to raise his spirits they marched from the city into the desert and the next five days were hard stretches of bright desert punctuated by delta towns and river crossings so that a man could be parched with heat and an hour later nearly drowned the mosquitoes were the worst that satyrus had ever known descending on the army in clouds that were visible from a stade away what do they eat when there arent any jews abraham asked mules dionysius answered the taste is much the same satyrus marched along in silence sometimes lost in dark fantasies of the torments amastris must now be suffering and again tormenting himself with his own inability to rescue her few things are more calculated to indicate to a young man just how small his roll is than marching in the endless dust cloud and bugs of an army column that fills the road from morning until night one tiny cog in the great bronze machine of war at night they camped on flat ground by branches of the nile and drank muddy water that left silt in their canteens every morning satyrus made himself roll out of his cloaks and go around the circle of fires helping one mess group start their fire finding an axe for another and reminding a third how to cook in clay without cracking the pots all in all the cooking was getting better if only because the phalanx of aegypt was beginning to acquire followers every village seemed to have girls and very young men who wanted to go anywhere if only to leave the eternal drudgery of the land on the river a girl was accounted a woman when she was twelve and old when she was a grandmother of twentyfive or so most of them were dead when they were thirty satyrus had heard these things but now he marched through it and every morning there were more peasants at his campfires cooking the food and eating it and the files of shieldbearers began to fill in so that the phalanx looked more like the foot companions on the third day philokles walked up and down the ranks ordering men to carry their own kit let them carry the cook pots philokles roared carry your own weapons you spent the summer earning the privilege dont sell it for a little rest the fourth morning and already amastris was like a distant dream satyrus had fallen asleep with abraham and he awoke to find his friend shivering satyrus was shivering too but he knew what to do he was up in a flash and threw his chlamys over the other man and then ran along the thermoutiakos a stream of the nile and then around the camp until he was warm well upstream he came across a pair of marines he knew and diokles leading a goat whered that come from satyrus asked we found it didnt we one of the marines answered wandering like diokles wouldnt meet his eye didnt actually belong to anyone he said satyrus rubbed at the beginning of a beard that was forming on his jaw you know what philokles says about theft wasnt theft diokles insisted wandering about like the marine said the other marine was silent i know where you can find your sister diokles offered suddenly if he intended to distract his officer he certainly succeeded you do satyrus asked ill catch up with you diokles said waving at the marines then he turned back the way he had come shes in the archer camp all the sailors and marines know it you wont send her back hades no satyrus said they walked half a stade to where a dozen young men were shooting bows at baled forage for the cavalry she got us the goat diokles admitted really satyrus asked do you really want to know diokles answered youll find her ill see you in camp satyrus jogged over to the men shooting at the bales it wasnt that hard to pick out his sister if you knew where to look he came up and swatted her on the backside the way soldiers in armour often did to each other melitta whirled you bastard she growled he laughed they embraced youre insane satyrus said no more than you brother she said any word about amastris satyrus sat on his haunches in the sand a new talent for a world with no chairs no word at all stratokles took her and sailed away he wont bother her melitta said shes too clever after a moment she said much too clever in a way that suggested that all that cleverness wasnt entirely admirable im afraid for her satyrus frowned i know how stupid this sounds but i want to rescue her thats not stupid brother if it was me id fucking well expect you to come and save me she laughed in her throat a deeper sound than shed ever made at home nice swearing satyrus said i get lots of practice melitta said i have to go back and make sure the breakfast gets cooked satyrus said and saw xenophon coming up his whole demeanour sheepish now i know where you sleep he said with more venom than he meant xenophon wouldnt meet his eye and satyrus was sorry to find that he didnt care much ill walk back with you xenophon said he and melitta exchanged a significant look no satyrus said you have your armour on and im going to run see you soon what do you call yourself bion like my horse she flashed him her best smile and he returned it then he waved nodded to xeno so as not to seem rude and ran off for his camp an hour later his belly full of underroast goat he was marching again they marched through natho and boubastis picking up more followers and meeting carefully assembled grain barges that supplied the army and kept the looting of the peasants down to manageable limits at boubastis philokles caught an aegyptian and a hellene stealing cattle from an outlying farm and he brought both men into camp at spear point what will you do with them diodorus asked he and eumenes rode in while the sun was still bright enough for work a barge was unloading bales of wood for fires there wasnt enough wood in the desert to build a raft for an ant as the aegyptians said satyrus listened attentively because the camp was buzzing with rumour about what the spartan had planned i intend to hold an assembly of the taxeis tonight what else should i do philokles asked diodorus laughed most of your men arent greek philokles philokles shrugged so you say when it comes to a desire for justice and a desire to have each man have his say who is not a greek you want me to kill these men out of hand as an example i do diodorus nodded thats exactly what i want philokles shook his head youd need a different commander for this group then strategos dinner was good because the barges were less than a stade away and there was plenty of food and plenty of fuel just five days into the march the phalanx of aegypt was harder and more capable than they had been in the near riot of leaving the city they could cook and sleep and eat and pack and march without much fuss but the assembly was a new adventure and a dangerous one because there was death in it the hellenes knew what was expected and so all the men gathered in a great circle in the crisp night air above them the whole curtain of the heavens seemed to be on display the stars burning with distant fire every man was there even those who had the mosquito fever or the runs that seemed to come with too much nile water at least for greeks soldiers philokles voice was as loud as any priests these men have disobeyed my orders and the orders of the army in sparta in athens in macedon these men would forfeit their lives but only his voice grew over the murmur of the men only if the assembly of their regiment approved it who will step forward and speak for the army prosecuting these men for their crime philokles eyes pressed on satyrus into the silence he stepped i will prosecute satyrus said philokles looked around who will speak for these men the two culprits grinned around at their comrades and were surprised to find many serious faces looking back at them finally abraham stepped into the silence i will defend he said satyrus looked at him surprised that his friend would oppose him but then he shrugged understanding that abraham no more wanted to defend them than he wanted to speak against them this was duty the evidence was brief and damning offered as it was by the phalanx commander satyrus asked a number of questions to make their guilt clear and then shrugged he had read every case ever pleaded in athens he could quote isocrates for instance but this didnt seem the place for such flights of rhetoric if we rob the peasants he asked the silent men of the phalanx why should they help us and what are we but enemies no different from those who come to conquer his words went home he could see them like an arrow launched from a distance that after a delay strikes the target he bowed his head to philokles and stood aside abraham stood forth i am not a greek he said but in this i think that the greeks are right that a man should be judged according to the will of his comrades because his comrades are best fitted to judge the crime abraham turned so that he was addressing the aegyptians who filled one half of the circle i ask all of you who has not eaten stolen meat in the last week who has not lifted a bottle of honey beer let that man vote that these miscreants be killed for myself i am no hypocrite my friend has told us why we hurt our own cause when we steal and i hear him i will not eat another stolen goat but until the taste of that stolen food is gone from my lips i will not condemn another to death philokles was suppressing a smile when he stepped past the two advocates well said by both he looked around fifteen hundred men stood in near perfect silence remember this moment philokles said to the assembly this is the moment that you began to be soldiers he looked around with approval and still they were silent so you are all goateaters how then should i punish them even their advocate did not trouble to claim them guiltless namastis stepped forward from among the aegyptians will you punish both alike he asked philokles put his hands on his hips what do you think he asked dont anger me priest namastis shook his head old ways die hard he said if you seek to punish both alike he said let them carry pots with the peasants until it is your pleasure to return them to the ranks a sound like a sigh escaped from the men gathered in the dark whoa said the guilty hellene a marine from the hyacinth silence philokles said any dissenting opinion another murmur like wind passing through a field of barley but no man stepped forward philokles nodded sharply theron pick the two best shieldbearers and swear them in to the phalanx these men may carry their kit if either of you desert you will earn the punishment of death serve and you may be restored philokles raised his voice do you agree men of alexandria they roared a shout that filled the night the eighth day found them at peleusiakos where mountains of wheat and cisterns of fresh water awaited them with barges of firewood and tens of thousands of bales of fresh fodder for the cavalry twelve thousand public slaves laboured at fresh earthworks in the brutal sun raising platforms of logs and sand and fill brought from the sinai and even from the river the ramparts rose four times the height of a man and the platforms carried ares engines that could throw a spear three stades or a rock the same to the north lay the sea and to the south the deadly marshes which offered no hope to an army even with the breeze from the sea the stink of the swamp mud overwhelmed the smell of horse and camel and the filth of men satyrus marched with the rest of his phalanx into a prebuilt camp and handed his kit to a slave to be cleaned they had tents of course the interior of the linen tent was airless white hot and brilliantly lit so that no man could sleep there in the daylight but the extent of ptolemys preplanning was staggering satyrus put his shield against his section of the wall and put his spear in a rack set for that purpose later after a dinner cooked by public slaves with enough mutton to quieten the loudest grumbles satyrus stood on the parapet with his uncles and their officers andronicus the hyperetes of the hippeis of exiles crax and eumenes all looking out over the sinai and the road to gaza were not doomed at all philokles said ive underestimated our farm boy diodorus laughed just as you were meant to mind you if the macedonians had managed to get their mutiny together wed never have got here but look at it every man in the army is going to look around at the walls and the camp the tents the spiked pits and the stores and every man is going to say the same thing ptolemy can hold this with slaves philokles said with mice something like that diodorus said he had wine in a canteen and he handed it around satyrus was cowed in the face of so many veterans but he mustered his courage so he said when will we fight diodorus laughed and slapped satyrus on the shoulder thats the great thing lad well never have to fight demetrios is a child but hes not a fool hell take one look at this and cut a deal then hell turn around and march home so no one wins satyrus said and amastris remains with the traitor diodorus shook his head but eumenes who was younger and perhaps understood satyrus better cut in thats not true satyrus first we win all we sought to do was defend aegypt we win thats an important concept for a soldier to understand second he shrugged i know its not the stuff of homer but even now i suspect that amastriss uncles and father and every other lord on the euxine and quite a variety of other busybodies will be speaking for her and when the golden boy looks at these walls and puts his tail between his legs well eumenes looked at the other officers and all three of the older men smiled well what satyrus asked torn between annoyance at being treated like a boy and the knowledge that to these men he was one what eumenes hell probably make a treaty just to get his men fed philokles said amastris will go on the table to buy some of that grain satyrus spat in disgust diodorus flexed his shoulders under his cuirass i want to get this bronze off my back satyrus i share your disgust you look very like your father when youre annoyed philokles put an arm around his shoulders he is growing to be like his father sos his sister diodorus said and they all laughed even satyrus it was almost a week before they saw the scouts of the enemy and another week before demetrios brought up his infantry the cavalry went out of the works and skirmished the hippeis of tanais rode forth and brought back prisoners sakje and medes and seleucus ptolemys new second in command won a cavalry battle somewhere to the south and east on the nabataean road the pikemen of the phalanxes played no part in any of this most of them sat in camp but the phalanx of aegypt drilled all day every day they marched up and down the roads and they charged across broken ground and open ground and they dug on the walls when ordered because philokles refused to give them a rest they worked harder than anyone but the slaves melitta watched them march by sitting on the great earthwork wall with her legs hanging over the edge to catch the breeze legs which drew no notice at all in a camp so full of available peasant girls that no one gave her a second look that thought made her smile beneath her feet xeno and satyrus and all the young men she knew there was dionysius his hair plastered to his head under a filthy linen skull cap making a sarcastic comment to his file partner she could see it on his face the lot of them marched by they were singing the paean to apollo to keep in step and they sang it well enough to move her bion bion officer she pulled her legs under her and swung off the parapet to drop to the hardpacked gravel of the sentry walk phylarch she called in her low voice idomeneus was a cretan like most expert archers he wore quilted armour and carried a massive bow and melitta suspected that the spadebearded mercenary knew she was a girl and didnt care she saluted him as shed been taught listen up lad im to take my best hundred archers well ride double with some of the horseboys and try a little ambush theres likely to be some plunder what do you say ill get my kit melitta said whoa horsey sunset at the camp of the exiles he grinned professionals they wont leave us to die i think melitta hoped her face didnt register her reaction exiles is what ptolemys army called diodoruss hippeis from tanais those were her people theyd know her too late to back out ill be there she said she accepted the derision of her peers with grace when she appeared on parade in persian trousers shed bought from a slave like most of them she had a big straw hat the size of an aspis and under it she wrapped her head in linen against the sun there wasnt much of melitta daughter of kineas to be seen the hundred picked toxotai didnt so much march as stroll across the camp good archers were specialists like craftsmen and they didnt have the kind of discipline that the men in the phalanxes needed in fact they derided the phalangites as often as they could cavalry were a different matter cavalrymen often had a social distinction and they considered all infantrymen to be beneath their notice melitta as the child of the sakje shared their disdain and it was odd to receive the cutting edge of it from men she knew pluton they smell crax laughed he trotted his horse along the length of the toxotai his charger actually brushing melitta he stopped and leaned over by idomeneus this is the best you could do they look like dwarves ido crax actually pointed at melitta that one cant be more than twelve her captain didnt get angry instead he pointed at bion fall out he said string your bow crax laughed well at least hes strong enough to get it bent say thats a sakje bow lad melitta had the string on with the practice of years without waiting for an order she put an arrow on her string chose a target a javelin target across the exiles parade square a good half a stade away and loosed the arrow rose drifted a little on the evening breeze and struck the target squarely so that the wooden shield moved and the thunk echoed hmm diodorus said that lad looks familiar to me crax diodorus had a duncoloured cloak over a plain leather cuirass and two spears in his fist crax reached down and slapped idomeneus i take it all back cretan theyre all apollos own children at least they wont burden the horses after a quick inspection ten of them were sent to fill all the water bottles a task melitta always drew because she was clearly one of the youngest then they paraded with the hippeis and every archer was assigned to a rider bion was assigned to a macedonian deserter she didnt know well although she did know him but just as she prepared to climb on to his mount carlus trotted his gigantic charger along the line captain says i take the boy carlus said the macedonian shrugged hes the lightest thats for sure not sorry to ride without him though theyve all got lice he turned his horse and moved back along the file carlus lifted bion with one hand hands around my waist lad he said carlus smelled of male sweat and horse not a bad smell at all but your uncle says that if you want to go with the army you should be with us carlus said his voice was level we can keep you alive i can keep alive i have comrades who i value she said and she knew that life in the camp of the exiles would not be real like life with the toxotai she was gaining a reputation as an archer and as someone to be taken seriously at knucklebones or even boxing with the hippeis shed be known for what she was kind glances and helpful hands and some laughter behind her back carlus shrugged everyone needs to make their own way he allowed the moon was bright and the desert empty and they rode fast the kind of speed that medes and sakje practised and few greeks could manage every man had two horses or even three and they changed every hour it was exhilarating to go so fast across the moonswept landscape with such comrades the sense of purpose was remarkable and heady the hippeis were exactly as silent as required loud when they felt secure silent as a necropolis when they began to close on the enemy camp and the toxotai were infected by their absolute conviction that they would win at the second halt for a horse change idomeneus grinned at her someday id like to train archers this well he said theyve been together twenty years bion replied and then realized she had blundered at least thats what the big barbarian im with said idomeneus nodded still he whispered you kids done chatting crax asked he was already mounted and he extended a hand to the cretan i hope were not keeping you up too late the party is just about to start no one bothered to tell bion the plan until they halted a final time just after the moon had set carlus was pointing at the ground what do i do she asked carluss grin was ghastly in the moonlight dig a hole and climb in well draw them to you at first light when you hear the trumpet start shooting he shrugged not my plan she rolled off the broad back of carluss elephantine horse and gathered her small pack she did not of course have a pick or a shovel all around her she could see other archers with the same difficulty they scraped shallow pits with their hands and some who had helmets used them while idomeneus walked up and down cursing and demanding that they dig faster by the time the very first rays of dawn turned the eastern sky pink she was lying in the cool sand with her cloak over her and a few hastily gathered blades of swamp grass over her cloak it wasnt much to her right she could see another cretan argon with his rump sticking up because he was a lazy sod and couldnt be bothered to dig hard why am i here melitta asked herself in the privacy of her hole shed been warm enough while working but now the sand was soaking the warmth out of her and she didnt have her cloak around her and she was cold and none of this made any sense the cavalry had ridden away she must have fallen asleep despite everything because suddenly there was movement around her and the sky was very bright indeed she raised her head and saw dust felt the hoof beats of horses many horses at a gallop wait for it idomeneus called he was standing in the shadow of a big rock string your bows a hundred capes wriggled and the sand seemed to roll like the sea as the toxotai strung their bows lying flat even the desert generated too much moisture to leave a bow strung overnight to bion it seemed as if the galloping horses were right on top of them and still idomeneus didnt call and the trumpet didnt sound louder and louder impossibly loud and terrifying stand up the cretan called eumenes was right in front of her two horselengths away and even as she stood his horse passed between her and argon his head turned to watch the rear and his cloak streaming behind him she put a heavy arrow on her bow as she noted that there were dozens no hundreds of horses but only a few of them had riders they stole a horse herd she thought it made her smile such a sakje thing the riderless horses raised quite a dust cloud she wrapped her linen wimple over her mouth and tilted her straw hat down to block the sun now she could see almost a stade and there were two big bodies of cavalry the enemy this was different from anything shed ever done different from fighting pirates she found that she was grinning like a fool she looked around she could hit at this range but she wasnt sure she was allowed to shoot just half a stade away were hundreds of enemy cavalry and they were coming fast a heavy cretan arrow leaped into the air argon damn him and it swept high before stooping like a hawk and falling just short of the lead company you fucking idiot do you want to eat horseshit tonight you useless turd idomeneus was not yelling but he was right there wait for the trumpet more quietly ares what a fuckface the enemy were so close that they must see the archers but they continued to canter along making the earth rumble melitta was shaking the way she had before telling aunt sappho that shed lain with xeno where was xeno anyway and whose plan was this the trumpet rang bion loosed without thought then watched as another arrow was dragged from the quiver and nocked red fletch upward bow up full draw four fingers over the mass of horsemen loose third arrow the lead company burst under the volleys of arrows the first arrows hit them in a tight clump most of them falling from high and hitting the unprotected hindquarters of the horses so that the animals screamed and fell or rolled or stood and fought the air bellowing their agony with noises that made melittas sakje stomach roll over with discomfort that killing mere men never caused her the effect on the company to her front was total where there had been a hundred cavalrymen there was a dust cloud and the screams of the dying nothing came out of the cloud but a single riderless horse and even as she watched the third volley of arrows vanished into the rising sand to a thin chorus of new screams the second and third enemy companies didnt hesitate they swept wide going for the flanks of the archers having changed from pursuers to desperate men within three flights of arrows the men on bions side of the engagement had long beards and persian dress they rode good horses and moved fast their captain wore rippling golden scale mail and had a hennadyed beard bion shot him from the saddle a pretty shot even at close range before he could react to the new threat coming at his own flank serried troops of the exiles coming over the low sand and mud ridges to the north and south leaderless his men were still focused on the archers flaying their front when the exiles ripped into their flanks heralded by a pointblank volley of heavy javelins that could knock a horse flat even so determined men bearded easterners who had grown up fighting sakje on the frontier and knew a disaster when they saw one didnt hesitate one group went straight for melitta she nodded even as she fitted another arrow to the string fingers suddenly clumsy a spasm of fear even while part of her mind was above the whole battle thinking things through their leader knew hed be safer going through the ambush than turning tail a good leader they were going to make it to her position and she couldnt stop them and nobody else could either she loosed hit or miss she didnt know because she threw herself flat and rolled in a ball as the medes went over her their sabres reaching for her that was her moment of fear blind and waiting to be pinned to the ground like a pig in the agora but then they were past and argon was making a shrill whistling noise she looked around dust no more and ran to the cretan who lay in his tooshallow pit with blood under his elbows and his back arched in pain his throat was cut just barely cut the extreme reach of a medes sword and he gave up as she watched his body ceasing to struggle his rump sinking into the hole he had dug for himself his head turned and he saw her his mouth moved no sound she never knew what he tried to say because a blow to her side suddenly knocked her flat her left arm and side rang with pain but she wasnt dead her hair was full of sand she spat got a foot under her the mede had a sword like a sakje akinakes long and narrow and he got a hand on the javelin hed thrown at her while she rose to her feet he hesitated when he saw her trousered legs and she got her sword out from under her arm before he could finish her off she didnt hesitate she put a hand up against the heavy javelin missed her grab and stepped in anyway swung the sword with the whole weight of her body behind it he got his akinakes up to parry but her blow sheered down the blade and cut into his fingers and hand from brutal momentum he froze in pain she swung hard cutting so deep into his neck that her sword stuck and he flopped in the bloody sand still alive arms reaching for her he got a hand on her leg and she kicked slammed her fist into his face blood from the neck wound splashing over both of them got the sword free from his muscle and bone and cut again and again and again and again until the sword flew from her fingers from exhaustion to land a horselength away in the sand she knelt by the body empty of anything later she got up and fetched her weapons drank some water and walked off down the line to where the other survivors gathered around idomeneus argons dead she said carlus rode by her i cant find her he roared and a dozen hippeis rode back the way she had come into the battle haze the archers watched wearily uncaring as to what the fuss was melitta didnt care much herself so she walked boldly across the sand to diodorus im right here she said diodorus looked down at her and his dustcaked face creased in a smile you look like your father sometimes he said he pointed at andronicus and gave him some visual cue that caused the gaul to blow a complex trumpet call and all the exiles began to rally several exiles waved at her and eumenes pointed her out to crax and carlus who shook their heads carlus rode over you scared me missy melitta spurned the hand he offered her to mount bodies to loot she said and i suspect there are horses for everyone big guy and if you call me missy again in public ill gut you carlus grinned as if hed just won a contest but his voice sounded gruff you and what army archer he spat and worked to hide his grin melitta walked off into the sand and she made herself pull rings from fingers there was some good armour and a lot of decent swords not that she needed either after the first minutes she couldnt bear the sounds the wounded horses made and the sight of the men in particular the sight of men she liked ignoring other men dying in agony at their feet while they stripped their bodies sickened her so she pulled a handsome saddle blanket from the corpse of a horse and a rider fallen together and she took the bridle and bit from hennabeard who shed dropped herself and then she walked all the way to the horse herd well clear of the carnage and cut out a pretty mare tall and dark with four white feet she put the tack on dealt with the mares unease with the smells and the whole situation and got herself mounted kit bundle bow and all and she had a few gold darics to wow the boys in camp idomeneus found her waiting with her horse you wont leave me for these centaurs will you he asked i shouldnt have put you at the end of the line in your first fight but you shoot faster than most of the others was it bad kid she wanted to say something witty the way satyrus did always brave always ready with a quip finally she said i didnt throw up idomeneus nodded his lips were as pinched as she felt hers must be you saw argon go down she shook her head medes got him in the charge we all hit the sand he didnt get flat enough idomeneus nodded again help me get him on a horse then the cretan said hes been with me five years least i can do is put him in the ground they recovered all their dead and crax and eumenes gathered armour and built a trophy and left it sticking out of the sand a taunt at the whole army of demetrios whose tents were just visible ten stades away on the horizon when they rode off with plunder and prisoners and two hundred new horses the trophy glittered behind them under the new sun until they crested the big ridge south of the walls and then they were home demetrios didnt make a treaty after two weeks of staring at the impregnable works of peleusiakos losing cavalry fights and watching his plans for conquest unravel demetrios decamped in the night leaving his fires burning and retreated across the sinai along eight hundred stades of coast road the morning after he vanished ptolemys army was awakened by trumpets from the door of his tent satyrus could see the cavalry in the next camp rolling their blankets and putting their bronze kettles in old linen bags theyre moving satyrus shouted at abraham who was still in the blankets with basis an aegyptian girl hed adopted philokles came up already in armour and carrying his shield and spear shieldbearers get packed march in one hour satyrus see to it that every man has food in his belly and more in his pack satyrus saluted but he caught his tutors arm what is it he asked philokles nodded in satisfaction oneeyes golden child has made a mistake lad and now were going to chase him i dont understand satyrus said you said no battle i was wrong philokles said if we catch him short of his depot at gaza hell have to fight i never thought ptolemy had the balls the spartan made a face no thats wrong like demetrios i forgot that ptolemy had the balls satyrus stood in the sand west of gaza on the coast looking at the thousand pinpoints of fire that marked the army of demetrios his army is huge dionysius said abraham stood with xeno and dionysius and a circle of their friends and filemates they had now been in the field long enough that there were friendships starting across the helleneaegyptian divide enough friendships and strong enough that namastis would share wine with diokles and dionysius i thought we werent going to have a battle abraham said wryly he handed some really bad aegyptian beer around they were six days out from the stockpiles at peleusiakos and there wasnt much of anything according to philokles demetrios might have avoided battle if two things hadnt worked against him satyrus felt very allknowing he was the only man in the phalanx who had information every evening straight from the command staff and it did a lot to reinforce his reputation the first was seleucus who stayed on his southern flank and harried him so that every man he had lost in the sands of nabataea came back to haunt him my uncles have fought his cavalry three times and put up a trophy every time he grinned thinking of what eumenes had told him about a certain fight in the sand horseboys dionysius said but he lacked his usual venom xeno took a swig of the beer spat and pretended to crouch as if in terror at the taste ares id rather drink water he said listen mock the horseboys all you want friends youll be happy enough to have them around if it comes to a fight listen to the old sweat abraham mocked but he smiled and xeno smiled back satyrus full of information to impart tried to be patient while he waited for silence listen he said philokles says that the worst of it is his own pride so that even when his fathers advisors told him to take the elephants and the best of his infantry and race for his depot he refused hes close dionysius said he drank the beer and made a face ares and aphrodite this is horse piss no listen im serious he would know xeno shot in and roared with laughter he didnt get to score against dionysius often try this then said a low voice and satyrus found a wineskin pressed into his hand he turned to see his sisters eyes bion he reminded himself he gave her a hug whos that dionysius said aphrodites insatiable cunny gentlemen our satyrus has himself a boy a boy in barbarian trousers satyrus how could you when you had me there was a brief silence and then abraham slapped his thighs and roared with laughter and so did all the men by the fire even namastis who was not usually loud in his demonstrations had to hold his gut xeno satyrus and bion stood silent while half a dozen young men squirmed dionysius actually went to the ground your face dionysius managed your abraham stumbled over to satyrus and put his hand on his arm god you look fit to kill us joke friend his eyes flicked over bion and in a stage whisper he said we know and then he sputtered a few times and subsided satyrus found that he was smiling so was xeno after a while bion smiled too fuck the lot of you he said in his low voice dont go leaving angry dionysius called or if you do leave the wine that got another round of laughter until voices from behind them ordered them to pipe down half a skin of wine later dionysius declaimed his hymn to the breasts of an unknown avatar of aphrodite bion drank wine indifferently and when dionysius lay down on his cloak he found a snake harmless bion assured him several anxious moments later philokles and theron came to drink the last of the wine theron gave bion a long look but said nothing philokles produced his spartan cup and filled it who among you poured a libation he said that silenced them what a thankless bunch of recruits you are the noisiest men in the camp and no libation he poured a good half of his cup into the sand i offer this wine to all the gods but most of all to greyeyed athena to keep us safe and to that god most men never name gentle hades take only the old and leave the young to enjoy their youth thats a chilly health strategos dionysius said philokles shook his head men will die tomorrow men you know you may be dead yourselves lack of sleep could kill you as dead as an enemy arrow lads i doubt that ten of you could get any ill from one skin of wine but i think its time to get in your cloaks and sleep still theron put in after taking his sip of wine id rather hear my front rank laughing their arses off the night before a fight than pissing in their beer philokles smiled anyone afraid satyrus managed a smile and a nervous silence greeted philokles who laughed youre all lousy liars philokles said but brave ones theron put an arm around his shoulders know what satyrus this will be my first fight in a phalanx im so scared i cant get to sleep he raised his cup philokles took the cup from his hand and drained it this will be my eleventh fight in a phalanx on a big field he looked around at the younger men and they looked at him the very image of the warrior im as scared as any of you more because i know what i face tomorrow but listen no philosophy here lads just the straight bronze as we say in sparta keep your spot in the line and get through their pikes as fast as you can and well be fine were really quite good tomorrow youll see how good we are will we win philokles dionysius asked philokles scratched his head like a farmer lad i dont know we ought to lose ptolemy is taking a mighty risk there are still men in this army macedonians who want us to lose so the greeks and the aegyptians have to fight extra hard see now go to bed and they did part vii the contest bc s tratokles had plenty of time to be disgusted with himself t he worst of it was that he had been wrong he the great political philosopher had backed the wrong horse as surely as demosthenes had with alexander it wasnt that demetrios the golden was incompetent he was ruthless and he had strokes of brilliance and his will was strong it was simply that he was too young and too inflexible to command an army his own brilliance and beauty clouded his judgment he assumed himself to be a child of the gods and behaved accordingly and even when events proved him wrong he couldnt be seen to change his mind stratokles watched as the golden boys strategy unravelled and he shook his head quietly he didnt need spies to tell him how badly their cavalry was losing the foraging war he saw the wounded the empty saddles the disgust of the saka and mede nobles on the other hand his networks his carefully paid webs of informers and messengers hung together and he had at least two reports a day on the treason of ptolemys macedonians the foot companions the elite of ptolemys army would change sides as soon as the fighting started the deal was done when they changed sides every macedonian on the field would know who the winner was and the golden boy would owe his throne to a wily athenian and his web of informers if he was a wrestler stratokles commented to his onetime kidnap victim demetrios would be at the edge of the sand with one foot on the line down two falls to one hmm amastris said why did you bring me here i thought more highly of the boy and his father than either deserves stratokles answered having begun on a path of scrupulous honesty he didnt deviate it might be said that i erred amastris nodded except stratokles spread his palms ah despoina there are some things even you are not yet ready to hear you have other loyalties let us say that i have the means to save the golden boy from his folly and thus render him deeper in your debt than would have been the case if he had been as competent as you imagined him to be amastris settled on to her cushions and smiled at him she had no problems looking at his face you are a superb student he said and she glowed at his praise stratokles had always devised plans in layers so that when one layer failed he had a reserve sometimes two or three he looked at his new student of statecraft and he thought lovingly of his new reserve in demetrioss camp palace a set of tents as big as xerxes captured tents in athens he had a young hostage a glowering handsome boy who claimed to have had alexander himself for a father herakles in macedon herakles was a rumour now that stratokles had laid eyes on him it was hard not to plot difficult to keep himself from imagining what he could accomplish for athens for the world if he had alexanders heir and this brilliant girl he looked at her again and knew that she was not for him but neither was the satrapy of phrygia suddenly it seemed like a limited ambition a wasted life he didnt need to be lord of a rich province instead he could stand behind the throne of the earth the trusted advisor the hands gentle hands on the reins of state athens would be the richest city in the world and he would have a statue in bronze on the acropolis you have seen the man that calls himself herakles stratokles said to his student she allowed herself a smile yes he is the son of alexander he may well prove to be the most important player on this board stratokles stroked his beard hes younger than my satyrus and has no experience of anything but being a hostage amastris waved for a cup of wine his experience is not the issue stratokles said his blood is the issue ahh she replied a child of yours by him alexanders grandson could guarantee the future of heraklea for ever stratokles said carefully she didnt blush instead she smiled demurely and shook her head or make my city a target for every adventurer with an army she said and my child and me ahh stratokles responded and they both laughed nonetheless he sent for his lucius and gave him some exacting instructions so while stratokles had plenty of time to be disgusted with himself he was not he was too busy plotting s atyrus rose with the first of the light feeling as if he hadnt slept at all bitten by insects and with his left hip sore from sleeping on the ground his guts churned and every time he looked out over the sand towards gaza they flipped again he went out beyond the horse lines and did his business but it didnt help before the sun was another handspan higher in the sky his guts churned again and he felt as if he had the same trots theyd all had camping on the nile when he stood still he shook after a while he ran it wasnt a decision he just dropped his chitoniskos on his pack and ran off naked except for his sandals he ran a stade and then another along the streets where men lay in rows some awake facing the dawn and others snoring in bliss or simply in exhaustion he ran until he passed the sentries to the west where the road led towards aegypt and then he turned and ran back without disturbing basis or abraham he used pumice to polish the scales of his cuirass and then he buffed the silver on his helmet until it shone like the moon like thousands of other men he went down to the beach and swam in the cool dawn far down the beach towards gaza he could see thousands of other men performing the same ritual he went back to his pack and took out his best red chitoniskos and then he put on his armour all of it even the greaves which he had only worn for parades then he walked around the phalanx of aegypt feeling hollow and made sure all the men ate a good meal melitta was up with the dawn having lain with xeno and regretted it somehow not the act itself but the surrender the triteness of sex before battle xeno was going to face battle with a thousand friends and he was scared she understood she was scared herself she and her people were facing the elephants archers javelin men all of the peltastai they were out on the sand digging pits and putting stakes in the bottom ptolemys greatest fear was the power of demetrioss elephants fifty of the monsters where ptolemy didnt have a single one so the light troops went out in the new dawn each attended by a handful of slaves and they dug this time they had tools ptolemy prepared for things like this she dug and dug she thought of argon and his tooshallow hole and she dug more she was soaked in sweat by the time yet more slaves came with food and she got out of her hole and ate slurping cool water from a clay cup and then eating mutton soup so fast that barley streamed down her chiton she regretted every minute that shed stayed awake the night before but she found as the sun rose and the colour of the world changed that she didnt have to be worried about being pregnant that was for tomorrow today she had elephants both armies threw out clouds of skirmishers first demetrios with all of asia in his fathers hip pocket put out several thousand peasants with javelins and the occasional sling or bow satyrus watched them he had his shield on his foot and his spear in his hand but most of his file was still donning armour or finishing a bowl of soup rafik stood with philokles at the head of the parade the trumpet still on his hip food was not helping satyrus felt that if he let go a fart his breakfast would stream down his legs with the last of his courage he gritted his teeth abraham came up put his shield facedown on the ground and raised an arm buckle my cuirass he asked sure satyrus said wheres basis praying abraham said satyrus got the buckle done hold my spear he asked i have to piss again he ran off to the edge of the parade and ran back still feeling as if his guts would leak out picked up his shield took his spear from abraham and tried to stand tall rafik blew the trumpet satyrus felt his knees lose their strength he wondered how men who were condemned to death felt he hated his weakness but the weakness was real priests philokles called one by one the serving priests came to the head of the parade all along the line men sacrificed a hundred animals died in as many seconds satyrus was surprised through the fog of his fear to find that the phalanx of aegypt was next to the foot companions the macedonian footguards were just a few paces to the right of his file silent except for the occasional order the men in the ranks had their armour on but their sarissas were being carried by servants their priest cut the throat of a young heifer out on the sand in front of them men died javelin men and archers and naked men throwing rocks four stades from the line of priests the battle had started the enemy light troops were terrible like slaves driven forward with a whip in fact for all melitta knew they were driven forward with a whip all of idomeneuss toxotai were together a betterarmoured band than they had been before the ambush spread at twopace intervals over several hundred paces of ground aegyptian peltastai with small shields and heavy javelins moved through them to face the hordes of demetrioss peasants and the fighting such as it was didnt last long before the peasants ran idomeneus came by and offered her an apple she smiled at him and took it i love apples she said another band of psiloi came out of the rising dust and hurled rocks at the peltastai who charged and drove them off but this time a few of the peltastai were left to bleed in the sand she could feel the earth pounding under her feet before she saw them they were immense too big to be real they moved with an unhorselike gait and they were slow but they were coming ahead of them came a fresh wave of psiloi men with light armour and round bucklers who seemed to have some spirit stand your ground the aegyptian officer yelled his voice was not reassuring she found that shed finished her apple she dropped the core and kicked sand over it without thinking about to be our turn i think idomeneus said luck bion shoot straight same to you pal she said and then she strung her bow satyrus could see the light troops as far as his eyes could see several thousand men their movement raised a curtain of dust but it was nothing like what it would be later in the day and nothing like it had been at gabiene just the thought of the fight on the salt flats made him take a sip from his canteen the army is going to move forward philokles called be ready this far out there was no marching when the trumpet sounded men lifted their shields and trudged forward in open order their servants still carrying canteens and food some men in other taxeis were still making their servants carry their shields the movement sounded like thunder and the ground moved as sixteen thousand pikemen and their servants and shieldbearers almost thirty thousand men and not a few women walked forward the polemarchs and the phylarchs watched attentively and men at the flanks of formations roared at each other because crowding or bowing at this point could disorder the whole line which had been formed so carefully satyrus saw humps moving opposite him elephants he stumbled and forced himself to stand upright ares ares god of war do not let me be a coward curiously the elephants had a steadying effect on satyrus most of all because he knew that his sister had to face them and he wanted her safe thinking of other people was a strange relief from fear but it was real as if fear was something selfish aha satyrus smiled he turned and looked at the pale faces of his companions philokles was still ahead of the phalanx as was theron on the opposite flank watch your spacing aegypt satyrus called he forced a smile at the front rank theyre only elephants gentlemen fifty paces forward and then a hundred and then another hundred the elephants were two stades away less and he could feel it when they moved in less than a minute the great brown and grey creatures would be among the ptolemaic skirmishers and his sister would be facing the monsters halt the trumpets called fall out the shieldbearers philokles called this is it abraham reached over shield and all and they embraced satyrus reached past abraham to clasp arms with dionysius and then with xeno xeno held on to his arm im sorry he said behind him his boy flashed a shy smile and turned to leave the ranks satyrus grinned and hugged him tell me later he said and his grin wasnt faked all around him as the servants cleared the files men clasped hands satyrus got a quick squeeze from diokles and another from namastis a kiss from dionysius and then the files were clear half files close to the front philokles called the same order could be heard from the foot companions who were just to their right namastis marched his halffile forward to fill the opening left by the shieldbearers now the phalanx was eight deep but much closer in order behind satyrus diokles and the rest of the file shuffled forward to form the closeorder battle formation satyrus could see panion the commander of the foot companions striding across the sand towards philokles his body betrayed rage you are crowding my files with your fucking slaves panion said double your files again and give me room your men must have drifted on the march philokles said were matched with the white shields on our left he shrugged open out to the right panion spat ive had enough of you greek you and your corps of baggagehandlers dont belong in the line i told ptolemy youd lose him the battle now youre on my flank and you know what you and your pack of dogs cowards go back to your taxeis philokles said we are in the same army i do not question your courage have the courtesy to do the same panion spat listen to you he turned to face the phalanx of aegypt most of you will be dead in an hour you dont even have to stand in the line your socalled polemarch demanded that you stand in the battle line run along home now gyptos the phalanx of aegypt shuffled panion laughed contemptuously dogs pretending to be men he said turn and face me philokles said panion turned listen macedonians philokles roared and his voice carried a stade i am a man of sparta when we charge the enemy see who flinches no man in our ranks has a friend across the lines macedonians no man there will offer a single one of our men mercy he walked up to panion and stood a half a hand taller foot companions your officer is bought and paid for by the enemy philokles pulled his cloak back off his shoulder you lie panion began and he raised his spear let the gods say who lies philokles roared panion struck but philokles arm moved as fast as a thunderbolt and his spear slammed into panions helmet and the man went down philokles laughed satyrus was an arms length from the nearest macedonian file they were roiling with fury macedonians came a roar from behind satyrus he turned to see ptolemy and seleucus on horseback brilliantly armoured and surrounded by hetairoi macedonians the enemy is demetrios who we will destroy in a few hours the enemy is not next to you in line the next man who speaks against another is a traitor mark my words he looked down at panion who was rising from the dust fucker panion said with something incomprehensible prove the charge unfounded on the field said the lord of aegypt he pointed at the commander of his footguards myself he said just loudly enough that the front rank of both taxeis could hear myself i think you probably are a fucking traitor panion die well and ill see to your widow try to screw me and ill put my mercenaries right into your shieldless flank and you will all die whether i win or not the lord of aegypt waved his arm at ranks and ranks of diodoruss exiles who stood by their horses on the flank of the foot companions then the lord of aegypt waved and most men cheered not the foot companions and philokles stood and faced them he clasped hands with philokles and rode away leaving panion in the sand behind him the elephants were closing on the toxotai men of alexandria philokles said he paused and even panions men fell silent yesterday or two weeks ago or a year ago you were different men you lived a different life some of you are rich men and some are poor some of you stole and others drank wine somewhere in these ranks is a man who killed for money another carried bricks some of you are greek and some are aegyptian a few of you are even macedonian he paused and men laughed today no one cares how you lived all that men will ever say of you is how you fought here and how you died are you in debt desperate the gods hate you his voice rose to fill the air as if a god was speaking the voice of ares come to earth stand your ground today and die if you must and all men will ever say of you is that you served the city you will go with the heroes your name will adorn a shrine be better than you were serve the city stand in your ranks and push when i call you remember that you will have no mercy at the hands of the men across the sand not a one of you will be spared he raised his spear over his head when i call every man must push forward one more step understand yes they roared remember every one of you there is nothing but this day and this hour show your gods who you really are he lowered his spear and walked to his place in the line pulling his helmet down and fastening the cheekpieces not your usual take on philosophy satyrus said when his tutor took his place philokles stood straight wisdom has a different look from the front rank he said to satyrus with a smile that showed under his cheekpieces prepare to march he roared the aegyptian peltastai stood their ground longer than melitta had expected just in front of her pit they closed their ranks and countercharged the enemy psiloi running the bronzeshielded men back among their elephants then they lost their nerve and retreated and their officers couldnt hold them after a man was caught by an elephant and spitted on her swordtipped tusks the animal shook the dying man and he split open the peltastai ran back half a stade melitta stopped watching them she had targets she loosed a dozen arrows at the leading elephants before she knew that her shafts were having no effect the lead elephant had so many arrows sticking out of her back that it looked as if shed sprouted some scraggly feathers but the beast continued her leisurely stroll forward still tossing the remnants of the peltastes on the twin swords around her mouth none of the other archers were doing any better were fucked she muttered drawing and loosing again their arrows had cleared the last of the enemy psiloi so that the monsters strode down the field in a long line with no infantry covering them but that seemed to be a very minor flaw as the line plodded across the sand towards her pit if they go through us they go into the face of the phalanx she thought and we lose next to her a pair of greek archers called to each other as they lofted arrows high their skin must be thinner somewhere called laertes the oldest man among the toxotai the beasts were now so close that the archers could try to aim for softer parts also close enough for flight to seem like an option she drew to her eyebrow and loosed to see her bronzeheaded barb bounce off the lead elephants head for the first time she realized that there were men on the backs of the behemoths without thinking she shot one the range was just a few horselengths and for the first time in fifteen shafts she saw a target go down the man clutching his armpit as he fell from the beasts back she thought of the elephants in eumenes the cardians army and how their mahout said that they were only deadly as long as there were men on their backs the lead cow elephant turned her head as if curious as to what had happened melitta shot two arrows as fast as shed ever shot in her life the first missed right over the top of the cow who was so close that melitta was shooting up to aim at all the second hit the other spearman on the elephants back sticking in his shield but not apparently doing any harm she looked around her and realized that the toxotai were running she was the last archer shooting she turned and ran herself satyrus pulled his helmet down and tied the chinstrap onehanded even as they marched forward flute players sounded the step and satyrus glanced right and left his heart filled by the sight as far as his eye could see their ranks were moving the centre was slow and the mass of the phalanx bowed but he could see now that the line of his own phalanx all the army of aegypt together was longer than the enemy line off to the right the cavalry was moving off to the left just a stade away satyrus could see diodorus sitting alone on his charger at the head of the exiles he seemed to be eating a sausage right in front of him the elephants had broken the line of peltastai and toxotai his gut clenched his chest muscles trembled and he had to make himself stand taller elephants melitta ran twenty paces and stopped in part because idomeneus was standing there putting an arrow to his bow and in part because she had to see what happened when the monsters hit the pits stop running idomeneus yelled theres nowhere to go he shot forty paces away the lead cow shuddered as her front feet slid out from under her in seconds she had slipped most of the way into the hole head first and her head cap of bronze pushed the stake flat and it did her no harm she bellowed gathered her hindquarters and scrabbled out of the pit shaking her head too shallow melitta shot her arrow struck in a great forefoot but something was wrong with the beast because she stopped she rolled her head looking right and left as arrows pricked her her snakelike trunk touched the prone form of the man whod come off her head when shed stepped into the pit he didnt move melitta almost had pity as the great beast tried to move her driver her driver her driver shoot the drivers melitta shouted her voice broke it was the most feminine shout on the field but it carried and she didnt care shoot the drivers idomeneus took up the shout drivers he said pulling his great bow to his ear and punching a fingerthick shaft into the mahout of the next beast in line the man threw up his hands and fell back and the beast riderless stopped be ready philokles roared beside him satyrus felt his arse clench felt his guts turn and turn again three times now his fear had fallen away and every time it came back elephants he looked at the front rank and it was bending because the foot companions werent keeping up dress up phylarchs he shouted really philokles job but he had his attention on the trumpets and the battle in the front theron theron was a hundred paces distant a hopeless distance on a battlefield theron step up he called and other voices repeated it the front rank flexed and there was theron waving his spear and pushing forward the filefollowers struggled to close up from behind a pikeman fell and the whole body of men rippled and someone cried out in pain close up philokles bellowed satyrus tore his eyes off the recovery of the middle ranks he was drifting left because hed turned his head watch your spacing namastis growled a deserved rebuke and then through the limited vision of his closefaced helmet he saw that the elephants had stopped look he said to namastis look the monsters were in the line of pits almost half managed to walk right through without touching the obstacles but they didnt exploit their success they had a curious morale of their own and when the archers began to clear the crews off the backs of the animals in the pits the whole elephant advance broke down idomeneus was the first man to run forward and melitta loved him for it stripped of their psiloi the elephants were vulnerable once they stopped the archers ran in among them in their open formation and began massacring the crews it wasnt even a fight the men on the backs of the huge beasts had no reply to make to the hundreds of shafts aimed at them and a few even tried to surrender no prisoners were taken the archers slaughtered the crews in a paroxysm of fear and rage and then the beasts began to turn away the masses of sharp shafts and the pointblank shots beginning to scare them and suddenly they were running away halt sang the trumpets halt echoed the officers the phalanx ground to a halt all along the line officers raced up and down ordering the line to dress the front was disordered everywhere and the foot companions were almost a full phalanxdepth to the rear if they hit us now were wrecked philokles said to satyrus gods he ran off along the front of the phalanx ordering men to dress the line the white shields took up the cry first and in a heartbeat all discipline was forgotten the elephants run men shouted and the front ranks the men who would have had to face the brutes first all but danced philokles roared for silence ptolemy appeared from the right and rode down the front rank look at that boys he called every man of you owes our light troops a cup of the best by herakles ptolemy halted in the centre of the white shields he seemed to be addressing the whole line ours to win boys right here right now remember who you are the white shields roared and so did the phalanx of aegypt but satyrus thought that the other cheers were muted he hoped it was just his fears philokles reached past namastis dont point he said its not all good over to the left the cavalry fight wasnt going well for anyone but suddenly in a flaw in the battle haze the whole line of the phalanx could see forty more elephants waiting ares satyrus cursed his heart sank again so he made himself turn his head drink water he yelled philokles was nodding we have to break the phalanx in front of us before demetrios throws those elephants into us he said that just became the battle he drank and spat when i fall you take command when you fall satyrus asked philokles gave him a brilliant smile the kind of smile his tutor scarcely ever smiled then the spartan ran out of the ranks towards ptolemy he grabbed at his bridle and they could see ptolemy nod and signal to the trumpeters and the signal for the advance rang out before philokles was back in the ranks ptolemy turned his horse and rode away towards the cavalry fight on the left way off to the right satyrus saw diodorus he wasnt eating sausage any more but he hadnt moved the foot companions were still not in their place philokles jumped out of the front rank held his spear across their chests and roared dress the line so loudly that satyrus flinched helmet and all prepare to execute the marine drill he called he ran along the front rank heedless of the javelins that were starting to fall until he reached theron and then he sprinted back fast as an athlete despite age and wine and armour spears up came the order they were less than a stade from the enemy a handful of brave or stupid psiloi still stood between the two mighty phalanxes but they were scattering running for the flanks satyrus watched the last of their own archers running off to the right to get around the killing ground now that he could see the enemy phalanx he could see that it looked bad there were ripples and gaps where he assumed the elephants had burst back through and officers were dressing the ranks half a stade and he could see the enemy move they had their ranks dressed they shivered as if the phalanx was a single living organism and the whole thing leaned forward as the enemy began their advance and suddenly everything happened at twice the speed the length of a sprint he could see the emblems on their shields spears down came the command by trumpet repeated by word of mouth and the sarissas came down in the phalanx of aegypt the men in front had the shorter spears and they lifted them over their heads in unison a sight that literally banished fear as training took over and satyrus got his shoulder firmly under the rim of his aspis sing the paean philokles called and the alexandrians started the call to apollo the song carried him forward a hundred paces literally buoyed him up but at its end in step and facing the foe he still had ten horselengths of terror to face ten horselengths and he was confronted by a wall of spears that filled his mind as amastriss body had filled it so that nothing and no one could take his eyes away from the lethal glitter of twelve thousand pike points the white shields were slowing down ares eyes front philokles roared ready alexandria the taxeis growled five horselengths the thicket of steel was pointed right at his throat his head too thick to penetrate thick enough to walk on it was impossible that a man could face so much iron and live his legs carried him forward charge philokles voice and rafiks trumpet sounded together and the front rank responded like trained beasts left shoulder down spear down head down spears rang against his aspis reaching for his guts again and again and he bulled forward legs pushing blow to his helmet step forward another blow and another with enough weight to shift him sideways so that he stumbled but he pushed he pushed nothing but the power of his legs and the weight of a dozen spear shafts on his aspis tilted almost flat like a table and he pushed diokles shield pushing him forward through up and push and he rammed his spear straight ahead felt the weight of diokles pushing him another half pace forward through to this right philokles roared like a bull and his spear hit a mans helmet just over the nasal and burst it in a spray of blood and the man fell back and philokles pushed suddenly as if his wits had been restored satyrus saw the fight for what it was and in one smooth motion he killed a phalangite not the man in front of him but the man in front of abraham whose shield was open and then he placed his big shield against the enemys and pushed and abraham pushed forward into the new space on his own or carried forward by his file and now he took the filefollower by surprise and simply knocked him down and satyrus rammed his spear over his shield once twice three times connected with something again and again glance at philokles cover his shoulder and then his opponent was down and satyrus was forward a step rafiks man was uncovered to his right and his spear was there scoring a clean hit on the mans helmet his point didnt penetrate but the mans head snapped back and he stumbled and rafik stepped on the man and went forward and rafiks filefollower put his buttspike through the mans chest satyruss opponent roared pushed his shield and diokles killed him over satyruss shoulder and satyrus leaped forward to cover philokles who had put another man down and was moving forward again the men behind the man facing philokles were flinching away now satyrus was chest to chest with another man his opponent dropped his sarissa and ripped his sword from the scabbard and satyrus felt the wash of the mans onion breath on his face and he was pushed back and the ranks locked abraham grunting and namastis shouting in aegyptian satyruss spear broke in his hands trapped against a shield he swung the buttspike like a mace and scored against the tip of the big macedonians shoulder where his shield didnt cover it and then his body moved as if he was making a sacrifice hand up grab the hilt under his armpit sword drawn down over the feint back cut the macedonian missed his parry his kopis overcommitted and his wrist bones parted as satyruss blade cut through his arm and glanced off the faceplate on the other mans thracian helmet the blood from his severed hand sprayed and blinded satyrus and he flinched stumbled but forward because diokles shoved him and then stabbed at his next opponent over his head saving his life a sword scraped along satyruss helmet and he lost a piece of his left ear although he didnt feel it one more step the voice of the war god said now the whole phalanx of aegypt planted and pushed the macedonian phalanx shuddered and then as if having given one step they could give another they fell back and now the aegyptians caught fire maybe theyd never believed or maybe theyd just hoped but in those seconds those heartbeats the same message went out to every man in the taxeis we are the better men alexandria namastis called he was the first satyrus thought but then everyone was shouting then there was no battle cry that any one man could discern but a roar a roar of rage and triumph and fear the bronzelunged voice of ares and the enemy phalanx gave another step another something had broken at the back and the spears were dropping and suddenly there was nothing scattered men stood confused in front of satyrus the enemies too foolish to have broken and satyrus killed one without thinking stepping up to the man and cutting one two three as fast as thought ares philokles said he sounded weak satyrus were not done rally them rafik sound the rally satyrus looked back he couldnt see anything behind him but his own men but to the side there were still enemies some so close that he could hear the orders their officers shouted the notes of the rally sounded philokles was leaning on his spear satyrus thought that he was just breathing hard but then he saw that there was blood all down the spartans legs pouring away from under his bronze breastplate ill go for theron satyrus said no time philokles said his knees went and he slid down his spear but he didnt turn his head right into their flank now boy before they recover his arm shot out pointing at the uncovered flank of the enemy phalanx and philokles fell just that way his face to the enemy his arm pointing the path to victory and satyrus did not flinch he stepped across philokles the same way hed stepped across the deck of the golden lotus as if hed done it all his life although the man he loved best in all the world lay in the sand at his feet diokles snapped forward to fill his place we will wheel the taxeis to the left satyrus called on my command through the cheekpieces of his helmet it sounded remarkably like philokles voice right down to the laconian drawl march he roared the taxeis pivoted on theron the leftmost man unless he too was dead this was the manoeuvre they had so often done wrong this was where the centre of the line would fold eager men going too fast terrified men going too slow halfway around all the time to consider how much like sailing a trireme it was to command a phalanx all the time to watch the men opposite him they were turning but men at the back were already giving way running for their lives past their fileclosers there was no hope for a phalanx taken in the flank the taxeis of alexandria pivoted well enough the centre buckled at the end someone tripped a man got a buttspike in the head and the spears were still down not erect too close for that too late to worry threestep charge satyrus called rafik sounded it only half the files responded the centre was a wreck just from two men going down and the spears of their files flying in all directions therons end of the line never heard the command or if they did they didnt respond it didnt matter because the fifty files that did respond covered the distance to the enemy at the run and their shields deflected the handful of sarissas that opposed them and then their spears were into the flank of the enemy and the enemy regiment collapsed and ran like a herd of panicked cattle two thousand men turned into a mob in a matter of heartbeats satyrus the rightmost man of his line never reached an enemy by the time hed crossed the space they were gone they were gone and the white shields were unblocked they had started to cheer however late they had come into the fight they were moving wheeling to the left just as the alexandrians had done philemon the polemarch of the white shields was calling to theron and theron came running across the face of the victorious alexandrians drink water satyrus called no one left the ranks to pursue the fleeing macedonians instead a few men cheered the rest simply stopped like exhausted runners at the end of a race philokles theron asked his nose was broken under his helmet and blood covered his breastplate he had blood on his hands down satyrus said philemon wants us to march to the right to make space for him theron said ill take your orders he continued good satyrus said he stood straight he wanted to laugh at the notion that the taxeis of halfsoldiers from alexandria were being asked to face to the right and advance by files a hard enough manoeuvre on the parade square on a battlefield he did what hed seen philokles do he ran all the way down the front rank repeating the command again and again he waited precious seconds the polemarch of the white shields yelling from further to the left he ignored him waiting for the phylarchs to pass the word back then he sprinted to rafik cursing his greaves they were eating his ankles face to the spear side he ordered march as one almost as one because he watched dionysius face the shield side and then pivot on his heel the phalanx of aegypt faced to the right and marched off one hundred two hundred paces deeper into the enemy lines from here on the front right of the phalanx satyrus could see all the way to the cavalry fight on the left could see the fortyelephant reserve theron he shouted satyrus pulled his helmet off face to the shield side restore your files dress they knew the facing order was coming and they did it like professionals and then the ranks dressed next to them the white shields wheeled up into the new line while to their front the next enemy phalanx began to shirk and flutter and men on the flanks realized what was coming theron appeared from the dust as if by the hand of some god polemarch he asked go and find philokles save him if you can satyrus had his war voice on no quaver of emotion why cant you be like this all the time melitta had asked him once he wondered where she was and if she was alive im the left phylarch if we dont flinch from the contest nothing on earth or in the heavens can save the army of demetrios satyrus said he pointed to where before they were even charged the centre phalanx of the enemy was melting away throwing down their sarissas even the sudden arrival of the reserve elephants might not save demetrios now his centre was lost satyrus looked back to where the foot companions waited in the sand unblooded less than a stade away theron needed no second urging he turned and ran off towards the site of the first fight around satyrus all his men had canteens at their lips satyrus sprinted out to the ranks and found the white shield polemarch my men need a minute he said im going to go shame the foot companions into joining the line philemon had a helmet shaped like a lions head he tipped it back on his head and glared at the foot companions theyre supposed to be our best he said he shrugged we wont beat the elephants without them satyrus saluted the older man and ran back across the sand just a stade the same distance as a hoplitodromos the race in armour at the olympics a stade had never seemed so long the macedonians stood in neat ranks their plumes undisturbed by a breeze panion was nowhere to be seen satyrus pulled his helmet off his head do you want men to say that we won this battle while you watched he shouted or are we better men than you he spat turned on his heel and ran back to his own taxeis when he reached his place in the ranks he was so tired that his knees shook the foot companions are wheeling into line diokles said satyrus pulled his helmet back down got his aspis back on his shoulder a shoulder that hurt as if it had been burned and raised his spear alexandria he shouted and fifteen hundred men roared and then they were moving forward the white shields strong on their flank the foot companions on their other side and satyrus could all but see nike holding her wreath over the end of the enemy line melitta and the rest of the toxotai finished their battle when the elephants broke when the phalanxes started forward in earnest the light troops ran in all directions and melitta wasnt ashamed to run with them they ran so far to get around the flank of the foot companions that she was severely winded they all were it beat being dead she knelt on the ground breathing so hard that she almost retched look at that idomeneus wheezed she followed his gaze the foot companions had slowed to a walk and the phalanx of aegypt moved away from them idomeneus spat fuckers been bought he said sitting back on his heels we beat the elephants for nothing and then they watched as the phalanx of aegypt charged home dust rose and the sound of a thousand cooks beating a thousand copper pots satyrus xeno the foot companions halted just short of contact with their opponents watching the rear ranks melitta had no idea what she was seeing idomeneus walked off and started collecting archers and then she saw that her uncle diodorus was sitting on his charger just a dozen horselengths to the right watching the other side of the field and then watching the dust cloud where the phalanxes had engaged there was a roar something had happened and she saw the rear of the aegyptian taxeis ripple as if a breeze had stirred wheat on a summer day and then they roared again she felt the shadow and looked up diodorus loomed over her you fought the elephants he said we did she said with pride diodorus pointed at the back of the phalanx the foot companions were moving forward now as if they could no longer resist the attraction of the enemy philokles has just given us the chance to win the battle diodorus said with quiet satisfaction what melitta asked diodorus turned and looked across the field where squadrons of enemy cavalry sat motionless he raised his arm see that cavalry they outnumber me and they arent coming forward he gave her half a smile im just supposed to keep them in check but i think that philokles has just broken golden boys centre i think i may just go and widen the hole care to come he grinned lets go and show macedon why were the best melitta sprang to her feet fatigue forgotten of course diodorus waved to crax who trotted up with a cavalry mount ah the mysterious archer crax said when he handed her the reins he grinned at her some people think they can fool other people he said melitta was briefly abashed i just wanted to save it for sappho diodorus said myself i wouldnt keep kineass daughter off a battlefield any more than kineass son second squadron third rank go and find your place now melitta saluted and followed crax she waved to idomeneus who shook his head and then waved back behind her the phalanx of aegypt surged forward she caught the movement and diodorus nodded just as i thought he said ready to move hippeis the enemys centre taxeis never fought they just melted away the rearmost men running first so that the whole regiment seemed to unravel like motheaten fur in a strong wind satyrus halted when the white shields halted he was amused to see the foot companions close up on his right at the double he wondered if the bastards had even seen any fighting but they were there and now they were committed then the whole right of the army formed at a ninetydegree angle from their original line swept from right to left and the rest of the enemy centre collapsed the enemys easternmost phalanxes were heavily engaged against ptolemys loyal macedonians and they had no chance to run and many were cut down and more of them surrendered rather than be butchered from the open flank satyrus had no idea what the cavalry were doing but the infantry battle was over and the enemys infantry were gone destroyed or surrendered or run his taxeis was now in the centre of the canted line facing a wall of dust and whirling sand all he wanted to do was walk back and find philokles but he knew his duty and when the line halted he ran down the front rank all the way to the left where he found the polemarch of the white shields now what satyrus demanded the polemarch had a purple shield with inlaid ivory he looked like achilles come back to earth but when he took his helmet off he was bald as polished marble fucked if i know son he said you in command of those aegyptians right those boys are on fire he grinned not that we did too badly ourselves and im so pleased that our foot companions chose to join the dance wheres your big spartan wounded satyrus said he got his canteen to his lips no easy feat in armour and drank deeply hope he makes it dont know never been in a battle like this never seen the enemy phalanx so badly broken it must be over what can they do he shrugged what have they got left to fight with just then some of the macedonian fileleaders started to shout and satyrus turned to look demetrioss other forty elephants were shambling out of the battle haze diodorus had the hippeis the exiles and six other squadrons of mercenary cavalry from the third rank melitta couldnt see much but she thought that they were all going forward together they rode forward at a walk and when she knelt on her borrowed chargers back she could see over the left squadron to the phalanx they moved and then halted then moved at a walk again and then halted she drank water and waited you look bored carlus said from two ranks ahead he laughed his big laugh tanu the thracian who was just ahead of her turned and joined in the laugh dont be in such a hurry to fight he said pays just the same i cant see melitta said the cavalry in front of us are unsteady carlus said their whole centre is gone the big man shook his head never seen anything like it and ive been in a few fights diodorus cantered over to crax at the head of her troop melitta front and centre he called she rode out sure that she was about to be sent to the rear for all his protestations but he waved her forward impatiently you know this amastris he asked yes she said good stay with me im going to have a go at breaking right through into his camp if we make it through that cavalry i dont think theres anything to stop us and then my dear girl well all be rich diodorus smiled and his beard which was mostly grey glinted with red well she said we are mercenaries but shouldnt we be finishing off those infantrymen she waved at the thousands of broken pikemen who were racing weaponless for the safety of the fortified town of gaza diodorus shook his head no he said he grinned if you kill them who will you use to retake tanais what we need is the money to pay them his grin grew broader and craxs grin and eumenes grin echoed his and there it is demetrioss camp lets go and get it shall we he gave orders and turned back to her stay right at my stirrup he said your friend the princess ought to be close to golden boys tent we need to get to her before all of ptolemys other cavalry he turned and backed his horse until he was facing his squadrons over there he cried his voice carrying easily are all the riches of asia all you have to do is take them they were the words of miltiades at marathon and the exiles roared their approval they went from walk to trot and then from trot to canter the files opening uncontrollably the farther they moved but the enemy did not await their onset rearguard squadrons who had stayed together this long fell apart when they saw themselves charged no one stayed to fight a lost battle especially against the same cavalrymen who had harried them for weeks out in the desert crax dropped off five files to round up prisoners mostly men whose horses were so poor that they couldnt outrun their pursuit and then the whole line was rumbling up the long gentle slope towards the fortified town of gaza the gates were open t he elephants came on undaunted by the long lines of pikemen forty elephants against eight thousand men satyrus ran back down the front rank to his own men sandwiched in the centre of the line his men had nowhere to go to escape the beasts he knew what alexanders phalanxes had done against elephants drop files listen aegypt im going to count off the front rank by five files i want those files to make a spartan march around to the rear and then halt make lanes through the phalanx some men like xeno and abraham looked as if they understood while others like dionysius looked blank satyrus began to run down the rank one two three four five all of you countermarch to the rear go the men he touched most of them he tagged by hitting their shields quite hard with his buttspike to make sure they knew they were the ones he meant turned and began to force their way back between the files and their filefollowers followed them pushing and shoving where they had to turning their shields sideon to the ranks to make space it was ugly it looked as if his whole phalanx had collapsed satyrus turned and looked back at the elephants who were close herakles stand by me satyrus said aloud front rank fileleaders look to your spacing make it solid he used his spear as a baton dressing the front rank xeno shook his helmeted head so that his plume bobbed up and down we have holes in our ranks the beasts will go down the lanes satyrus shouted then we attack them he turned back to look at the elephants half a stade stand fast alexandria when i shout the name of herakles every man turn towards the nearest elephant and attack kill the riders he spared a glance for the white shields who were carrying out the same manoeuvre making lanes in a much more professional manner the elephants were so large that they filled the horizon so close that he could see their tiny eyes so loud that their footsteps caused the earth to tremble dust rose behind them like smoke from the forge of hephaistos satyrus found that his hands were shaking on his spear haft the elephants sped up their heavy bodies moving with grace their massive feet crashing more rapidly against the earth and satyrus was frozen for a moment and then he raced for his place in the front rank knees soft as wet bread he made himself stand straight turned and faced the charge of the monsters the idea of making lanes in his spear block seemed beyond absurd all those years ago tavi had said that the beasts wouldnt fight without a man on their back satyrus gripped that idea the way a drowning man grips a floating spar spears down someone bellowed at a remove he realized that he had shouted the order his body was running on its own the taxeis responded like one man the spears flashing as the ranks lifted their weapons and put them in position as if the mass of an elephant wouldnt snap the shafts like kindling just beyond the reach of his spear he saw the nearest behemoth turn slightly and race into the opening between abrahams file and xenos two pikelengths away the beast was already slowing but it ran into the lane as if the driver had given the order satyrus couldnt see any of the other beasts but he could see the vermilion paint on the flank of the beast that had gone by and smell its strange stink he could all but hear philokles telling him that sometimes the leader had to show the way he shivered with fear and filled his lungs and even over the stink of the great monsters he smelled the wetcat smell of the god at his shoulder herakles he trumpeted he raised his spear and turned stepping out of the ranks suicide in an infantry fight but now he was two files away from the elephant and fear or no fear this was something he had to lead he raced across the empty ground of the front and turned down the alley of the missing files coming up on the beast from behind its ridiculous tail swaying as it walked the men on its back were terrified their terror steadied him both were thrusting pikes down at the aegyptian phalangites most of whom thrust back hesitantly herakles satyrus called he was within reach of the things leg his spear was plenty long enough he ran alongside the beast for three paces pivoted on his left foot and punched up with his spear right into the mahouts side the man turned too late and his scream was lost in the thunder of the elephants and the phalanx roared as he fell from his perch the beast stopped it made a sound a horrible sound the same sound that satyrus would have liked to have made when he saw the blood pouring out of philokles rage and sorrow and mourning compounded abrahams spear plucked the macedonian pikeman from the beasts back and the man fell into the phalanx screaming as he died on a dozen spears the aegyptian taxeis turned into a mob tearing at the men on the elephants and in some palaces the beasts rioted killing a dozen men in a few seconds one animal threw an alexandrian jew so high in the air that his fall injured as many men as the elephants rage had another animal pinned a man under one huge foot and used her trunk to pull the dead man apart but everywhere the crews were being butchered at close quarters the files who had retreated to form the gaps came charging back down the alleys without orders without any intention but to join their comrades and kill and even the horrors of the death wreaked by the monsters couldnt slow the inevitable conclusion as a thousand men fought ten elephants the elephant closest to satyrus gave another hideous cry and then slumped almost unmoving all around him the sounds of fighting died away most of the elephants had broken free of the phalanx and now their crews gone they ran away over the plain but three of the elephants were trapped in the press of bodies and they simply stood waiting for their fates abraham caught at satyruss spear arm as he prepared to kill the beast stop satyrus turned his helmeted head what stop abraham said he pulled his helmet off his long hair falling in a sweatcaked mass theyre ours weve captured them in seconds his cry was taken up and as long as satyrus lived he would remember that cry and the thousands of alexandrian hands reaching out not to kill but just to touch the great beasts the elephants are ours the exiles went through the crowds at the gate like a scythe through the stalks of wheat on an autumn day when the wheat is dry and the stalks are brittle then they passed under the great gate of the camp and into the narrow streets behind the gate melitta followed diodorus as they entered the town there was no real defence just panicked men running from horsemen who seldom stopped to cut them down then they were through the town and into the tented camp and melitta could see the enemy horsemen and many of the infantry already streaming away from the back of the camp a complete rout the enemy already abandoning their own camp their wives their treasure follow me diodorus roared he pointed his chargers head at the complex of tents in the centre like a palace built of canvas with a magnificent central structure of tyrian purple exiles follow me melitta had been all but born to the saddle but she still found diodorus difficult to follow he rode over obstacles jumping tent ropes like a centaur his officers cloak streaming away behind him melitta rode around obstacles that diodorus jumped but she stayed with him and crax and eumenes and both of their troops followed their faded blue cloaks marking them as friends so far they had the camp to themselves ares and aphrodite diodorus shouted as he rode under the gate of the command area it had its own temple to nike its own fountains behind him the handful of guards surrendered to the exiles more poured in behind him rows of gilded bronze statues decorated every entryway and a bath of silver stood in the middle of the court diodorus let his horse drink from it what an idiot diodorus said eumenes fileleaders at the door of every tent four files in the gate and every fucking coin gets shared understand lads eumenes men didnt wait for orders they were off their horses and moving to protect their posts as soon as they heard the hipparch eumenes took more files out of the gate to surround the tent complex take it all diodorus bellowed the exiles roared to melitta he said this beats glory any time we have to find amastris melitta shouted but amastris was one woman and here was reward for years of fighting here was the treasure of an enemy army and most men knew that this was the hoard that would pay for their return leon rode into the courtyard he saluted diodorus third troop is sweeping the officers lines and fourth is off to cull the horse herd he nodded i see that were the first ones here uncle leon had a line of blood along his lip youre hurt melitta said look who it is leon said he didnt smile we need to find amastris everyone is looting melitta shouted at her uncles behind leon coenus was directing a crowd of eager men with crowbars melitta shrank away ptolemys flank was getting the worst of it last i saw leon said to diodorus over her head wont do us any good if the farm boy dies while were looting diodorus shook his head demetrios was over there with all his best cavalry he said he pulled off his helmet ptolemy can handle it if he cant win with both his left and his centre victorious we were doomed from the first eumenes looted the enemy camp at gabiene and you still lost leon was watching the dust to the east let me take the mercenaries you think that you could get them out of an enemy camp once the looting starts diodorus looked around ptolemys good leon coenus forget the marble apollos golden balls that man will stop to look at art leon looked around if youre sure there may be some items amidst all this vulgarity that i want melitta looked back and forth we need to find amastris she shouted look sharp there diodorus yelled when a knot of mercenaries tried to push past one of his files this is ours comrade push off leon saluted on your head be it brother he said he ignored melitta clasped hands with diodorus and rode off it was ugly and there were things that melitta didnt want to watch rape brutal killing without mercy but not as much as she would have seen if the camp had been defended the exiles hadnt lost a man and their blood wasnt up and their discipline held they found the treasury took prisoners who seemed to be worth ransom and formed caravans of their loot before the rest of the army was in the camp melitta watched it sickened and she watched the remnants of the beaten army flood away over the back gates and the back walls and on to the sand just beyond the cordon of exiles she watched a line of men raping a woman the victim didnt even scream tanu the thracian in her file caught her eye and shook his head dont watch lass he said we should clear em out carlus said aint harming us none tanu said he shrugged i could use a piece of that he said melitta straightened her spine my friend is out in that somewhere she said i need some men who will watch my back while i find her she kneed her horse forward until she was in front of the pickets who will follow me lord eumenes put us here tanu said making trouble girl coenus said you hama and carlus and tanu damn your black heart get your arse in the saddle he looked up at melitta well melitta moved her gorytos and put the hilt of her akinakes in easy reach stratokles is no fool she said diodorus is too busy looting to care and uncle leon is too angry to listen to me coenus nodded i wonder why girl melitta dismissed leon with a flick of her hand but stratokles would have run as soon as he knew the battle was lost hes gone and hes got amastris with him i know it it wasnt her best rhetoric satyrus would have been better at this but something in her tone went home both to the men like carlus who knew her and to coenus he nodded and waved at the man holding his charger all right im with you lady looting is not for gentlemen coenus raised an eyebrow besides im done the elephants were running and a handful of terrified but elated volunteers were guarding their three captures led by namastis now a phylarch satyrus was reforming his taxeis the white shields were streaming away to the north all discipline gone having survived the elephants they were hunting fugitives the aegyptians were different unsure of what to do with their victory satyrus formed them his stomach roiling at the losses and the gaps where was xenophon where was dionysius where was diokles there were so many holes in the front ranks that he had to use every one of the young men hed recruited as a phylarch and then he had to promote a dozen of leons marines he rallied them facing the enemy camp to his left there was still fighting scattered bands of cavalry enemy and friendly appeared out of the battle haze it was past noon satyrus drank water and tried to find someone to give him orders on his right the foot companions rallied the elephants had hurt them satyrus could look to his right and see familiar faces amyntas was now in the front rank just a few men away satyrus waved and amyntas waved back the motion seemed to embolden the foot companions left phylarch he turned on his heel and saluted any orders polemarch he asked satyrus made a choking noise he turned and spat what did you ask he choked out the macedonian shrugged despite his bronze breastplate quite a few officers failed to survive first contact the man said he pulled off his helmet and offered his arm to clasp philip son of philip satyrus son of kineas satyrus said i have no idea what to do now philip laughed fuck are you sure youre an officer he asked hoof beats purple cloaks and dun cloaks moving in the dust to his front cavalry on our flank came the shouts from the left satyrus had to see for himself he stepped out of the ranks philip hold this line he ordered abraham take command of the right file rafik on me the nabataean followed him out of the ranks and he ran the rubbing of his greaves tearing at the bloodcaked sores on his ankles as he ran across the front of his taxeis cavalry his comrades shouted theron wasnt there to command the left but apollodorus one of leons marines had ordered the flank files to face to their shields and down spears covering the flank of the taxeis a smart man satyrus stopped level with him there they are apollodorus said he pointed into the haze of dust where satyrus could just see movement satyrus reached up and tilted his silver helmet back on his head the cheekpieces hinged up and he could breathe and see the enemy cavalry was coming forward cautiously they offered him no threat at all his files were steady and apollodorus had already made them secure well done marine satyrus said thank you sir the marine answered woodenly as if he were a real officer looks to me like they crushed our right while we crushed theirs he added the leader of the enemy cavalry was encased in golden armour and he had a golden helmet he rode forward slowly and then a trumpet sounded and his men halted behind him and to the left another trumpet sounded men pointed satyrus flexed his back under his scale corslet and fought exhaustion the man in the golden armour had to be demetrios gold helm rode forward boldly in a few heartbeats he covered the ground and he pulled up just short of satyrus thats my helmet he said come and take it satyrus said not his best line ever but not bad he managed a smile i thought that you might be my infantry demetrios said conversationally i seem to have lost we destroyed your infantry satyrus said demetrios nodded shall we fight single combat you look like a hero to me satyruss tired smile flashed into a grin demetrioss charm was like a force of nature for just a heartbeat he wanted to fight the magnificent enemy in handtohand combat delighted satyrus said if youll dismount there were trumpets sounding behind the left flank and demetrioss troopers were starting to shuffle no i dont think id better demetrios said he smiled as if satyrus had scored a point pity i think we might be a match and id like to have something to show for today satyrus stepped out of the ranks so that he wouldnt seem afraid another time perhaps he shouted men in the ranks were calling out demetrios reared his charger and saluted the olympic salute next time then hero he turned his horse and rode away hero satyrus said apollodorus was grinning he was still grinning when ptolemy rode through the dust young satyrus he said i think weve won why are your men so far from your place in the line what news satyrus shook his head weve won lord ptolemy grinned his ugly face transformed i thought we might have at that seleucus saved my arse in the dust and things seemed to get better so the boys stayed loyal all the ones who matter satyrus said and there was a thin cheer as official news of victory spread the men of the aegyptian taxeis collapsed like curtains cut from their rods men knelt in the dust or even lay down and then someone began a hymn the aegyptian hymn to osiris most of the men knew it even the greeks and the haunting melody was taken up zeus soter boy ptolemy said there were tears on his cheeks and he slid from his mount drawn by the singing more men rode out of the haze the dust cloud itself began to thin ares seleucus shouted the rightflank cavalry is already in their camp he seemed to see the infantrymen for the first time well fought soldiers no one will call this a cavalry battle ptolemy clasped satyruss hand wheres your tutor boy your polemarch satyruss heart seemed to stop because he hadnt given philokles a thought in what seemed like hours down sir he said im in command ptolemys grip tightened good man he said he embraced satyrus i knew you were a young man of talent then he looked up at seleucus round up anyone who can still ride were going to press the pursuit seleucus laughed no lord were going to loot the camp the men have already made that decision but ill offer a reward for the elephants we have half a dozen satyrus said he bowed to ptolemy and when the great man had remounted and ridden away he felt as if he had to lie down in the sand he felt like collapsing but instead he turned and walked back to abraham take the men back to camp do not let them join in the looting im going to find philokles satyrus looked at his men who looked more like a defeated army than a victorious one the foot companions werent much different get men to bury the dead and find our wounded send for the shieldbearers abraham nodded satyrus walked off alone as they rode out of the cordon the scene turned to one of debauched violence that made the night market appear to be safe and orderly and the looting of the exiles a model of decorum men drank anything they could find and behaved like animals for no reason or every reason and melitta stayed close to her own riding behind coenus as he kept to the centre of the great avenues of the tent camp twice hama and carlus killed other men from their own army this is horrible melitta said this is the river in which we swim coenus said he spat most men are little better than animals as if to make his point an orange glow lit them behind them the town had caught fire it burned and melitta heard the screams of the trapped villagers ptolemys army laughed as they screamed and butchered those who ran macedonians from ptolemys army killed the macedonian wounded of demetrioss army they rode clear of the camp past the horse herds and into the tail of the enemy rout coenus reined in this is insane girl melitta rode straight past him she knew she could find stratokles amastris wasnt her real goal any more although images of the rape of the woman in the camp filled her head when she thought of her friend she rode faster pressing past frightened camp followers and wounded soldiers at her shoulder rode a dozen of her fathers best men and no one turned to face them philokles lay wrapped in his cloak his head in therons lap he had therons chiton wrapped around his groin and therons chiton was spartan red theron was weeping satyrus ran the last few strides with a sob and threw himself on the ground philokles he said his tutors eyes met his and he grasped the mans hand you broke them he said therons voice was thick and hoarse he doesnt care about that he choked i tried to be a moral man philokles said softly but i died killing other men you are a hero satyrus said through his tears you are too hard on yourself i love you philokles said so softly that satyrus had to put his head down to listen tell melitta i loved her satyrus nodded yes he said suddenly ashamed we love you all the time philokles made a noise in his throat just so he whispered he took a deep breath examine your life love your sister be true he looked at theron for a moment and then he slumped a little tried to move his hips and gave a short scream blood poured over the ground so fast that satyruss feet were drowned in it kineas philokles said his eyes went to the sky and there on the edge of dark melitta saw the satyrs profile by the light of the burning town stratokles he was wearing a cloak mounted on a fine mare and his cut nose revealed him even in the dark melitta could see that he had amastris mounted in front of him she grabbed at coenus stratokles she called there he is coenus turned his horse it took him a long moment to see what she saw and then he was riding at the athenian stratokles heard the hoof beats and turned his horse he had his guards and they turned with him stratokles coenus called melitta put an arrow on her bow the athenian actually smiled he lowered his sword gods my luck has held listen i surrender his grin broadened a man of honour in all this rout coenus slowed his mount to a walk and his men moved to surround the athenians companions drop your sword coenus said stratokles shook his head lets have an understanding he said exchanging a look with one of his companions i have someone very valuable here and i know things things very important to your ptolemy understand i understand you killed my mother melitta shouted stratokles turned his head like fuck i did honey one of eumeles guardsmen did that after she cut off my nose he shook his head annoyed nothing personal about it girl just politics stratokles whispered something to his captive and she squirmed give me a safe conduct and ill give you the girl he said melitta found that it wasnt that hard even after a long day to keep her bow at full draw but amastriss movements were spoiling her aim look at me stratokles she said he didnt look at her he touched his booted heels to his horses sides and the mare backed up i dont think youll shoot through the tyrants daughter to get me he said to coenus he added im perfectly willing to surrender just not to be murdered no need to surrender lucius said in his low voice from behind them sorry im late boss i have your life in my hand stratokles melitta said lucius had a blade at hamas throat lady look around you i have ten men to your six he shook his head and you cant keep that arrow drawn all night coenus laughed grimly you dont know her stratokles call off your dog and ill call off mine stratokles nodded done amastris is going with you lucius did you get the other one lucius grunted of course stratokles laughed around them there was fighting and the sound of a camel screaming filled the night time we all went our separate ways coenus glared at melitta put up he said he killed my mother melitta said i want him dead you are all fools if you think that my life is worth my oath and my revenge i dont mind dying coenuss arm touched hers and she lowered her arrow she saw stratokles motion at his man and the big italian let his sword fall away from hamas throat stratokles tipped the princess on to the sand see i keep my part of the bargain he said he bowed from the saddle princess i hope we meet again amastris picked herself up ive learned a great deal from you sir she said stratokles laughed i wont even charge you for it stratokles turned his horse nimbler now with just one rider and rode for it his men followed him melitta shook her head you have a lot to answer for she said to coenus coenus shrugged youll thank me yet he said one of luciuss men spat as they slowed there was no pursuit all that loot and nothing to show for it he complained stratokles was tired but the encounter in the sand had filled him with fire and he laughed again nothing he asked we have alexanders son he pointed at the huddled figure of herakles bundled in luciuss arms men whistled softly stratokles led the way up the coast riding like a conqueror i rather liked him amastris said melitta didnt answer with coenus and hama she and her escort trotted across the battlefield at the edge of night there were beasts out already vultures and worse creatures feasted on the dead melitta saw elephants being herded by frightened men and hordes of macedonian prisoners thousands of captured pikemen from the shattered centre she rode past them what are you thinking amastris asked melitta said nothing only pressed her charger harder she had a feeling moira was lying heavily on her that feeling pressed harder the faster she rode until she saw a circle of men standing in the last light they were the only men on the battlefield who were not looting except for some slaves already busy burying the dead they parted for her horse and there was her brother alive she breathed in and out philokles hes dead satyrus said he looked old even in the ruddy light of the burning town he said goodbye to you melitta fell into her brothers arms xeno asked for you but you werent here satyrus said amastris needed to be rescued i failed to kill stratokles it was like telling sappho how she had spent her day satyruss expression was wrong behind her coenus choked and gave a great cry no melitta said but she didnt need to look at the cloakwrapped body next to philokles to know who it was xenophons death was stamped on her brothers face for ever the death of his youth she could see it with the same inevitability that she could see that she carried the dead boys child we never satyrus said and then he turned his face away its not about me he said bitterly what are you all doing amastris asked satyrus is that you satyrus stepped away from his sister and took his love in his arms amastris he said amastris kissed him and looked around im sorry for them amastris said softly but ptolemy won love you won not tonight satyrus said he looked up at the sound of hoof beats and saw the exiles coming with a baggage train of loot and captured slaves and then diodorus was there and leon and other men who loved philokles and xenophon epilogue t he army of aegypt gathered its heroic dead for return to aegypt ptolemy collected his looters and his army and thrust north scattering demetrios but failing to catch him and came back to gaza rich in loot and plunder and leaving palestine a flaming disaster behind him satyrus and melitta like most of the survivors of the battle spent a day unable to move and then were pressed into duties burying the dead hauling food there were never enough slaves after a battle and the danger of renewed conflict was at first very real demetrios saved most of his cavalry his patrols began to prowl the shore north of gaza weeks passed ptolemy took his cavalry on a deep raid into palestine and cities opened their gates to him diodorus rode at his side and the loot was legendary but finally ptolemy turned for home and the phalanx of aegypt led the march fourteen hundred veterans when they entered alexandria they sang the paean and the crowds cheered them as they cheered no other troops and namastis embraced diokles and amyntas and satyrus and abraham when they were dismissed as if they were all brothers and fathers and mothers wept for the dead but the war and the world marched on alexanders funeral games had cost a few thousand more lives but there was still no shortage of contestants a week after they returned to alexandria leon sent satyrus to the slave market with twenty talents of pure gold and diokles and abraham as his lieutenants buy the best of the macedonian prisoners leon said what for melitta asked everything made her grumpy now sapphos displeasure and coenuss toocareful attention theyll be the core of our infantry leon said next summer when we sail for the euxine that made even melitta smile and she waved at satyrus as he left for the slave pens accompanied by his friends and some hired guards because of the money the captive phalangites looked terrible underfed hopeless they didnt look like soldiers most didnt even raise their eyes as satyrus walked among them and they stank we want these satyrus asked diokles who still favoured his right shoulder and rubbed it a great deal theres a sight for sore eyes said a familiar voice satyrus turned his head and there was draco and philip his partner satyrus grabbed the slave factor ill take that pair he said thats our boy draco said he managed a smile zeus soter lad i thought we were dead men and no mistake dead and dead philip managed he looked as if he was dead despite their filth satyrus hugged them whats the game then philip asked eyeing the gold i want two thousand of the best satyrus said help me choose them what for draco asked ares dick lad thats more gold than ive ever seen except persepolis im raising an army satyrus grinned with my sister well lad the best are mostly dead draco said at arbela and jaxartes and gabiene and a dozen other fields across the world he took a deep breath free men youll buy us free of course satyrus said all right then draco said and the fire returned to his voice just like that he straightened up and began to point at men who were lying in their own filth party is over boys he shouted were going to be free this here is satyrus and hes our strategos the macedonians shuffled to their feet satyrus watched and was afraid philokles used to call war the ultimate tyrant he said abraham nodded tyrant indeed historical note writing a novel several novels i hope about the wars of the diadochi or successors is a difficult game for an amateur historian to play there are many many players and many sides and frankly none of them are good from the first i had to make certain decisions and most of them had to do with limiting the cast of characters to a size that the reader could assimilate without insulting anyones intelligence antigonus oneeye and his older son demetrios deserve novels of their own as do cassander and eumenes and ptolemy and seleucus and olympia and the rest every one of them could be portrayed as the hero and the others as villains if you feel that you need a scorecard consider visiting my website at wwwhippeiscom where you can at least review the biographies of some of the main players wikipedia has full biographies on most of the players in the period as well from a standpoint of purely military history ive made some decisions that knowledgeable readers may find odd for example i no longer believe in the linothorax or linen breastplate and ive written it out of the novels nor do i believe that the macedonian pike system the sarissa armed phalanx was really any better than the old greek hoplite system in fact i suspect it was worse as the experience of early modern warfare suggests that the longer your pikes are the less you trust your troops macedonian farm boys were not hoplites they lacked the whole societal and cultural support system that created the hoplite they were decisive in their day but as to whether they were better than the earlier system well as with much of military change it was a cultural change not really a technological one or so it seems to me elephants were not tanks nor were they a magical victory tool they could be very effective or utterly ineffective ive tried to show both situations the same can be said of horsearchery on open ground with endless remounts and a limitless arrow supply a horsearcher army must have been a nightmare but a few hundred horsearchers on the vast expanse of a successor battlefield might only have been a nuisance ultimately though i dont believe in military history war is about economics religion art society war is inseparable from culture you could not in this period train an egyptian peasant to be a horsearcher without changing his way of life and his economy his social status perhaps his religion questions about military technology why didnt alexander create an army of insert technological wonder here ignore the constraints imposed by the realities of the day the culture of macedon which carried it seems to me the seeds of its own destruction from the first and then there is the problem of sources in as much as we know anything about the world of the diadochi we owe that knowledge to a few authors none of whom is actually contemporary i used diodorus siculus throughout the writing of the tyrant books in most cases i prefer him to arrian or polybius and in many cases hes the sole source i also admit to using joyously any material that plutarch could provide even though i fully realize his moralizing ways for anyone who wants to get a quick lesson in the difficulties of the sources for the period i recommend visiting the website wwwliviusorg the articles on the sources will i hope go a long way to demonstrating how little we know about alexander and his successors of course as im a novelist and not an historian sometimes the loopholes in the evidence or even the vast gaps are the very space in which my characters operate sometimes a lack of knowledge is what creates the appeal either way i hope that i have created a believable version of the world after alexanders death i hope that you enjoy this book and the three or four to follow and as usual im always happy to hear your comments and even your criticisms at the online agora on wwwhippeiscom see you there i hope
