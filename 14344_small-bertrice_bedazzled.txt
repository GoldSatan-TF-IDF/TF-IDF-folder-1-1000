bertrice small bedazzled the second book in the skyes legacy series prologue london is he dead mother the boy peered closely and curiously at the body slumped in the darkblue tapestry chair the woman held a small looking glass attached to the gilt cord about her waist up to the mans nostrils the mirror remained clear not the faintest hint of breath upon it he is dead my son she replied matteroffactly then reaching into the bosom of her gown she drew forth a dagger with a beautifully carved and bejeweled handle she looked at the weapon a moment admiring its artistry regretting it would be lost to them handing it to the boy she commanded put it into his heart as i have shown you the boy stared down at the blade in his hands i always wanted this dagger he mused why must it be this dagger mother i shall not be allowed to have it now shall i it isnt fair we have been over this several times my son the woman said quietly this weapon is known to belong to your older brother as he and lord jeffers have had a very public falling out over lady clinton when this dagger is found in lord jefferss heart it will be assumed that your brother killed him she smiled you do want to be your fathers heir caro mio dont you how much nicer to be his heir than just his second son there is little satisfaction in being a second son i suppose so the boy said and he sighed will they hang dev for this murder mother if they catch him the woman replied but hopefully they wont i really dont want your elder brothers death on my conscience i just want my darling little boy to be his fathers heir it isnt our fault that your father was married had a son and was widowed before i wed him but if they dont hang my brother then how can i be our fathers heir what if dev proves his innocence your brother will have no chance to prove his innocence dearest his mother explained patiently we have been over this before your brother is rash and he will be convinced to flee england before he can even be arrested he will never dare to come back with the threat of execution hanging over him now push the dagger into lord jefferss heart dearest she lightly touched his hand encouragingly the boy did as his mother had bid him twisting the blade with some pleasure she noted not particularly shocked the woman took the goblet from which her victim had been drinking splashing the remaining contents into the fireplace where they hissed briefly then died away using her own handkerchief she wiped the goblet free of the residue of finely ground glass and hairthe items she had used to kill her prey then she poured fresh wine from the decanter into the goblet and replaced it upon the table opposite a second goblet which she tipped over to give the appearance of both anger and haste on the part of the victim there she said well satisfied with her efforts her son was growing fretful can we leave now mother the boy whined impatiently she nodded taking his hand the pair slipped unnoticed from the house that lord jeffers had rented when he was in residence in london his valet the only servant lord jeffers employed had been given the night off the woman had made certain using one of her own serving girls that he would not return until dawn even now as she and her son mounted their horseswhich had been hidden in the alley belonging to their victims houseand rode quickly back to their own elegant abode the woman knew her stepson would have been informed already of lord jefferss demise and encouraged to escape lest he be blamed for the crime of course the young man would arguehe always didand attempt to reason with the familys majordomo but poor desperate rogers would convince him for he loved the young man whom he had known his entire life as he would a son rogers was old now his weakening mind could easily be confused the woman had coolly informed him just before she and her son had left the house that evening that lord jeffers would be found murdered in the morning with the young masters dagger in his heart if rogers did not forewarn the young man he would surely be arrested convicted and hung for the crime after all was not the quarrel between the two men over that strumpet lady clinton public knowledge lord jeffers had no other known enemies but my lady how could you know such a thing the old man had quavered then he shuddered when she smiled knowingly at him he was not so old that he didnt realize she knew because she planned to commit the murder herself he had always suspected she was a dangerous woman but as a servant he was helpless to her will his master was at court with the king there was no way he could get a message to him in time besides would his lord believe such a tale rogers had always known that her ladyship was jealous of the young masters position he knew she coveted it for her own son but he had never imagined she would kill for her child still she was giving the elder son a fair chance to escape with his life even if he would lose everything else he held dear she would have the young masters inheritance for her own he bowed stiffly i will see my lord makes a good escape your ladyship the woman nodded i knew that i could count upon you she said then she added you have always been a careful man rogers is it not comforting to at least know he will be safe and that you will have a comfortable old age yes my lady he had replied impassively i am grateful for your kindness but when she had gone he had run up the staircase of the house faster than he had ever imagined he could at his age delivered the bad news to his young master and then convinced him not without great difficulty to flee for his own safety less than a year later rogers had died quietly in his sleep the truth of lord jefferss death went with him part i england chapter welcome to france madame the due de st laurent said v t to his motherinlaw as he handed her from her great traveling coach merci monseigneur catriona stewarthepburn said curtseying stiffly her famous leafgreen eyes making contact with the dues but a moment and then peering beyond him anxiously james leslie the duke of glenkirk stepped quickly forward a smile on his handsome face his arms open to enfold his mother into his warm embrace jemmie she cried out her eyes filling with tears even as his arms closed about her and he kissed her soft cheek my bairn glenkirk laughed and then he hugged his mother hardly a bairn madame nae at my age he stepped back and gazed upon her tis good to see you madame when we learned that you would be coming we brought over our entire brood so you could finally meet your grandchildren some of whom are already half grown and your wife jemmie his mother said you have been married more than a decade and i have never met her jasmine has been so busy having our bairns that i couldna let her travel she was nae a lass when i married her after all he tucked her hand in his arm come and let us go into the chateau they are all awaiting you my wife and family and my sister and her children jeanclaude lady stewarthepburn said turning to her soninlaw tis really quite good of you to have us all the château is large the due de st laurent replied cordially and a few more children makes little difference his motherinlaw raised an eyebrow and then she laughed james leslie had three sons of his own plus two stepdaughters and two stepsons seven in all and it was hardly a trifle especially when added to her daughter and soninlaws six children her youngest child her daughter francesca had married her dashing french duke fourteen years ago when she was sixteen and had lived happily with him ever since shortly afterward her beloved second husband francis stewarthepburn had grown suddenly ill and died but he had lived to see both of his daughters settled francesca with her jeanclaude and jean or gianna as she was known the wife of the marchese di san ridolfi their son ian was another matter and had yet to settle down how is jeannie the duke of glenkirk asked his mother as they entered the house so italian that you would never fathom that she was a scot his mother answered him and ian what mischief is he up to these days we must speak on ian came the terse reply they entered a bright salon where the family awaited them grandmère grandmère francescas children rushed forth to surround her demanding her attention as they welcomed her welcome mama the duchesse de st laurent said as she kissed her parent i thank god that you have come safely to us the trip is long and it is tedious francesca her mother replied but not dangerous how beautiful she was cat thought she has his wonderful auburn hair and my eyes when she smiles i see him she acknowledged francescas children the four boys and two little girls greeting each by name then looking across the salon lady stewarthepburn saw that her eldest son had joined a beautiful woman with nightdark hair and spectacular jewelry seeing the direction of her gaze the duke of glenkirk led his wife forward madame my wife jasmine leslie jasmine curtsied gracefully welcome to france madame i am pleased that we finally meet as am i the older woman said kissing her daughterinlaw on both of her smooth cheeks then she stepped back a pace you are very beautiful jasmine leslie and quite different from the wife i chose for jemmie when he was young i hope i compare favorably madame jasmine answered lady stewarthepburn laughed isabelle was a sweet child but a moon to your sun my dear now i want to meet my grandchildren all of them i consider your bairns mine too as my jemmie has been father to them longer than their own sires eh for a brief moment jasmine was speechless and her turquoise eyes grew misty then recovering herself she beckoned her offspring forward she was truly touched that jemmies mother could be so generous madame may i present my eldest child lady india lindley the young girl curtsied prettily and my eldest son henry lindley the marquis of westleigh my second daughter lady fortune lindley my son charles frederick stuart the duke of lundy while the girls curtsied the young boys bowed lady stewarthepburn acknowledged them graciously saying to the elevenandahalfyearold duke of lundy we are distantly related my lord on your late fathers side my grandfather spoke of you once the young duke replied he said you were the most beautiful woman in all of scotland i see he did not lie madame his stepgrandmother burst out laughing god help us all my lord but you are surely a true stuart she wondered what this boy would say if he knew that the nowdeceased old man who had been his grandfather had once been an unstoppable satyr who had destroyed her first marriage and these are jemmies bairns jasmine was continuing our eldest patrick then adam and duncan we had a little lass but lost her almost two years ago she caught measles and died a month after my dearest grandmother she was named for that lady and for janet leslie janet skye i remember my greatgrandmother janet cat told jasmine we called her mam she was a very formidable woman as was my grandmother jasmine replied is it true you were once in a harem india lindley suddenly burst out cat turned to look at the girl she was easily on the brink of womanhood and every bit as beautiful as her mother with black hair and the most wonderful golden eyes yes she answered i was in the harem of the sultans grande vizir which sultan india persisted there is only one sultan cat said the ottoman was it exciting or awful indias eyes were alight with unbridled curiosity both cat told her india jasmine was mortified by her daughters outrageous behavior but then india was so damned headstrong and always had been my mother was raised in a harem india volunteered was she now it was cats turn to be intrigued my father was the grande mughal of india jasmine explained my mother was english she is married to the earl of broccairn i remember your mother cat replied velvet is her name she stayed with us at hermitage years ago you dont really look like her do you i have some of her features but i am mostly a mixture of my maternal grandmother and my father jasmine answered that would indeed account for the slightly oriental tilt of jasmines unusual turquoise eyes and the faint golden tint of her skin lady stewarthepburn thought she let her gaze wander to the pert india the girl had skin like milky porcelain and a faint blue sheen to her midnightcolored hair but where had she gotten those eyes they were like a cats gold not amber and with tiny flecks of black in them the older woman settled herself into a chair by the fire france in april was a chilly place the fuss of her arrival had died about her her children and their mates had ensconced themselves about her on a settee a chair and a stool her grandchildren were amusing themselves how old is india she asked she will be seventeen at the end of june jasmine said suspecting what her motherinlaw would next ask she was not disappointed and she is not married jasmine shook her head betrothed nay madame you had best see to it soon then came the pithy observation the wench is ripe for bedding close to overripe and susceptible to trouble i would wager james leslie laughed at his mothers words india has nae yet met a man to attract her attention mother i want my girls to wed for love i did and i hae never been happier mam had me betrothed to your father at four and we married but moments before your birth when i was barely sixteen lady stewarthepburn noted love was not a consideration in making the match although i came to care for your father but you loved lord bothwell unconditionally the duke of glenkirk reminded his parent besides yer first marriage took place fortyseven years ago times have changed since then mother and you would allow your stepdaughter to make an unsuitable match in the name of love cat was surprised to find she was appalled i am obviously growing old she thought jasmine interposed herself between her husband and his mother in the conversation india will never choose unwisely madame for she is most proud and extremely aware of her heritage she is the grandchild of a great monarch and her fathers family was an old and very noble one it pleases her that my stepfather and her stepfather both have ties to the royal family she adored my grandmother madame skye and was weened upon the tales of her adventures and her relationship with great bess when the time comes india will pick the right man have you had no offers for her gat was curious several but they did nae please india in most cases she felt the families involved were simply looking to her fortune and nae to her the duke of glenkirk told his mother she was correct india can be very astute a girl in love for the first time is not always careful or wise cat cautioned well as no one has yet caught indias fancy i do not believe we have cause for worry jasmine replied the leslies of glenkirk had come to france to represent their country at the proxy marriage of the new king charles i to the french princess henrietta marie king james had sickened and died unexpectedly on the twentyseventh of march the marriage negotiations had already been concluded although there was some difficulty about the princesss religion charles stuart had no time to argue with his government he was suddenly king and without an heir while he did not feel he could depart his country to personally celebrate his marriage with his father newly deceased he felt strongly that the marriage must go forward immediately and his queen be brought to england the marriage which originally was to have been celebrated in june was now moved forward to the first of may so charless enemies in the parliament would not have time to marshall their forces and delay or prevent the match the duke of buckingham was to have acted as the kings proxy at the june celebration but now he had to remain in england to attend the old kings funeral which was set for the end of april for it was not unusual for a king to lie in state several weeks instead the due de chevreuse would act as the english kings proxy chevreuse was related to both the french royal house and the english through their mutual ancestor the due de guise he was therefore a suitable choice and acceptable to both sides most of the english court remained in england but charles had asked the duke of glenkirk and his family to attend his wedding it would be a far more pleasant occasion than poor old jamies funeral the duke conceded to his wife and if his sister the duchesse de st laurent would ask their mother to come from naples for a visit jasmine and the children could at least meet catriona hay leslie stewarthepburn the young kings reason was more personal james leslie himself was distantly related to charles and his stepson little charles frederick stuart was the new monarchs nephew although he had been born on the wrong side of the blanket such accidents of birth did not matter to the stuarts except where the succession was concerned they had always welcomed recognized and considered their bastards legitimate members of their clan the king wanted some of his family blood at his wedding ceremony and the leslies of glenkirk would acquit themselves and therefore the stuarts quite well they were also not important enough to be missed at the official mourning ceremonies since they only rarely came to court the st laurent chateau was in the countryside two hours from paris the leslies had been included on the guest list for the signing of the marriage contract and the betrothal ceremony on the twentyeighth of april as well as the wedding on may first they would attend with the five oldest children the st laurents lady stewarthepburn and the two youngest leslie children would come for the wedding only the lindley children and their stuart halfbrother had been too young to participate in king jamess court when queen anne had been alive she had died the year india was eleven the queen had adored fetes and masques she had loved art music and dancing her dour husband had tolerated her follies as he called them for love of his annie once the queen had died however jamess court became less entertaining it was hoped that the new french queen would enliven charles stuarts court even as the late anne of denmark had enlivened the court of james stuart glenkirk and his family were astounded even openly awed by the elegant magnificence of the louvre palace there was absolutely nothing like it in england they were met by the two royal english ambassadors the earl of carlisle and viscount kensington who quickly escorted them to king louiss chamber where the signing would take place first however the proper protocol had to be followed the two ambassadors handed the contract to the king and his lord chancellor to read this done the king signified his acceptance of the terms previously agreed upon and only then was the princess summoned to her brothers presence henriettamarie arrived escorted by the queen mother marie di medici and the ladies of the court the princess was garbed in a gown of clothofgold and silver embroidered all over with golden fleursdelys and encrusted with diamonds rubies emeralds and sapphires once the bride had taken her place the bridegrooms proxy was called the due de chevreuse came into the kings chamber wearing a blackstriped suit covered with diamonds he bowed first to the king and then the princess then the due presented his letter of authority to the king bowing once again accepting it louis xiii handed it to the chancellor and then signed the marriage contract other signatories were henriettamarie marie di medici the french queen anne of austria the due de chevreuse and the two english ambassadors the contract duly signed and witnessed the formal religious betrothal was performed in the kings chambers by the princesss godfather cardinal de la rochefoucauld the due de chevreuse answering for the king of england the ceremony over the princess retired to the carmelite convent in faubourg st jacques to rest and pray until her wedding on the first of may and the guests departed the duke of glenkirk and his family returning to chateau st laurent on henry lindleys sixteenth birthday which happened to be the thirtieth of april the glenkirk party the st laurents and lady stewarthepburn traveled to paris for the royal wedding it was better the due said to go the day before rather than waiting until the first but the roads were clogged anyway with all the traffic making its way into the city for the celebration by chance jamess brotherinlaw had a small house on the same tiny street as did jasmines french relations who would not be coming for the wedding the de savilles lived in the loire region many miles from paris and while of noble stock they were not important besides it was springtime and their famous vineyards at archambault needed tending more than they needed to be in the capital for the princesss wedding to the english king so they gladly loaned their little house to their relations the wedding day dawned gray and cloudy by ten oclock in the morning it was raining nonetheless crowds had begun gathering outside of the great square before notredame the previous evening now the square was overflowing with people eager to see the wedding the archbishop of paris had gotten into a terrible row with the cardinal de la rochefoucauld it was the cardinal who had been chosen to perform the wedding ceremony despite the fact that the cathedral was the archbishops province the royal family had brushed aside the archbishops protests as if he had been no more than a bothersome insect furious the archbishop had retired to his country estates not to return until after the wedding he could not however aggravated he might be deny the princess the use of his palace which was close by the cathedral and so at two oclock that afternoon in the pouring rain henriettamarie departed her apartments in the louvre for the archbishops residence in order to dress fortunately a special gallery had been constructed from the door of the archbishops palace to the door of the cathedral it was raised eight feet above the square and set upon pillars the lower half of which were wrapped in waxed cloth and the upper half in purple satin embroidered with gold fleursdelys at the west door of the cathedral was a raised platform which was sheltered by a canopy of clothofgold that had been waxed to prevent the rain from penetrating it at six oclock in the evening the bridal procession began streaming out of the archbishops palace moving down the opensided gallery toward the cathedral the bridal party was led by one hundred of the kings swiss guards the first two rows were a mixture of drummers and soldiers with blue and gold flags following the guards came a party of musicians twelve played upon oboes there were eight drummers who were followed by the ten state trumpeters playing a fanfare following the royal musicians was the grand master of ceremonies behind whom strode knights of the order of the holy ghost in jeweled capes next came seven royal heralds in crimsonandgoldstriped tabards the bridegrooms representative the due de chevreuse was proceeded by three ranking noblemen he was garbed in a black velvet suit slashed to show its clothofgold lining on his head was a velvet cap sporting a magnificent diamond that glittered despite the dullness of the late afternoon behind him were the earl of carlisle and viscount kensington in suits of clothofsilver the populace standing in the pouring rain on either side of the gallery struggled against each other attempting to get the best glimpse of the wedding party and the court cries of god bless the king and good fortune to the princess were heard by those moving along the gallery toward the platform and the cathedral most of the guests would pass through the raised canopied flooring and take their places within the cathedral only certain chosen ones would remain upon the dais to see the ceremony performed because the king of england was considered a protestant it was necessary to perform the wedding ceremony before the doors of the cathedral but as all weddings had once been performed in this manner little was thought of the arrangement afterward a mass would be celebrated within notredame among the chosen to view the wedding india lindley stood shivering as she drew her cloak about her she should have worn her rabbitlined cape but it was not nearly as fashionable as the one she was wearing she looked at the french courtiers in their magnificent clothing she had never seen anything like it it was utterly spectacular and she felt like someones poor country relation her mother of course had fabulous jewelry which covered a multitude of fashion sins but she and fortune looked positively dowdy even in comparison to the bosomless elevenyearold catherinemarie st laurent whose claretcolored silk and clothofgold gown was delicious here comes the bride fortune singsonged next to her fortune was enjoying every moment of this colorful and marvelous show it didnt matter to her that her mother and sister looked like a pair of burghers daughters india focused her eyes upon henriettamarie who was escorted by both of her brothers king louis xiii resplendent in clothofgold and silver and prince gaston elegant in sky blue silk and clothofgold the petite sixteenyearold bride was dressed in an incredible gown of heavy creamcolored silk embroidered all over with gold fleursdelys pearls and diamonds the dress was so encrusted with gold and diamonds that it glittered as she walked on her dark hair was a delicate goldfiligreed crown from whose center spire dripped a huge pearl pendant that caused the watching crowds to gasp i have better murmured the duchess of glenkirk and her motherinlaw restrained her laughter behind the bride and her brothers came the queen mother marie di medici wearing as always her black widows garb but dripping with diamonds in recognition of the occasion finally came frances queen anne of austria in a gown of clothofsilver and gold tissue sewn all over with sapphires and pearls leading the french court the few english guests had already been brought to the raised and canopied dais to await the arrival of the bridal party now come the cardinal performed the wedding ceremony and then the bride her family and the french court were escorted into the cathedral for the celebration of the mass inside the cathedral was filled with other invited guests members of the parliament other politicians and civic officials garbed formally for this occasion in erminetrimmed crimson velvet robes the walls of the cathedral were hung with fine tapestries and the bridal party was seated upon another canopied raised dais having settled the bride upon a small throne the due de chevreuse departed her side to escort the two english ambassadors and the few english guests to the archbishops palace for they would not attend the mass ridiculous jasmine muttered beneath her breath be silent james leslie said softly but sharply while he agreed with his wife that this prejudice between roman and anglican anglican and protestant was absurd it was a fact they had to live with and to involve ones self in the sectarian fray was to make enemies it was better to remain neutral lady stewarthepburn nodded her approval of her sons wisdom did you see the gowns india said excitedly to her mother i have never seen such clothing a bridal gown should be beautiful jasmine replied nay not the bridal gown india responded it is lovely of course but it is the gowns worn by the women of the french court that i am envious of mama your jewels naturally always overshadow anything you may wear but fortune and i look like two little sparrows compared to the french ladies why even flatchested catherinemarie outshines us it is most embarrassing we are here to represent our king and we look like two serving wenches whats wrong with our gowns fortune asked her elder sister i think we look quite nice i do like queen annes short hair though can i cut my hair like that mama no jasmine said your hair is beautiful child why would you cut it if this spanish queen of france would cut and frizz her own hair it is because her hair is not as fine as yours fortune nor as red fortune grumbled i am going to have an entire new wardrobe made when i get home to england india said i shall dazzle king charless court mama with my french fashions and their vibrant colors our countrymen wear such dull colors pale blue rose brown and black and mama you have so much jewelry would you not let me have some of it please she is certainly not shy about asking for what she wants is she cat said to her son she has been i imagine quite a handful to raise jemmie eh the duke of glenkirk smiled she is nae worse mother than any other girl he told her she hae always been an obedient lass give her what she wants and then find her a good husband was his parents advice she will not be obedient much longer i think i agree with your mother jasmine said there is a wild streak in india that i have never really recognized before perhaps i have not wanted to see it because it reminds me of my brother salim but suddenly i see familiar traits in india and i remember that my father indulged salim even when his disobedience was unforgivable and yet our father forgave him drunkenness lechery theft even murder there was only one thing my father would not forgive him curious lady stewarthepburn asked what salim desired me as a man desires a woman my father could not countenance it and i was married to my first husband prince javid khan salim had him murdered and knowing he was near death my father smuggled me out of india when i was indias age i was about to be wed to my second husband who was indias father then you must find a husband for india cat said it is obvious it is time for her to be settled before she causes a scandal i wish i knew a suitable match for her in naples oh no jasmine cried i should not want her so far away from us like my grandmother i want my family about me and we have all our family in england and scotland madame all but my uncle ewan oflaherty who lives in ireland and you madame who remain in the kingdom of naples jemmie has told me of your ah difficulty with the late king but now that james stuart is dead and buried would you not consider coming home to scotland again there is a place for you at glenkirk always bless you my dear jasmine cat said her voice thick with emotion but my beloved bothwell is buried in naples at the foot of our villas garden and that is where i will lie one day beside him in death as i was in life besides my old bones are too used to the warmth of the south to tolerate the damp and chill of scotland any longer your greatgrandmother returned home from a warm climate the duke said quietly i am not janet leslie cat said as quietly outside the salon where they were waiting a canon boomed it would appear the mass is finally over the earl of carlisle noted dryly took long enough viscount kensington responded do these catholics really think god is going to overlook their fornications and other mischief just because they spend so much time in church on their knees well lets hope this little queen weve gotten proves as fecund as her old mother come to the windows the earl called to them the rain has finally stopped and there are fireworks being shot off they stood watching as the rockets soared into the skies bursting red or green gold or blue sparkles against the darkness the wedding party and its guests made their way to the archbishops palace where a banquet was to be held in the great hall which had been newly decorated for the occasion with tapestries from the louvre a banquet table stretched from one end of the hall to the other the king had been placed in its center beneath yet another embroidered clothofgold canopy to his right sat his mother to his left his sister englands new queen the proxy bridegroom was placed on henriettas other side the bride was served by a highranking nobleman her old friend from childhood baron bassompierre and two french marshals when the meal had at last ended all the guilds of paris paraded before the new queen and her brothers swiss guards performed an intricate drill at eleven oclock the exhausted bride retired back to the louvre for the rest of the week all paris rejoiced and celebrated the marriage that united england and france there were balls and banquets so numerous it was difficult to get to them all the finest however was given by the queen mother in her new and magnificent luxembourg palace then suddenly george villiers the duke of buckingham arrived in france he had come he announced grandly to escort englands new queen home buckingham was very tall and extremely handsome his dark eyes when fixed upon a woman made her feel she was the only woman in the world his wife was devoted to him and while he was considered a terrible flirt lady villiers had no cause for jealousy buckingham had such beautiful features that the late king james had given him the nickname of steenie because the old monarch said george villiers had the face of st stephen who had been noted for his beauty the french queen was openly admiring of the englishman the french male courtiers hated him on sight for they considered villiers arrogant it was their opinion he behaved as if he were a king himself and they could barely tolerate his presence their wives disagreed sending the duke languishing looks each time he came their way smiling invitingly sighing over his chestnut curls his exquisitely barbered mustache and little pointed beard the queen and the other ladies of the court were always delighted to have the english duke among their company he swept into their midst one afternoon wearing a suit of silvergray silk and gold tissue the suit was sewn all over with pearls but the pearls were forever dropping off and rolling across the floor as servants scrambled to retrieve the gems the duke of buckingham waved them away with a smile the pearls were naught but trifles he told them implying there were plenty more where they came from keep them he said you have done it quite deliberately the duchess of glenkirk scolded george villiers these pearls are sewn too loosely so of course they will drop off you are intent on annoying these poor french what a wicked creature you are steenie they had known each other ever since villierss very early days at king jamess court the dark eyes twinkled an elegant eyebrow arched mischievously and then he smiled at her but he said not a word at last on the twentythird of may the new queen of englands great cavalcade finally departed paris it was made up of the several hundred people who would accompany henriettamarie including besides the lords and ladies who were to make up her household a large number of servants cooks grooms a surgeon an apothecary a tailor an embroiderer a perfumer a clockmaker eleven musicians mathurine her fool and twentyfour priests including a bishop the king had an attack of the quinsy his throat was so enflamed that he could barely speak he bid his sister farewell at compiegne and returned to paris to recuperate at amiens marie di medici developed a fever after a few days it became obvious that henriettamarie would have to leave her mother and travel onward with her great train by herself charles was already sending impatient messages to france requesting his bride come forthwith finally they reached boulogne where twenty ships were waiting to take the new queen and her retinue to england there was also a party of english ladies and gentlemen who had come to greet the new queen but while henriettamarie was polite she showed little warmth toward these members of her new court they were protestants and must be avoided as much as possible her foolish spiritual advisors warned her little caring if she made a good impression on her new subjects as long as her soul was safe the duke of glenkirk and his family had taken their leave of the young queen in paris they would see her in england but it was not necessary that they be part of the great company traveling with henriettamarie to her husband they returned to the chateau with the st laurents so they might have a few more days with lady stewarthepburn who would be spending the summer in france with her youngest daughter james leslie tried hard to get his mother to return home to scotland with them you dinna even know this stuart king mother and his parents your last link wi the royal stuarts are both gone now come home wi us to scotland there is always a place for you at glenkirk catriona hay leslie stewarthepburn shook her head she had been a dazzling beauty in her youth and while time had aged her she was still a stunning woman her honeyblond hair had turned a snowy white just faintly tinted with gold her leafgreen eyes however had not changed they were as clear and beautiful as they had always been now they fixed themselves on him jemmie she said you are my eldest child and i love you dearly but i will not leave bothwell as i have already told jasmine besides as i have also said my old bones are too used to the sunshine and the warmth of the south going home to scotland would take ten years off my life while i miss francis i am not all that anxious to join him yet i enjoy my grandchildren too much i fear she laughed and patted his hand you have done very well all these years without me do you not miss your children he queried her my brothers and my sisters hae given you grandchildren too mother and all have at one time or another come to naples with their families to see me she responded they do not need me either jemmie a woman raises her bairns and then no matter how much she loves them she must let them go on to live their own lives a mother and father are like the sun around which their children move then one day it all changes the bairns are grown and become like the sun themselves which means the parents must take a lesser position in their lives there is no tragedy in this for a mother wants her bairns to nourish and lead their own lives they go on and we go on i loved all my bairns but you were not my only life soon jasmines three eldest will be ready to leave the loving nest you and she have built for them you must let them go jemmie as i let you and your brothers and sisters go and you must let me go my son while you may not realize it you did so years ago when i left scotland and you became head of the leslies of glenkirk seeing me after so long a time has but made you nostalgic i dinna realize how much i hae missed you mother until now james leslie said will you nae return to scotland ever you know i will never leave him she replied he would like it if he were buried in the soil of his native land the duke of glenkirk said slowly then he chuckled ill wager he was awaiting cousin jamie at heavens gate and queen anne with him she always liked bothwell mother didnt she cat nodded all the women liked francis she recalled with a small smile but if he were awaiting jamie at heavens gate surely the king thought he had been sent in the opposite direction from which he anticipated although seeing his annie might have reassured him she laughed and then grew pensive again aye he would like to have been laid to rest in his native land jemmie do you think he would object to being planted in leslie soil the duke inquired of his mother on the grounds of the old abbey cat said softly could you jemmie did we nae once hoax the royal stuarts mother the duke answered her you and i together you would not think it disloyal to your fathers memory my father is nae buried at glenkirk the duke said his mother did not know it of course for she had been gone from scotland but the dukes father the fifth earl of glenkirk had not been lost at sea as had been reported before the king ordered him declared dead actually he had been captured by the spanish and gone exploring with them in the new world where he had made himself a new life the duke had learned of it almost twentyfive years ago when his father appeared suddenly at glenkirk to make amends for his long absence he was extremely relieved to learn he might go on with his new life and return to the young woman who awaited him in a place called st augustine james leslie had never seen his father again although every few years a missive would arrive filled with news of his adventures and the halfsiblings his new wife had borne him my father was a good scotsman mother and if it had been possible he would have been buried at glenkirk himself i dinna believe he would object to you and bothwell being there he owes you that much the duke said meaningfully and then besides who will know it but us then one day we shall come home to scotland together he and i lady stewarthepburn said and suddenly her eyes were filled with tears which slid down her beautiful face even as she attempted to prevent them ahhh she said softly we had such grand times he and i as we rode beneath the border moon then catching hold of her emotions she said we will travel in a single coffin that way there will be no questions just the duke of glenkirks old mother returning to be buried in her native soil and no one shall ever know where bothwells grave is jemmie for even in naples there are those who believed those scurrilous tales of witchcraft and magic cousin jamie and his protestants spread about francis there are some who come to take soil from his grave believing it has powers i must keep a watch there all the time or they would surely steal his body away to use in their vile rites i dinna think i will get you home too soon mother the duke said seeking to lighten the moment no she replied with a small laugh then she hugged him thank you jemmie for your generosity i hae always enjoyed sharing secrets wi you mother he chuckled only jasmine shall know besides we two agreed she answered him i will miss you and i you he told her and then the duke of glenkirk took his mother for a final stroll in his sisters gardens chapter such extravagance the countess of alcester said in very disapproving tones she turned to her niece you are spoiling the chit jasmine by allowing her to have such a wardrobe every fortune hunter at court will descend upon you when india parades herself in this splendor am i so witless greataunt india defended herself that i cannot separate truth from fiction i have turned down half a dozen matches in scotland for the very reason i knew it was my fortune that attracted the gentlemen in question and not me fine clothes will do little if anything to dull my perception of men your tongue is too quick for a girl of respectable upbringing the countess snapped india was too damned headstrong even as her mother had been even as my mother was willow lady edwardes countess of alcester thought irritably thank heavens my daughters have all been obedient girls and my granddaughters too although perhaps one or two of them bear watching if you will take my advice jasmine although i suspect you will not you and james will make a good match for india and cease this nonsense and outrageous expense then heaving her bulk from the chair in which she had been sitting lady edwardes shook out her own dark skirts i do not like london anymore she grumbled and no one should live here at this time of year it is too warm and much too damp but what could we do we had to come to london to greet the new queen i think the queen is very pretty india noted all young girls are pretty her greataunt said and this one no more or less than many but there will be difficulty over her religion mark my words and if all those french with her persist in their rude habits the king will do well to send them away she moved toward the door i am going back to your uncles house now she announced i will see you all in the morning when we go to court and i hope jasmine that your daughter will be suitably garbed like a proper young englishwoman and not decked out like some foreigner the countess of alcester stamped through the open door which a servant held for her her skirts swinging indignantly as she went fat old cow india muttered when the door had shut again she has just forgotten what it is like to be young jasmine told her daughter although personally she agreed with her daughters assessment aunt willow had always been prim and proper it was as if she strove to be entirely and totally different from her own mother a lady of passion and colorful character it often made her seem joyless and didactic your greataunt is correct in one thing however india jasmine said tomorrow you will wear one of your less spectacular gowns to court to greet the queen it would not do to outshine her majesty when she is undoubtedly striving to make a good impression upon her new subjects she will be feeling strange and i suspect not just a little frightened in her new land like when you came to england india said jasmine nodded at least the queen can go home again if she wants to visit france once i left india there was no going back do you ever regret leaving her eldest child asked jasmine shook her head no my life there was at an end my fate was here with your father and later in scotland with your stepfather my darling jemmie you must never fight your fate india even if it is not the fate you believe you would choose my fate isnt very interesting mama india said i will have to choose a husband very soon or risk being an old maid i will settle down and have children as you and grandmother velvet and my greatgrandmother madame skye did there is no excitement or surprises in such a fate it is all quite ordinary i fear neither madame skye nor my mother nor i led dull lives in our youth india jasmine reminded her daughter although i do hope you will not face quite all the excitement we did i am not certain you could cope with it being so gently raised grandmother velvet was gently raised and she managed to survive her adventures india reminded her mother it was a different time jasmine said softly thinking her english born and bred daughter did not know the half of it come and help me choose what i will wear tomorrow mama india said and we must choose something for fortune she will wait until the last minute and somehow manage to look like nobodys child embarrassing us all fortunes appearance matters little to her i fear the duchess of glenkirk laughed aloud at her eldest childs assessment of her younger sister it was so accurate india cared very much how she looked and how she appeared before the world her hair was always properly coiffed her gown fresh her nails neatly trimmed fortune on the other hand was an unrepentant hoyden whose red hair was always flying and tangled as fortune dashed impulsively through life her skirts muddied and more than likely a smudge upon her pale cheek the duchesss mother said that fortune would change when she got older but fortune would be fifteen in just a few weeks and showed no signs of maturation how on earth could she and rowan lindley have spawned two such different daughters let us choose your sisters gown first jasmine suggested knowing it would take india forever to settle upon her own garb india nodded her agreement the main problem will be to find something clean she said but i suppose nelly does her best to keep up with our wild fortune then india laughed no one can make me angrier than fortune mama she does not seem to care at all but i do love her i know you do the duchess replied and then together the two hurried upstairs to seek out a wardrobe indias elegant new silk skirts rustling as they went impressed by the exquisite clothing she had seen at the french court india lindley had returned from france determined to have a new gown nay a dozen new gowns fashioned in the same manner of the finest materials sewn all over with jewels and gold thread with fine brocade petticoats that would show through the gowns front opening she thought the farthingales and bellshaped skirts of her greatgrandmother grandmother and mothers day far more elegant than the skirts of today that fell to the floor in simple folds with the fullness toward the back it was somehow sloppy india thought but it was the fashion now opulent fabrics india thought would take the curse from this less elegant mode india had therefore raided the omalleysmall trading company warehouses where there were incredible fabrics stored that her mother had brought from her homeland nearly twenty years ago there was so much fine stuff that india knew even if she and her sister were completely outfitted in dozens of new gowns each there would still be enough of the beautiful materials left over she had picked carefully colors and fabrics that would flatter her skin then she had personally overseen the making of the garments which were far richer than those normally worn now in england satisfied that her gowns were every bit as good as those that would be worn by the queen and her french ladies india looked forward to going to court the king and queen had been remarried at st augustines abbey in canterbury and had then made their way to london coming into the city by barge as there was plague about it was not the official state entry that henriettamarie had expected still the young queen waved at the crowds through the open window of the vessel as they stood there along the thames bank in the wind and rain to greet her the king was more sedate waving regally his face somber afterward however the queen had retired to rest from her long journey it was just now at the end of june that she felt ready to attend the formal proclamation of her marriage the ceremony took place in the great hall of whitehall palace the king and his queen sat upon their thrones while the marriage contract was read aloud to the assembled dignitaries and the court looking about her india was quite satisfied that she was the best dressed englishwoman in the hall fortune of course had rolled her eyes as india had been laced into a small corset but india knew it was worth it for her small breasts swelled discreetly over the low square neckline of her gown pushed up by the corset the gown itself was of claretred silk with a wide ivory lace collar that extended low on the shoulder the sleeves reached the elbow and showed ivoryandgold brocade through their slashes that matched the tantalizing glimpse of petticoat through the gowns skirt opening the duchess had refused to allow her daughter to wear her own famous rubies believing pearls more suitable to the occasion indias hair was as fashionable as her gown her dark locks being fixed into a flat coiled knot at the back with a single lovelock tied with a gold ribbon draping itself teasingly by her left ear damn me if that aint the most beautiful girl ive ever seen adrian leigh viscount twyford said to his friend lord john summers too rich for your blood lord summers replied dryly you know who she is johnny and why should i not aspire to such a magnificent creature because she is the stepdaughter of the duke of glenkirk and the sister of the marquis of westleigh a virgin and an heiress far beyond your reach you dont want to marry twyford you want to seduce seduce that beauty and youll end up very dead whatever they have planned for lady india lindley it isnt you ill be earl of oxton one day johnny viscount twyford replied and what a countess she would make india tis an odd name the duchess of glenkirk the girls mother is from that land i am told although her mother is english or scots im not sure which i do know they are a wealthy family and somehow distantly related to the kings family lady lindleys halfbrother the duke of lundy is also the kings nephew wrong side of the blanket of course but you know these stuarts adrian the women are obviously hotblooded viscount twyford noted his blue eyes fixed on india be careful adrian his friend teased if your mama should find out you have an interest in such a suitable girl she will be quite piqued i know how she dotes on you it is said she will never give you over into the care of another woman my mother would do well to remain at oxton hall looking after my father he has not been well in recent years twyford said sourly shes still a handsome woman lord summers remarked she concentrates on remaining so the viscount replied it is her sole interest that and certain men she will not prevent me from marrying johnny when i find the right girl and i believe i have it is my duty to have an heir i know it would please my father he fixed his eyes on his companion i must be introduced to lady india lindley johnny do you know any of the family i have an acquaintance with her brother henry lindley the marquis of westleigh my little estate borders his holdings at cadby if he is here i suppose i might presume upon him he has a good nature lord summers swept the great hall with his mild gaze ahh there he is with his stepfather the duke come along adrian this is as good a chance as well get i think the two men made their way across the large chamber which was filled to overflowing with the court the marriage contract having been read the king had gone into a nearby chamber to dine and the queen had retired to her apartments this left the courtiers to mill about visiting and gossiping with and about each other when they had reached the area where the duke of glenkirk stood speaking with his stepson lord summers stopped and waited to catch henry lindleys eye saying when he did i came to pay my respects my lord and to introduce you to my friend viscount twyford who having seen your sister lady india tells me he will perish if you do not introduce them lord summers grinned in friendly fashion at the marquis of westleigh who was three years his junior introduce me to these gentlemen henry the duke of glenkirk said he took in the measure of the two young men before them lord john summers father his estate borders mine we have sometimes hunted together when i have been at cadby henry lindley said and this is his friend viscount twyford do you have a name young man the duke of glenkirk demanded adrian leigh sir i am the earl of oxtons son and heir he bowed to james leslie and the young marquis and you wish to meet my stepdaughter sir to what purpose the duke inquired fiercely a tinkle of laughter greeted his words as the duchess of glenkirk overhearing turned and took her husbands arm do not be such a ninny jemmie viscount twyford would appear to me to be a fairly respectable young man and india is a beautiful young girl to what purpose indeed she laughed again then said henry take both these gentlemen and introduce them to india then she lightly touched adrian leighs arm you are respectable sir are you not aye madame i am he said boyishly then go along with my son my lord jasmine instructed him the trio hurried across the hall again this time headed for india who stood with another young girl chattering she smiled at her brothers approach holding out her hand to him henry she quickly looked at her brothers two companions and then directly at her brother mama says i may introduce these gentlemen to you india but i recognize lord summers india said smiling prettily at him you hunt with henry at cadby dont you i did not know you had seen me mistress as we have never been formally introduced until now lord summers said bowing to india how could i fail to notice so handsome a gentleman india said coquettishly tossing her head just slightly gods blood the girl next to her swore fortune india looked scandalized she is my younger sister and has never been out in society before india excused her sibling she will never i fear behave properly is flirting outrageously with a man youve just met proper fortune demanded india flushed i am not flirting i was being polite fortune snorted henry lindley laughed sisters he said effectively dismissing them both as silly creatures india if you are quite through being indignant i will introduce you to viscount twyford who for some reason has insisted upon making your acquaintance the word beautiful did pass his lips when he spoke of you india lindley turned her golden eyes upon adrian leigh she held out her hand how do you do my lord she murmured much better now that we have met my lady he returned taking her slender elegant little hand and kissing it fortune rolled her eyes comically henry i am suddenly nauseous will you escort me away from this sickening sweetness india did not hear her she had the presence of mind to withdraw her hand from viscount twyfords grasp but she was already intrigued by him zut alors india un anglais avec charme a voice declared and an outrageously beautifully dressed young man turned from the throng taking up indias hand so recently released by viscount twyford he kissed it gallantly bonjour ma belle cousine rené oh rené you have grown up havent you indias gaze swept over the handsome frenchman he was quite gorgeous oui chérie je suis un homme speak english rené you are in england now and not france india scolded him and you do speak better english than most english speak french cousin how good it is to see you again she turned again to lord summers and viscount twyford this is the chevalier st justine my cousin rené lord john summers and adrian leigh viscount twyford rené i didnt know you were coming with the queen from france i didnt see you in paris jasmine said why are you here one of her majestys gentlemen of honor fell ill at the last moment and as i had just come up from archambault to paris on estate business and stopped at the louvre to pay my respects to king louis it seems i was in the right spot at the right time its quite an accolade for the family that i was chosen chérie and just how are you related the viscount asked not simply curious but strangely jealous she called him cousin but exactly how close were they the froggie was perhaps too handsome too suave lord summers the chevalier and young henry lindley all recognized the suspicion in adrian leighs tone it was an incredible presumption on his part to voice such an inquiry but india seemed totally unaware renés greatgrandmother and my greatgrandfather were brother and sister she answered the viscount i spent part of my childhood in france rené and i were playmates rené do you recognize henry all grown up and there is fortune over there with mama the chevalier bowed to the marquis my lord it is good to see you again as well now however i shall go and pay my respects to your parents and lady fortune eh ill come with you india said tucking her hand through his arm mama will be so surprised rené henry she called to her brother you come too then smiling at the other two gentlemen she moved off across the great hall with her escorts you have an admirer ma petite rené st justine noted mischievously as they walked a bit bold for my taste henry lindley replied there is something i have heard about the family that is not savory but i cannot think what it is right now i do hope you are not going to be one of those overly protective brothers henry india said sharply remember that i am older than you are i thought viscount twyford rather charming and he is handsome you are ten months older than i am india her brother reminded her tis hardly a generation the earl of oxton yes now i remember the earls eldest son was implicated in the murder of a rival in love and fled england he disappeared and has never been heard of again the earl fell into a deep decline and has not appeared publicly since it happened your swain is his younger halfbrother india son of the second wife who is said to take her lovers from among her servants and tenants charming indeed im surprised a fellow as decent as summers would associate with such a man i hardly think viscount twyford suitable for you sister you cannot blame the viscount for the behavior of either his elder halfbrother or his mother henry how unfair of you india cried i like him and if he wishes to pay me his addresses i shall welcome them say anything to father about his unfortunate relations and father will know about that little housemaid at greenwood you have been fucking in dark hallways didnt think i knew did you gods blood her brother swore how did you know are all men that noisy when they fuck india wondered aloud the chevalier burst out laughing india you have not changed little cousin i am so glad then he paused a moment and said but henry is correct in one sense chérie a man is rarely unlike his family in his behavior besides you can do better than a mere viscount you are the daughter of a marquis the stepdaughter of a duke you have a marquis for a brother and a duke for a brother and that little duke is the kings own nephew aye chérie you can do much better than a provincial little viscount i shall do as i please india answered him and he laughed once more i am not just well connected but rich as well rené and when you are rich you can do as you please she told him within the law her brother reminded her disapprovingly while the queen struggled to find her way within this new court she had been married into and her french household and the english court jockeyed for dominance the younger less important members of her train led by the chevalier st justine and the younger english courtiers became friendly none of them cared for power they simply wanted to have fun it was summer the weather was pleasant and new to court most of them found it exciting filled with youthful exuberance they involved themselves in hunting and picnics boating tennis and archery contests from dawn till dusk then they danced the night away or took part in little masques often the young queen joined them for like her late motherinlaw anne of denmark she loved such merriment the king however who had enjoyed his mothers revels in his youth was now weighed down by his office and not often amused i want to go to queens malvern lady fortune lindley complained to her mother one warm and muggy morning why must we remain here with the court we have never followed the court soon summer will be at an end and we shall be returning to glenkirk mama your sister has entered society and if we are ever to find her a husband fortune we must remain with the court right now all the eligible young men are here jasmine explained to her middle daughter if india wants to remain here fine fortune said but cant the rest of us go up to queens malvern it isnt just me we all want to go isnt that so henry i should be at cadby her brother agreed nodding jasmine looked to her children charlie she said i have paid my respects to my uncle mama and been presented to the queen charles frederick stuart the duke of lundy replied it is not necessary for me to show myself at court again until the coronation which my uncle the king says will be next winter the duchess of glenkirk peered questioningly at her three leslie sons we would rather be in the country mama said patrick speaking for himself and his two younger brothers adam and duncan i suppose that we could send the seven of you to queens malvern jasmine said thoughtfully and your father and i could remain here to chaperone india but you would have to behave yourselves if i did she warned them adali is at queens malvern mama fortune reminded her parent you know adali would not let us run wild if anything he is sterner with us than you and papa well jasmine considered nibbling on her lower lip and i will help him oversee the boys fortune pressed gently and i will be at cadby mama henry reminded her it would just be our younger brothers and the baby for adali to monitor fortune will spend her days riding and she cannot get into trouble just riding i see no reason for your father to object jasmine decided very well you may all go up to queens malvern yaaaaay her offspring cheered when fortune pressed tomorrow if you can pack yourselves up by then her mother replied and fortunes siblings cheered lustily once again what is this all about india demanded to know coming into the family hall where they were all seated she was dressed for riding in a deep blue velvet skirt and a jacket trimmed in silver we are going to queens malvern fortune began india shrieked nay we cannot i do not want to go up to the country it is boring and then before we know it we shall have to return to scotland ohhh shall never see adrian again she turned on her sister this is all your doing fortune you are simply jealous because the gentlemen are attracted to me and not attracted to you and your carroty hair ohhh i hate you i shall never forgive you i shall die if i cannot remain with the court she flung herself into a chair if you ask me she should be sent home to glenkirk right now muttered henry lindley darkly you are not going to queens malvern india her mother said i intended to let you remain here with your father and me but now i wonder if henry isnt perhaps right apologize to your sister this moment and i was not aware that viscount twyford had caught your fancy he is not at all suitable for a girl of your breeding and wealth henry lindley quickly shook his head at india denying any betrayal of her secrets but i like adrian mama he is charming and he is very amusing and he likes me india finished smugly has he said so jasmine asked her daughter gracious no india replied but rené says it is so fortune is awaiting your apology jasmine said quietly india quickly hugged her sister im sorry she said you know i didnt mean it fortune if this is what an interest in men does to a person fortune answered i hope i shall never seek to attract a gentlemans attention then picking up her skirts she hurried from the hall saying as she went i have to pack if we are to be ready by the morrow come laddies her brothers scrambled to their feet and dashed after fortune why dont you and papa go with them india said innocently jasmine laughed because you must have a chaperone but im seventeen india protested just her mother reminded her in grandmother velvets day girls younger than i came to court india grumbled i dont understand why i cant stay alone in your grandmothers day the girls at court your age were either maidsofhonor serving old queen bess married or in the charge of a parent or older relative and like you seeking husbands of good name good repute and suitable fortunes this is not however your grandmothers day a young woman of good family is properly supervised by her family lest society receive the incorrect impression that she is either not valued or that her behavior is loose you are sooo oldfashioned india muttered if i am her mother replied serenely i shall remain so and until you have left my home for your husbands home you will obey me you will also not give me cause to regret that i have allowed you to remain with the court when i should far prefer to go home to queens malvern myself with your sister and brothers i am quite capable of changing my mind india now tell me about viscount twyford does he seek to pay his addresses to you he really is not suitable you know why not india was curious as to what her mother had heard his fathers family is a respectable one jasmine said they are glocestershire people i am sure you know about his brother deverall it was quite a scandal and such things do not die deverall leigh murdered a rival india said so it was said and the fact that he fled england did nothing to erase that impression many however did not believe it deverall leigh was an honorable young man but still it was his knife found in the victims chest and he ran away a convenience for his stepmother and her son adrian no one saw or heard the murder of lord jeffers his serving man was away that night and there was no one else in the house and of course there was the knife deverall leigh can never return to england without facing the hangmans rope for there is no one to attest to his innocence if indeed he is innocent i had heard that his father had disowned him what choice did the poor man have so your friend adrian will one day be the earl of oxton and sooner than later if the rumors are to be believed jasmine finished but why do you hold adrian to account for his brothers behavior mama you have said the leighs are a respectable family india replied i said his fathers family was respectable his mother however is another thing she is a foreigner her family is not the equal of her husbands she is said to take lovers men of low station her husband is a broken man some say her behavior is as much to blame as the alleged behavior of deverall leigh this young man who has caught your fancy is her son raised by her what kind of man can he be the acorn india does not fall far from the oak besides the leighs are not a family of wealth and you have always sought to avoid those young men who were fortune hunters what makes you think adrian leigh is not because he is obviously interested in me mama the others were always asking about my lands and my other holdings and what kind of income i had from my inheritance adrian never asks such things then possibly he is different india but he is still not suitable jasmine responded still as long as his behavior is correct toward you i see no reason you should not continue to enjoy his company better she think i have no violent objection to this young man jasmine thought i do not want to drive her into his arms he is clever this adrian leigh he has to know that india is very very wealthy it has never been a secret he is willing to wait and see just how wealthy she is until he has her securely netted a dangerous opponent i fear damnation why could not the perfect man come along and sweep india off her feet jemmies mother was right my daughter is ripe for the taking and a girl in love for the first time is not always prudent james leslie stood with his wife the following day waving the majority of their children farewell as they set out with their servants for queens malvern i should just as soon go wi them he said dourly but he understood the importance of their remaining come autumn though they would return north whether it pleased india or not and he agreed with his wife that they would allow india a certain measure of freedom for nothing was more embarrassing to a young girl than to be obviously overseen india danced that same evening away in a magnificent gown of peacockblue silk with a silver lace collar the bodice of which was embroidered all over with pearls and diamante she wore pearls in her dark hair and her lovelock was tied with a silver ribbon studded with twinkling crystals about her slender throat was a choker of creamy baroque pearls she was flushed with pleasure and her creamy cheeks were rosy you are the most beautiful girl in the entire world adrian leigh told her passionately his sapphireblue eyes glittering i know india replied and then she laughed at his surprise do you want me to demure and giggle like some little ninny she teased no he said surprising her i want to steal you away and make love to you for hours on end would you like that my india as a virgin i have no idea whether i would like it or not india replied pertly and i am not your india even when i am married i shall belong to no one but myself adrian the women in my family have always been both independent of spirit and independent in their own wealth i see no reason to change such a fine custom do you i would change nothing about you he told her fervently i adore you just as you are india he bent his blond head and brushed her lips impulsively with his india tossed her head half avoiding him i have not given you permission to kiss me she said tweaking the fabric of his skyblue silk doublet i should be a poor suitor if i meekly waited for your permission he said pulling her into an alcove and pinioning her against the wall the blue eyes stared down into her gold ones you are ripe for kissing india and i vow that no lips but mine shall ever touch yours adrian leigh said his mouth fully touching hers for the first time warm firm not at all unpleasant india thought her heart raced madly with her first kiss her stomach felt as if the bottom had suddenly fallen out of it then he took his lips away smiling down at her did you like it india he asked her she nodded you have nothing to say to me he said again she commanded him i want to see if its as nice the second time as it was the first adrian leigh laughed very well he acquiesced and kissed her a second kiss encouraged this time when her own lips pressed back against his he raised his head up thats it india kiss me back then he kissed her a third time and indias arms slipped about his neck her little round breasts pressed against him tsk tsk tsk i think that is quite enough chérie india heard her cousin the chevalier st justine say with a feigned sigh of exasperation guiltily india pulled away from the viscount rené he drew her blushing from the alcove you must have a care for your good name chérie even if monsieur le viscount does not my intentions are honorable chevalier adrian leigh protested if they are indeed viscount rené st justine said you surely know better than to take a wellbred virgin into a dark alcove and enflame her innocent passions with kisses rené india was mortified i am not a child damn it the gentleman knows what i am saying india even if you do not understand he replied now come and dance with me cousin he led her off leaving viscount twyford standing in the semidarkness india was certainly well guarded adrian leigh thought to himself but he meant to have her for his wife much to his surprise those unschooled little kisses she had returned his kisses with had aroused him was it your first kiss chérie rené inquired curiously i will be so glad when i do not have to answer to my family for my every action india muttered as they walked together how did you know we were there rené india was torn between irritation and outright anger i saw him push you into the alcove and when you did not emerge as quickly as you should have i came to rescue you he told her if i saw it india then others certainly did you are not a girl of easy virtue cousine but if you allow gentlemen to take you into dark places you will gain a reputation whether you want one or not your viscount sought to put you at a disadvantage i fear and you are too innocent of the world to understand that now however you do eh why does everyone think adrian is bad india asked him perhaps not bad the chevalier said thoughtfully but he is mayhap opportunistic to catch an heiress such as lady india lindley would be quite a coup for him but i havent said i wanted to marry him rené nor has he even mentioned the subject india replied he does not have to chérie if he sullies your good name then no one else will have you despite your wealth and your beauty you would fall into his lap like a ripe fruit ma petite i do not think you want anyone to manipulate you like that india eh rené st justines brown eyes were questioning bending he kissed her cheek but i do like him rené india said still you are correct in realizing that i dont like being beguiled into an untenable position so i suppose the answer is not to allow gentlemen to put you in dark corners she laughed i thought i was so grown up rené it seems i am not i am glad i have you for my guardian angel henry has gone to the country with my siblings court did not suit them at all alas chérie i shall only be with you for a little while longer the gentleman whose place i took has recovered and will be coming from paris soon and i am needed at home i may be a chevalier of france but i am also the finest wine maker at archambault i must return to france in time for the harvest and you will be returning to scotland the king wants papa here for the coronation india said i hope i shall be allowed to come from glenkirk then if you behave and do not give your mama and papa any difficulty chérie i suspect they will allow you to come rené said his eyes twinkling a small smile upon his lips but you must be very very good eh india laughed i will be cousin she promised him because in a few weeks time i shall go north and unless i can come to court this winter i shant ever see adrian again then i shall die an old maid eh she mimicked him teasingly non non the chevalier protested you shall not die an old maid chérie somewhere in this world is a wonderful man just waiting to make you happy you will find him india never fear you will find each other this i know george villiers the duke of buckingham had come to court as a young man he had found favor with old king james worked his way up the social ladder from the second son of a knight to a dukedom and married an earls daughter lady katherine manners but james stuart was old and having gained his favor george villiers set out to win over the kings only surviving son and heir charles in this endeavor he was successful and now george villiers was next to king charles the most powerful man in england wealth and power had bred in him the desire for more wealth and power in the young queen he sensed a rival and so he set out to destroy any small influence she might gain with her equally young husband his tactic with king james had been to subtly create a conflict between the old man and his son when the disagreement was full blown the kings beloved steenie would step in and mediate between king and prince it was clever and neither james stuart or charles stuart ever realized they were being cunningly maneuvered by the wickedly adroit villiers the duke attempted to work the same tactic on the queen but henrietta was far more clever than her husband and quite used to such court intrigue she resisted george villiers strongly and he fearful of losing his position set out to destroy her marriage to charles stuart by deliberately fostering misunderstanding between the two henrietta could not complain to her husband for like his father before him charles was of the firm belief george villiers was his true and best friend both king and queen had been virgins on their wedding night for charles was far too prim to have taken a mistress or tumbled a servant girl in a dark stable as neither his father nor buckingham wanted any other influence in charless life they had discouraged his involvement with women the young couple dared to speak to no one about this painful experience they stumbled along in their physical relationship the sixteenyearold queen shy of her equally shy but demanding husband who had been told by villiers that what the man wanted was what god approved of for man was superior villiers then convinced charles that his wifes shyness was a refusal of his wishes and an attempt to gain the upper hand things went from bad to worse whoever heard of a name like henrietta villiers said one day to the king its so foreign the queen is english now and really ought to have a good english name perhaps we could call her queen henry henrietta of course as the duke had anticipated fell into a terrible rage upon hearing the suggestion mon nom est henrietta she screamed henri la reine henri cest impossible non non non je suis henrietta charles found her passionate gallic outburst distasteful we will speak when you are calmer madame he said coldly then his gaze swept the queens chamber all these monsieurs he said in reference to his wifes french attendants both male and female they really must go madame it is time you were served by your own people these are my own people the queen answered him sharply these persons are french madame you are englands queen and should be served by good englishmen and women the king replied his tone equally sharp it was agreed henrietta said struggling to remain calm that i should have the right to choose my own household sir it was not agreed that they should all be french the king snapped buckingham has sought a place for his sister the countess of denbigh within your household and yet you have been adamant in your refusal madame i like it not the comtesse is a protestant sir the queen said you cannot expect me to be served by a protestant i am a protestant madame the king replied it did not stop you from marrying me nor will it stop you from having my heirs one day and they will be protestant he glared at her marie your majesty said madame st george who had been the queens governess and now sought to turn the argument back to the original and less volatile ground if the queens name henrietta seems unsuitable for a queen of england would not marie mary queen mary be better i know your majesty is not so petty that he would insist upon calling the queen by any other name but her own in private but queen mary would be her official title if it would please your majesty she curtsied mary is english is it not and it is my mistresss second christian name it seems a good compromise the king said pleased to have gotten his way and not wishing any further outburst from his wife who nodded mutely in agreement the duke of buckingham was equally pleased but for a different reason the english had long memories and they had not forgotten bloody mary tudor the last roman catholic english queen who had persecuted the protestants she had not been popular and neither would this queen mary be he chuckled to himself well pleased when parliament opened the queen was not present for her confessor bishop de mende had somehow gotten the idea that a church of england religious ceremony was central to the occasion the king was furious the parliament was offended and granted the king only a seventh of the monies he needed he adjourned the session and moved his household to hampton court for the plague was still rife in london buckingham continued to undermine the queen advising her that her clothing was far too lavish and unsuitable for an englishwoman her hairstyle was too foreign her temper too quick he advised her that she should be more amenable to her husband or charles would send her back to france then he attempted once again to gain a place in her household for not just his sister but his wife and his niece as well the queen was outraged and this time did complain to her husband in response charles went hunting to avoid the uproar and while he was gone the countess of denbigh held a public religious service in the royal household the queen and her people interrupted it not once but twice trekking through the hall chattering and laughing their dogs in their wake as if nothing unusual were taking place buckingham dutifully reported this to the king making certain charless anger was well roused the king was indeed outraged but not at lady denbigh for deliberately baiting the queen his anger was directed solely at his wife whom he decided to punish by sending her entire retinue of french back to paris now buckingham realized he had gone too far he did not wish to be responsible for endangering the alliance between england and france which this marriage represented in paris king louis and his mother had heard of the discord between the recently married couple they were not at all pleased and decided to send an envoy to investigate buckingham quickly persuaded the king to allow the queens household to remain for the time being the plague having finally subsided the coronation was set for february second at glenkirk james leslie grumbled loudly at having to make the trek from the eastern highlands of scotland down to london at the midpoint of the winter the snows were deep the trip would be cold and take forever they would have to leave immediately after twelfth night i dinna intend taking all of you bairns he said to his assembled family i am perfectly happy to remain home fortune lindley said henry charlie and patrick shall go because the first two are english and the last my heir the duke of glenkirk said india held her breath and threw a beseeching glance at her mother adrian leigh had been permitted to correspond with her and had kept her apprised of all the gossip and the coronation plans i think india should go too jasmine finally said why james leslie demanded because she is rowans firstborn and an english noblewoman of an old and respected family who certainly should see her king crowned jasmine said quietly besides this is an excellent opportunity for us to look over the young men from suitable families many will be at the coronation who do not as a rule come to court it is a wonderful chance for her besides it will please me to have my daughter with me jemmie verra well he said grudgingly but i dinna want to see that fancy young viscount hanging about india he looked directly at his stepdaughter hes nae for you mistress do you understand me india i hae been patient allowing him to write to you once a month but you will nae wed such a fellow this time i would see other suitors at our door ye dinna hae your cousin rené to hide behind any longer did you nae know i knew twas young leigh who you were so anxious to be wi and nae the chevalier india bit back the quick retort on her lips and hung her head in a contrite fashion she would damn well do what she wanted to do but she would wait to get to england before she made that announcement yes papa she said meekly and thank you for allowing me to go and yell pick a husband india james leslie told his stepdaughter either down in england or here in scotland lassie youll be eighteen this june and you canna wait any longer mama was only eighteen when i was born india noted but she hae already hae two husbands he said and besides it takes time to make a bairn and birth it i want to love the man i marry india told him ill nae force you to the altar lassie james leslie said but you must be more tractable and practical in this matter i will try papa india promised him what a little liar you are fortune mocked her sister afterward when they were alone in their chamber you want to marry adrian leigh india i know you do and he would like to marry you although i do not think he loves you just your wealth of course he loves me india said angrily to her sister he has told me so in his letters fortune fortune shook her head i do not understand you india you have always been so careful where fortune hunters are concerned yet now you become clay in the hands of this viscount what is the matter with you you dont understand india began i know i dont fortune agreed but i do want to india you are my sister and i love you we are only two years apart and while we are very different it doesnt mean i dont care what happens to you because i do adrian leigh writes you in a manner i do not believe he should be writing you he behaves as if you were formally betrothed you havent read my letters have you india was outraged of course ive read them fortune said matterof factly you dont hide them very well india if mama didnt trust you she probably would have read them too and then you should not be going to england for the coronation this adrian leigh is very bold sister he kissed me india said the first time rené caught us and scolded me roundly after that we were more careful ohhh fortune i cannot imagine my life without him papa simply has to change his mind about adrian i cannot bear to think of marrying anyone but him but why fortune was entirely perplexed certainly adrian leigh wasnt any more handsome than their brothers his prose to india was just plain sillyher lips were two turtledovesand his spelling was utterly atrocious what in the name of all heaven was so special about him that india was behaving like a little ninny i cannot explain india said helplessly he is just too wonderful fortune and i love him you will understand one day fortune shook her head you had best be careful sister she warned her sibling if you dont choose a husband and you know it cannot be your swain papa will choose one for you parents still do you know it is their right mama and papa have been very lenient with us it must be adrian india replied stubbornly fortune shook her head again we shall have no peace in this house i am thinking until you are safely married india to adrian came the reply and fortune laughed i hope to never have a daughter like you she said the duke and duchess of glenkirk departed scotland on the seventh of january arriving at their house in london greenwood on the thirtieth of the month there was barely time for their clothing to be unpacked and pressed waiting for them upon their arrival was viscount twyford filled with news james leslie was not pleased to see the young man but listened politely the queen it seemed would not be at the coronation once again she had taken the counsel of her religious advisors ignoring the pleas of both her mother and her brother the king of france who wanted her crowned with her husband henrietta however had been convinced by bishop de mende that the protestant archbishop of canterbury could not possibly place the crown of england upon her roman catholic head only he a french catholic bishop could as that was completely unacceptable to the english the queen would not be crowned at all nor would she be in the abbey when her husband was of course the queens behavior was outrageous the duke of buckingham was openly irate at what he claimed was an insult to englands church and to charles himself the entire court was talking about it adrian leigh told them all the while throwing languishing glances at india who kept sneaking peeks at him from beneath her dark lashes adrian leighs mother had to his annoyance come up to london for the coronation when she learned from her son that india would also be there she began to advise him and while he was no longer fond of her as he had been when he was a boy he had to admit she was a wretchedly clever woman her stepfather will not even discuss the matter of marriage with me viscount twyford told his mother i attempted to bring it up today when i went to greenwood to welcome them back to london i asked if we might speak privately but he held up that big hand of his and said there was nothing i had to say to him that would possibly be of interest to him how the hell can i ask for the girls hand if he wont let me india says he disapproves of our family because of the lord jeffers murder and because of your poor reputation why the hell must you consort with men of such low station madame if you must take a lover could it at least be one of noble blood could you not at least be discreet blue blood runs cold marielena leigh replied dryly besides adrian my lovers are not your concern marielena leigh was still a beautiful woman with smooth white skin dark hair and large exciting dark eyes reaching out with very long slender fingers she plucked a sweetmeat from the plate before her and popped it into her mouth the pointed tip of her pink tongue catching a drizzle of honey from the corner of her sensuous mouth when the scandals you create endanger my marrying one of the wealthiest virgins in england madame they most certainly do concern me he told her angrily you cannot erase what has been adrian she said if her family objects to you you must take another tact my dearest i am surprised you have not considered it does the girl love you she believes she does he said thoughtfully but i am the only man ever to kiss her or try to court her she is inexperienced and has been very sheltered by her family they have allowed her to refuse the eligible suitors who have come courting her and why she believes they were only after her wealth i on the other hand have never mentioned her wealth although i am told by those who know that she is an heiress of considerable property a fat dowry could help us to rebuild oxton court his mother said slowly do you love her could you be happy with this girl she is perhaps a trifle too independent for my taste but her wealth makes it possible to overlook her behavior besides once we are married and i have control over india i will see she changes her ways the women in her family are very fecund and several children should take a great deal of the spunk out of her he laughed i will enjoy having her in my bed aye madame i could be content with lady india lindley and her wealth then you are going to have to reach out and take what you want my son his mother said she licked the sweetness from her fingers what do you mean he demanded her stepfather will not even speak to me except when forced to do so madame adrian if you do not take this girl while you have the chance to take her i can guarantee you that the duke of glenkirk will see you do not get another chance at her convince her to elope with you even if you are caught before you can marry her her reputation will be totally ruined no one else will want her and you will win by default the countess of oxton said to her son i dont want to get caught he replied i want to wed her and bed her before her family can intervene if we were stopped before i could accomplish those two things the duke is quite capable of dragging india back to scotland and marrying her off to some highlander who would know nothing of the scandal and finding his bride a virgin would be satisfied with the match i must take her someplace that they are unlikely to look for us at first but where take her to napoli to my brothers house his mother suggested your uncle giovanni will welcome you at villa di carlo you can marry the girl and bed her to your hearts content the leslies of glenkirk are unlikely to seek you there for how could they know of it when she has given you a son then bring her home to england her family will be forced to welcome you then adrian for the first time in many years adrian leigh embraced his beautiful mother you are so damnably clever madame he said you have always looked after my best interests it is perfect she shook him off gracefully you must convince the girl adrian and believe me it will not be easy she sat back in her chair and reaching for her goblet sipped the wine he had earlier poured them why not she loves me he declared with the enthusiasm of his youth picking up his own goblet he swallowed the cool red wine thirstily until the goblet was empty she loves her family too the countess of oxton replied wisely she will be torn between you both you will have to make her choose you over them my son or you have not a chance despite her feelings but how mother we must make certain that the duke and his family continue in their coldness toward you despite your charm and good manners the sweeter you appear and the chillier their reception particularly if it is in lady indias presence will only help but make the girl take your side do not at any time criticize her family my dearest defend them saying if you had a beautiful daughter you would want to protect her too from what you believed was an unsuitable match remind her what a fine old family the leighs are say things like we are not wealthy or powerful people like your family but we are honorable and noble that too will make her take your part you will appear to be a worthy and virtuous young man held unfairly responsible for the wicked behavior of your elder brother and your flighty mother neither of whom you approve of and would disown if it would not break your poor old fathers heart adrian leigh laughed genuinely amused by his mothers cunning you are absolutely diabolical he said again i say it is a perfect plan mother and i thank you he leaned from his own chair and kissed her cheek if she proves too reluctant adrian you must make love to her in order to convince her i do not mean you should deflower the girl but i assume from what you have told me that you have only traded kisses with her so far caress her breasts first through the fabric of her gown and then if you can slip your hand into her bodice and gently fondle her be certain not to frighten her however else you lose your advantage with her i should like that he said softly she has the most tempting little breasts i have ever seen the countess of oxton smiled at her son knowingly he was a great deal more like her than he was willing to admit his wife would not be unhappy with him as she had been with her sons father the cold bastard the king was crowned in westminster abbey on candlemas day february the queen watched the procession from a window in the gatehouse of whitehall palace the king wore a white satin suit but overall the coronation was an austere event as the royal treasury was almost bare only the generosity of several wealthy families prevailed upon by the duke of buckingham made it possible for there to be a celebratory feast afterward the duke and duchess of glenkirk had kept a sharp eye on india whose behavior was demure in the great abbey afterward when they entered the banquet hall at whitehall however india managed to give her parents the slip and find her way to adrian leigh who greeted her warmly helpless to stop her without causing a scene james leslie nonetheless saw where she went back at greenwood house that evening he paced the family hall angrily she hae deliberately disobeyed us jasmine and i for one hae had enough of her willfulness we will leave for scotland at the beginning of the week what good will that do his wife asked india will correspond with young leigh and we will be returning to england come summer there will be nae more letters by summer india will be either betrothed or better yet married james leslie replied firmly since india will nae choose a suitable match for herself we will choose one for her ohh jemmie his wife murmured i dont like to do that to india i want her to love the man she marries your father chose prince jamal your first husband for you you dinna know him until you married him and yet you were happy the duke reminded his wife your grandparents chose rowan lindley indias father as your second husband and you grew to love him didnt you so much so that you almost died when he was killed king james chose me as your third husband and we have nae been unhappy hae we i know you love me darling jasmine and i certainly love you india is behaving in a childish manner she hae deliberately fixated herself upon an unsuitable man and refuses to look elsewhere because she thinks if she continues in her stubbornness she will as she hae many times before get her own way but this time it is nae about a gown or a puppy this is indias life and i will nae hae her miserable for the rest of it because she chose the wrong man i owe that to her father have you any ideas for an appropriate match jasmine asked well i would hae you ask your aunt willow about eligible young englishmen and i know both angus drummond and ian maccrae hae unmarried sons they would be more than favorable to a match wi our daughter both the drummonds and the maccraes are solid families nae great titles but educated and nae fanatical where religion is concerned still your aunt may know of some suitable young noblemen and india being english by birth might prefer to live in england near her two brothers henry and charlie and your family i suppose it is the only way jasmine said reluctantly her husband might be taking a firm approach but he certainly wasnt being unreasonable she thought india of course would rage and howl but they had no other choice her motherinlaw had been right when she had suggested that india was ripe for bedding before the girl caused a scandal with the wrong man they were going to have to marry her off to someone more eligible by summer well hae a wedding the duke decided firmly then you and i will hae to consider what to do about fortune for she will be sixteen in july and should also be wed i had thought to take her to ireland jasmine said i had always intended giving her macguires ford and its lands i think she should therefore have an irish or angloirish husband jemmie excellent he agreed we will take fortune to ireland this summer henry will go to cadby charlie to queens malvern patrick will remain at glenkirk in my stead and the other two lads may either go down to england or remain at glenkirk then it is settled my love jasmine nodded it is all for the best she agreed it is past time we established the girls but i hate to lose them the time has gone so quickly just yesterday they were little lasses running barefoot through the vineyards at belle fleurs do you remember the first summer we brought them to glenkirk and they swam naked in the loch i remember how they splashed and giggled refusing to come out of the water even when their lips were blue with the icy icy cold her eyes grew moist where did my little girls go jemmie where did they go he put a comforting arm about her he had no answer to such a question in a dark corner of the family hall india had listened to her parents so cruelly deciding her fate now she sidled carefully from her hiding place and slipped into the hallway of the house bumping into her sister fortune as she exited youve been eavesdropping fortune accused her be quiet india hissed mama and papa will hear you i didnt mean to eavesdrop i was in the hall when they came in and they didnt see me so i hid in a dark place and listened you wont believe what i heard some of it concerns you come on she half dragged her younger sibling up the stairs to the bedchamber they shared closing the door behind her she announced dramatically we are to be married what fortune squeaked have they relented about your viscount and what do you mean by we she plunked herself down upon the bed speak up india they wont let me marry adrian and they intend to pick a husband for me either some son of one of papas uncouth friends or someone our old dragon of a greataunt willow thinks is suitable papa says im to be married by summer then henry is to go to his seat at cadby and charlie to queens malvern what about me fortune pressed you said we were to be married i dont know anyone i want to marry theyre taking you to ireland this summer mama says shes giving you macguires ford and its lands i suppose youre getting it because you were born there she hasnt been back to ireland since our father was murdered before you were born they are going to look for an irish or angloirish husband for you you will be married probably before summers end well little sister what do you think of that fortune was strangely silent for a long moment and then she said there are three thousand acres belonging to macguires ford its a goodly estate to have i wonder if the horses will be included as part of my dowry ill get a fine husband with all of that india was astounded by her sisters reaction she had fully expected fortune to rebel even as she was rebelling dont you care that you are going to be married to some stranger she demanded fortune turned her turquoise eyes on her sister a woman particularly women of our class and wealth must be married india i have absolutely no experience with men and so i think i shall rely upon our parents to pick my husband they will not force either one of us into a bad match i imagine ill be given a choice and can choose the man i prefer myself if you were not so pigheaded you would not be in the difficulty that you are in now mama and papa made no secret that adrian leigh was not for you they said it plainly but you will have your way or die trying wont you sister well this time you will not get your way and i think you had best accept that its past time we were both married i will marry the man i love india snapped dont be such a fool india fortune snapped back you will not tell mama and papa that i overheard them came indias reply of course not fortune said its months away then she grew thoughtful i wonder what he will be like i shall enjoy having my own home although i shall miss the family we will all be scattered now wont we fortune was a practical girl if a bit wild india was no longer listening to her sister however she somehow had to find adrian and tell him of these latest developments that threatened to part them he would know what to do leaving fortune she hurried back downstairs to the writing room penning a message to viscount twyford and then sealing it with wax she pressed her signet ring hard into the soft substance slipping from the room she let herself out into the garden and ran down the lawns to the riverside oi she called to a passing werryman who seeing her wave and hearing her call rowed over to the greenwood quai aye lady where does ye want to go india handed him the packet along with a coin take this to whitehall give it to the royal boatmaster and tell him it is to be delivered immediately to viscount twyford the earl of oxtons heir youre to wait for him do you understand you are to bring viscount twyford back here the werryman felt the weight of the coin in his hand he didnt have to look at it to know it was double probably triple in legal fare yes mlady he said pulling at his forelock respectfully then pushing cockle away from the quai he rowed away it never occurred to him to keep her coin and throw the missive in the rapids beneath london bridge for he was an honest man besides the gentry had a way of repaying dishonesty india watched him go relieved it was going to be all right she and adrian would figure out what to do together picking up her skirts she hurried back up to the house realizing as she ran that she was cold in her haste she had forgotten her cape but it didnt matter nothing mattered but her future with adrian leigh chapter greenwood house was silent at the midnight hour when india heard the rattle of pebbles at her window slipping from the bed she shared with fortune she hurried across the chilly floor and swinging the casement open peered out seeing adrian leigh standing in the moonlight she called softly to him i will come down then pulling the window shut she caught up her cape and headed toward the bedroom door fortune murmured softly and turned in the bed stopping her sister for a moment to make certain that her sibling was not awakening satisfied she slept india eased herself through the door and pulling her cloak about her ran quickly down the staircase through the hallway and into the library pushing open one of the large windows she summoned her swain to her adrian here she beckoned to the shadowy figure the viscount climbed through the open window drawing it shut behind him then pulling india into his arms he kissed her startled and breathless she gently extracted herself from his embrace laughing nervously adrian for shame i have not asked you here for the purpose of dalliance she was flushed and her heart was beating rather more quickly than before he was so bold she thought no sweeting i am disappointed he teased her then pray mlady why have you summoned me he took up her hand and kissed the fingers on it ohh adrian i do not know what to do she cried softly and did not protest when he pulled her back into his arms and began to stroke her dark hair what is it poppet he encouraged her tell me and i will endeavor to make it better he kissed the top of her head she was so trusting and sweet and rich he knew she was his for the taking we will be returning home next week papa says since i will not choose a suitable man to marry then he and mama must pick a match for me but i dont want to marry some stranger oh what are we to do adrian they are going to separate us forever india sobbed softly if they take me home to glenkirk i will never see you again oh i know it is bold of me to say it but i couldnt bear it if we were parted from one another i will die i know i will i cannot let you do that he said as softly thinking that his soontobe fatherinlaw had just provided him with the very opportunity he required to steal lady india lindley away from her overly protective family when his mother had suggested it he hadnt thought it would be this easy but adrian she gazed up into his face and he thought she was really quite beautiful what can we do your father has left us with no choice my darling he told her in a calm and most sensible voice we must run away and get married before they can take you back to scotland india now she looked up at him and found herself very torn he was so handsome with his long straight nose and his silky blond hair his sapphireblue eyes seemed to look at her with such love and devotion ohhh adrian i do not know it seems so impetuous a thing to do ah india do you not love me he asked her in a hurt tone oh yes adrian i do love you then she blushed furiously for she had never said such a thing to him before and i love you my darling he quickly reassured her knowing such a declaration from her lips required a similar devotion on his part but i love my family too she said worrying her lower lip with her top teeth in her concern you do not have to stop loving them my darling just because you love me he told her but is it really just of them to keep us apart when we love each other i know that my mother and my halfbrother have brought shame upon the leighs of oxton court but i am my fathers son first and foremost india we are an old and noble family is it fair of your father to hold me responsible for deverall and mamas bad behavior i think the duke of glenkirk a better man than that my love still he is a father protecting a beloved daughter and i do understand how he feels even if i think him wrong if we are married then you and i settle the entire matter by controlling our own destiny i know our actions will anger your parents at first but when they see how happy we are they will forgive us i know it but where could we go adrian that they would not follow india asked snuggling against him she felt so safe now we must leave the country he ventured waiting to see what indias reaction would be to that leave the country she was more than startled by his suggestion there is no other option india where can we hide in england my love your family is large and scattered all about the whole country and we certainly cannot go north can we he chuckled and kissed her on the tip of her nose we cannot go to france either she informed him joining in with his train of thought we have family there we could go to naples he suggested naples why naples adrian his hand was caressing her back now and it was really quite pleasant my uncle the conde di carlo lives in naples he said we could go to him and be married there then we could remain with my uncle until we had our first child if we returned home with our son your father could not annul our union sweeting my fathers mother lives in naples india said lady stewarthepburn papas sister is the marchesa di san ridolfi what if we ran into them adrian then papa would know where we were we will be wed privately my love and remain safely within the walls of my uncles estate have you ever met these ladies india my stepgrandmama last summer in france but not the marchesa she answered him a wave of doubt washed over her it seemed so rash an action to take running away and marrying perhaps you do not love me enough india to dare such a bold course he subtly taunted her seeing the indecision on her face ohh but i do she cried no i think not he replied sorrowfully goading her further but i do adrian i swear i do india insisted then say you will pledge yourself body and soul to me as my wife sweetheart he said his voice holding just a hint of pleading say you will marry me and be my wife and bear my children say it but before she might speak he was kissing her passionately his lips hot and hungry upon hers the hand that had been caressing her back was now sliding beneath her cloak moving to caress her bosom lightly indias head was spinning with delight her lips parted slightly beneath his and she drew her perfumed breath into her own mouth when his hand slipped into her nightgown bodice to cup a single breast she gasped with surprise no one had ever touched her breasts before the warmth of his palm was intoxicating and when his thumb and his forefinger gently pinched her thrusting nipple she almost swooned falling back against his arm with a soft moan of distinct pleasure if this was love it was wonderful lifting his head from her he begged say you will marry me my darling can you not sense how i long for you how much i love you my precious india say it say it or i will fling myself into the river this very night for i cannot live without you yes oh yes she breathed immediately he removed his hand dipping his head to kiss the swell of her bosom over her gown your virtue is a precious jewel to me my love he told her solemnly i must cease our loveplay lest i lose control of my passions and shame us both we have a lifetime before us in which we may pleasure each other but not until we have married oh adrian i do love you she told him wishing he were not quite so noble at this moment in time she had liked his caress and his kisses her entire body seemed more alive now than it had ever been but the wet stickiness between her legs in that secret place was confusing she didnt know what it was and she certainly couldnt ask mama now do you know exactly what day your family plans to depart for scotland he asked her in practical tones i must find a ship sailing for naples i suspect we do not have much time in three or four days time at the most india replied he has not given the order for our possessions to be packed up yet i will go to the docks in the morning and find us a vessel he told her there will be someone sailing for the mediterranean soon go to the omalleysmall trading company docks india advised i will not sail on any other ship but one of theirs if we trust ourselves to strangers we could end up murdered for our possessions and thrown overboard adrian sea travel can be dangerous but the omalleysmall ships belong to my family and we will be safe but will these people not recognize you india not if i board the ship in disguise adrian she told him feeling quite clever you shall be a son of the conde di carlo and i your elderly greataunt lady monypenny newly widowed and childless returning home to naples my girlhood home after many years in order to die you have been sent by your father my nephew to escort me this will allow us to purchase two cabins without arousing suspicion i shall keep to my cabin during the voyage so my disguise may not be penetrated by anyone else on board am i not cunning my sweet lord she grinned mischievously at him indeed he agreed a bit surprised by her resourcefulness perhaps indias mind was a little too skillful at deception he considered but then he remembered how rich she was and how beautiful and how well she had responded to his roving hands she was tamable all women were tamable under the right circumstances and he would not be a harsh master you must go now she told him come tomorrow night and use the same signal to call me our plans must be finalized by then giving india a quick kiss the viscount opened the casement window and stepped through it into the night until tomorrow my love he told her and then he was gone into the darkness india sighed as she latched the window shut he was so wonderful her adrian and soon they would be man and wife how sensitive he was not only did he sympathize with papa who was being totally unreasonable and difficult but his carefulness and concern for her person and her innocence showed her that he was a man of excellent character her parents were wrong about adrian he was the perfect man for her leaving the library she crept back up the staircase to her bedchamber and slipped easily into bed next to her sister who was now snoring she thought she would be too excited to sleep remembering the events of the last hour but india was soon slumbering as heavily as fortune in the morning she feigned a headache and kept to her bed until half the morning had gone by sipping smoky black tea that her mother had brought her to ease the alleged throbbing in her temples we thought we might spend the afternoon at court jasmine told her daughter do you feel well enough to come india sighed deeply i think not mama she said the pain is easing but a trip upon the cold and damp river will but bring it back we are not leaving london tomorrow are we i will get another chance to bid their majesties farewell wont i your father has decided we will depart on tuesday the duchess told her daughter it is only saturday you will have the opportunity to say goodbye to the king and queen india then i think i shall remain within the house today india replied i should be fine by the morrow would you mind if we went to whitehall jasmine asked henry and charlie have already made some important contacts and perhaps i shall find a lovely gentleman for you my daughter india smiled wanly there is no one for me but adrian mama oh my darling girl jasmine said you must put him from your mind he is entirely unsuitable and your father will not hear of it jemmie has tried so hard to raise you as rowan lindley would have india and i know rowan would agree with jemmie about your viscount put it aside my daughter for you will not be happy until you do india sighed i will try mama she murmured that is all i ask of you for now jasmine replied when the leslies had departed for whitehall taking fortune with them as well india arose and began to pack her own little trunks neither she nor fortune had been allowed to bring servants on this trip the house was quiet and practically servantless for the duke had not bothered to hire extra help on this visit and only the small permanent staff that lived at greenwood was in residence there were five of them the majordomo the housekeeper the laundress the cook and the stableman india now took an armful of laundry to the laundress we are leaving on tuesday she said i want to travel with clean undergarments dolly would you mind doing these today im sure mama and fortune will want their things done too and this way we will not overburden you by piling everything on you at once of course mlady and most kind of you the laundress answered india hurried to the library and opening the false panel where her parents hid their valuables when they were in london she put her hand into the dark cavity the chamois bag of coins her father always took when they traveled was quite plump the duke obviously had already been to the goldsmiths bank in preparation for their return trip india smiled to herself and withdrew her hand closing the panel she fully intended taking that bag with her when she left with adrian it would be a down payment on her dowry she would wager after he paid their fare he would have little left and be glad for her foresight her fathers gold would keep them quite comfortably for the next year she returned to her own bedchamber her family had not returned by the midnight hour when adrian leigh once again tossed pebbles at her window india flung open the casement and looking down said you must be careful my family have not yet returned from whitehall and will be coming by the river what news my darling lord i dare not come down i can see the river better from here and you must be gone before they return you were right my clever poppet he told her the royal charles the omalleysmall trading companys newest cargo and passenger vessel departs for the mediterranean on the morning tide monday and it will stop at naples i have booked us two cabins as you instructed and we must be aboard by five oclock in the morning at the latest who is its captain she asked thomas southwood he replied my cousin she said thoughtfully but as he has not seen me in many years i expect we will be safe especially as i shall be disguised as old lady monypenny come for me at four oclock in the morning i shall bring two small trunks and my jewelry so do not come in a small werry you have done admirably my darling india blew him a kiss go now before we are caught i love you adrian she drew the window shut her heart soaring just a few more days and they would make good their escape she climbed into bed and was already sleeping by the time her family returned home the next day was sunday and they attended religious services at whitehall palace the king preferred the more catholic anglican service despite the grumblings from the many puritans in his court go and have your own services then he ordered the more outspoken of them do none of you remember that i am pledged to be as tolerant as i may you do not like englands church and you do not like the queens faith go then and hold your own candleless plain services with no outward show of faith but your droning voices coming from the kings chapel they saw adrian leigh exiting the queens chapel and there is another reason you cannot wed with that fellow james leslie said his hand reaching out to prevent india from joining her chosen swain he is a practicing member of romes church and that is a dangerous thing to be here right now in england as we all know the leslies of glenkirk were once roman catholics and so was mama india replied pertly did not old queen elizabeth once say there is but one lord jesus christ the rest is all trifles everyone was once a member of the roman church the duke said patiently but times have changed now while i do not believe god gives a damn how we worship him as long as we do and are respectful we must be prudent india this family and your mothers family have survived by being careful we do not involve ourselves in politics or religious bickering we keep our own counsel and pay the taxes levied on us without complaint nonetheless it would be unwise even if viscount twyford were a suitable match for you which he is not for you to wed a practicing member of the roman church at this time it is foolish to draw attention to yourself for if you do you will find that many people are easily envious of a wealthy and beautiful young girl such as yourself such people will strive to harm you india pulled angrily away from her father this is my last day at court she said let me do what i want and associate with whom i choose papa i am seventeen and i am not some wee lass who needs to be told what to do if you will take me from the man i love and force me to wed someone of your choice at least adrian and i have had this one last day together then with an angry swish of her garnetcolored velvet skirts she was gone let her go jasmine advised her husband she is a sensible girl and will make peace with the situation if you do not irritate her any further jemmie she must sort out her feelings by herself why is it i want to turn her over my knee and whack her bottom with my slipper the duke asked his wife jasmine laughed softly because she has gone and grown up on you jemmie she teased him no father likes to see it happen to his daughter not only that she prefers another man over you these days what a betrayal to your heart she pulled him down and kissed his cheek but i will always love you my lord duke and i will not leave you for anyone but death and then reluctantly he chuckled oh my darling jasmine he told her it is good that you are wiser than i come and let us enjoy the day we will bid our friends and family farewell and be gone from this place there is too much strife here i regret with buckingham deciding the queen is his enemy and the french king sending a diplomat to sort out what the hell is going on that our king and his pretty little queen cannot get along and the puritans are gaining more influence and power every day they will be trouble mark my words there is nothing worse than someone who truly believes his way is the only way and everyone must conform or be punished or perish i shall be glad to be back in my highlands at glenkirk i do not think i will come to london again by the way have you spoken to your aunt willow yet about some young men for india i want her married as soon as possible let her be her husbands problem we have one more daughter and five lads to settle before our job is done he concluded with a chortle do you honestly believe that marrying them off absolves us of our parental responsibilities jasmine asked i do not care how old they get they will always be our children and we will always care what happens to them jemmie leslie but theyll be out of the house he reminded her cheerfully they spent their day making their farewells and james leslie was pleased to see india awaiting them at the riverside quai without viscount twyford in tow when they were ready to depart it was just dusk when they reached greenwood house once inside india asked her brothers to bring down her trunks and place them in the front hall but dearest her mother said we are not going until tuesday morning there is no hurry papa is always saying that i am tardy and that i keep everyone waiting and make them late being behind with my packing i decided this time to be ready before all of you i even had the laundress do my laundry yesterday so she would not be overburdened i want to see my trunks here in the hall mama then she giggled charmingly it may be the only time in my life i am ahead of papas schedule well go and get your sisters trunks james leslie commanded his sons if she is ready now she deserves the credit for it and we shall all look admiringly upon her trunks here tomorrow as we pack our own clothing for our departure india smiled sweetly at her father as her brothers brought down her luggage i was very rude to you today papa i apologize for my discourteousness but i do not ask your pardon for loving adrian even if you wont let us marry i think you are being very unfair you will not even give him a chance but hold him responsible for the bad behavior of his mother and halfbrother it is wrong papa and i am ashamed that you would do such a thing you have always been a fairminded man until now she curtsied the duke gritted his teeth and held his temper you know that i love you india you must accept that i know what is best for you i only want you happy and damn it i will see that you are in spite of yourself he caught himself first love is always the most poignant but it is not necessarily the most lasting i want a lasting love for you you have always trusted me india why will you not trust me in this matter you are my daughter and i dont want you hurt if you do not let me marry adrian i will be unhappy the rest of my life india announced dramatically since you two cannot agree on this point jasmine said interjecting herself between her eldest child and her husband i think it best we do not discuss it again tonight india you have done a fine job of getting ready and since you are you will help your sister and me to pack our own possessions tomorrow now go to your room my child and rest you know how difficult it is to rest along the road and we have a very very long journey ahead of us jasmine concluded kissing her parents india moved serenely up the staircase and entered her bedchamber she had given her father one last chance and she had hoped against hope that he would change his mind and then they wouldnt have to run away she sighed adrian had been right all along her father was not giving them any other choice well this time tomorrow they would be well at sea and on their way to italy and all her parents would know from the note she was leaving them was that she and adrian had gone off to marry and they would not come back until they had why do you bait papa that way fortune demanded entering the room he is not being unreasonable your viscount really isnt right for you india but you are always so insistent upon having your own way papa has never said he disapproved of adrian only his family india retorted a man is his family fortune replied you packed early so you could sneak off tomorrow and spend time with your swain didnt you mama saw right through you and now youll have to help us she teased her elder sister i am very fussy about how my things are packed it will take you all day between us i fear if you are not careful india threatened her sister ill take all your clothing and throw it out the window ha ha fortune taunted and picking up a pillow whacked india with it within moments the two were engaged in a pillow fight that ended with them both collapsing into gales of laughter upon the bed i shall miss you little sister india said miss me fortune looked puzzled when father marries me off to his dark stranger in a few months time india quickly said gods boots do you realize our childhood is just about at an end by this time next year we could be both great with child she stuffed one of the pillows beneath her skirts and paraded about the room ohhh i hope its a son for my dear lord fortune giggled why do men always want sons she wondered aloud well our real father didnt get one first india said he got me before he got henry and then he got you after he died do you remember our real father at all fortune ask wistfully india sighed deeply i have one tiny memory of this great big golden laughing man lifting me up in front of him on his horse and riding me about but that is all it really isnt much is it its more than henry and i have fortune answered her our real father wasnt even alive when i was born but i do remember prince henry a little bit he was handsome and could never take his eyes off mama just imagine if he had been allowed to marry mama then our charlie would be king now instead of his uncle charles mama was considered unsuitable india said she had been older than fortune and remembered more just like adrian is unsuitable for you fortune responded i am going to bed india announced ending the discussion the two sisters washed themselves put on their nightgowns and climbed into bed across the room the fire burned brightly warming the bedchamber india blew out the candle and settled down if she did not wake up in time adrian had promised to throw pebbles at the windowpane again as her trunks were in the hall by the front door it would only take her a little while to dress and go down to join him she wasnt certain she would sleep but she did fortune snuggled close next to her making her familiar little sleep noises india awoke suddenly in the darkness the clock in the hallway struck three times she lay quietly for several minutes and then arose carefully wincing as her feet touched the icy floor boards padding across the chamber india added some coal to the fire and it soon after sprang to life again the clock chimed the quarter hour she dressed slowly in a black velvet gown a starched white ruff about her neck on her feet she wore dark walking boots in the attics she had found a mourning veil she would wear with her dark gloves and long dark cape while she dressed the clock in the hall chimed the half hour and now was chiming threequarters of the hour india stuffed her jewelry pouch in her beaver muff and slipped quietly from the room she tiptoed down the staircase moved as silently as she could through the hallway and entered the library going to the panel behind which her father hid the valuables she opened it and thrust her hand inside immediately her fingers made contact with the chamois bag pulling it out she opened it making certain that it was filled with gold coins satisfied she pushed it into her muff with her jewelry and closed the panel now she hurried out into the main hallway of the house again and going to the front door she slowly and not without some difficulty drew the bolts securing the entrance aside she did not have to wait long there came a gentle scratching at the door and india opened it immediately allowing viscount twyford into the house with another man he immediately picked up one of indias trunks and headed back down to the river take the other trunk india instructed adrian i want to rebolt the door so no one notices the door unlocked in the morning and raises an alarm too soon ill go out the library window my love and join you in but a moment the viscount took up the second trunk and india shut the door behind him sliding the bolts back into place she then retraced her steps to the library and exited through one of the casement windows pushing it shut behind her it was unlikely anyone would notice the window was unlatched if it gave the appearance of being closed tightly then without a backward glance she hurried down the lawns to the quai where her transport awaited her as he helped her into the boat she had only a momentary pang but then her heart soared they were free lift your veil madame so i may be certain its you and not your papa hiding beneath the gauze he teased her india raised the silk fabric tis i my love she said the werry moved quickly down the river into the pool and was rowed directly to a dock at the omalleysmall trading company adrian leigh climbed from the small vessel and helped india onto the dock leading her to a sturdy gangway before a great sailing ship he helped her to board india moved slowly and heavily in her guise as an elderly widow beneath her veiling she might have been anyone ahh signore di carlo a cultured voice spoke you are right on time sir and this will be your aunt my condolences madame on your great loss monypenny was old he lived a good life came a gravelly voice from beneath the veils you are one of lynmouths lads arent you aye madame i am his fourth son captain thomas southwood replied geoff is the heir john is a churchman and charles is married to an heiress i however prefer the sea as a wife shes less troublesome and asks little of a man heh heh came the snicker from beneath the veils then you are like your grandmother who i am told was a pirate a base canard madame captain southwood was smiling now my steward will show you to your cabin he bowed what was all that chatter adrian leigh asked nervously when they were alone again you will give us away before we have even escaped i am supposed to be a garrulous old lady and as such it is highly possible that i would know his family it has put him off guard adrian he doesnt imagine for one moment that im not the old lady i am supposed to be the royal charles moved out into the pool precisely on schedule and made its way majestically down the thames with the outgoing tide toward the sea india remained in her cabin once she entered it she stood by the small porthole that looked out on the deck and beyond it the river they passed by greenwich and the shipyards at tilbury the midfebruary day was gray although not stormy india had thought when they had left greenwood that she detected the faintest hint of spring in the air how long would it be before she enjoyed another english spring and summer again she felt the deep roll of their vessel as the thames entered the channel realizing with singular clarity of mind that her course was set she could not go back and for the first time in her life india lindley wondered if she had really done the right thing shivering she drew her furlined cloak about her tightly the royal charles was a serious cargo vessel it had left england with a load of wool and cornish tinware in its deep holes the ship made its way down the english channel past lands end and plotted a course across the bay of biscay at bordeaux it took on a consignment of red wine it then sailed around cape finsterre putting in at lisbon where it took on a cargo of hides hugging the coast for a time it moved around cape st vincent and into the gulf of cadiz stopping at the city of cadiz to take on baskets of oranges and lemons they sailed through the straits of gibraltar docking at malaga to onload barrels of sherry it was here that the other passengers two spanish wine merchants debarked they would next put into marseilles to offload the wine and take on salted fish and then sail on to naples adrian informed india having obtained his information from the captain india had not come out of her cabin since they had left london except for short walks on the deck at night well muffled in her veils she was in deepest mourning adrian had explained to captain southwood and preferred her solitude she found the sea soothing tom southwood laughed we are fortunate to have had fine weather so far signore di carlo or lady monypenny would find the sea not quite so salubrious i am sorry however that she will not take her meals with us i found her a rather amusing old lady outspoken and much like my late grandmother lady de marisco alas adrian replied while my aunts spirit is soothed by the sea her stomach is a bit more delicate i fear the weather had grown quite warm they were in the narrowest part of the mediterranean adrian told india she was skittish and would not allow him much time in her cabin or her company these days he worried that she was regretting her actions but india said nothing to that effect and so he believed her just nervous of travel they would return overland when the day came he decided but for a quick cruise across the channel they were several days out of marseilles when the passenger steward sought out tom southwood captain may i speak with ye a moment the steward stood in the door of the main cabin come in knox what is the problem well captain tis the lady the one who is getting off in naples aint she supposed to be an old lady sir aye now what was this all about tom southwood thought well captain she aint an old lady shes a young lady knox looked very uncomfortable i was going by her cabin this afternoon and i seen her sitting on her bunk brushing her hair i stopped because i was so surprised that an old lady would have such fine tresses then she turned her head slightly she didnt see me sir and it werent an old ladys face it was a beautiful young girl captain damnation tom southwood swore irritated what the hell was going on and he would certainly have to find out before they put into another port a young lady a signore di carlo who spoke accentless english he had said he was schooled in england an elopement it was the only and the logical answer signore di carlo was running off with someones daughter but whose and what was captain tom southwood to do about it come with me he said to knox and leaving his cabin made for the passenger deck knocking on the faux lady monypennys cabin door he entered without waiting for her permission to do so a young girl jumped up from the bunk where she had been reading and gave a startled gasp jesus christ tom southwood swore again india lindley im sorry captain but you have mistaken me for someone else india said in her plumiest tones india you are somewhat grown since the last time i saw you tom southwood said grimly but you have your mothers look about you and that fetching little mole she sports between your nostril and your upper lip and you are wearing the lindley signet ring your mother gave you now what is this all about and why are you masquerading as an old lady although i believe i know the answer to my own question then you need nothing from me tom india said angrily is he your italian tutor this signore di carlo the captain demanded of her youre eloping arent you and you chose my ship to do it on i had heard you had grown into a little hellion but i never thought you would cause a scandal like this if anyone finds out what you have done you will be ruined no decent man will have you but adrian is a decent man india cried out defending her love he isnt my italian tutor cousin tom he is viscount twyford the earl of oxtons heir we were eloping to his uncles house in naples to be married because papa would not be reasonable i love him and he loves me i chose your ship because i knew we would be safe and i came aboard in disguise for obvious reasons knox move lady lindleys things to my cabin and see that her gentleman is confined to his quarters for the duration of the trip captain southwood said tom you cannot be so cruel india sobbed cousin he told her sternly if we are fortunate there will be one of our companys vessels in marseilles going west to england if there is i intend putting you on it and seeing that you are returned home to your parents if there is not you will remain aboard my ship and return home with me as for your swain he has paid his passage to naples and he shall disembark there but without you noooo she wailed no grasping her lightly by the arm tom southwood literally dragged his young cousin from her cabin to his as they passed the cabin housing adrian leigh they could hear him pounding on the door in furious frustration shoving india into the day room of the great stern quarters that were his tom southwood said i will speak with your viscount and explain to him that things have changed india you are going home young lady i hate you thomas southwood india shouted and she flung a wine carafe at him i hate you he ducked and beating a hasty retreat exited his cabin locking the door behind him now he returned to the passenger deck and let himself into viscount twyfords cabin the young man leapt up from the bunk upon which he had been sitting well my lord you are found out captain southwood said grimly the game is up and you will be put off in naples my cousin india however will be sent home you will be confined to your cabin until we reach your destination you have no right adrian began pompously only to be cut off aye my lord i have every right as captain of the royal charles i am the master of this small seagoing domain upon which you currently reside you do not have the duke of glenkirks permission to marry his daughter you have cajoled and lured an innocent young girl away from the safety of her family you are a cad my lord now i will leave you to consider the seriousness of what you have done i think it will be a long time before you dare to show your face in england we are a large family my lord and we protect our own i pray to god this has remained a private matter and that indias reputation is yet intact do you understand me may i at least say farewell to india viscount twyford asked you have said all to my cousin that you should and probably a great deal more captain southwood replied and do not bother trying to speak with india through the cabin walls i have moved her to my quarters she too will be confined even as you are until she leaves this vessel now i will bid you good day sir thomas southwood then found his first mate mr bolton and explained to him what had happened tis a right bad coil sir mr bolton said shaking his head theres advantages to being a bachelor im thinking pray the lord the lass hasnt ruined herself with a scandal india was so angry with her cousin that she refused to eat that evening i shall starve myself to death she told him dramatically you shall return to england with my withered body in a coffin and then papa shall kill you thomas southwood swallowed back his laughter he had a younger sister laura who at indias age had also been given to similar histrionics suit yourself he said mildly but this fish is really quite delicious it was freshcaught by knox earlier today and the artichokes came aboard at cadiz would you like a fresh orange they are very sweet go to hell india spat angrily her hand inching toward a pewter goblet a dangerous look in her eye he was quickly on his feet and before she might throw anything at him he dragged her up from her chair and across the cabin you may sleep in my bed india and i shall take knoxs trundle out here he pushed her into his smaller sleeping cabin locking the door behind her there is water for bathing and drinking my dear he called to her and then returned to the table to finish his meal while she shrieked at him from her prison in the morning it was knox who opened the door to let her out captain says you may have the run of his quarters during the day mlady the steward said pleasantly can i get you anything to eat some fruit perhaps no thank you india said politely where is my cousin captain dont sleep more than four five hours mlady he be up on deck and has been since before dawn knox said well if i cant be of any service to you ill go tend to the young gentleman knox wait will you take a message to viscount twyford for me india pleaded i will make it worth your while the steward shook his head despairingly edging toward the door for he knew of indias penchant for throwing things im sorry mlady but you know i cannot then he was out the door before she could argue with him or pitch a missile at him india heard the sound of the key turning in the lock once again and almost snarled in angry despair she had not come this far to be denied setting herself in the window seat of the cabins great window she looked out no escape here the window looked onto the sea itself and peering down through the glass she could see there was no ledge the little sleeping cabin had no access to the deck only the door in this cabin itself had entree to the main deck but she would find a way she would and she was certain that her beloved adrian was also seeking a means of escape perhaps when they got to marseilles and her interfering cousin attempted to transfer her to another ship she could escape them and while they were looking for her she would sneak back on board and help adrian then they would travel on overland to naples she wasnt going to be stopped now sail ho she heard the call out on the deck looking out the great window india could see another vessel in the distance put on more sail came the command india could hear the creaking of winches as additional canvas was raised but the ship didnt seem to be gaining any speed she looked back out the window again the other ship was gaining on them rather quickly it was a narrow sleek vessel with scarletandgoldstriped sails she turned as the cabin door opened and her cousin entered a worried look upon his handsome face be quiet and listen he told her in a few minutes we are going to be boarded by pirates from one of the barbary states india paled and gasped cant we escape them she asked under ordinary circumstances yes but the bloody wind is dying on us and without the wind we cant outrun them now hear me very carefully india for what i am going to say may save your life my grandmother was once in a similar situation if you are asked to convert to islam agree and save your life dont be a little fool and refuse we need no martyrs in this family agreeing means you will be given or sold to a highly placed man and not thrown into the common slave bagnio where you would be raped and forced into whoredom but cant we be ransomed she asked him horrified neither of us is important enough cousin he told her one day i may be able to get a message home and then perhaps he stopped and looked at her you may not be able to go back then ohhh tom india cried not to see mama or papa ever again this family has a history of troublesome and adventuresome women who usually end up surviving quite nicely india listen learn and for gods sake remember that from the moment of your capture you are no longer the duke of glenkirks daughter but nothing more than a beautiful slave you will be at the mercy of your master whoever he will be keep your temper in check cousin and a civil tongue in your head or you could find that tongue yanked out the barbary pirates are fierce men i would rather be dead than submit india cried dramatically tom southwood grasped his young cousin by the arms and shook her hard dont be an idiot india he said and then releasing her he was gone out the door again to her despair she heard the key turning in the lock did he never forget the corsair ship drew skillfully alongside the royal charles she could now see the reason for its speed while the ship had sails it was also propelled by banks of oars which had given it a great advantage over the larger merchant vessel caught in a dying wind india wished she could be out on the deck what was her cousin doing was he going to fight the crew stand ready to defend the ship sir mr bolton said tom southwood shook his head resistance would be futile he told his first mate who had already known it look at their guns besides i want the ship intact eventually were going to steal it back francis bolton he chuckled youve told the crew what i said aye sir but two of them is irish papists and half a dozen are hardnosed puritans the sailmaker is a jew and the cook says he dont believe in anything they wont convert the first mate replied well ive warned them and hopefully enough of the lads will so we can sail this ship home one day the young captain replied heads up bolton here they come he stood straight his green eyes sweeping over the corsairs vessel it was the largest of the galley class with twenty four five six eight benches of oars each bench would hold four or five men this particular ship had an enclosure over the stern which meant it carried janissaries the rest of the deck was open to the sky there was a large fixed cannon located on a low deck area and several swivel guns sat amidships then a large tall man was standing before him he spoke accentless french i am aruj agha a captain in the royal ottoman janissary corps based in el sinut and sailing under the command of its dey who are you sir captain thomas southwood out of london commanding the royal charles under the aegis of the omalleysmall trading company we are usually allowed unmolested in these waters aruj agha why have you stopped us did you not see the pendant we fly it means nothing to me sir came the polite reply whatever meaning it might have had once it obviously no longer has that meaning you and your ship are fair game and now belong to the dey of el sinut what cargo do you carry wool cornish tinware hides fruit and barrels of sherry was the response i also have two passengers both of whom can be ransomed one is the son of the earl of oxton and the other who happens to be my own cousin is the daughter of the duke of glenkirk her younger brother is king charless bastard nephew her father will pay a fortune to regain her custody i was taking her to visit her grandmother in naples if you are familiar with our world captain southwood then you know the rules on captives i hope for your cousins sake that she is an ugly little girl thomas southwood grimaced and aruj agha laughed no well then you had best let me see her he said i have locked her in the main cabin as i feared for her safety sir please follow me very wise aruj agha agreed well be taking your ship in tow and so you your passengers and a few of your crew may remain until we reach our destination i shall put my own men aboard to sail this vessel we are three days out of el sinut and the rest of my crew theyll come aboard my galley to be put in chains of course the dey will decide their fate once we arrive aruj agha said tom southwood was not surprised it was to be expected the dey would give the men a chance to convert to islam and those who did would sail aboard his ships those who did not would be sold go to the deys ships as galley slaves or go to the mines it was a well known and common practice reaching the main cabin he unlocked the door calling to india as he did cousin it is i she stood in the center of the cabin a sword in her hand you gave up without a fight she accused him we are a merchant ship india the corsair has guns he explained where the hell did you get that sword put it down now i cannot i must uphold the familys honor tom which you have so easily besmirched i found the sword beneath your bunk i will not give up without a fight india declared aruj agha looked admiringly at india the girl was a dazzling beauty she wore a dark claretcolored velvet skirt and a mans full shirt a large black leather belt surrounded her tiny waist her long dark curls were loose and her eyes flashed fire she was utterly magnificent en garde infidèle india taunted waving her weapon at him jesu tom southwood swore helplessly how could he have forgotten the weapon beneath his bed aruj agha however burst out laughing come my beauty he cajoled her with a friendly grin your cousin did the right thing it would have pained me to have to blow this lovely ship to pieces and kill all aboard you will not be harmed indeed i foresee a wonderful life ahead of you as the favorite in your masters harem give me the sword he held out his hand india slashed wildly at it fortunately the agha pulled his hand back swiftly receiving only a glancing blow that nonetheless opened a small ribbon of blood across his fingertips then india leapt forward flaying at aruj agha wildly the janissary captain was no longer in a mood to coax the girl he met her attack yanking the weapon from her hand and shoving her rudely to the floor where he held her down with his booted foot tom southwood never moved a muscle he knew that the agha would not seriously harm india she had too much value as a captive but if she didnt learn the place she held in this strange new world she was going to get herself killed tom are you going to let him do this to me india shrieked help me she squirmed beneath her captors boot i warned you india he told her in their own tongue now shut up before he has you whipped and dont say he wouldnt because he would that is how recalcitrant slaves are dealt with here i hope by now you realize the danger you are in he turned to the jannissary speaking french once more i have told her to behave herself aruj agha but she has always been very spoiled i cannot guarantee she will listen ive handled wild mares before captain i am ashamed to have been taken off guard by a mere unskilled girl she is a virgin of course they are always more skittish in an unfamiliar situation he looked down at india are you prepared to be a bit more docile my beauty he lifted his foot from the small of her back and pulled her up go to the devil india spat at him ill kill you given half the chance ill be no mans slave damn you aruj agha chuckled a spirited filly is always the finest he announced is she always this sweetnatured captain im afraid so tom southwood replied where is adrian india demanded of her cousin if they have harmed him they will pay dearly shut up india he cautioned her you will only make it worse for your friend he may be ransomed if this dey is generous of heart and greedy of spirit now just do as you are told cousin if he can be ransomed why cant i she insisted because you are a beautiful virgin and more valuable as a concubine these people cannot imagine any father paying what you would otherwise fetch on the block when having been captured by pirates you will be considered spoiled by our own people now india just be quiet and do as you are told with aruj aghas permission i will come and see you later he concluded the last sentence in french so the janissary captain could understand him of course aruj agha replied we want the girl content fear spoils a womans beauty the two men exited the cabin locking india in once again outside the door she could hear the orderly sounds of activity as the majority of the royal charles seamen were transferred onto the pirate galley where they would be shackled the voices outside her door were now foreign and indistinguishable but for an occasional english voice she was frantic for adrians safety and tom had told her nothing her head was throbbing and she had bruised her hip when aruj agha had thrown her to the floor india suddenly felt like crying she heard the sound of the key and the door opened again to admit knox the steward captain wanted me to tell ye what is happening mlady and bring you something to eat ye aint touched a morsel since last night and that aint good youve got to keep up yer strength where is adrian india asked the steward desperately and a tear rolled down her cheek now dont you go fretting mlady about the young gentleman knox told her feeling a little sorry for the girl now hes locked in his cabin same as you captain says he might get ransomed all the rest of the crew but for the captain me mr bolton the first mate mr james the second mate and will the cook has been sent over to the galley we got a bunch of them heathen crewmen aboard us now he set down the tray he was carrying and peeled the napkin back india looked wanly at his offering and sighed i dont think i can eat a morsel she said if ye eats every bit of this meal up mlady ill carry a message to yer young gentleman he bribed her cook killed and roasted the last of the chickens today and made some fresh bread theres an artichoke some grapes and ive sectioned an orange for ye now you eat it up when i takes the gentleman his tray ill take yer message to him as well all right india sniffled but began to pick at the food the steward had brought her she took a nibble and then another and discovered to her surprise that she was actually hungry despite her low spirits she quickly stripped the meat from the chicken wing chewing it vigorously and swallowing it down is there any cheese she asked the steward beneath the bread mlady he answered her masking a smile the poor lass had not eaten in a day of course she was hungry she had best eat now for god only knew what kind of heathen food they would be offered when they reached port im getting too old for this kind of adventure knox thought to himself if i ever get back to england ill find myself a nice widow with a bit put aside and settle us in a cottage down in devon with a view of the sea from the windows which will be more than enough for me if i gets back when india had finished all the food on the tray knox picked it up to go asking what shall i tell the young gentleman mlady say i love him india began and that im praying for our deliverance tell him i wouldnt consider it amiss if he would pray for all aboard the royal charles too and he should find a way for us to escape india concluded yes mlady knox replied thinking he would certainly leave off the last part of her message to adrian leigh they didnt need the young milord trying to be heroic and getting himself killed not that knox thought the young man heroic he was rather more of an opportunist taking his chances when they appeared favorable still a little caution never hurt alone again india sat in the window seat once more viewing the empty sea the sun was beginning to set in the west almost directly in front of her above the sky was a clear sharp blue streaked with wispy pink clouds the western horizon was flame and purple and gold with just the faintest edging of pale green as the sky darkened a single bright blue crystal star appeared in the early night sky india sighed it was so utterly beautiful she wondered if adrian was watching the sunset too and did he think of her as she thought of him the sound of the door being opened caused her to turn her head from the window she expected to see her cousin but it was aruj agha instead india stiffened do not be concerned my beauty he said in a reassuring voice you will not be harmed in my care let me light a lamp it is dark in here he drew the oil lamp down and lit it with a small wick from the lamp he carried remain in your place my beauty and let us talk do you understand what has happened this day you and your bandits have pirated our ship india said sharply he chuckled amused by her continued spirit it is my right to capture your vessel girl he told her these waters are under the control of that most gracious servant of allahmay he be blessed forevermurad the fourth of that name he is but a young lad but we hope he will one day be a great sultan as an infidel ship you are fair game my beauty who are you india asked curious are you a turk i am a bosnian my beauty it is part of the ottoman empire but in europe i was conscripted into the corps of janissaries when i was eight years old it was a great honor for my family my uncle had been a janissary i was educated by the corps and nurtured by the corps i worked my way up through the corps until i attained the rank of aghacaptain you would call it in your tongue he told her what will happen to me india asked my cousin says i will be a slave now i am not a slave i am the daughter of the duke of glenkirk two of my brothers are dukes and one a marquis i am an heiress of great wealth and related by blood to englands king aruj aghas brown eyes twinkled and he stroked his russet beard thoughtfully tis a most impressive pedigree my beauty but it does not change the facts your cousin told you the truth india jumped down from the window seat and stamped her foot my family will pay you a fabulous ransom for my safe return i could pay you the ransom myself dont you understand arug agha i am rich why i own two trading ships the star of india and the prince of kashmir they are on the east indies run bringing spices silks and jewels to england each year all that in addition to a great inheritance left me i have listened to you carefully my beauty now you must listen to me i do not have the right to make any decision regarding your fate you this ship and everything on it men and cargo alike now belong to the dey of el sinut who rules in the sultans name here it is he who will make the decision concerning your fate it is my job to bring you all safely into the harbor of el sinut and with allahs help guidance and blessing i will he arose now i will bid you good night you need have no fears my beauty you are quite safe my cousin she asked i will allow him to come and see you in the morning the agha told her then with a bow he departed the cabin locking it behind him india paced the room this was impossible and none of it would have happened if you had heeded your parents a little voice in her head said gods nightshirt she swore but the little voice was right and she knew it if she had listened to her family instead of allowing her foolish heart to rule her she would be safe at home in scotland and not the captive of barbary pirates her family wouldnt force her to marry someone she didnt really love they could try but in the end she would have gotten her way if she had just been a bit more patient india decided and as much as she loved adrian he had been wrong to cajole her into the elopement just look what had happened to them and he would more than likely be ransomed but everyone seemed to be very sure that she wouldnt be there was a stigma attached to a girl finding herself in this position still her greatgrandmother and her grandmother as well as her aunt valentina had found themselves in similar situations and come home to lead respectable lives but that had been years ago times were different then and people certainly more reasonable and openminded now if it were known that lady india lindley had been captured by barbary pirates it would cause a scandal of great proportions and no decent man would offer for her and if adrian was sent home ahead of her and she later returned why even he wouldnt wed her gods boots india muttered what a headstrong damned little fool she had been what in the name of heaven was she going to do how could she save herself could she convince this dey to ransom her along with adrian it seemed her only option the only other course open to her was to kill herself and india knew she didnt have the courage to do that besides if the truth were known she didnt want to die anyway but what if this dey fellow decided to keep her india smiled grimly she would be the most difficult the most impossible the most awful creature he had ever known and he would certainly send her home having concluded that a ransom was a better bargain than an uncooperative and raging girl she was not about to be any mans slave it was a totally unacceptable concept she would not tolerate it she curled back into the window seat the sky was dark now and there was a thin new crescent of a moon reflecting itself delicately into the black sea around it the stars were bright was her sister looking at that same moon fortune who was so accepting of their parents decision to find her a husband in ireland so content to settle herself at macguires ford and be mistress of her own lands how much easier it would have been for all of us india thought if i had been more like fortune yet her sister could certainly not be called docile fortune was anything but meek and mild but she was of a far more practical bent of mind than her elder sibling how long will it be before i see my sister and brothers again and our parents too india wondered damn it i miss them she half whispered to the empty cabin i have been so foolish i will certainly never be this foolish again she sighed and continued looking out upon the sea watching the wake of their vessel just faintly silvered as the royal charles sailed inexorably on toward el sinut part ii el sinut would you like to come on deck as we enter the harbor aruj agha asked india on the morning they arrived in el sinut do you have a long enveloping cape my beauty i have two the black wool with the fur lining i wore aboard in england and a turquoise blue silk with a cream brocade lining india told him that one has a hood and is more suitable to our climate aruj agha said but i will need something to veil your features from public view as well india rifled through her trunks finally pulling forth a large laceedged handkerchief which she held up will this do and why does my face have to be hidden are you afraid someone will recognize me and you will be forced to let me go no he said with a smile she was a persistent wench he thought in our society respectable women cover both their hair and their faces from public scrutiny such delicate discretion allows a woman a greater measure of freedom without being accosted by bold men in the streets women who allow themselves to be seen are obviously women of low repute attempting to sell their favors he helped her on with her long cape if you wish to appear in public in el sinut or anywhere else in the sultans domain you must be cloaked and veiled he drew her hood up over her head we must affix the veil do you have any small pins in my jewel case india said will my jewelry be taken from me aruj agha it was all given to me by members of my family i will intercede with the dey for you he said but it is his decision my beauty you must understand that he carefully pinned the white cloth across indias beautiful face concealing everything but her golden eyes and dark brows standing back he appeared satisfied now we are ready he told her with a broad smile i do believe that i could have a career as a ladys tiring woman my beauty india giggled in spite of herself and allowed him to lead her out onto the deck the air was hot and dry ahead of them the great galley its striped sails blowing gently in the slight breeze rowed into an enclosed harbor drawing its prey behind it the harbor entrance was flanked by two squaretowered lighthouses they mark the ingress aruj agha told her and are also responsible for the great chain that for now rests beneath the surface of the waters but in emergencies can be raised to block entry to the port they have a similar device across the golden horn in istanbul tom southwood remarked looking about the anchorage carefully there were at least three more big galleys as well as galleots brigantines frigates and small fellucas which could accommodate only three to five benches with one oarsman each as opposed to the galley that had taken them in tow and had twentyeight benches with two oars for each bench and four to five men on each oar this was a busy and formidable anchorage it would not he now realized be as simple as he had thought to take back the royal charles and escape but as an honorable man he had no choice but to eventually try india wasnt in the least interested in the harbor its vessels or its operations it was this place el sinut that fascinated her it was a city like none she had ever before seen the buildings were all white and the hot midmorning sun glaring off them was almost blinding they were not all of one height and most seemed to be terraced each succeeding story set just slightly back of the one below in what appeared to be the center of the city was a large building the dome of which was overlaid in gold leaf and glittered brightly is that your deys palace india asked aruj agha no he told her that is the grande mosque of el sinut what is a mosque she inquired it is what we call our holy place like your churches he explained to her do you see the four towers surrounding the dome they are called minarets six times each day the imans our priests ascend the minarets and call the people to prayer you pray six times each day india said incredulous we are devout people he replied what is going to happen now aruj agha india questioned him as their ship was made fast to a dock why we will go up to the deys palace it is there he pointed following the direction of his finger india saw a large cluster of buildings on a low hill just below the grande mosque they were as faceless and anonymous as all the other buildings in the city a litter will be brought for you he said answering what was obviously to be her next question and the others she wondered aloud my cousin viscount twyford will they go too they will walk behind us my beauty he responded i must now see to the arrangement he told her i will leave you in the company of your cousin aruj agha moved away from them all business now i am afraid india suddenly said looking up at tom southwood you must show no fear he warned her especially among the women of the harem you have to understand that these women are all vying for the attention of a single man and hate each other they will do whatever they have to do to destroy a potential rival i think i should rather be at an oar she told him with a small chuckle as she attempted to calm herself there is one thing i must insist you do india he said under no circumstances say you were eloping with viscount twyford if there is the slightest suspicion that you are no virgin you could end up being sold in the common slave market and find yourself in a brothel you will be safest in the deys household but what if he gives me to someone else india fretted you are still securest in the harem of a wealthy man than in a whorehouse cousin and i will be able to find you more easily but poor adrian india said piteously he will think i have betrayed him and it will break his heart i cannot do it tom adrian will certainly understand that your safety is our main concern thomas southwood told her it should be his concern too if he truly loves you please india promise me you will follow my instructions eventually i will get us all out of this situation but you have to trust me and do as i tell you at that moment aruj agha joined them once again bid your cousin farewell captain you realize you will not be able to speak with her again quickly we are ready to depart for the deys palace tom southwood hugged india whispering urgently into her ear as he did so promise me ill try she whispered back hugging him come the janisarry captain said taking india by the arm and leading her from the deck down the gangway and onto the first solid ground she had touched in weeks she swayed just slightly as she regained her land legs as the agha called them helping her into a curtained litter do not remove your veil my beauty or attempt to open the curtains once they are drawn he said sternly it is difficult to breathe she complained nervously where was he taking her what was going to happen to the others and adrian she had not seen him in several days was he all right lie back against the pillows he advised her in a kinder tone seeing her obvious distress although she made a valiant attempt not to show that she was frightened you will find a small embroidered pouch tucked along one side of the litter in it is a vial of water to assuage your thirst should you need it you will find you can see through the curtains although no one will be able to get close enough to you to invade your privacy the town is pretty and you will enjoy the ride to the deys palace it is not a great distance my beauty he gave her a small smile then he drew the litters curtains closed and he had not lied to her india quickly discovered she could see out aruj agha was dressed very handsomely this morning she mused he wore red silk pantaloons a greenandgoldstriped shirt with a matching sash about his waist and a handsome green silk cape lined in red there was a curved sword hanging from his sash his boots were of red leather and upon his head was a small turban with a pearl pendant a rather handsome chestnut gelding was brought forth and he mounted it easily observing and directing the unloading of the royal charles from his perch the cargo was packed into muledrawn carts and put into line behind the agha indias litter was then moved behind the cargo suddenly she saw the english crew coming down the gangway of the corsair galley they were shackled by their legs and around the neck of each man was an iron collar from which a chain was fastened to the man before him in the line of prisoners only captain thomas southwood was permitted to walk free ahead of his men having given his word of honor not to attempt an escape along their route indias eyes anxiously scanned the shackled men desperately seeking out adrian leigh she gasped horrified to see him first in the line next to knox pale and treated no better than the common sailors how could they before she might voice her protest to aruj agha her litter was lifted up by four of the janissaries who had come off the galley the procession moved off the docks and onto the narrow winding streets of the city realizing that there was nothing she could do to help adrian india took the aghas advice and lay back amid the brightly colored silk pillows in the litter she could see that the white walls of the buildings were devoid of windows on the street level some of the structures had latticecovered windows on the upper levels but most did not looking into the courtyard entrances she saw tubs and ceramic jars of flowers in a riotous profusion of shapes sizes and colors sometimes she saw a bubbling fountain the streets were amazingly clean and the populace appeared very orderly going about their daily business without much ado india quickly realized that the veiled figures were females but there were actually very few of them they passed through a large open market square there were stalls set up selling all kinds of produce and flowers meat poultry and fish household goods fabrics leather goods song birds in wooden cages and live animals then she shuddered seeing a block upon which slaves were even now being auctioned off the people in the market jeered at the captive seamen but made no other hostile move toward them the street they entered on the other side of the market square was slightly steeper and gently terraced with wide stairs the houses along it were larger obviously belonging to a more affluent class of citizen the street itself began to widen as they moved up it india could see the dome of the grande mosque and realized if the deys palace were just below it they must be getting closer the procession entered another square this one empty of people there were no buildings on either side of the square it was walled and above it was nothing more than cloudless blue sky the square was paved in blocks of cream and red marble ahead of them stood the deys white marble palace they passed beneath a deep wide entry arch into an open courtyard armed guards lined the entry and the courtyard their procession moved through another wide archway flanked with heavy wooden doors entering into another courtyard this one planted with a tiled fountain in its center indias litter was set carefully down and a moment later aruj agha opened the curtains and offered her his hand helping her out he looked at her a moment and then nodded as if satisfied you will follow me my beauty do not speak unless the dey gives you his permission to do so if he questions you you may answer him now let us go the time of the deys audience is almost over india looked quickly about her but her cousin and the other english captives had been already taken away but to where she couldnt be afraid she must not be she genuinely believed her life depended upon her being strong and so she followed quickly after the janisarry captain he led her down a wide corridor and finally into a large pillared room with an opaque dome through which sunlight filtered softly the room was crowded and hot but she shivered nonetheless seated crosslegged on a pillowed dais at the far end of the room from the entry was a man garbed all in white but for a clothofgold sash about his waist his broad pantaloons were white with wide embroidered bands of gold and pearls and most extraordinary his feet were bare he wore an opennecked white silk shirt and she could see a heavy gold chain with a pendant upon his smooth bronze chest a white satin cape lined in clothofgold was fastened about his neck with a thin gold chain on his head was a small low turban from whose front and center wrapping sprouted an aigrette feather set in a perfectly round diamond aruj agha my lord the large black slave who was the doorkeeper boomed in stentorian tones stay here the janissary commanded her when i call you you may come forward my beauty the he hurried up to the foot of the dais and falling to his knees kissed the deys foot arise aruj agha you have returned sooner than i expected you have had good hunting then i assume indeed my lord caynan reis i have the agha scrambled to his feet once again bowing as he did so what have you brought us the dey asked his face was an oval and a short wellbarbered black beard fringed his jaw making a circle about his mouth a fine english round ship my lord it is not even a year old and was meant for the east indies run but its captain was breaking it in gently by sailing it between london and istanbul for the last few months its cargo i regret is not particularly valuable just portuguese hides english wool and tinware oranges and lemons from cadiz and a number of barrels of sherry from malaga which we dumped into the sea remembering the prophets admonition on wine its crew however is made up of welldisciplined seamen quite a cut above the usual scurvy creatures we generally take off these ships many including the captain have already said they are willing to convert to islam and sail beneath the flags of the sultans government and el sinut and the vessel carried two passengers a young english milord who will undoubtedly fetch a respectable ransom and the captains cousin a young noblewoman said to be an heiress of great wealth she was being escorted to visit her grandmother in naples i am assured she is a virgin my lord caynan reis she is i believe quite a prize beautiful the dey asked his long fingers toyed with his beard of course my lord the agha replied the dey laughed first things first he said bring me the captain of this ship that i may assure myself of his honesty thomas southwood was escorted in by two janissaries he first bowed and then making obeisance as he had been instructed touched his forehead to the deys bare foot remaining upon his knees he straightened his body and waited tell me your name and who your family are the dey instructed captain thomas southwood master of the royal charles out of london my lord i am the fourth son of the earl of lynmouth the vessel i sailed belonged to the omalleysmall trading company in which i have a small share i am now at your service my lord you are willing to convert to islam and sail for me aye my lord you are quick with your answers captain and i am suspicious of such a cooperative attitude is it possible you are considering escape that you believe you will be given your freedom if you convert and then may flee i am not such a fool as you may think you may speak my lord dey you would know me for a liar if i said i had no thought of escape surely every captive dreams of escape however once many many years ago my grandmother was a captive of islam she eventually returned home and told her children and grandchildren that to suffer for dogma is both foolish and wasteful of the talents we have been given that the christians the jews and the muslims all worship the same god no matter the name they call him by i willingly accept islam and i offer to you my services as both a ships captain and a navigator it would be a shame if my talents were wasted at an oar or in the mines or the fields i have no wife to return home to and so i am content for the time being to remain here in el sinut serving the sultan as many before me have done if you will have me of course my lord dey i realize you have the power of life and death over me but if you will have me i am your servant you have a facile tongue the dey remarked he looked at aruj agha and speaking in arabic rather than french asked what think you my old friend is the english captain trustworthy for the present i believe so my lord dey he has certainly been more than candid with you you could ransom him of course if he is indeed the son of a noble ransoming these people is more trouble than it is worth the dey replied i am giving you my new galley the gazelle aruj agha take this englishman with you as a navigator that way you can lock him up when you attack other ships at least until he proves his loyalty to us in the meantime you will have his skill if indeed he has not lied about that i do not believe so my lord he is exactly what you see no more my gracious thanks for the gazelle i shall take her out almost immediately with your lordships permission the agha said what will you do with the round ship i think i shall keep her and perhaps after your englishman has proven he can be trusted he will teach our people how to sail such a vessel now where is this other englishman of rank the agha signaled and two janissaries brought viscount twyford forward adrian leigh however refused to kneel or even bow before the dey instead he immediately began a harangue i am the heir of the earl of oxton sir i can be ransomed for a handsome sum do so immediately that i may be quit of this savage place on your knees dog aruj agha roared what bow to some infidel the viscount returned get on your knees you damned fool tom southwood growled they will separate your head from your shoulders without a thought aruj agha didnt wait another moment he grabbed adrian leigh by his iron collar and kicked his legs from beneath him slamming him to the floor where his aristocratic nose making hard contact with the marble floor began to bleed profusely the dey watched impassively then he said send him to the galleys i cannot be bothered with the arrogance of this young milord perhaps after he has rowed his way across the sea for a few months he will be more amenable put him on the gazelle take him away whatwhat is happening adrian leigh demanded furiously wiping his nose with his torn sleeve youre going to the galleys for your stupidity tom southwood said dryly i am not being ransomed viscount twyfords tone was incredulous you speak to the master of el sinut like he is some stupid servant and you expect him to ransom you jesu preserve you viscount you are an incredible fool tom southwood told him as they were taken from the deys audience chamber and in all the time since we have been captured you havent said one damned word about india dont you care what happens to her she has done nothing but fret over your fate you selfish bastard but you really dont care do you we all know what happens to women in this sort of situation adrian leigh said coldly even if we could all be ransomed india is surely no longer fit to be my wife that agha fellow was certainly most solicitous of her wasnt he knox told me he couldnt do enough for the wench she has undoubtedly saved her own skin by giving herself to him shes a passionate little bitch you know tom southwoods big fist slammed into adrian leighs bruised nose with the speed of lightning and he actually heard the viscounts nose break you miserable bastard he roared before their guards pulled him off the viscount who was once again bleeding from his battered proboscis it was nothing more than her fortune wasnt it tom southwood said but she poor innocent wouldnt believe us of course it was her fortune adrian leigh half moaned why the hell else would a man marry a woman but for her dowry india had watched adrian and tom depart the chamber she had no idea what had happened to them for she hadnt been able to hear from her place in the rear of the audience chamber which was now almost empty seeing the blood on the viscounts face she was not just a little frightened then she heard aruj aghas voice call to her and he came to lead her up to the foot of the deys throne quickly he removed the long cape she wore and unveiled her face india stood silently in her silk shirt and her dark silk skirts the agha had warned her to keep her eyes lowered because she was as yet anxious and fearful she was more than willing to follow his instructions there was not a sound in the hall it seemed but her own thundering heart the dey arose and stepped down moving directly in front of india reaching out he tipped her face up let me see your eyes he commanded her his voice was deep and rich his french exquisite she shyly raised her dark lashes and was startled to see that his own eyes were a deep sapphire blue holding her chin between his thumb and forefinger the dey gazed directly into her face and india felt a blush firing her cheeks she has eyes like a young lioness the dey pronounced speaking to his companions as if she wasnt even there or worse didnt understand she is very spirited my lord dey aruj agha warned is she thedey sounded amused then he said to india does my captain speak the truth are you a thorny english rose please my lord what has happened to my cousin and viscount twyford india burst out unable to help herself she is spirited the dey said and then he told india your cousin has accepted islam and will sail with aruj agha as for that arrogant young milord i have sent him to the galleys the galleys the words burned into indias brain it was a death sentence adrian would not be able to survive such punishment she had seen how hard the galley slaves had worked on the aghas ship and when they had not worked hard enough to suit the overseer a whip had been applied to their backs to encourage them onward india shrieked with her fury and her distress her eyes went to a dagger in the deys clothofgold sash grabbing at the bejeweled handle she pulled it out and stabbed wildly at him with it you have killed adrian you have killed him she screamed allah preserve us the agha cried out and leaping forward disarmed india throwing her to the floor my lord are you seriously injured ahhhhh i shall never forgive myself for having introduced this wretched girl into your presence my lord speak to me the dey however was laughing spirited i do not think that begins to describe the wench he said rubbing his bruised shoulder do not fear my good agha i am only slightly grazed her aim was most dreadful but she has ripped my cloak then he signaled to two of his startled servants immediately they pulled india up and dragged her across the chamber where they fastened her between two marble pillars her feet just barely touching the floor the back of her shirt was ripped away and her long dark hair pushed aside she saw his bare feet by her side you cannot be allowed to attack me without being punished he said softly the lash will be plied so that i do not break the skin on your back and seriously harm you i will wield the whip myself and you will receive five lashes i am being merciful because you are new to our ways although i am certain that attempted murder in england would be met with a far harsher judgment than that i will mete out to you i do not care what you do to me india said brokenly your cruelty will kill the viscount why should you care he asked her his voice curious because i love him she half sobbed the dey did not answer her instead he moved directly behind her and india heard the whistle of the whip even before it hit her back she cried out with the first blow ihate you behind her the dey smiled grimly and continued her punishment adding the second third fourth and fifth lashes to her back but india clamped her lips tightly together and did not cry out again when he had finished the agha said i shall take her to the marketplace and sell her my lord dey no caynan reis said i am going to keep her aruj agha but she tried to kill you my lord the wench is far too dangerous to keep i would never forgive myself if she succeeded in a second attempt no let me sell her the dey chuckled no he replied i enjoy a little danger she is a virgin is she not well we all know how passionate virgins can be she attacked me because she says she loves that arrogant little milord and she believes i have given him a death sentence i will turn her foolish heart because it will be a challenge to do so she may one day become the pride of my harem now let me get a better look at this prize you have brought me aruj agha strip her he told his servants the slaves released india from her confinement between the two pillars she was half carried half dragged across the floor to the dais where the dey now stood the remnants of her shirt and her chemise were pulled away revealing her bare torso india swallowed hard knowing that to struggle was futile this dey would have his way her skirts and remaining undergarments were drawn off one of the slaves knelt and removed her leather slippers she was half in shock she had never felt so naked in her entire life caynan reis stood silent as indias charms were uncovered his darkblue eyes moved slowly over her her breasts were round and perhaps a bit small yet they were incredibly lush with the proper loving those little fruits would ripen nicely her nipples were like unopened flower buds all tight and hidden the triangle of dark curls at the junction of her thighs would be removed of course but he could see the mound beneath those curls was plump the dey stepped down and stood before her look at me he commanded her and when she did he reached around her and fondled one of her buttocks then his hand smoothed its way down her back you have skin like the finest bursa silk he told her he then moved in a leisurely fashion about her she had beautiful limbs well shaped and not too thin her legs were long her feet small and slender he put his arm about her suddenly and drew her back against his body cupping one of her breasts in his hand tell me the truth he whispered in her ear his fingers caressing her bosom are you truly a virgin india nodded vigorously at first unable to speak she was both hot and cold and had to struggle to remain standing for her legs felt as if they would give way at any minute his large hand was splayed across her belly and felt fiery against her skin she wondered if he could feel her trembling finally she was able to speak of course i am a virgin she gasped why would you think otherwise because you have told me you are in love with the milord the dey answered her i love him but i am certainly no wanton india murmured and if he had had me would you set us free oh god she wished his hands didnt feel so allpossessing every time he caressed her chills raced up and down her spine no i would not set you free although it would displease me to learn that another had traveled the path i have solely reserved for my own pleasure his lips brushed her ear i am going to make love to you he said softly i shall kiss you and caress you until you beg me to relieve you of the burden of your virginity never she half whispered vehemently and i shall teach you how to please me his big hand drew her head to one side and his mouth branded her throat with kisses tell me your name my thorny rose she couldnt breathe she couldnt breathe and then she finally managed to say india india he breathed hotly in her ear i am lady india anne lindley daughter of the duke of glenkirk i have a brother who is a duke and another brother who is a marquis i am rich and can pay whatever ransom you desire ohhh god dont do that please let me go my lord there isnt enough gold in the world to buy you from me the dey told her then his fingers teased down her torso and pushing his hands between her trembling thighs he cupped her venus mound within his palm you belong to me he told her india collapsed against him the touch of his hand in that most secret of places was simply too much for her with a cry she fainted dead away the dey caught her in his arms and calmly handed her limp form to a eunuch brushing indias hot cheek with the back of his hand he smiled to himself aruj agha had been wrong there had been a valuable cargo on the english ship and as was his right the dey claimed this cargo for himself take her to baba hassan he told the eunuch and tell him the girl is to be treated like a princess i will speak with him later the eunuch turned and exited the audience chamber carrying his burden with extreme gentleness if she kills you i will not be responsible aruj agha said wryly i think she will break you rather than the other way around we will destroy each other in an excess of passion the dey answered him i have been bored of late i will no longer be bored she intrigues me my friend she was frightened to death but she would not admit to it or even show it by any outward sign i knew for i could feel her trembling ever so slightly beneath my touch when she declared she was in love with the milord i feared i had been misled with regard to her virginity and i was ashamed to have brought you so poor a gift the agha said but when she fainted at your intimate touch i knew she was indeed a virgin i wish you much joy with the girl my lord dey now i will take my leave of you aruj agha bowed low before his lord the english milord caynan reis said do not kill him my friend i want him alive to eventually ransom but first i think he needs a strong lesson in manners you will ransom him despite the difficulty the agha was surprised why the girl believes i have given him a death sentence in a few months we will show her that he is still alive and that i am a merciful man i will have won her love by then and so we will ransom him it amuses me to do this now go and allah be with you aruj agha travel safely and bring me more treasures to enrich our master the sultan the janissary captain departed the deys audience chamber and caynan reis dismissed his servants sitting quietly upon his dais viscount twyford how odd it had been to hear the title that had once come out of his halfbrothers mouth adrian had under his mothers tutelage become an arrogant swine so filled with himself that he had not even recognized deverall leigh but then it had been ten years since they had last seen each other ten years could be a lifetime the dey considered in that time his halfbrother had grown from a snotnosed brat into a haughty and insolent cad one of the guards who had escorted captain southwood and adrian from his audience chamber had been a sailor on the ship he had taken from england that vessel like the royal charles had been captured by corsairs sailing out of el sinut the guard like deverall leigh had accepted islam and gained a decent life although he rarely heard his native tongue he had dutifully reported the conversation he overheard between the english captain and adrian even as the dey was preparing to punish india for her attack on his person captain southwoods gallant attempt to protect his cousin from scandal undoubtedly came about because the foolish inexperienced india was attempting to elope with adrian he could see his stepmothers greedy hand in it the dey thought he doubted the girls family would have approved any match between his halfbrother and india not with his stepmothers reputation and the scandal of lord jefferss murder for which he had been held responsible he simply should have held adrian in his dungeon until a ransom could have been obtained for his person although he knew his father was not a rich man still marielena leigh would have moved heaven and earth to regain her darling son the dey smiled grimly he could imagine her anguish the little bastard however had aggravated him with his arrogance the order to send him to the galleys was out of his mouth before the dey realized what he was saying well a few months in the galleys wouldnt kill adrian it might even make him a better man after all the dey of el sinut had himself been confined in the galleys for almost two years and he had survived surely his halfbrother was made of the same stuff and when the ransom was finally paid caynan reis decided he would reveal himself to adrian and he would tell him how delicious a prize the beautiful india was for although his halfbrother had now dismissed the girl he had been eloping with it would certainly madden him to know she was deverall leighs mistress and would be until he tired of her adrian had always been loath to share his toys when he was little even when he had tired of them his stepmother had taught him one important lesson women were expendable and absolutely not to be trusted nonetheless his revenge would be sweet and it was little enough for adrian to suffer after all he would go home to england and one day inherit the title that was rightfully deverall leighs whereas deverall leigh could never go home because he stood accused of murdering lord jeffers his name was blackened forever and he knew that his fathers heart was broken because of it for he had been the earl of oxtons favorite son and that was what hurt the dey worst of all the knowledge that his father had been shamed and injured because of this so that a selfish and thoughtless womans son might supplant him he wished there was some way he might make his stepmother suffer for all her betrayals and for the death of an innocent man but he knew his desire was a futile one still he would think on it was it not written that nothing was graven so deeply in stone that it could not be changed india opened her eyes she was surrounded by pale gold gauze draperies gingerly she turned her head she was lying naked upon a scarlet silk mattress beside her was a low table its top inlaid with blueandwhite mosaic atop the table was a crystal goblet half filled with a pale peachcolored liquid she was so thirsty but she could hardly move india moaned softly and instantly a black face appeared in her view she gasped trying to cover herself i am baba hassan lady chief eunuch of the deys harem you are thirsty it was a statement and not a question the eunuch braced her shoulders in a halfseated position and held the cup to her lips drink it slowly lady he advised apparently impervious to her unclothed state the liquid was cool and fruity and slid easily down her parched throat what is it she finally asked him when she had assuaged her thirst the drink had been sweet and she could feel the strength coming back into her limbs it is a mixture of fruit juices he told her and he lay her back upon the mattress where am i india asked him you are in the harem of the dey caynan reis may allah protect and preserve him baba hassan told her i have been told you are to be treated gently despite your violent behavior of earlier today the eunuchs long face wore a disapproving look i did not even wound him india said defensively you should have not even attempted to do such a thing it showed an appalling lack of manners baba hassan said sternly you are a beautiful maiden not some wild savage is our young assassin awake then a belllike voice inquired india turned her head and saw the voice belonged to a very beautiful older woman with silver hair and almondshaped turquoiseblue eyes she had a lean body and an elegant carriage and there was an amused smile upon her unlined face i am azura the mistress of the deys harem the woman said how are you feeling now my child tired india replied weak what is the matter with me a long sea voyage the distress of being captured by aruj agha fear azura said quietly and i suspect you are in a little bit of shock having been whipped by the dey i do not imagine you were ever treated so harshly before my child were you the older womans face was genuinely concerned i am a noblemans daughter and related to our king of course i have never been beaten before india answered azura indignantly and feeling the tears pricking sharply behind her eyelids she fought to prevent them from overflowing her eyes and displaying her weakness for all to see azura reached out and squeezed indias hand let the tears come my child they will be a catharsis for you if i weep you will think me weak india said stonily iam not weak i do not cry before strangers i understand azura said calmly but when you are alone later cleanse your sorrow with your tears my child now are you hungry india nodded baba hassan will see you are fed and then we will take you to the baths azura told her she arose i will come back later when you have finished your meal my child we will talk who is she india asked the eunuch when azura had gone is she the deys wife caynan reis has no wife baba hassan replied the lady azura was the favorite of the former dey on his deathbed he asked caynan reis to protect her and let her live out her days here where she has lived most of her life of course he agreed she keeps order among the women who are apt to be difficult as all women are the eunuch concluded he clapped his hands sharply and a slave girl appeared with a tray here is your meal lady baba hassan said india sat up slowly and another slave girl appeared to prop pillows behind her back upright the tray in her lap india inspected the contents curiously there was a bowl of yellow grain mixed with pieces of green scallions and bits of chicken half a round of a flat bread a small bunch of green grapes and a thin slice of something pale gold in color what is it she asked the eunuch saffroned rice with onion and chicken the bread and grapes you recognize and a slice of melon a sweet fruit he answered her india began to eat using a small silver spoon and her fingers there was neither a fork nor a knife upon the tray the rice and chicken were nicely cooked and flavored the bread still warm and the melon was absolutely delicious almost melting in her mouth it is all very good she pronounced as she finished she washed her hands in a silver ewer the slave girl held out drying them on a small linen towel provided the tray was removed we will now go to the baths baba hassan announced but i have no clothes india protested you do not need clothing to bathe and you are certainly in need of bathing was the tart reply you have soft skin and so are obviously used to washing but i doubt you could have done so aboard your ship why are you so modest lady there are only women here you are not a woman india snapped at him neither am i a man he replied dryly helping her to her feet come along now the lady azura will be waiting for us he pulled back the gauze draperies they were in a large room india now saw here and there were other partitions formed by the sheer draperies beautiful young women lounged about on low silkcovered furniture and upon satincovered pillows warm air blew through the latticed windows there were cages of songbirds hung in the windows india still felt embarrassed to be so vulnerable among these women but remembering her cousins warning she grit her teeth and held her head high ignoring the spiteful remarks spoken in french so she would be certain of understanding them as she passed through the harem her breasts are too small are we certain she is a girl dark hair ho hum how common an overblown blonde said she is soooo hairy her buttocks are nice enough but the dey is not that kind came the reply followed by a round of malicious tittering do you think shes a virgin asked another girl she must be who would want such a creature was the answer she does not look like she will hold much interest for our master once he has taken her maidenhead if he even bothers to before giving her away to some desert sheikeh he wants to believe he is honoring there was more laughter among the women of the deys harem and india could feel her cheeks flaming she needed desperately to retaliate so these pampered creatures would not think she was easy prey she stopped and turning about slowly said with devastating effect i wonder which of you i will kill first then she continued onward following behind baba hassan with apparent meekness behind her there was a sudden shocked silence you have a fine sense of the dramatic the eunuch observed wryly as they left the main room of the harem and entered the baths ahh here you are azura hurried forward smiling i will leave you in the lady azuras competent hands while i return to restore order out of the chaos you have created half of the ladies will be weeping with fear from your fierce remark the eunuch departed what on earth did you do azura asked india those common creatures made unkind remarks about me as i passed through their domain india replied i only considered out loud which one of them i should kill first surely they didnt really believe me i only did it to spite them azura laughed you will have frightened them to death she told india you come from a land where the women are free in comparison to the women here your women may own land walk the streets unveiled in many cases even have a say in choosing their own husbands those vapid creatures peopling the deys harem are incapable of such independence their sole reason for being is focused on pleasing caynan reis and any new inhabitant of this harem is considered a threat to be frightened away you however were not in the least intimidated by the ladies of the harem indeed you threatened them with violence and having heard of your attempt on the deys life this morning they fully believe you capable of such an act it was most naughty of you to terrorize them so then she laughed again where is your homeland india suddenly asked azura i was born in poitou azura said quietly like you my father was of the noble class and i his eldest daughter i was sent one summer when i was twelve and a marriage was being arranged for me to visit relatives near marseilles one day barbary corsairs stormed ashore and i was taken along with my cousins into captivity the former dey sharif el mohammed was my only master i have lived in this palace for thirty years you had no children india couldnt resist being curious azura shook her head sharif el mohammed had no offspring she said women of course are blamed in such a situation but my good lord knew better which is why he never put me aside she smiled at india you are so full of questions my child and i must get you bathed you have never seen baths like these i will wager and indeed india had not the room into which they entered was constructed of creamy marble domed its pillars were of a pale green marble in the center of the room was a round pool directly beneath the dome around the room were fountains with gold spigots set into the walls above shelllike indentations in the marble floor there were marble benches in varying heights set about the room was warm and damp and the air was scented with roses several slave women hurried forward bowing politely to the lady azura here is the new maiden azura said you must prepare her properly for our master she has been aboard ship for many weeks and is in need of much attention but unlike many of these girls she does bathe regularly as you will see by the softness of her skin the bath attendants took india in their charge i will remain with you azura assured her the bath women tskedtsked over the condition of indias thick dark curls admired her golden eyes and then set to work she was stood in one of the floor shells and rinsed a young woman with a small curved silver instrument ran the implement over indias entire body to her surprise india saw dirt being scraped off of her skin she was rinsed again next she was washed very thoroughly by two ladies holding large sea sponges filled with a foamy soap when they had finished and she had been rinsed off a third time another woman knelt to examine indias body so closely that india blushed with embarrassment what is she doing india asked azura as the woman began to smear a pink paste that smelled of almonds over her legs and venus mound does she have to touch me so intimately our men do not like body hair on a woman azura explained as the bath attendant lifted each of indias arms in turn and spread her mixture beneath the upraised arms the almond paste will remove the offense it wont take long i promise while they waited for the depilatory to do its work indias hair was thoroughly washed and then toweled almost dry azura admired the girls tresses for india had hair that curled naturally even to the end of its length which was about midback the older woman lifted a handful of the curls admiringly feeling its texture and thickness its lovely she said here in the sultans realm maidens with golden or flamecolored hair are usually the most valuable but your marvelous ebony curls are quite wonderful azura told the younger woman these curls are truly your crowning glory my child the pink paste was washed away and india found herself feeling shy again as her venus mound was suddenly so prominently displayed azura led her into the bathing pool which was warm and quite relaxing india was surprised to see what a fine body the older woman had despite her age when you are feeling relaxed we shall leave the pool and the slaves will massage our bodies with sweet oils azura explained do you do this every day india asked her yes azura replied bathing is a very social amenity the poor go to the public baths the hours being specified for men and for women there they wash and exchange gossip and just talk does the dey heed your words my lady india asked he must if he entrusts his harem to you you must tell him that i am a very wealthy girl and can buy my freedom i must be returned to my family since adrian and i snuck away just as my family was to return home to scotland it is just possible that no scandal has arisen from our behavior if i could just get back home again it would be all right azura was very quiet for a long moment and then she said i will not lie to you my child caynan reis has not need of your wealth for he is wealthy beyond all it is highly unusual for a young and beautiful woman to be ransomed out of barbary once i thought as you did my heart was broken and only when i accepted my fate was i able to be happy again you are not like the little fools peopling his harem you are clever and you are intelligent you can win him over with those qualities if you will but try i do not believe he has ever loved which is why it is so easy for him to give his women away when he tires of them and that is often for they bore him i suspect he may have once been betrayed by a woman he was beginning to care for and so he trusts no woman entirely not even me if you displease him enough he will dispose of you by offering you to someone he wishes to honor or if you anger him he will give you to his soldiers to be a barracks whore he has done it before has he no heart then india asked a little frightened now oh he has a heart azura answered the girl but it is buried deep within the ice of his soul someone must touch him and melt that ice one day i think that someone could be you india i dont know how to make love to a man india half whispered and how can i allow a man i do not even know the freedom of my body of course you dont know how to make love azura said with a gentle laugh you are a virgin and such knowledge has not yet been imparted to you once you have been unburdened of your maidenhead i will tutor you myself in the arts of love i have never before done this for any girl but i believe you can become the deys true favorite she patted indias cheek comfortingly come now and let us have our massage my child you will feel ever so much better after it they stepped from the warmth of the pool to be dried with thick fluffy warm towels such as india had never before seen then they lay down upon separate benches each of which had been padded with a small mattress and the masseuses began to knead their bodies with fragrant oils their strong fingers digging deep into muscles and india finally began to relax she was being seduced by this delicious luxury and she knew it but she didnt really mind at this point in time when the masseuses had finished they arose to be dressed azura chose for india a coralcolored silk garment that she called a kaftan there were wide bands of gold thread embroidery at the wrists of the flowing sleeves and at the keyhole design of the neckline azura now ordered indias curls to be brushed and a gold band was fit about her forehead a slave brought azura a jewel case and the older woman chose a pair of earbobs which she carefully fixed in indias earlobes they were gold and shaped like stars gold bangles were pushed onto both her arms then the mistress of the baths personally pared indias finger and toenails as short as she could without cutting her there my lady azura she is ready the bath mistress said azura who had dressed herself in a deep purpleandsilver kaftan turned to look at her charge ahhh yes she is lovely she said my compliments fatima as always your work is perfection the bath mistress beamed well pleased come my child azura called to india and she led her back into the main room of the harem the other girls were now asleep lying upon their mattresses within their curtained alcoves azura settled india within her cubicle i will return for you when it is time she said softly time for what india said quickly her nerves tightening again why my child surely you understood that the dey wishes your presence this evening the harem mistress said then she patted indias flushed cheek it will be all right india you must trust me i have only your best interests at heart then she was gone india was horrified she didnt know this man nor he her and yet he would take her to his bed tonight what kind of a world was she in now once again she wished she had obeyed her parents instead of forcing the issue to obtain her own way she suddenly remembered asking lady stewarthepburn what it was like to be in a harem had it been exciting or awful both her stepgrandmother had replied but cat leslie hadnt been a virgin when she had faced the passions of a powerful turk and while it had been exciting to experience the baths with the lady azura what lay ahead was too awful to contemplate once she had been in the deys bed there was no turning back for her she could never go home again never see her parents or her brothers or fortune the tears came silent and soundless for india would allow no one to hear her sorrow or her pain but perhaps there was yet hope perhaps the lady azura would take pity on her despite her honest explanation to india that there was no going back if azura pitied her she would surely speak to the dey it was indias experience that the rich always wanted more with few exceptions surely this dey was not so wealthy that he couldnt use more wealth exhausted india lay upon her mattress and dozed praying as she slipped into sleep that the dey might relent and send her home in exchange for a ransom azura had left her charge and gone directly to the deys apartments he waved her to a chair and a servant put a goblet of fresh juice into her hand azura sipped the liquid and then looking up at the dey said she is terrified but she will not admit to it my lord you must treat this maiden very gently you know i am not rough with my women he replied my lord allah has surely sent you this maiden azura told him she is of your own race your own class and if you can but win her over she would make you a fine wife she is very beautiful my lord i had little time to notice he said mockingly i was too busy defending my life from the little wildcat azura laughed her aim was very poor my lord she did not even scratch the skin the physician tells me you like this wench dont you azura i have never known you to care for one of my women the dey said perhaps i am getting old azura replied this girl could be the daughter i never had my lord i barely know her and yet i like her there is something about her that touches me mayhap it is her courage for though she is frightened she conceals it well when those silly creatures in your harem insulted her this afternoon she contemplated aloud which one of them she would kill first and set them into hysterics azura chuckled it was quick witted of her and most deftly done they will think long and hard before attacking her again yet she responds well to reason and kindness i have had no difficulty with her at all he was thoughtful a moment and then he said so you think i need a wife do you my dear azura why surely you want sons my lord every man wants sons she answered him perhaps one day you may go home to your england again and bring your sons to your fathers house the deys face darkened i shall never go home again azura how can i with a charge of murder hanging over me i need no sons for oxton nor a proper english wife what i want is revenge and i have the means of enacting that revenge the young man i sentenced to the galleys this morning the one your india longs for he is my younger halfbrother now my fathers heir if he lives long enough for me to ransom him he did not recognize me of course for ten years have passed since we last saw each other i should not have recognized him either but for his pompous bleating about his importance aruj agha has been told and will look out for him but adrian will row his hands raw for a few months before i inform his dear mother that he is a captive in barbary and when she pays his ransom for marielena will move heaven and earth to redeem her precious offspring only then will i reveal myself to my sibling and india azura asked her very presence here will have ruined her reputation in england the dey said she tells me that her family was returning home when she ran off with your halfbrother my lord she believes her reputation could be yet salvaged if she could be ransomed take your revenge upon your brother and send india home to her family you do not need this particular maiden in your bed azura concluded she had had no intentions of pleading for india until she heard the deys plans it disturbed her that he could be so vindictive true he was a hard man for to rule he had no other choice but this was cruel no caynan reis said implacably it is going to give me double pleasure to tell adrian how delightful a bed partner i found his little betrothed of course being the swine he is he doesnt want her now he believes she gave herself to aruj agha because the agha was kind to her while she was in his charge kindness is a quality with which my halfbrother is not familiar still he was never one to share his possessions even when he tired of them the knowledge that i have had the girl when he has not will enrage him and give me great satisfaction i also suspect that the girls family did not approve of him and so he cajoled the silly creature into running away with him to be married when they learn he has been ransomed and she is my captive i suspect his life will not be worth a great deal anymore my stepmother will not be able to protect him from the lady indias father and her brothers caynan reis laughed grimly i can but imagine her terror and her eventual pain but what of your father azura said quietly if indias family kill your halfbrother who will follow your father i know not the dey replied as for my father he was quick to believe the worst of me and under the influence of that bitch he married after my own mother died he disinherited me i was told he deserves to have his line die out how could he believe i was so lacking in honor that i would kill a man over the favors of a wellknown court strumpet that we quarreled over her is true but neither lord jeffers or myself would have killed over such a woman i had not realized before how deep your pain my lord azura said gently the girl india caynan reis changed the subject do you believe she is really a virgin if adrian could convince her to leave her family perhaps he also convinced her to part with her virtue i cannot answer that question without the physician examining her my lord azura told him truthfully but if i were to hazard a guess i would say absolutely yes she is a virgin her demeanor is modest and quite innocent she reached out and took his big hand saying pleadingly promise me my lord that you will treat her with kindness do you know me for a beast he demanded curtly pulling his hand from hers his blue eyes were indignant you are angry my lord but the girl is english azura said wisely remember you yourself believe she was cozened by your halfbrother who probably acted on your stepmothers instructions she is as much their victim as you once were be kind to her my lord no wonder sharif mohammed loved you caynan reis said your heart is too good azura but i will promise you that i shall not harm the girl provided of course that she does not attempt to harm me again he concluded with a small smile i shall make certain i am not wearing any weapons when we meet later this evening then i shall bring her to you my lord i must first bathe azura i have not had the time today before now bring her to me in an hours time and then you may go to bed tell baba hassan that i will keep her with me until dawn he is to come for her then and escort her back to the harem azura arose and bowed to the dey then she hurried from the room to find the chief eunuch baba hassan was ensconced most comfortably in his own elegant quarters smoking on a water pipe when the lady azura joined him wiping the mouth of the pipe he offered it to her as she seated herself opposite him drawing upon the hookah azura pulled the watercooled tobacco into her mouth and then released it it was most soothing rubbing her essence from the mouth of the pipe she passed it back to the eunuch i have just come from the dey he will keep the girl until dawn when you are to escort her back to the harem so baba hassan said with a smile you have put your little plan into operation have you my old friend i will not reveal to you what i have heard from his lips this night azura told her companion but he desperately needs to love and be loved in return of this i am convinced i believe this girl may be the one to find his heart it is not a good time azura for him to be distracted from the business of governing el sinut baba hassan said i hear whispers on the winds there is trouble coming what do you hear she asked him it is the janissaries again baba hassan said wearily they are planning yet another revolt against the sublime porte their people have been all throughout the empire seeking secret support attempting to find weaknesses in the vassal states i am told they will promise the rulers of barbary autonomy and freedom from paying tribute to istanbul in exchange for their aid she did not ask from where he had obtained his information or if the source was reliable for baba hassan would not have brought it to her attention if it were just idle gossip her only question was does the dey know yet the chief eunuch shook his head in the negative so far no emissary has come from istanbul to el sinut and aruj agha she questioned him do you think he will be loyal to the sultan or to his fellow janissaries aruj agha has been in el sinut as long as caynan reis has the eunuch said slowly i think he would be loyal to the sultan but the camaraderie of the corps is strong and his family has a history of service to it and who would they replace sultan murad with baba hassan the valide kiusem had three sons by sultan ahmed murad has two younger brothers ibhrahim and bayazet but it is the valide kiusem who is the true power in istanbul right now as sultan murad is just thirteen azura said what difference does it make which one of her sons rules if she rules for them they intend to murder both her and sultan murad baba hassan replied then they will put their own people in place and rule for the next sultan who will be of their own choosing and much too young to rule for himself they might even slaughter the other prince to prevent any rival faction like the siphatis from springing up the janissaries are not merciful remember young osman whom they brutally murdered a few years ago my lady azura they have grown very powerful in the last hundred years and as their strength has increased so has their influence they are rapacious in their desire for wealth and for domination over the empire if they could rule without a sultan i truly believe that they would then perhaps it is a good time for the dey to fall in love baba hassan the mistress of the harem said thoughtfully right now his heart is cold his memories of his family and his homeland bitter he could act rashly for what has he to lose but if he loved the girl if she bore him a child then his actions would be wiser for he would not want to lose this new family to capricious fate as he lost his old family i cannot fault your instincts in the past azura the eunuch said slowly mayhap you are right now and perhaps the rumors will come to nothing and the janissaries be content for a time the janissaries are never content she replied but istanbul is a long way from el sinut with luck we will escape the plotting and the inevitable betrayals that will come about from this latest conspiracy i pray to allah the most merciful and compassionate that you are correct azura baba hassan answered fervently she smiled slightly so do i she said now our main goal is to see that india and caynan reis find love together they are two difficult young persons i suspect dealing with the janissaries may be easier he told her with a small chuckle india had been dozing she was feeling very relaxed and the soft fabric of the kaftan against her skin was soothing then to her annoyance she was shaken awake and she heard azuras voice in her ear awaken my child it is time india slowly opened her eyes rolling back over to ask the older woman time for what madame time for you to go to the dey came the answer she was suddenly awake and completely alert tonight he would really ask for me after what i did her heart was beginning to pound with anxiety azura gently pulled india from her mattress there is nothing for you to be afraid of my child she soothed the girl i am not afraid india protested but in truth she was still had not thomas southwood warned her about appearing frightened india determined to show no fear no matter what happened azura ignored her protests drawing a brush through her charges dark curls instructing her to rinse her mouth with mint water and then leading her from the harem into a dimly lit hallway at the end of which were two large arched doors studded with brass nails and hinged with heavy black iron hinges azura pulled the doors open slightly and said softly go in my child he awaits you then she gave india a delicate but effective push into the chamber drawing the doors shut behind her the room was softly lit by a large hanging lamp burning scented oil there was the sound of a tinkling fountain that india reasoned was in the gardens she could see beyond the room past the curved pillars with their pale gauze draperies that hardly stirred in the warm night air the floor beneath her feet was tiled the furnishings were simple but elegant of polished wood brass and tile some chests tables and a single chair with a leather seat come here india started at the curt commanding voice and her eyes went to a large dais of carved wood decorated in gold and silver gilt which harbored a huge mattress covered in coral and goldstriped silk the dey wearing only his white pantaloons lounged arrogantly upon the mattress her eyes widened slightly she had never seen a man so so unclothed it was very disconcerting his chest was smooth and golden his one garment was worn low on his narrow hips and cut low to reveal his navel without the small turban he had worn in his audience chamber she could see that he was darkhaired come here he repeated india shook her head imperceptibly caynan reis let his eyes examine the girl as she stood visibly trembling her back pressed to the door she was absolutely the most beautiful creature he had ever encountered the flawless porcelain ivory skin he had noted it when he had whipped her earlier cleaned up he could see the prize he had snatched from his brother he wanted to kiss the full lush mouth and run his long fingers through her dark silky curls he could see she was terrified her golden eyes gave her away but her stance was pure defiance he slid off the mattress curious as to how far she would challenge his authority over her seeing him on his feet coming toward her india swung about her hands pushing against the door desperately she bit her lower lip to keep from crying out as she felt him behind her his body pressed lightly against hers she could barely breathe but she swallowed the cry in her tight and aching throat standing perfectly still even as she heard his steady breathing next to her when one of his hands slammed against the door by her head she jumped in terror he laughed softly you are afraid he said his fingers pulling her dark hair aside his warm lips kissing the nape of her neck no india managed to grate out her nose just pressing against the heavy oak door between brass nails i will not hurt you he said leaning around to nibble upon the delicate lobe of ear ummmm as i suspected you are delicious she remained silent although if the truth had been known a succession of shivers was racing up and down her spine you are a very disobedient little slave he told her his fingers playing with her curls i am not a slave india said fiercely i am lady india anne lindley daughter of the duke of glenkirk sister of the marquis of westleigh the duke of lundy and lord leslie of glenkirk you have no right to hold me i am a freeborn english woman and no slave your lineage is impressive he told her softly but you speak of what you were india and not of who you are now you are a spoil of war brought to me by one of my captains and thus you have become a slave he pushed his body hard against hers it is time you learned your place in this new world you have entered you are my slave your sole purpose in life is to please me never the brass nails in the door were pressing against her delicate flesh he laughed at her defiance and nipped the back of her neck with sharp teeth what other choice do you have he mocked i will die she replied grimly little fool he growled low in his throat do you think i will allow that to happen quickly first i would give you to the janissaries in the palace barracks for their pleasure do you believe they would accept your feeble refusals they would strip you naked holding you down while they took their pleasure of you again and again and again you would be subjected to every kind of perversion known to man my innocent little virgin and when they had finally destroyed your spirit and your beauty you would become a common barracks drudge it would take you some time several years i suspect before you would finally die of disease and starvation india is that what you really want the words he spoke were terrifying no she whispered then you will yield yourself to me he said quietly again she shook her head you may ravish me my lord but i will never yield to you ever ravish he tasted the word with his tongue greatly offended ravish i want to make love to you little fool i want to caress these soft white limbs his big hand slipped beneath her wide sleeve and then smoothed down her arm i want to love every inch of your body and kiss that tempting mouth until it is bruised with my kisses his hands grasped her shoulders i want to hear you cry with pleasure when our bodies join and we become one but i do not want to ravish you the only way you will have me my lord is to force me india said stonily he made a sound of annoyance as his hands dropped away from her shoulders little fool he warned her do you not realize that i could have you bound and then take my pleasure of you you would rejoice when i had finished for i would have shown you paradise no you do not understand and i will not coerce a mere girl in order to teach joy to a reluctant maiden i will not allow you to drive me to such a thing grasping her arm he yanked her away from the door and then opening it half dragged her down the corridor to azuras private apartments entering he pushed india to the floor and put a firm foot upon her this slave girl he told the startled azura is unmanageable my lady keep her with you tonight and then tomorrow baba hassan will come and prepare her to serve me as my body slave i should give her to my janissaries but i am too softhearted and you know well the reason why but she will service me in some capacity if my bed is not to her liking then there are other ways she may be useful lifting his leg he pushed the shaken girl toward the harem mistress and then turning about departed india crouched upon the tile floor trembling what happened azura demanded struggling to keep the anger from her voice was this silly little virgin going to spoil all their plans with her stubborn nature i will not let her do this azura thought angrily she roughly pulled india to her feet i refused him came the expected answer from the palefaced girl i told him he would have to ravish me but i would not yield myself willingly and i will not azura shook her head despairingly do you know what might have happened to you she cried have you any idea how fortunate you are that he has shown you mercy this is a fair man but he is not an easy man he might have killed you where you stood and it was his right for you are only a slave now india oh i dont know what will happen to you allah we must convince him to forgive your outrageous behavior and accept you back in his bed i will not be a whore indias voice broke and in spite of herself she began to cry the dey had terrified her first with his talk of the janissaries and then when he had dragged her down the hallway she had thought surely he was going to carry out his threat i want to go home she sobbed you are home azura snapped unless of course you continue in your foolish behavior allah only knows where you will end up then perhaps in some sheikehs tent out on the desert where your fair skin will be burned leathery as you squat over a campfire cooking your masters supper of couscous and goat then relenting her harshness she put her arms about the girl to comfort her wont the dey just ransom me now india sniffled no my child i have spoken the truth to you when i told you that there is no hope of a ransom for you you must accept your fate now what is so terrible about becoming the beloved of caynan reis he is handsome and yet young if you would give him a child your position in his household would be assured particularly if that child was a son would this not have been your fate in your own england india to marry and have children you want me to marry the dey india was astounded he will take you for his wife if you give him a child azura half lied that is the way of this world but i am a christian and he is an infidel india pointed out he follows the teachings of islam my child azura said mamas father her real father not broccairn was a muslim india considered thoughtfully we all worship the same god azura told her in practical tones what difference does it make how we worship india was thoughtful and then she asked what will happen to me now my lady what did the dey mean when he said i was to serve him as his body slave i do not understand you will be at your masters beck and call around the clock my child and you will serve him in all ways except in his bed azura explained you will have no place in the harem but where will i sleep india cried wherever the dey tells you you may sleep she replied do not be afraid india it is a mild punishment he gave you for the affront to his pride perhaps it is better you will learn to know him she smiled encouragingly at the girl you may sleep here with me tonight upon the divan then in the morning baba hassan will explain your duties to you she patted indias hand gently lie down now my child you look absolutely exhausted and i can see you are near collapse it was barely dawn when baba hassan came to awaken india both his look and his tone were disapproving get up girl your master must be awakened and bathed india scrambled to her feet casting a desperate look at azura but the mistress of the harem ignored her come along the head eunuch said and india quickly followed him now after you have awakened the dey girl you will escort him to the baths to bathe and dress him and then you will fetch his breakfast i will help you this morning but after today you must know your duties without me and carry them out baba hassan pushed open the door to the deys suite calling as he did in a low but clear voice awaken my lord dey the dawn is breaking and you have a full schedule he pulled the naked girl from the deys side return to the harem layla then he looked at india gently touch him girl and bid him awake gingerly she reached out and brushed his shoulder with her fingers awaken my lord she half whispered caynan reis rolled over looking up at her she isnt garbed properly he noted to baba hassan she must bathe you my lord she will be given her new garments after she has completed her first duties the eunuch answered his master the dey arose let us begin then indias eyes widened with surprise and shock the dey was stark naked she didnt know where to look and what made it worse was the slight smile upon his lips that mocked her first that overripe little creature in his bed was she going to be expected to rouse those women every day now his nakedness when he certainly knew that she had never seen a naked man in her entire life her cheeks burned with her embarrassment the dey has his own private bath baba hassan informed her he moved across the chamber through another arched door saying as he went remove your kaftan girl you cannot bathe your master dressed your garment would be ruined with the water and the steam they were in the baths anteroom and the eunuch swiftly whisked the kaftan over her head handing it to a waiting slave there was no time to protest or even feel shy india swallowed hard not daring to look at caynan reiss handsome face for she knew instinctively that he would be silently taunting her and she would want to smack his face she had already learned that attacks on the dey would not be tolerated she was amazed that her back was free of soreness after the five strokes he had meted out to her yesterday the first thing you must do the eunuch began and then he went on to instruct india in the proper method of bathing a man wield the scraper yourself baba hassan the dey instructed the eunuch i am loath to allow a pointed object in her hand quite yet india rinsed caynan reis using a silver basin after he had been scraped free of sweat and dirt very good the eunuch approved now continue on as i have instructed you and when the master is soaking in the heated pool wash yourself for it is the only time you will have to do so each day then bring our lord to the masseuse and i will give you your new clothes baba hassan hurried off leaving india alone with the dey caynan reis sat down upon a marble bench nodding at india to begin the ablutions first she washed his dark hair and when she had rinsed it thoroughly she toweled it free of water then kneeling she washed his feet and lower legs he stood and india washed his upper legs his chest his belly hurrying behind him to wash his back shoulders buttock and the back of his legs then she rinsed him thoroughly he had the most beautiful body she thought wondering as she did if it were proper for a woman to see a man naked and admire his form he seemed to be in perfect proportion lean and hard i am finished my lord she said softly i think not he told her you have not yet washed my manhood india remember you are now my body slave and it is your duty to bathe all of me my manhood is an important part of me could you not bathe it yourself she ventured my god he couldnt really want her to wash him there take your cloth kneel down and do your duty india he said in a nottobearguedwith voice india gritted her teeth iam not going to allow him to bully me she thought kneeling down before him god it was staring her in the face were they all so big and what was that hanging beneath and behind it she dipped the cloth into the alabaster jar of thick soap be gentle he warned her it is tender and needs a delicate touch you do not want to injure so fine an instrument as this im certain there are better in the world she retorted the words out of her mouth before she realized it to her relief he laughed possibly he agreed but you must trust me my little virgin when i tell you my manhood is a weapon to be reckoned with and i have had no complaints from my women india washed him and rinsed the potent flesh with warm water your women would not dare complain my lord they might be banished from the comfortable idleness of your harem if they did now i believe you are ready for the bathing pool turning away from him she let the dey make his own way into the warm perfumed water quickly washing herself while he relaxed when she had finished he beckoned her join me he said his look daring her india glided down the steps into the water sighing softly at the luxury of it and positioning herself opposite him she said nothing you have the lushest mouth he told her have you ever been kissed she nodded in the affirmative his eyes were so blue by your lover the english milord he was not my lover my lord we were to marry who else kissed you in an amorous manner he demanded no one my lord i am not some lightskirt india replied he moved quickly through the water standing before her and his lips lightly brushed hers did your milord ever touch you once she whispered it was really most disconcerting standing here in the warm pool her body just touching his he touched my breasts once the admission colored her cheeks like this he cupped one of her breasts his fingers lightly brushing her nipples indias eyes closed briefly aye and you liked it he said softly please my lord india said then pushing him away for his nearness was most distressing she exited the pool the masseuse awaits my lord please come and let me dry you in the end he told her you will yield to me india but i will be patient with you for i believe you are a prize worth having then he left the bathing room and she followed slowly confused baba hassan was awaiting her i have the garment you are to wear in your capacity as the deys body servant he handed her a pair of while silk pantaloons with wide bands of gold and silver embroidery at the ankles and about the hips the pantaloons rode low on her body baring her navel the eunuch now stood before her a small pot and a brush in his hands dipping the brush into the pot he painted each of her nipples carmine red when he had finished he said you are ready girl go now and help your master dress for the day surely there is another garment for me to wear she gasped looking down at her bright red nipples this is the costume of a female body slave the eunuch answered then his brown forehead wrinkled what am i thinking he cried out and drew from a pocket a beautiful narrow gold collar bejeweled with all manner of gems diamonds rubies emeralds pearls sapphires he fastened it carefully about her throat it is not too tight wordlessly india shook her head shocked then go and attend the dey girl when he is dressed and you have escorted him back into his apartment i shall show you the way to the kitchens now go and stand by your master until the masseuse is finished with her duties caynan reis was lying upon a pad that had been set on the masseuses marble bench he was on his stomach his head turned to one side a small sturdily built woman of indeterminate age massaging his buttocks with strong fingers he opened his eyes and looked lazily at her remain where i can see you he said closing his eyes again india stood stockstill her mind awhirl she could scarcely believe what had happened to her she was an english noblewoman not some slave and yet at this moment in time she was a slave girl she was not the first woman in her family to find herself in such a position her grandmother her greatgrandmother greataunt valentina even her stepfathers mother had all at one time in their existences been enslaved as she was now enslaved but they had escaped their captivity and india intended that she would escape too there was only one difference between india and her female relations the others had not been virgins at the time of their captivity they had all been married or widowed indias golden eyes strayed to the deys long form the masseuse was now busily kneading his right leg it was a shapely leg she thought nicely formed the thigh well muscled the calf prettily rounded the foot at the end of the leg below the narrow ankle was lengthy and slender the masseuses hands worked the deys big foot her thick thumbs pressing up and down the arch massaging the ball of the foot pulling each toe slowly and carefully india watched fascinated her eyes following the masseuses every move unaware that caynan reis was watching her through the slits in his darkblue eyes when the masseuse had finally finished her task she spoke softly to the dey and bowing withdrew help me up he said to india and when she had aided him to roll over and sit he casually put his long legs over the table and stood my clothing for the day is in the cedar cabinet there he told her from now on it will be your duty to see that fresh clothing is there for me every morning and every evening baba hassan will tell you my schedule and if the clothes i need will be for an ordinary day or for an occasion you cannot sleep as late as you did in the morning india in future you must be up long before i am to make your preparations do you understand i am not a fool my lord i understand quite well she replied sharply he caught her by the wrist saying in a hard voice if there had been anyone else in the room now when you spoke to me as you did i should have had to have you beaten again india when you address me your voice must be dulcet and amenable as befits a dutiful female slave you offended me greatly last night but i was not unkind i realized you were frightened finding yourself in what must seem difficult circumstances to an english dukes daughter you are being given a second chance as my body slave but i will tolerate neither disobedience nor a sharp tongue from you if you displease me further i will give you to my guards to tame india opened her mouth to berate him but remembering her cousins warning to her said instead yes my lord i apologize if you serve me well you will find i am not a hard man he told her but i am master of el sinut and it is not an easy task should i show the slightest weakness even within the privacy of my household i should be challenged i would not serve my master the sultan well if i allowed the slightest discord within this vassal state of his do you understand india i am the dey not some foolish courtier strangely his words made sense to her yes my lord i do understand she told him then going to the cedar cabinet she opened it and viewed the garments he would wear today the white silk shirt was embroidered in gold thread along the neckline the cuffs of its full sleeves had wide bands that were bejeweled she brought the shirt to him slipping it over his head so that it slid over his broad shoulders and chest there were no laces and the shirt was open to midchest india now brought him the white silk pantaloons i can find no drawers she said nervously i dont wear any he said softly she flushed uncertain what to do next you must help me on with the pantaloons he told her lifting one foot so she could slide the garment over it india ground her teeth together to prevent the pithy comment forming in her mind kneeling she pulled the pantaloons over first one foot and then the other as she stood up again she drew the silk up his long legs over his slim hips finally covering his manhood which had seemed to grow larger beneath her gaze from her sight she pulled the drawstring of the pantaloons together making a bow and tucking it within the garment her hand brushing against his flat belly as she did so again she flushed but said in an even voice there are two sashes set out my lord which one will you have today i shall wear the silver he told her i will show you how to wrap it about my waist and he demonstrated the method when she had handed him the item in question unwinding it he told her now you do it india and when she had and it was perfect he complimented her clever girl you watched carefully will you take the sleeveless coat lined in the clothofsilver then my lord it was a beautiful thing india thought the front of the coat embroidered in silver and gold thread and small sparkling aquamarines and deeper blue tourmalines sewn on it yes he said its so beautiful india remarked is this coat for an occasion my lord he shook his dark head nay india but today my audience chamber is open to the people of el sinut as it is one day each week they come and bring their disputes to me to mediate as i represent the sultan in istanbul it is important that i look a little majestic for them it does both the people and the sultan i serve honor india looked into the cabinet again bringing out embroidered silk slippers and a small silver turban decorated with a single waterblue aquamarine will you wear these now my lord she asked bring them with you he told her after i break my fast i shall finish dressing then he turned and she followed after him back to his apartment where baba hassan was waiting the brownskinned eunuch eyed the dey critically she has done well my lord he finally remarked yes the dey replied with a small smile she has we shall now go and fetch your meal my lord where will you eat inside or on the terrace it is still early and the terrace faces west the dey said i think i may eat there without fear of baking in our hot sun the eunuch gestured to india come along girl he said impatiently and she barely had time to set down the slippers and the turban before she had to race after him outside in the hallway india cried out to the eunuch please baba hassan if you go so quickly i shall not be able to find my way by myself later the eunuch said nothing but slowed his pace so she might be able to mark her passage alone tomorrow they entered the kitchens and he introduced india to abu whose domain it was so this is the girl abu said meaningfully looking her up and down you are a foolish creature he noted i have come for the deys meal india told him ignoring the remark will you help me or must i go back to him and say you would not india replied in a sweetly bland voice she looked directly at abu the master was too gentle with you girl abu said sourly it is not my place to criticize the dey india murmured you are bold to speak such words to me but i shall not repeat your discourtesy to the dey abu now what does he eat in the morning upon first arising i do not know the foods of this place grumbling beneath his onionscented breath abu showed india how to set up the tray she would carry to the dey he enjoys a slice of ripe melon abu said cutting a piece and placing it on a blueandwhite porcelain dish yogurt he ladled a silky white substance from a stone crock into a bowl that matched the dish bread he placed a small round flat loaf on a silver plate honey he put half a comb on another blueandwhite dish and coffee which the coffee maker will come and make for him unless he requests something else this is what he eats each morning if there is no melon available i will give you other fruit for him for the dey enjoys fruit very much thank you india said picking up the tray and looking to the eunuch let us see if you were paying attention baba hassan said lead me back to our masters apartment he was pleased when she was successful and told her so i will go with you later however to make certain you remember for tomorrow you must go alone they entered the deys apartment and went through to the small tiled terrace that opened onto the garden india set the tray before the dey who was seated at a small table a wizened little man came bearing a brazier a small pot a blueandwhite cup and saucer and other items he squatted near the dey emptying some darkcolored beans into a strange vessel which india quickly discovered was a grinder grinding the beans he heated water upon the brazier and added it to the beans which were now in the pot which the dey told india was for brewing the coffee caynan reis ate his meal and when he had finished the old coffee maker brought him the aromatic turkish coffee which had already been heavily sweetened to almost syrupy consistency he sipped it clear the table girl baba hassan whispered to her you may have what i have not eaten the dey said and then he ignored her enjoying his coffee eat baba hassan advised her unless he tells you otherwise his leavings are all you will get girl anger welled up in india but she quickly swallowed it back she was not going to allow her pride to overwhelm her good sense there was still some orange on the melon rind she nibbled at it finding it sweet and quite delicious the silver spoon remained within the bowl of the yogurt abu had called it what is it she asked the eunuch milk that has been allowed to go sour and congeal he said india put the spoon in her mouth it was tart she decided wrinkling her nose but it wasnt unpleasant she finished the bowl he had left a third of the round loaf india quickly stuffed it in her mouth for she could see the dey was almost finished with his coffee the eunuch handed his master a wet towel to wipe his hands and face with and then gave it to india put it on the tray he said as she wiped her own hands and face a maid servant will take the tray you must now follow the dey as he goes about his business but first put on his slippers and turban the dey sat and india was forced to kneel as she fitted his silver brocade slippers onto his feet rising she took the turban from baba hassan and placed it upon his dark head now step back from your master and bow the eunuch said this indicates to him that you have finished and he is ready india did as he bid her wondering why once his feet were shod and the small turban on his head the dey couldnt figure that all out for himself she wisely held her tongue following caynan reis from his apartments in the company of the head eunuch she was suddenly aware once again that her upper body was unclothed and her bosom visible to anyone who would but look it was really quite intolerable but she believed if she gave any more difficulty at this time she would find herself in worse difficulties than she already was she was alive and there was always the possibility of eventual escape they entered the audience hall through a small side door aruj agha approached the dey and with him was tom southwood now in turkish garb toms eyes flicked over his cousin shocked then he quickly looked away how she longed to speak to him but she knew she dared not baba hassan led her to the dais handing her a longhandled fan of peacock feathers the handle was carved ivory and the feathers were set in a holder of filigreed gold you will stand here the eunuch told her and slowly fan the dey while the audience is in session you may stop occasionally to rest for the day will be hot but do not allow our master to grow overheated girl or i will whip you myself do you understand india nodded why were they always asking her if she understood or not she was certainly not feebleminded she tilted her head to see if she could hear what aruj agha was saying to the dey we will be sailing tomorrow my lord the janissary told him the young milord caynan reis asked quite shocked to find himself shackled to an oar my lord but otherwise unharmed came the reply see that he remains unharmed if his manners can be improved i will consider redeeming him to his family eventually it seems a shame to lose the ransom he looked at tom southwood you look the part he said dryly are you certain you can fulfill your duties i can my lord the englishman answered him i have taken the name of osman in honor of a dear and old friend of my grandmothers who lived in algiers many many years ago he was an astrologer aruj aghas mouth dropped open osman the astrologer the osman he turned to the dey my lord he was very famous and highly respected then he looked at tom southwood your grandmother really knew osman how it is a long tale my lord agha but i shall happily relate it to you on the long nights we are at sea then he said to the dey my lord caynan reis may i beg a small boon of you before we depart what is it navigator osman the dey replied my cousin tom southwood murmured still retains her virtue the dey said dryly i am of a mind to be patient with her and so she serves me as my body slave she is quite unharmed and will remain so if she continues to behave thank you my lord tom southwood bowed and then remained silent as the agha and the dey discussed the voyage to come the english captain glanced a final time at india she nodded her head just imperceptibly at him indicating that she had heard and was all right he looked quickly away from her and just in time for the agha was ready to leave the two men bowed once again to the dey and then departed the audience hall the dey settled himself upon his low throne and nodded to the head eunuch to order the doors opened india began to wave the fan over him the deys secretary a small fussy little man appeared and handed him a long scroll of parchment which was filled with a great deal of writing none of which she could read the doorkeepers flung open the doors and the hall was suddenly filled with a multitude of people none of whom were to indias great relief interested in ogling her carminetipped bared nipples caynan reis handed his secretary the scroll and said begin the divorced woman fatima and the merchant ali akbar the deys secretary said and when the two stood before the dey his secretary told them first the woman may speak and then ali akbar the woman bowed politely she was neatly but poorly dressed and far past the flush of her youth my lord i have come to you for justice some thirty years ago when i was fourteen i became ali akbars first wife i have given him three sons and a daughter in the ensuing years ali akbar took three more wives which as you know my lord is all the wives allowed under the laws of the prophet in order to take another woman to wife ali akbar has to discard one of us i am she he cast aside so he might wed with a thirteenyearold maid who he hopes will restore his lost virility i will be honest with you my lord i am not unhappy to be free of this man whatever love that was between us died years ago however ali akbar has refused to return to me my bridal portion which as you know my lord is mine under the laws of the prophet without it i am a beggar at the gates i have no home i must beseech strangers for my daily bread please help me my lord i throw myself upon your gracious mercy caynan reis looked at ali akbar is this true he asked the merchant squirmed beneath the dark gaze my lord he began nervously business has been poor of late and i have other more important obligations to meet fatima could go and live in her daughters house but she prefers to shame me by wandering the streets and importuning all who will listen with her litany of complaints against me have you returned your former wifes bridal portion the dey demanded sternly no my lord the merchant shifted uncomfortably return it this day the dey looked to the woman fatima do you know how much is owed you lady yes my lord she said softly you will tell my secretary he told her and you ali akbar will not argue the price the lady appears honest to me and in punishment for your greed i order you to purchase a house with a garden for the lady fatima and two slaves to serve her she will be permitted to choose the house and the slaves herself and you lady will cease your public complaints against this man in return my lord you will ruin me the merchant cried and he shook an angry fist at his former wife and the dey continued you will pay a fine to the sultans coffers of ten gold pieces and another ten to the chief mullah of el sinut in penance for your attempt at flouting the laws of the prophet while the law allows you to discard one wife for another it also makes provision to protect such a woman you broke your word when you refused to honor your betrothal agreement any further complaint from your mouth ali akbar will be met with severe punishment the merchant was at last cowed and bowed to the dey before turning abruptly and leaving the audience chamber the woman fatima however fell to her knees and kissed the deys slipper thank you my lord she said tears running down her worn face do not commit your husbands sin of greed when you seek your own shelter lady he warned her the sword of justice cuts both ways yes my lord she said scrambling to her feet and backing away from his presence india was absolutely fascinated for a few moments she had almost forgotten to ply her fan so the dey would not become overheated she had thought el sinut a place where women counted for little but if she understood it correctly women were protected under the laws of islam caynan reis had been kind firm and very fair in his handling of the matter of the woman fatima and the merchant ali akbar the other cases brought before caynan reis that day were not half as interesting but he judged them all with utmost equitableness it seemed to her in midafternoon the dey called a halt to the proceedings and dismissed the remaining people from the audience hall he had heard almost all of the cases on his secretarys scroll and would hear the others first the following week he arose removing his turban and handing it to india then he strode from the chamber almost flinging her fan at an attending slave india hurried after him i am hungry he told her go to the kitchens and fetch me something to eat india he said as they entered his apartment yes my lord she said putting the small turban upon a table is there anything in particular that you desire just food he told her i can find my way india told baba hassan and she ran out you will need help abu told her in a conciliatory tone when she told him that the dey desired food he eats his main meal now in midafternoon and then naps in the heat of the day i will send several kitchen slaves with you to carry the food what will you give him india asked curious he is not a heavy eater abu said i will send a roasted chicken a bowl of saffroned rice with raisins a dish of olives some sliced cucumbers in oil and bread and fruit as he spoke he piled the trays with the items he named signaling several little kitchen maids to take up the trays and handing india a decanter this is a lemon sherbet for the dey to slake his thirst you may carry it and the silver goblet the dey does not drink wine india asked wine is forbidden by the prophet although there are some in barbary who do not obey the prophet abu finished darkly india thanked the more cooperative cook and led her party of serving girls back to the deys apartment the sun being high now however this meal was taken indoors and when he had finished eating he again instructed india to eat from his leftovers when she had stripped him of his garments sponged him with rose water and helped him to his couch to rest this is ridiculous she thought to herself but silently followed caynan reiss orders when he lay apparently dozing she crept to the table and seating herself began to eat abu was not stingy with the food and she was quickly satisfied afterward she carried the trays one at a time back to the kitchen when she returned to the deys apartments at last baba hassan was awaiting her the dey will sleep until just before sunset girl he told her you are permitted to rest also now that your duties are completed where am i to sleep she asked him the chief eunuch went to a small cupboard and drew out a narrow mattress he proceeded to unroll this will be yours you are to place it outside of the deys bedchamber and sleep there unless he instructs you otherwise he will call you when he desiresyour service when he arises you will find a silk kaftan for him in the cedar cabinet he has no guests this evening she was to sleep on a mat outside caynan reiss bedchamber door it was absolutely ridiculous but at least she was comfortable india thought she was not chained to an oar seated upon a hard wooden bench on aruj aghas galley silently india spread the mat baba hassan had given her before the deys bedchamber door and lay down upon it soundlessly she wept this was what her pride had brought her to and if adrian died it would surely be all her fault india awoke hot and headachy rising she rolled up her sleeping mat and tucked it back in its cupboard then going to a carafe upon the table she poured herself a goblet of water it was warm but at least it relieved her thirst and her head began to ache less opening the door to the deys bedchamber she saw that he still slept lying quietly upon his aide his long form just slightly curved she left the door open to allow the air to circulate what breeze there was and walked out into the garden it was a walled enclosure in the center of which was a round tiled fountain with a bronze flower spray in its middle india sat upon the wide lip of the fountain for it was cooler there and the faint mist of the spray was very refreshing the small square tiles were sea blue interspersed with white and there were pale yellow water lilies in the fountain dipping her hand in the water she startled a fat goldfish and laughed softly as it skittered away the air about her was perfumed with flowers there were pink damask roses in bloom and other flowers she recognized hollyhocks in white cream yellow and purple stood tall with their figshaped leaves at the back of the beds which were edged with blue campanula there were scarlet martagon lilies in a halfshaded part of the garden the fourfoot stalks holding between eight and ten pendulous flowers orangered in color with their edges turned up like turks caps in a sunnier area there were yellow caucasian lilies sweetly scented and graceful there were small to mediumheight trees in great blueandwhite porcelain tubs with large trumpetshaped flowers of pink red and yellow with very prominent yellow stamens with red stigmas that she didnt recognize sniffing one she found they had no fragrance at all but they were very dramatic and beautiful flowers there was a greenery with thick leaves she didnt recognize and cedar trees standing tall and graceful she could hear bird song but could see no birds there were brightly colored butterflies and bumblebees wending their way amid the flowers for a brief moment she could almost imagine she was somewhere else anywhere else but el sinut she started as his hand fell upon her shoulder do you find my gardens pleasant india the dey asked her she jumped to her feet is it all right that i came into it my lord perhaps i should have asked you first her golden eyes were wide with her apprehension you are my body slave and the gardens are available to you as long as your duties are done india you do not have to be afraid of me because you came into the garden do you like it his hand moved away from her shoulder aye it is beautiful and so peaceful i almost forgot for a moment where i was my lord she said candidly he smiled faintly do you play chess he asked her aye i do she answered him then fetch me a fresh kaftan from the dressing cupboard india and we will play a game here in the garden i will get the board and the pieces do you play well none of the harem women play well i play very well she said and then must you always walk about naked my lord her cheeks were pink he chuckled in this heat it is more comfortable india but as i respect your modesty i have asked for a garment were you one of my harem women i should not bother nor would it matter to them does not the holy book say that man was created in gods image i somehow do not think of god as looking as you do my lord india told him pithily and then went to fetch his kaftan behind her he chuckled again the wench had spirit and was by far the most interesting female he had come across in years he knew his chief eunuch baba hassan and the lady azura had hopes that he would find a woman he liked enough to wed and have children by his harem women were kept infertile by means of a special sherbet made for exactly that purpose for he had made it very clear from the moment he became dey that he wanted no children who others might use against him in a powerful struggle for el sinut it was a volatile world in which he lived and ruled there were always plots swirling about particularly as the central government in istanbul had not been as strong in recent years as it had been in the past still he might take a wife eventually but not have children india had possibilities she was english as he was although at this point in time he had no intention of telling her that they communicated quite well in french and she was a noblemans daughter as he was a noblemans son if she was a trifle overproud she could be gently tamed much of her haughtiness stemmed from her youth and inexperience and he had not a doubt fear she was vulnerable and he could easily see how adrian had convinced her to elope with him although he knew she would probably never admit it probably she had already been having second thoughts in the matter and was not unhappy her english cousin the captain had found them out it saved her the embarrassment of admitting her error in judgment she would have gone home protesting but in her heart she would have been relieved the decision had been taken out of her hands if her family had disliked him before adrian and india eloped they would dislike him far more now that their daughter was a captive in barbary he chuckled a third time particularly if they learned she had gone from the frying pan directly into the flame india came running with his kaftan it was a comfortable cotton garment striped in deep blue and its own natural color the sleeves were wide and the neckline open to his navel without a word she flung it over his head yanking it down so quickly he barely had time to fit his arms through the armholes does my naked form disturb you so much india that you must cover it as fast as you can he teased her i am not used to such things she replied you have not the chessboard tell me where it is and i shall get it it is in the chest in my day room he told her smiling yes she has possibilities she was already learning to treat him with respect before others while being a bit more at ease with him in private she was so beautiful indeed dazzling with her creamy skin her dark curls and those fascinating golden eyes he had never in his life seen eyes like indias she would take time to woo and win although she would never realize he was wooing her she would come to him for only if she did could she be truly happy with her decision in having done so she would be acknowledging a parting from her former life when that day came and india was certainly not ready yet to do that she brought the board with its carved redandwhite marble pieces and they set it up on a low table upon the terrace seating themselves upon large pillows i to his pleasure she played extremely well almost beating him and when he said checkmate she frowned where did i make my mistake she wondered aloud and it was then he realized that she had indeed been playing to win it surprised him almost as much as it delighted him his harem women would have allowed him to win if indeed they could even play with him he showed her her error i wont do that again she promised him she took the second game and he the third the light was now almost gone from the garden and the night insects were beginning to hum their songs he had not enjoyed himself so much in years come he said rising and then pulling her to her feet are you hungry it is my habit to eat only bread and fruit in the evening i will fetch it she said and hurried off when she returned he invited her to eat with him in the cool garden when they had sated themselves with grapes melon and warmed flat bread baba hassan appeared i must instruct the girl in preparing your clothing for the morrow my lord he said take her the dey replied i am content with my company tomorrow the head eunuch said as he led her off the dey must meet with the chief engineer for the city the great aqueduct that brings fresh water into the town from the mountains is in need of repair his clothing can be simple baba hassan brought india into a large enclosed room about the chamber were silver bars that stretched from one wall to another and upon the bars were hung hundreds of garments these racks the eunuch said waving his hand are his more elaborate garments the others have the simpler robes bending he flung open a brassbound cedar trunk you will find his pantaloons sashes and shirts in these trunks the slippers are on the shelves here the deys jewelry is kept in a large case in his bedchamber his taste is simple you will find how are these things kept clean and fresh india asked this climate is so warm he must certainly need to change his garments each day baba hassan am i expected to do his laundry let me warn you i have absolutely no experience in such matters the head eunuch chortled no girl we have laundresses aplenty he pointed to a large reed basket bring the deys used garments here each evening when you come to choose the clothing you will put in the cedar cabinet for the following day this basket is for the discards a servant will bring them to the laundresses to wash now here is the cabinet in which you will place his fresh garments girl it opens on two sides and on the other side you will find the dressing room in the baths each evening before you go to bed choose the proper clothing for the morrow i will inform you what sort of garments will be needed now let us begin what would you choose tomorrow for the dey indias careful choices pleased baba hassan the chief engineer of el sinut while a valuable civil servant was not of great importance the dey will not need a turban but where are they kept she inquired he showed her and then said you are content to serve the dey in this capacity rather than as one of his harem women i am not content to be here at all india replied honestly but as i am i prefer being his body servant to being his whore i only wish it were not necessary for me to be so unclothed clothing confers status the eunuch answered her you have no status except that which your master gives you girl what language do you speak here india asked him i have an ear for languages as do most of my female relations i would learn the language of this land will you teach me baba hassan her request surprised him we speak the arabic tongue he told her if the dey gives his permission for you to learn our language then the lady azura will teach you i will inquire tomorrow for now we will return to the deys apartments the final thing i must teach you is how to prepare the love cloths our master is a virile man and requires female companionship every night i know how to prepare love cloths she said surprising him once again but you are a virgin he said astounded i am she confirmed but my mother was the daughter of the grande mughal akbar she was raised in india and when she came to england she brought her servants with her when i began my monthly flow of blood rohana one of mamas women with my mothers permission taught me how to prepare love cloths mama always said that nothing spoiled a mans pleasure more than the unseemly evidence of previous pleasure the eunuch nodded your mother was correct girl and now i understand why your eyes are almond shaped your mughal blood shows they had reached the deys apartments again and leaving her at the door baba hassan said since you know what to do do it girl india reentered the deys chambers in one of the wall cupboards she found a silver ewer she filled it with water which she perfumed with rose oil next to the basin was a stack of neatly folded linen cloths taking a dozen she brought them with the basin into the deys bedchamber and set them by the bed going back out into the garden she found caynan reis observing the moon i have i believe completed my duties for the day my lord is there anything i can do for you before i retire to my pallet go to the harem and bring back the woman nila he told her she is a blonde actually the fairest hair of them all and most voluptuous of form i wish her company tonight he looked directly at india his dark eyes unfathomable i am to fetch your whores for you india was outraged you have the choice of fetching them to me or taking their place he said coldly and do not call them whores india they are perfectly respectable harem women and honored within my house do not pass judgment upon that which you do ndt understand this is not your england it is el sinut when you have brought nila to me you may spread your pallet outside my bedchamber door in case i have need of you in the night you will not hear me if you are further away turning on her heel india ran from the room this was the final humiliation she thought first she was forced to walk about half naked all day the nipples on her breasts painted carmine to draw attention to them except no one was supposed to look she had waited on this arrogant dey hand and foot bathed him fetched his food laid out his clothing dressed him and now she was expected to bring his whores to him it was intolerable but if she didnt do it who knew what he would do to her he was such a complex man kind and fair to those whom he judged yet thoughtless and cruel when he sent poor adrian to the galleys she didnt understand this man but she had quickly learned that he would brook no disobedience finding her way to the harem she entered looking about at the women there they ignored her for she was not as important as they were being only the deys body slave there were seven women from whom she might choose and four of them were blond and voluptuous then azura was at her side murmuring softly which one does he desire nila india answered in a low voice she is the one with the breasts like two soft pillows azura told india the blonde with the longest hair is mirmah laylu wears her hair always in a thick plait and the last blonde is deva the redhead is sarai the tall brunette is samara the petite brunette is leah have you enjoyed your day india laughed it has been interesting and informative she told the mistress of the harem come and see me when you have the time azura said now go and fetch the chosen one india walked across the main chamber of the harem stopping before nila the dey desires your presence you are to follow me she said in neutral tones then she turned and departed the harem assuming nila would follow the deys concubine scrambled to her feet and with a smug look at her companions hurried after india do not walk so quickly nila complained my legs are not as long and gawky as yours are i am delicate and fineboned india said nothing but she did slightly increase her speed delicate and fineboned the girl was a peasant i shall tell the dey of your rudeness nila cried india stopped and turned about and i shall tell him i overheard you disparaging his manhood when i entered the harem she told the lush blonde naturally i was shocked what did she mean you have the prick of a worm my lord you would not dare nilas blue eyes were wide with fear do not find yourself on my bad side nila india warned her and then she continued on her way leading the blonde into the deys apartments im certain you know the way from here she said sweetly nila almost ran past the english girl and india overheard her trilling as she entered caynan reiss bedchamber ohhh my lord i have come as quickly as i could india fetch a carafe of sherbet she heard the dey call why is there none already here hurry she slammed from the apartment and ran through the cool halls to the kitchen it was empty but there upon a silver tray was a carafe of fruit sherbet and two small goblets picking them up india hurried back and slowly entered the bedchamber the dey and his companion were both naked now nila sat between her masters spread legs and as he fondled one of her large breasts she slowly and sensuously sucked the fingers of his other hand her eyes half closed her face a mask of open desire india stopped not certain where to put the tray nila finished drawing upon the deys fingers taking his hand and bringing it down to her venus mound the fingers seemed to have a life of their own stroking her as she began to squirm beneath his attentions the deys eyes met indias he could see the confusion and the surprise upon her beautiful face she tried to look away but could not do so and she flushed with her shame put the tray by the bed and then find your pallet he finally said taking pity on her the hard voice seemed to rouse her from her stupor and she tripped over her own feet to do his bidding almost running from the bedchamber to escape the disturbing yet exciting scene she had just witnessed her heart was hammering wildly her legs felt weak pulling her pallet from the cupboard she saw a neck roll and drew it forth too she spread her bedding before the deys bedchamber door and lay down but when she closed her eyes she saw again the dey with his paramour her eyes flew open why was she so disturbed she wondered the dey was not hurting nila and indeed she was encouraging his attentions surely there was nothing wrong if the dey and nila were content she closed her eyes again and dozed only to be awakened by the sound of a woman moaning deeply india crept closer to the door and put her ear against it ohhhhh ohhhhhhh ohhhhhh my lord do not stop i am in paradise oh oh yessssss nilas voice cried indias eyes were wide with shock and then she heard the dey groaning but the sound was one of pleasure im not going to stop you insatiable little bitch he said im going to keep on until you are finally satisfied ohhhhh ohhhhhh yes yes yes nila half sobbed india curled herself into a ball her hands over her ears she might be a virgin but the audible sounds of lovemaking were obvious for some reason it disturbed her greatly and the earlier image of the dey and nila caressing entered her mind again oh god what is happening to me she wondered she tried to picture adrian leigh with her in such a manner but she could not to her deep distress she found herself taking nilas place in her minds eye it was too horrible to even contemplate she did not know this man how could she imagine such intimacy with a man she didnt really know it was wanton the days that followed took on a familiar pattern that mirrored the first day she had begun her service to caynan reis and yet each day was different in its way she particularly enjoyed the mornings when he would hold public audiences or when officials or visitors would come to speak with the dey only the europeans and the jews seeking the deys favor found it difficult not to stare at her naked breasts with their bright red nipples oddly she began to find humor in the situation the afternoons were hot and long and very dull the dey gave permission for azura to teach india arabic it was very difficult having a different alphabet she needed to learn but it was a challenge and india always enjoyed a challenge one afternoon several months after she had come to el sinut they finished their lessons and azura ordered a cooling sherbet brought with a plate of honey cakes you are doing very well she praised india it took caynan reis much longer to master what you have mastered in just these past four months you have a knack for languages my child who is he azura caynan reis i mean how did a foreigner rise so high in the sultans service he was a captive very much like your own cousin who now sails with aruj agha he spent almost two years in the galleys and then one day while his ship was anchored in the harbor my lord sharif el mohammed was rowed out to it to see its captain on some small matter of business between them caynan had by that time proved his worth to the vessels captain and was no longer chained to an oar instead he served the captain as his steward their business over sharif el mohammed left the ship but as he was getting into his own barge he fell into the sea he could not swim and indeed he was weighed down by his garments caynan leapt over the side into the water and saved the dey sharif el mohammed in gratitude my own dear lord sharif freed caynan and invited him into his service they became fast friends and as my lord sharif began to sicken caynan reis took over more and more of his responsibilities my lord wrote to istanbul telling the sultan that he was dying and asking that caynan reis succeed him the sultan agreed my lord died shortly thereafter but he was content knowing el sinut was in safe hands there were tears in azuras bright blue eyes india reached out instinctively to comfort the woman do not weep my lady she said azura laughed weakly it has been a long time since the mention of sharif el mohammeds name could render me weepy she said he asked caynan reis to allow me to remain in the only home i had known since my capture caynan reis is like a son to me he has been gracious and very kind tell me my child are you learning to like him india nodded aye but not all the time sometimes he can be cruel my lady although i think he does not mean it you are wise to see that azura said i do not know what happened to him in his homeland that caused him to leave it but it hardened his heart i fear it will take a very special woman to melt the ice that encases his soul perhaps you are that woman you cannot spend the rest of your days as his body slave there is so much more you can have if you will but ask my child i do not know if i am ready yet my lady india admitted surely you do not think you can be returned to your own land india trust me my child it will not happen your life is here now she thought about azuras words as she lay tossing upon her pallet that night attempting to block the cries of the deys companion from her consciousness why did these women all howl so each night when he made love to them and why did he call out as well it was a mystery and not one she was likely to solve unless she would yield herself to caynan reis could she was azura correct would she never return to england again and what if the harem mistress was right did she want to live like this forever she knew his body well enough india thought and the sight of it no longer troubled her or frightened her she knew her own body equally as well now the trouble was she wasnt quite certain what they were supposed to do with their bodies once they were past the caressing and the kissing she had seen between the dey and his women she remembered once asking her mother about what transpired between a man and a woman jasmine had grown thoughtful and then she had told her eldest daughter that all would be revealed before she married but it wasnt really seemly that india have such knowledge before then it might encourage her to experiment and girls should not experiment with passion before marriage it was not wise or safe and besides here jasmine had laughed it was better that a man believed he was fully in charge of lovemaking at least at first but if his bride knew everything then it would spoil it for him india wondered if azura would enlighten her and believed she would she would ask her tomorrow azura she knew would be very pleased that india was finally showing an interest in the carnal side of her nature ahhhhh my lord it is too sweet came the cry from the deys bedchamber oh be silent you silly creature india muttered to herself ivow she thought silently that i shall never carry on like those silly women do each night i think they do it just to please him and for no other reason nothing could be that wonderful or could it and would she be daring enough to soon find out what if he decided he was no longer interested in her india wondered nervously no of late she had caught him sending glances her way when he thought she wasnt looking and when she caught him at it he had smiled knowingly did he suspect her interest gods boots how embarrassing she finally fell asleep awakening just at dawn as she had accustomed herself to do rising she stored her pallet and neck roll in the cupboard then opening the deys bedchamber door she crept silently into the room going to the bed and poking at the naked girl curled up next to caynan reis samara she whispered to the longlegged brunette samara it is time to get up go back to the harem ummmm samara murmured sleepily turning onto her back and opening her eyes if i remain perhaps he will want me again india pulled the girl by her arm get up she snapped you know baba hassans rule and if you do not go back to the harem this minute i shall go and fetch him you will be punished samara scrambled to her feet she was every bit as tall as india you are just jealous because the dey does not find you desirable she said meanly you are the lowest of the low a body slave india pushed the naked girl from the room shoving her kaftan into her hands you are mistaken you overblown damascus rose it is i who do not find the dey desirable i think it will be a long time until you enter his bed again samara she smiled sweetly you see i have my masters complete trust now and it is i who choose his nightly companion i do not think i will choose you for a long time samaras lush mouth fell open in shock you lie she said disbelievingly you lie india laughed go back to the harem and await your masters next invitation you will be old and fat before it comes she thrust samara out into the corridor and pulled the doors shut on her nasty cow she muttered to herself id sleep with him myself before id let you go back into his bed again would you india the dey stood in his bedchamber door would i what my lord she asked innocently he laughed you have a wicked tongue india and you bully my women shamelessly are you jealous of them my lord i may now find myself your slave but i am a dukes daughter your women are of a lower class and if i did not keep them in line they would be impossible to tolerate she pointedly ignored his question come now my lord dey it is time for your bath yes my lady he teased following her into the baths she scrubbed him with great vigor until he finally protested do not be such a bairn she told him go and soak in the bathing pool he stood in the warm perfumed water up to his neck watching her as she performed her own ablutions he had not approached her since that first morning when she had been learning her duties now he considered he might attempt her again and see her reaction he watched her through halfclosed eyes as she rinsed herself with several basins of water finally putting the silver ewer upon its shelf then she stepped down into the pool positioning herself opposite him as she always did you have no visitors today my lord she said i must go over the engineers plans for the aqueduct repairs he told her i wonder if i should not simply have a new aqueduct built for the town rather than repair the old one which dates to roman times why not repair the old one just enough to continue its use while you are having a new aqueduct built my lord india suggested that way el sinut is guaranteed a continuous supply of fresh water if the original aqueduct is as old as you say it could give out at any time losing it would be a disaster for the city some would say it has stood this long why go to the expense of building a new one he told her in the matter of peoples welfare my lord no government should be penny wise and pound foolish india replied is not your treasury full if it is the governments gold why hoard it for what other purpose have you collected taxes and tribute if not to make your peoples lives comfortable and safe from what you have told me these past few months and from what i have overheard the valide does not want any kind of strife to unsettle her young sons reign she would have his life peaceful until he comes of age to rule by himself if el sinut lost its water supply the people would turn against the government and what could istanbul do to help being so far away their solution would be to send troops to put down the revolt then they would leave and the problem would still remain it is better that you attend to the matter of the aqueduct my lord dey and avoid any civil discord india concluded your advice is sound he replied thinking as he spoke that her intellect was far above that of any woman he had ever known she had obviously been thinking about the problem for some time now and she had reasoned well the arguments for and against her conclusions she gave him a genuine smile come my lord dey she said as she moved up the steps from the pool you cannot remain here all day she held out a large towel for him the masseuse awaits you she wrapped him in a towel and began to dry him caynan reis chuckled to himself he had wanted to attempt a seduction this morning but she had so fascinated him with her speech regarding the aqueduct that he had completely forgotten she must come to you the voice in his head told him he had his massage she dressed him and brought him his morning meal then he closeted himself in his library giving her his permission to do as she chose until it was time for his main meal the day was overwarm for winter as he went over the plans brought to him by the citys chief engineer he could see the wisdom in her words he sent for the author of the plans and brought up the possibility of building a new aqueduct to replace the old it would be the better strategy my lord the engineer told him we could indeed do minor repairs on the old system that would hold for several years a new aqueduct would take us three years to build you see we cannot be certain of the damage and wear to the interior of the aqueduct but a new one would assure us of a supply of fresh water for the next several centuries my lord the cost the dey demanded not a great deal more than to do serious repairs on the old aqueduct my lord which might need more repairs in the future then we will build a new aqueduct the dey decided handing the plans back to the chief engineer start immediately returning to his apartments the dey found his midday meal already set out for him his head ached and the air was unusually heavy for july still his appetite was not affected when he had finished he arose saying to her i think it will rain shall i prepare you for your nap my lord she asked softly he nodded allah his desire for her was suddenly eating at him she removed his garments and sponged him with rose water he said nothing but his darkblue eyes searched her face for some sign that she was weakening toward him india carefully kept her eyes averted from his if she looked at him she would be lost she feared she didnt understand the emotions now swirling about inside her are you well my lord she asked him seeing his agitation my head aches india he told her sit down my lord and let me rub it for you she suggested nay he said thinking if she touched him again he would explode i will rest and it will ease itself he told her go and have your lesson with azura no india said azura says i have advanced far more than any of her other students in so short a time i will remain here my lord so that if you need me i may serve you come and lie with me he said softly she shook her head in the negative just lie by my side india i promise you that nothing will transpire between us your presence would comfort me caynan reis said i have not eaten india said softly and i must then return the trays to the kitchen or poor old abu will be most distressed my lord when you have finished he said then come to me are you commanding me my lord india asked him nay he replied and closed his eyes india slipped from the bedchamber and ate her meal then she carried the trays back to abu returning to the deys apartments she warred with herself for several long minutes and then entering his bedchamber she lay down by his side he did not move and she was not certain if he was asleep or awake it had begun to rain and the sound of the droplets hitting the gravel path and the flora out in the garden was very soothing her eyelids grew heavy and she was soon sleeping caynan reis took a deep breath and put an arm about the slumbering girl she gave a small sigh and curled herself against him he could scarcely contain himself she had come to him of her own accord he let his eyes scan her face she was dazzlingly beautiful and she was almost his he longed to kiss those full lush lips of hers to taste the innocent sweetness of her he balled his hands into fists to prevent himself from touching her further and frightening her away he knew that other men would consider his attitude toward india ridiculous if a woman belonged to a man and he desired her body she gave it or he took it yet from the beginning he had not been able to force her suddenly he realized that he wanted india to want him for himself and not because he was the dey of el sinut the women in his harem were lovely and most amenable but india was correct when she said that they feared him they did in their world he held the power of life and death over them they sought to please him because everything they were or possessed was because of caynan reis the dey of el sinut while he believed he had tamed indias proud manner a trifle he had not broken her spirit she spoke her mind to him and did not mouth inanities at him he realized now that he needed more than just willing bodies to pleasure him he needed a woman who would be his companion his lover and who would tell him the truth he needed india it was as simple as that but now he had to convince her of it he couldnt be certain if it would be easy or difficult of late he had seen her looking at him with a questioning look in her marvelous eyes what was she thinking could she ever really love him given the way in which she had come to him had they been in england instead of el sinut would she have even considered him as a husband she was seventeen which was old for a virgin and she had not chosen a husband nor had her family chosen one for her he wondered why one day he would ask her he thought his head was still aching though less so when he finally fell into a deep sleep but when he awoke his mind was clear the rain had stopped and india was gone from his side had it all been a dream india he called out to her yes my lord she stood in the open bedchamber door my headache has left me he said feeling foolish he had been like a child for a moment fearful that she was gone from him i am glad my lord she answered him he arose and she slipped a kaftan over him who shall i choose to share my bed tonight india he asked her who shall i choose for a very long moment she was silent and she pierced him with a look the meaning of which he could not fathom then she said in a low voice it is not seemly my lord that i choose for you i know you heard my foolish boast this morning to samara but it was only to keep the absurd creature in her place who shall i choose india he repeated the question he stood directly before her his hands now resting lightly on her shoulders i am losing my reason she thought i cannot india choose me my lord she finally said choose me he was not entirely certain that he had heard her aright reaching out he cupped her face between his two hands and looked directly into those marvelous eyes of hers india choose me my lord she repeated once again in a soft voice you are certain his heart was hammering and he felt almost weak in his longing for her this was not simply desire he realized in a blinding burst of cognition this was love i am certain she replied but oh my lord please be patient with me you know i am neither incompetent nor witless but i know very little about passion her cheeks flushed with her words caynan reis bent his dark head and touched her lips with his it was a slow kiss delicate and filled with promise when he finally removed his lips from hers indias hand went instinctively to her mouth her fingers touching the flesh wonderingly she hadnt known quite what to expect but certainly not this tenderness there was something far more to the kiss than she understood and seeing the confusion in her eyes he knew for an absolute certainty her innocence i will teach you passion india he told her his hands leaving her face his strong arms enfolding her in a warm embrace her cheek lay against his chest she could feel the beating of his heart beneath the fabric of his kaftan she trembled and then angry with herself for what she felt was an unpardonable show of weakness pulled away from him gently he drew her back enfolding her once more his hand sleeked down her dark curls soothingly passion is always confusing in the beginning afterward it is merely surprising he told her i feel foolish she admitted do not my thorny little virgin he teased her lovingly i have never had a virgin in my bed and i find the prospect an unusual aphrodisiac what should i do india asked him another night i will begin to teach you the things that please me and azura will instruct you as well my precious tonight however i would simply initiate you into the delights of love oh he felt her stiffen and realizing how nervous she must be he said to her now india go and fetch our evening meal my headache is gone and i find i am hungry she slipped from his arms and hurried from the room relieved it wasnt that she wanted to take back her acquiescence she didnt but her mood was lightened by the realization that he would not rush her along passions path what would ii be like she wondered would she too call out like those silly harem women she was curious to learn what would make a woman cry with such obvious pleasure his kiss had been quite wonderful much better than adrians kisses and for a moment she felt guilty but the feeling quickly passed she could see now that adrian had been an utter fool the dey was not a cruel man but he absolutely insisted upon being respected as was his right if adrian had behaved better he probably would have been ransomed by now and her family would have known where she was she knew that her parents would have moved heaven and earth to regain her person but adrian had not been wise and while he might eventually escape his captivity she would never escape hers was that why she was finally assenting to caynan reiss desire to save herself to make a place for herself in this new world or was she intrigued by this man who could be so kind and also so cruel she wondered if another man would have been so patient as he had been and what would have happened if she had never decided to yield to him reaching the kitchen she found the evening tray with its decanter of fruit sherbet the bowl of ripe fruits and a blueandwhite plate of flat warm bread picking it up she returned to the deys apartments i have set up the chessboard he told her as she set the tray in its accustomed place and then prepared the basin with its love cloths she took her place opposite him and their game began she had learned much from him about chess and while india had always been a good opponent she had become an even better one over the last few months tonight however she was distracted and finally after her third loss in a row he called a halt to their play reaching out he took her hand and raising it to his lips kissed the fingertips lightly unable to help herself she pressed her fingers along his mouth again he kissed them again parting his lips just slightly to suck upon those slender digits startled she pulled her hand away then stretching his arm out he touched her lips with his own hand do what i did india he instructed her softly shyly she took his fingers into her mouth drawing upon them timidly at first and then unable to help herself sucking more strongly surprised her eyes widened even as she felt her heart begin to race her cheeks felt suddenly hot there was something so sensual so primitive in what she was doing and while she forced herself to do so she didnt really want to stop she looked at him questioningly as she released his fingers the dey caressed her face gently his knuckles grazing the cheekbone are you hungry he asked her india nodded nervously although she really wasnt but anything to take her mind from the outrageously erotic thoughts now assailing her she struggled to her feet even as he stood up together they moved to the table where the food was laid out india poured the dey a small silver goblet of sherbet handing it to him it was his custom to help himself to the bread and the fruit seated opposite each other they ate in silence for a time he plucked a small bunch of palegreen grapes from the bowl and began to pull the individual fruits from their stems with his teeth slowly one by one his eyes met hers she watched fascinated until the action of his strong white teeth and his swirling tongue that snaked out to catch the juice from the grapes made her giddy when he had finished he took a slice of pomegranate spooned the seeds from it and cutting it into pieces began to feed it to her she ate several chunks of the tartsweet fruit licking the juice from his hand in an action that surprised her how bold she was becoming india thought to herself and blushed at the small smile that briefly touched the corners of his mouth could he read her wicked thoughts she hoped he could not caynan reis took one of the damp towels that always accompanied his evening meal and leaning over wiped her hands and face before cleaning himself then sitting back in his chair he said quietly to her disrobe for me india she did not argue nudity between them was natural to her now standing india loosened the ties on her pantaloons and they fell to the floor picking the garment up she laid it across the chair come here to me now he said and when she had moved to stand before him he took the damp towel and removed the carmine stain from her nipples i prefer you as allah created you he told her rising he pulled off his kaftan laying it next to her garment then reaching out he drew her into the circle of his embrace so that their bodies just touched you have no idea my precious how much i desire you he said quietly but it is important to me that you are not fearful india of what will transpire between us this night do you understand she nodded mutely unable to meet his gaze it was ridiculous that she felt so suddenly shy but she did i will not hurt you he promised her and if you become afraid you will tell me there is no shame in a virgin being suddenly reluctant or apprehensive india lovemaking is a joyous pastime and i would have you gain pleasure from our endeavors she nodded again aware all of a sudden that he was gently stroking her his big hand smoothing down her back with a delicate touch she looked up at him questioningly and without another word his mouth covered hers his lips easing her nervousness proffering a sweetness such as she had never known to her surprise she found herself kissing him back offering herself to him as she certainly never had to adrian leigh and realizing even as she did that she did so willingly i want him she thought and i don v even really know what it is i want of him he took her face between his hands raining kisses upon it until she truly believed that there wasnt an inch of skin he had missed you are so beautiful he murmured against her lips alighting upon them again as a bee returning to a flower he nibbled upon them teasingly then pressed passionately against her mouth gently but firmly and wordlessly cajoling her to part her lips when she did so he ran the tip of his tongue along the moist flesh then unexpectedly thrust into her mouth to touch her tongue with his india gasped totally surprised by his action she wanted to draw back but the writhing tongue encircling hers was frankly the most sensual feeling she had ever experienced hesitantly at first then more boldly she fenced with his tongue feeling her body begin to entertain a strange and sultry heat that while unfamiliar was she decided in the overall most pleasant she slipped her arms about his neck drawing him closer until their bodies were pressed tightly against each other for a moment his breath caught in his throat as he felt her breasts pushing against him she had absolutely no idea the havoc she was wreaking had she been any other woman he would have thrown her to the floor and taken her then and there instead he slowly ended the kiss loosening her embrace his hands going to her waist to turn her about so he might reach about taking her breasts in his two hands they nestled like two white doves within his cupped palms he brushed his thumbs lightly across her nipples smiling to himself as the delicate flesh puckered with her arousal india closed her eyes as he fondled her she sighed and leaned her head back against his shoulder she had never felt so cared for in her entire life she was at ease with this man as she had never been at ease with adrian leigh how could this be she had loved adrian loved aye it was past she realized and as she did she knew that her father had been right it had just been an infatuation that she had in her inexperience stubbornly insisted was more but it hadnt been more yet what was this that she felt for caynan reis and did she feel anything other than curiosity or budding lust if she didnt feel some emotion toward him then how could she allow him the liberties he was now taking and she had indeed allowed him he had not taken advantage of her oh she could not hide behind that old excuse of wanton maidens what is it india his voice sounded softly in her ear and he then nibbled upon her lobe you are distressed i sense it his big hands continued to caress her breasts i wonder what sort of creature i am that i enjoy your attentions she said candidly i have been taught that the license i now grant you is an intimacy allowed only between husband and wife yet i permit you to kiss and touch me in a familiar manner and i feel no guilt how can that be unless the high moral character that i have always attributed to myself does not exist and i am little better than a lewd trollop offering her favors in the high gate his hands fell away from her breasts and taking her by the shoulders he turned her about look at me he said sternly and when she raised her eyes to his he continued this is not your england india your parents have raised you well that you hold such a high moral standard up for yourself but even in england such standards are not ordinary despite what king and church may proclaim you must know that india here we do not count it a sin that a man desires a woman that is why we are allowed up to four wives at one time and many concubines to please us he touched her cheek tenderly did it ever occur to you india that perhaps you are beginning to care for me and this is why you feel no shame at our behavior his mouth brushed over hers lightly and his deep blue eyes questioned her gently india blushed and a tremor ran through her slender frame i i oh i hate this feeling of confusion she suddenly cried i told you nothing would be between us unless you wanted it as much as i do he reminded her praying silently that she would not elude his passions once again he was struggling to remain patient but i do want i do india said softly and then she hid her head against his chest why in gods name was she behaving like such a complete ninny what was the matter with her did she care for him allah he thought were all virgins like this damn the little witch she had given her consent and he would wait no longer without a word he swept her up into his arms gaining his bed his arms still tightly about her as he collapsed against the pillows oh her eyes were suddenly wide and she knew instinctively that there was now no going back as he slipped her from the comfort of his embrace upon the boldly striped mattress his look was a look of undisguised passion that even she could recognize and india thought suddenly of her mother had not jasmine willingly shared herself with prince henry stuart a liaison that had resulted in her halfbrother charles frederick stuart and that had been in england what are you thinking he demanded that your gaze burns me my lord she dissembled he laughed and once more kissed her mouth lightly if you but knew my thoughts little virgin you would burst into flame he told her i cannot ever remember desiring a woman as i desire you my precious india he caressed her face with the back of his hand i am not yet a woman my lord she half whispered back we will shortly remedy that he told her his kisses becoming more ardent as they moved over her face and down the graceful column of her throat across her chest and finally to her breasts his lips were warm and seemed to burn her delicate skin wherever they touched she was acutely aware of everything her senses suddenly sharpened to every nuance of his passion even of her own body her breasts seemed to be swollen they almost hurt and when his mouth closed over a nipple and suckled upon it a small cry escaped her ahhh god she felt his tongue swirling about the nipple teasingly and then his teeth gently very gently nipped at the sensitive tip ohhhh his tongue swiftly laved over the nipple soothing it but he hadnt really hurt her at all when he lifted his dark head she eagerly guided it to her other nipple so it too might know such pleasure then she felt his other hand caressing her belly moving in teasing little circles over the silky skin she ached with both pleasure and anticipation for whatever was to come the hand slipped lower to cover her venus mound and india felt her breath catch in her throat brushing his fingers over the smooth mound he ran a single digit down the moist crease separating the fleshy folds she couldnt breathe and then the finger pressed itself between the tempting furrow touching her in a place she hadnt even known existed india gasped sharply and the finger began to caress that place reaching out she dug her fingers into his shoulder this is your pleasure place he murmured his finger rotating itself about the sensitive nub of flesh you can feel it my precious cant you the joy is beginning to stir within you isnt it yes dear heaven this was sweet she would die with delight she thought pressing herself up to meet his hand she felt as if she were going to burst there and then indeed she did the pleasure permeated her entire body like slow warm wine oozing through her veins until the delight was as suddenly gone as it had come no she protested there is more he promised her this is just the beginning then his finger pushed deeper finding her passage exploring her gently he didnt doubt her maiden state but he could barely contain his delight at finding her virgin shield fully intact she was very tight but already wet her young body eager for the consummation he knew he could wait no longer to enjoy her withdrawing his hand from her venus mound he began to cover her fair body with his kissing her deeply as he did his hands lightly pinioning her she was completely cognizant of his actions of the hard length that had been pressing against her and was even now seeking to possess her she trembled openly as he tenderly spread her open to his attentions and he kissed her again the look on his face was one she could not fathom there was no lust only gentleness my lord she whispered confused her eyes seeking an answer the deep blue eyes looked down at her little fool he murmured to her have you not yet realized that i love you then without another word he thrust deep inside her piercing her innocence his declaration astounded her even as the sharpness of her defloration briefly pained her then after a moment he began to move upon her and india cried out softly at the pleasure she was receiving she could feel his length and the breadth of him as he plumbed the secret depths of her she welcomed him shyly at first then more boldly her arms wrapping about him into an even closer embrace put your legs about me he ground the words out into her ear she obeyed the command and then cried out as he plunged deeper into her softness she had never imagined it would be like this so wonderful so intimate so indescribable she clung to him her breath coming in hard bursts as he thrust to and fro within her body her nails began to claw at him she couldnt help it there was a tension building and building within her that needed release ohhhhh god she wailed i can bear no more ohhh god dont stop then it was as if she was almost yanked from her body and flung among the stars she soared shuddering as spasm after spasm wracked her sending waves of heat and sensation slamming into her leaving her gasping for breath he felt the walls of her sheath contracting and convulsing around his throbbing manhood and caynan reis was astounded india had been a virgin and yet her passions were even now bursting and forcing from him a torrid tribute with a groan of complete surrender his love juices filled her engulfing her secret garden i want sons from this woman was his last conscious thought and then he rolled away from her lest he crush her though his arms were still tight about her he came to himself at the sound of her soft weeping india what is it allah forgive me if i have hurt you tell me my precious he leaned over her kissing the tears upon her cheeks i am so happy she sobbed will it always be like this between us will you continue to desire me or have i lost my allure now that i am no longer a virgin she looked up at him so vulnerable that it almost broke his heart i love you he told her once again did you think i but said the words to ease your conscience india before i took you i never thought that i should love a woman but i love you i will always desire you little fool aiways i shall make you my wife as quickly as i can do so you will be the deys first wife first wife she sat up now i am allowed four he teased her and will you take four she demanded her look angry i think you will be more than enough wife for me my precious he laughed allah i am beginning to desire you again i would not believe it possible but i am andyour harem my lord she persisted the dey of el sinut would be made to look a fool ruled by his wife if he did not maintain a harem he told her that is not a matter for us to discuss india now kiss me sweetly on the lips will you make love to your harem women he pulled her down beneath him and kissed her hard it would seem i will have to having such a disobedient favorite he said to her half laughing am i to deny myself the company of women when you ripen with my children or your link with the moon is broken are you so lustful then she asked him aye he grinned mischievously at her i am now fetch the love cloths for my hunger for you grows as each minute passes she pouted but then slipped from their bed to fetch the basin and the soft cotton cloths first however she washed herself startled a moment by the blood smeared upon her thighs realizing it was the proof of her lost virtue then she brought the basin with its fresh water and clean cloths to him it is your duty to bathe my member he told her wickedly india eyed his manhood suspiciously she had of course washed him in the baths but now now it looked somewhat more lethal to her soaking the cloth she wrung it out and gingerly began her task when she had finished and removed the basin and cloths he called her back to his bed again i want you to caress my love lance he told her touch it india hold it in your hands it will not harm you she sat facing him curious to learn more about this part of him that had given her such incredible pleasure cautiously she touched his manhood with her fingertips it was warm and stirred slightly beneath her touch she drew her hand back nervously then gamely reached out again taking his member into her hand her fingers closing about him gently it seems alive she said i can feel it throbbing she loosed him and stroked his manhood with surer fingers now as if she were petting a favorite pet to her surprise it began to grow beneath her very eyes thickening and lengthening its ruby head sliding from its velvet sleeve ohhh india breathed softly you see the power you hold over me my precious he told her i think of you and am excited you touch me and i am aroused reaching out he began to caress her breasts again i can encourage your appetites as you do mine she said comprehending what he was trying to teach and show her he drew her down into his arms kissing her aye india you understand perfectly make love to me my lord she said softly and instruct me on how i may make love to you that i will do another time tonight is for your delight my love for i gain pleasure knowing i have pleasured you then his lips took possession of hers once more and it was heaven india thought quickly lost again in the fiery passion he engendered within her and heedless of the world around her azura however had noted there was no call from the dey this night for one of the harem women when the midnight hour had come she hurried to the apartment of the chief eunuch saying as she entered he has not sent for a woman baba hassan never in all the years he has been dey has a night passed when he didnt desire female company then the answer must surely be that our reluctant protégé has finally succumbed to our master the chief eunuch answered the mistress of the harem have you not noticed in the past few weeks the glances he sends her way when she is not looking at him his patience has been utterly astounding for a mortal man baba hassan arose from his pillows come azura let us go and see what has happened between them we cannot it would be a terrible intrusion on the deys privacy she answered her companion baba hassan chuckled his dark eyes crinkling almost closed with his humor azura he will never know we have spied on him he took up a small oil lamp follow me lady walking across the chamber the chief eunuch reached out to press his hand against the tile border just above his head almost immediately a hidden door swung open revealing a narrow passage baba hassan stepped through the door followed quickly by azura the door swung shut behind them come along he whispered and flabbergasted she followed behind the passage moved this way and that the air was fetid but breathable how was it azura wondered in all the years she had lived in this place that she had never before known of this secret passage several times they came to crossroads and the eunuch would turn right or left and once he went straight forward the flame from his little lamp flickering skittishly upon the walls enclosing them she was beginning to be uncomfortable in this small space are we almost there baba hassan she asked him and to her surprise he stopped suddenly she watched as raising the lamp up he found a small handle and silently rotating it revealed a tiny opening in the wall of the passage before which they now stood baba hassan turned his head and said look azura and tell me what you see the mistress of the harem peered through the opening to her astonishment she saw the deys bedchamber before her her eyes went immediately to the bed and then she smiled india was in caynan reiss arms and the dey was making very passionate love to her and most important of all in azuras eyes india was obviously enjoying her masters attentions she turned away from her view saying to baba hassan it is as you suspected the eunuch looked briefly into the room and then closing the peephole led his companion back through the hidden passage to his own apartment again the two conspirators settled themselves and the chief eunuch himself brewed the coffee that they shortly drank as they sat together he said to azura now we must hope that she has pleased him enough that he will not quickly be bored with her she must have his child he looked to the woman seated opposite him she has not been given the special sherbet has she there was no need for it as she would not accept his attentions until now azura replied unless he orders me to give it to her i shall certainly not do so she smiled with her own memories he was being so gentle with her baba hassan he is in love with her the chief eunuch responded dryly not lust azura replied surprised no love baba hassan said he is behaving with her the way our late master behaved with you lady the girl is fortunate now let us pray to allah the most compassionate that we have enough time before we are approached by the janissaries azura worried his heart must be so fully engaged with india that he will act in a wise and prudent manner oh why cannot men be peaceful baba hassan why must they always war and plot against one another it is their nature lady the chief eunuch answered her then he chuckled almost to himself tomorrow however you will find a war brewing in the harem when the other women learn that india has now become a woman and possibly will be our masters favorite azura frowned not in the least amused their plotting and planning will rival the janissaries she grumbled she arose from her place opposite him i had best seek my bed india will need me come the morning i will have to protect her from the others they were more than well aware that he had not sent for one of them tonight and were pondering upon it when i shooed them all to their beds by the morning they will surely have deciphered the puzzle you can control them the chief eunuch told her indeed i can she replied but i dislike chaos in our little world baba hassan i will not however hesitate to remove any troublemakers she hurried from his apartment when she had gone the chief eunuchs face grew serious the emissary for the janissaries had not yet come to el sinut but his contacts in istanbul had recently advised him that a single agent had been dispatched from the capital to the barbary states only one had been sent to avoid both suspicion and detection it had been cleverly done who knew where he would begin his mission would he go first to algiers or come to el sinut and what disguise would he take and how would he obtain the deys ear aruj agha was at sea yet baba hassan sighed he must be patient it would all evolve as allah willed it but he hated the thought of rebellion el sinut had been peaceful for some time now the smallest of the barbary states it was always in danger of being swallowed up by its bigger more powerful neighbors only a succession of intelligent strong and clever deys had kept it independent that and the fact that its fleet was larger than its size warranted and was extremely lucrative for the royal coffers but a serious rebellion against the sultan was something it had never encountered pray allah the all merciful that they could avoid the anarchy when and if it came the chief eunuch thought to himself chapter good morning my lord it is time for you to arise i have brought the morning meal baba hassan said his smooth brown face impassive caynan reis rolled onto his back and his blue eyes opened lazily thank you baba hassan he said must we get up now propping himself up on an elbow he leaned over and kissed india awake it is the general audience today my lord the chief eunuch reminded his master i could of course say you were ill but that would cause consternation i fear shall i escort you to the bath that is my task baba hassan india said sitting up and totally unabashed by her complete nudity your duties have changed my precious the dey told her with a smile and then he kissed the tip of her nose but i enjoy bathing you my lord caynan she told him so be it he answered and together they arose from their bed walking hand in hand from the chamber toward the deys bath a broad smile split the chief eunuchs face this was very good they were caught in the throes of love then his smile faded as quickly as it had come but would india cooperate with them to aid the dey in avoiding treason the english were very independent but then they were loyal to their monarch too still the girl was no fool but if they explained everything carefully to her she could not fail to see the wisdom in their plan of action and convince the dey of it as well he hurried off to the harem to speak with azura his associate however had her hands full and when he entered the fountain court of the haremlik he was immediately surrounded by the deys women all chattering at him at once be silent he thundered at them and they stepped back momentarily frightened you see what i must put up with azura murmured what has happened to the dey the darkhaired samara boldly demanded oh baba hassan please tell us if our master is all right the beautiful blond mirmah pleaded her blue eyes teary the dey is in excellent health and spirits this morning ladies the chief eunuch reassured them but he did not send for one of us last night the flamehaired sarai exclaimed he always has one of us to warm his bed he was not alone baba hassan replied the english girl samara spoke the words with loathing oh not the english girl blond deva half whispered she is so beautiful i will scratch her eyes out samara snarled attempt it and you will find yourself in the open slave market within the hour azura replied sternly how spoiled you have all become your duty is to please our master and if india gives him pleasure then you should be glad for him i will not tolerate jealousy in this harem and neither will caynan reis resign yourselves to what was meant to be or would you prefer to provide entertainment for the janissaries she turned away from them saying come baba hassan we have business to discuss leading him to her own quarters she asked have you eaten yet come and sit with me where is the dey i awoke them myself the chief eunuch said i brought the morning meal but india insisted on bathing her lord herself as she has been doing these past several months last night i told you that he loved her but this morning i tell you that she loves him as well this is just as we hoped but now my dear azura we must make certain that india follows our plan else we all find ourselves in jeopardy from the irrational and foolish behavior of the janissaries i will go to the dey myself and see what plans he has for india azura said i am certain that now he will no longer expect her to serve him as a body slave i shall bring a beautiful kaftan for her to wear today if she is to become his favorite then she must have her own apartment and everything that goes with such an honor we have been friends since her arrival now i shall build upon that friendship she is an intelligent girl and can be brought to see reason if she loves him as you believe baba hassan she will want to protect him from all harm melon she offered him a plate and together they ate their morning meal all the while planning how to protect the dey and el sinut from chaos when they had finished azura went to the main wardrobe for the harem and chose an exquisite turquoiseblue silk kaftan embroidered with gold thread butterflies and creamy pearls as well as several pale gold veils for indias head and to shield her beautiful face should she go from the harem today hurrying through the palace azura entered the deys apartments greeting her lord with a smile and displaying the finery i thought perhaps my lord that you would want india garbed somewhat differently today i have brought these garments for your approval what think you my precious caynan reis asked india they are lovely my lord if it pleases you i will wear them but please let me come with you to the general audience i love watching you judge and settle disputes i will be happy to ply my fan today that you not become overheated nay you will sit by my throne he said someone else will ply the fan now go and put on your new clothing for me while i speak with azura the dey commanded her and india taking the garments from the older woman hurried into the bedchamber i want you and baba hassan in the audience chamber today as well as the ladies of the harem seat them behind a carved screen so they may see but not be seen he told her is this a special occasion i have somehow overlooked azura asked he laughed and the sound was so happy and carefree that she was surprised for she had never heard him make such a noise in all the years they had known each other i am going to marry her the dey said do not feign amazement you lovely creature he teased azura you and baba hassan have dangled her before me since the day she arrived you wanted this to happen and while i believed you both mad it would seem you know me better than i know myself it is a mans nature to want love and be loved in return my lord azura answered him diffidently hah he chuckled you plotted the entire matter my lord india had come forth from the bedchamber caynan reiss deep blue eyes widened with approval allah he exclaimed how exquisite you are my precious love then you are pleased she smiled happily then turned to azura thank you my lady for making such a fine choice azura nodded in reply and then said to the dey you will of course want the lady india to have her own apartment my lord aye have the empty rooms next to mine prepared for her he instructed the mistress of the harem but my lord those rooms are not within the harem azura reminded him a trifle amazed by his instructions the harem is for my concubines he answered her the rooms near me are for my wife i do not want my bride far from my side while india will rule my house and bear my children you my dear azura will continue to be the mistress of the harem this is my wish yes my lord the older woman answered him allah he really was in love with her she bowed politely and backed from the deys apartments hurrying to find baba hassan so she might tell him of all that had transpired and prepare the harem for their outing she did not however tell her charges of the deys decision to marry that must be his little surprise the concubines would of course be distressed by the news but she would reassure them that their place within the deys household was a secure one he would not for the time being want their company as frequently as he had in the past but they would come to accept the new arrangement any who caused difficulties would be sold away and replaced while azura was content that caynan reis take a wife and have children the beautiful india must not be allowed to have such influence over her husband that he perhaps ignore his faithful servants eventually there must be a second wife or at least a favored concubine to engage the deys interest india however could be the only woman allowed to give the dey sons lest el sinut be subjected to the same sort of internecine warfare afflicting the sublime porte where the sultans women warred with each other ambitious for their sons it was just this sort of thing that had weakened the empire leaving it vulnerable to factions like the greedy powerhungry janissaries who were even now plotting treason for now though india would serve their purpose while making caynan reis the happiest of men the mistress of the harem concluded come ladies she said reentering the harem you are to dress in your finest garments and be allowed to sit in the audience hall today and watch our master in judgment over his subjects with cries of pleasure the harem women rushed to find the most flattering clothing that they could rummaging through their jewel boxes calling to their personal slaves for their cosmetics and perfumes azura oversaw it all a secret smile upon her beautiful face watching as samara chose flamecolored garments the equally darkhaired leah a deep rose redhaired sarai was resplendent in green and gold and the four blondes exaggerated their delicate coloring in the palest of pastels pink sky blue peach and apple green and when the seven women were dressed with matching veils covering their bejeweled hair and their pretty faces azura escorted them from the harem to the audience hall before them the chief eunuch went clearing a path through the waiting populace all of whom were fascinated to be given even the slightest glimpse of the deys harem women as they hurried through the corridor heads bowed eyes lowered and heavily veiled baba hassan led the women into the vaulted chamber with its greenand white mottled pillars and settled them behind a carved wooden screen facing the deys throne and set to one side there small chairs had been arranged in such a manner that each woman could gain a good view of the proceedings no matter where she was seated samara silently counted the seats there were but eight just enough for the harem and the lady azura she smiled well pleased obviously the english girl does not merit the privileges we have been given she announced smugly to her companions she cannot have pleased him remember deva remarked archly that she is merely his body slave exactly samara crowed her status remains lowly while ours is a favored one i think she did please him the blond laylu replied look azura bit her lip so as not to laugh as the seven pairs of eyes turned toward the dais where even now caynan reis was standing by his side stood india her metallic gold veils glittering splendidly in the morning light as the hall grew silent with expectation the girls head was lowered just enough to be modest without being servile the dey spoke today i bring you good news he began i am the happiest of men for i have decided to take a wife i shall ask the chief iman to marry me to this woman before the sun has set this day he took indias hand leading her forward saying behold she who has brought me the greatest joy i have ever known then to azuras surprise india knelt before the dey kissing the hem of his bejeweled coat and finally flattening herself at his feet the hall erupted into cheers even as caynan reis raised the girl up his arm about her protectively then he brought her to a small satin stool set on his right hand and seated her before taking his own throne baba hassan looked toward the carved screen and azura knew the look was for her alone it plainly said what azura had known all along india was strong of character indeed she had played this hand beautifully giving the dey the public respect he must have as the sultans governor while cleverly endearing herself to him further it was obvious that the girl had decided where her fate lay well well sarai said softly i should have never thought resistance was the way to our lords heart she shrugged fatalistically do not despair nila murmured one wife is always followed by a second we will have our chance when our lord grows tired of the english girls waspishness that performance she just put on hardly smacks of pettishness samara observed wiser than the others she is clever far cleverer than i would have given her credit for the little bitch let us give her a chance mirmah said to them and leah nodded in agreement we do not really know her now she will come to live in the harem with us and it is possible we may become friends after all she is to be the masters first wife and the first wife always has the most influence not always samara replied azura held her peace signaling them to silence now that the audiences had begun they would find out soon enough that india was not to be housed in the harem with them which would of course cause further jealousy samara was an obvious troublemaker and she would also have to watch nila and sarai mirmah however had possibilities that azura had never before observed she would mention them to baba hassan and they would keep mirmah in mind for a possible second wife she could prove to be the perfect counterbalance to the strongwilled india mirmah was a circassian bred for the harem and taught to please a master in a variety of ways the dey moved to get through the public audience as quickly as possible without slighting any of his supplicants the crowds within the hall however understood and some with but simple matters to be adjudicated requested of the chief eunuch that their cases be rescheduled another time so the dey might get on with his own personal business the hall emptied quickly for most in the crowds could scarcely wait to get outside into the town and spread the word of the deys marriage when the public audience was finally over baba hassan stepped forward bowing to his master and said shall i take the lady india to the womens mosque my lord to be prepared for your marriage caynan reis nodded and then spoke quietly to india you will submit yourself to a special bath of purification my precious then an iman will ask you several questions baba hassan will translate what you cannot understand and instruct you on how to answer india remembered shreds of stories she had heard from her family now pushing into her consciousness you want me to accept islam she said to him he nodded if you are to be my wife you must he told her it is customary for all captives to do so in your position words she would say words what was in her heart was known only to god india thought her greatgrandmother had in a similar position accepted islam so had her stepfathers greatgrandmother my own grandfather whom i never knew but of whom mama has always spoken the great akbar believed all religions had value i do not have to reject christ india considered thoughtfully to herself then she looked into his eyes smiling and said i will do it my lord but in return i would have a favor from you walk with me my precious love he said taking her by the arm his look telling baba hassan to remain where he was when they were a distance from any who might overhear he asked her what would you have of me india i have told you that my mother was the daughter of the great mughal emperor akbar when she was thirteen she was married to her first husband a young prince this prince was a follower of islam but while my mother had been raised to respect all faiths she was as i am a baptized christian at her request she was also wed in secret in her own christian faith because he loved her her prince was willing to acquiesce to her request will you do the same for me my lord is there a christian priest here in el sinut who would marry us and keep the secret so as not to endanger you he thought for a long moment and then said to her i am not certain who i can trust within the christian community which is very small india i promise you however that before our first child is born i will wed you in your own faith will you accept my pledge on that my precious love i will she replied for i have learned in the months that i have been your body slave that you are a man of honor have you he was touched by her words he had not realized she was observing him so closely emboldened he asked her do you love me just a little india or do you wed me because it is the expedient thing to do i believe i am beginning to love you my lord i know i do not hate you i realize now that all i have been told since coming to el sinut is the truth i will not return to england and even if i ever did it would be difficult for me so is it not prudent for me to accept my fate and make a happy life for myself she smiled shyly at him yes he answered her content for now with her candid answer then he led her back to baba hassan do what must be done he told the chief eunuch i will go and see the iman we must leave the palace and go to the womens mosque baba hassan told india he then gave orders to the slaves about them and india shortly found herself in a litter once again leaving the grounds of the palace for the first time since she had arrived in el sinut five months back the womens mosque was a beautiful building of pure white marble inside it was colonnaded with pillars of redandwhite marble holding up horseshoe arches baba hassan put her in the charge of an old woman who took her to the ritual bath already awaiting the bride it was little different from the harem bath but india found she was being treated with deep respect by the bath attendants it is a little bit like marrying a king she thought realizing that as wife of the dey she was indeed very much like a queen when they had finished bathing massaging and perfuming her they brought her fresh garments a creamcolored kaftan embroidered with silver and gold threads and small pearls and diamante her dark curls were brushed with fragrant oil and dressed with pearls a gossamer veil shot through with gold and silver was placed on her head a matching veil drawn across her face soft kid slippers covered in beaten gold were slipped upon her narrow feet you are now ready my lady the mosques bath mistress said then she led india back out into a courtyard where baba hassan was awaiting come the chief eunuch said we must now see the iman who presides over the womens mosque i will translate for you she was brought into the company of a whitebearded elderly man while frail of form his look was an intelligent and piercing one instinctively india bowed to him and then stood silently her eyes modestly lowered the dey has chosen a beautiful woman baba hassan the iman said does she understand why she is here i do my lord iman india said before the eunuch could speak for her i have come to accept islam so my lord caynan may wed me baba hassan smiled silently at her carefully spoken arabic the iman nodded had you ever heard of islam before coming to el sinut my daughter our faith is an old one though not quite as ancient as christianity and certainly not anywhere near as old as judaism i knew of islam my lord iman india answered him do we not all worship the same god indeed my daughter we do come let us sit and i will tell you of the five pillars of wisdom that are the strength of our faith they settled themselves upon a low divan the chief eunuch standing behind them and the iman continued to be a good member of islam you must observe our creed in which we demand belief in god his angels his books his prophets and the last day in which all men will be judged our prayer is a simple one there is no god but god and muhammed is prophet of god will you say the words for me my lovely lady there is no god but god and muhammed is the prophet of god india spoke clearly it was such a simple declaration angels i know you believe in having been raised in a christian country our prophets are your prophets our holy books are called the quran we also recognize the scriptures of abraham the torah of moses the psalms of david and the gospels of jesus christ all as revealed by god the second pillar of wisdom is prayer we pray five times daily upon rising in early afternoon in late afternoon at sunset and finally at night before retiring the third pillar is alms giving like christians and jews we believe in charity toward those less fortunate than ourselves the fourth pillar requires us to fast in the ninth lunar month which we call ramadan between sunrise and sunset we refrain from eating drinking smoking and relations with our women the fifth and final pillar of wisdom requires us to make a pilgrimage to the holy city of mecca in our lifetime if we can these are things upon which our faith is founded my lady will you accept them i will india answered him without hesitation then my daughter having now accepted islam you are permitted to wed the dey the old man said to her understand that while it is every mans duty to wed and procreate marriage in our world is not a religious rite it is a contract between two people the dey will settle a bride price upon you which is yours and yours alone you must be obedient to his will and his will alone my daughter if at any time he wishes to divorce you he will say i dismiss thee thrice your bride price would go with you in that event we do not however approve of divorce and discourage men from it what if a woman wishes to divorce her husband my lord iman india asked curious such a thing is not permitted she was told the iman arose slowly from his seat baba hassan you will take the lady now to be wed the chief iman of el sinut is awaiting her arrival so he may witness this happy event india bid the elderly cleric farewell and followed after the chief eunuch the womens mosque was next to the main mosque in the city they had but to cross a courtyard half shadowed with afternoon sun he brought her into the building to a small room looking out upon a garden azura was awaiting them along with the dey and the chief iman the iman abd allah was a portly man with a nononsense air about him let us begin he said you have settled a bride price upon the girl my lord and it is sufficient enough good he looked at india you are willing to marry this man my lady i am india replied softly excellent the iman answered with a smile very well i will witness you pledging to one another you may begin my lord dey caynan reis took indias hand in his azura will whisper the words to you when it is your turn he reassured her then with a smile he spoke his promise to her i caynan take you india as my lawfully married wife before god and in front of this company in accordance with the teachings of the quran i promise to do everything to make this marriage an act of obedience to god to make it a relationship of love mercy peace faithfulness and cooperation let god be my witness because god is the best of all witnesses amen his deep blue eyes looked directly into her golden ones as he spoke his vows india felt her cheeks grow pink she was being married and certainly in a manner she had never anticipated or even expected for a moment tears welled up and she wished her parents and her siblings were here with her she was not unhappy with her decision but she missed those she loved best he squeezed her hand and she focused upon his handsome face once more smiling softly through her veil at him as she began to speak her own marriage vows to him i india take you caynan as my lawfully married husband before god and in front of this company in accordance with the teachings of the quran i promise to do everything to make this marriage an act of obedience to god to make it a relationship of love mercy peace faithfulness and cooperation let god be my witness because god is the best of all witnesses amen it is done then abd allah said with a broad smile may i offer you my felicitations my lord dey we are pleased to see you take a wife at long last may the union be fruitful and may your wife give you many fine sons i will endeavor to see that she does her duty the dey returned with a broad smile come said azura taking india by the arm we must return to the palace discreetly the servants have been working all day to prepare your apartments i think you will be pleased the two women entered their litter baba hassan walking alongside of them and you must visit the haremlik before sunset why india asked her i am not going to live there those women hated me before i married my lord how will they feel now i am content to let them remain in their part of the palace and i will remain in my part of the palace the dey is not giving up his harem india azura said it would be very unrealistic of you to believe he will cleave only to you his appetite for female flesh is a strong one and he indulges it daily there will be times when you are unclean or with child you cannot ask him to suppress his desires in those times it would be unhealthy for his juices to be so pent up you are now the head of his women and you must make peace with those silly foolish creatures for the sake of your husband his house must be a place of quiet and calm now of the seven samara is the most dangerous be firm but fair with her she will not like you but it may prevent her from mischief if it does not i will have her sold off nila is the clever one she will act to her own advantage but do not trust her mirmah i believe can be trusted she is a gentle creature and goodnatured to a fault as for the others they are harmless though some are sharptongued i have chosen little gifts for you to give them this evening each is different but none more valuable than the other and they will recognize that india sighed deeply very well she said i will follow your advice my lady azura in these matters you know better than i azura laughed you are too young to isolate yourself india the harem women will be like sisters some you will love others you will probably hate but you will all manage to get on together you say that with such certainty india said i have lived in the harem for over thirty years azura replied you are so fortunate my lord sharif made no woman his wife he feared his enemies too much while i was his favorite i had to share his affections with the other women in his harem it was not always easy for me but it made him happy that i kept the peace within his house i never whined at my lord about the other women which set me apart from them they were foolish and were forever pouring a litany of complaints into his ear my sole efforts were directed toward his comfort his pleasure i asked for nothing and in return received everything even though you are the deys wife now india you could benefit from my example she concluded was baba hassan chief eunuch in lord sharifs time india asked the older woman nay the chief eunuch was old baba mamood he died shortly after my lord sharif baba hassan was my personal servant and my lord caynan raised him into his current position on my advice baba hassan and i love caynan reis as we would a son we do whatever we have to do to see to his happiness and his safety azura told india who is he india wondered aloud i know nothing about him other than he too was once a captive i do not know his nationality or his station in his former life or even his age he is twentyeight azura told her as for the rest what does it matter it has nothing to do with today you love caynan reis and that is all that should matter to you your life is here and not back there in some other world in some other time and place india nodded you are correct my lady azura the past is nothing now we must live for the present she sighed i only wish that my family might know of my happiness i hate to think of the pain i have caused them by my precipitous and hasty flight if they knew where you were azura said they would surely attempt to retrieve you from us perhaps in a few years when you have children you will be allowed to send a message to your mother my grandmother would understand my plight better than anyone else in my family india said she was in a similar position in her youth and became the fortieth wife of the grand mughal akbar yet she returned to england azura was puzzled her family learned where she was but might have been content except grandmamas husband the earl of broccairn was alive she had thought him dead in a duel and had gone off to india with her elder brother to meet her parents when she was kidnapped and sent to my grandfather by the time they found her and requested her return grandmama had had my mother her family of course did not know that my grandfather would not allow her to take the baby to england with her and that is how mama came to be raised in akbars imperial court my family is not like any others india finished i should say not azura remarked with a chuckle ahh we are finally back she said as the litter was put down with a small bump come my lady india and i will show you your new apartments then we must go to the harem she laughed when the bride wrinkled her pretty nose in distaste indias new apartments were directly adjacent to her husbands they would share the garden there were but two rooms plus a small servants chamber the walls were white the floors squares of large red tile the day room had a small fountain in its center that was made of yellowandwhite tiles there were several overstuffed divans with rolled arms striped in blue and yellow satin low ebony tables inlaid with tiny squares of multicolored tile a rectangular cedar table upon which were a silver tray holding a decanter of lemon sherbet as well as a blueandwhite fezware bowl of fresh fruit there were large colorful pillows with gold tassels and standing bronze lamps burning fragrant aloes lamps of colored glass and warm polished brass hung from the ceilings sheer silken curtains hung in the arches that opened to the garden the carved screens being pulled aside the bedchamber was simple there was a bed upon a giltandpainted dais the mattress was covered in silver and seablue silk there were more tasseled pillows several cedar chests were placed about the room and upon a lovely table with carved legs was a goldbacked hand mirror and matching brush for her hair by the bed was a low table upon which rested a silver lamp burning perfumed oils carved ivory screens blocked the arches and were hung with silk curtains are you pleased azura asked her india nodded it is all so lovely please thank the servants for me lady they have done very well what is in the trunks part of your bride price i suspect clothing jewelry fragrance there will be time for you to explore later the harem india resigned where are their gifts baba hassan will bring them when he knows we are ready azura said if you go now you will be able to join your husband all the sooner are you not ready again for his kisses and caresses india blushed nodding let us go then she replied as they entered the harem the day room grew suddenly silent as seven pairs of eyes fixed themselves upon india make you obeisance to our masters wife now head of this household azura announced to them then her eagle eye observed as the seven women bowed low to india even samara i thank you for your greeting india said in reply i have brought you all little tokens to celebrate my marriage today she turned to the chief eunuch baba hassan you know which gift is for which lady will you hand the gifts to me i admit to not choosing them for i do not know you all well enough yet but i would have them come from my hand to yours she smiled will the harem continue to exist lady demanded samara boldly she was not a woman to beat about the bush whether the harem exists or doesnt exist is not my province that is in the deys domain i am content however that you be here but my husbands house must be free of discord i will strive to see that it is so samara her answer seemed to appease the harem women and they each stepped forward to receive their gift the gentle mirmah set the tone by taking indias two hands in hers and pressing them to her forehead in a gesture of acceptance and respect each of the others followed mirmahs example samara being the last and obviously reluctant india smiled at each of them though some more warmly than others as she handed out the gift packets which were wrapped in silk kerchiefs and tied with gold ribbons the ladies cried out delighted as they opened their gifts for baba hassan had not been stingy in choosing the women compared the earrings and necklaces and were all satisfied will you partake of light refreshments with us my lady mirmah asked india i will be happy to join you india replied noting that azura had disappeared from the scene the women led india to a divan positioning themselves about her upon cushions as the slaves brought sweet grape sherbet and a plate with tiny honey cakes and small horns of chopped nuts and dough filled with raisins nuts and honey there were also sweet dates and juicy figs upon the plate you know i am english india said as they ate i want to know about all of you mirmah is circassian azura has told me but what of the rest i am french nila said i am seventeen and have lived in the deys harem since i was fifteen i was a gift to him from the dey of algiers who was my first master we are greek laylu said indicating deva in her statement we came from the same village and have been enslaved since we were ten baba hassan bought us in the market of el sinut three years ago i am venetian sarai spoke up i come from a family of wealthy merchants i was on my way to naples to be married when my vessel was captured after the corsair captain had taken his pleasure of me he gave me to the dey who beheaded him for violating me women captives are not supposed to be mistreated i am moorish leah said my family was poor and sold me into slavery so they might survive i had two masters before i came to the deys harem last year i am of syrian birth samara said curtly india did not press samara further for she obviously did not wish to speak on her origins in detail for whatever reason it seemed so strange here at first she said but now this is home did you all feel that way too the other girls nodded most of us were born free sarai said being a slave even a privileged slave is difficult at first you have done well to win our lord caynans heart and in such a short time when none of the others of us could do it he has always been kind but he merely slakes his lusts upon our bodies you have gained something more my lady india and we are frankly envious of you india blushed not knowing what to say but we are safe and comfortable mirmah spoke up and we shall all be friends i was born on a slave farm and raised to be a harem woman it is better when the women of the harem get on my lady india my first master was aruj agha who purchased me in the great market of istanbul one evening when the dey came to aruj aghas house for a meal he saw me and admired me aruj agha had me delivered to the palace the next morning i like it here aruj agha had no other women for he could not afford them it was lonely waiting for him to return from his voyages i am glad we have each other and i am happy that our lord caynan has found a wife her sweet nature touched india and reaching out she took mirmahs hand and sarais hand in hers saying i agree with mirmah we should all be friends and keep peace in our lords house i promise you that i will be a good mistress to you allah samara exclaimed i do not know if it is the cakes or the atmosphere but i think i am going to be sick from all this sweetness india burst out laughing you remind me of my sister fortune samara she said she says exactly what she is thinking too samara was surprised by indias reaction she had expected the deys bride to be offended but here she was making light of samaras rudeness did you really take a knife to the dey when you arrived she asked india frankly curious to know if the stories had been only rumor i did india admitted it is fortunate my aim was so poor as i now love him she chuckled allah you are daring samara said with grudging admiration i was not taught to fear india replied quietly how will you feel if our lord takes a second wife sarai asked india frankly jealous india responded candidly but i shall have to live with it she paused if he takes a second wife she concluded the other women laughed i suppose it is best to leave everything as it is now samara said thoughtfully one wife and a harem it would appear that we can all get along if we try and we are content as things are the others murmured in agreement and azura watching from behind a screen was extremely pleased that india had taken her counsel making her peace with the women of the harem she is an intelligent young woman the mistress of the harem considered she can be influenced if she is approached correctly el sinut will be kept safe from the machinations of the janissaries i am certain of it now she turned her attentions back to the young women seated about india and listened with great interest for they had somehow managed to turn the conversation to matters of a sensual nature india blushing at their teasing was clever enough to admit that she knew absolutely nothing about lovemaking other than what the dey had introduced her to the previous night i am so ignorant she said i know it is audacious of me to ask your help in such matters but i would please our master how ingenious of her azura thought admiringly if nothing else her very artlessness will win them all over even samara it is deftly done particularly calling caynan reis our master and not her husband by not lording it over them she made herself one of them it was skillful and wickedly adroit of india azura considered the deys wife might turn out to be far more than they had anticipated the mistress of the harem turned her attention back to the seven women and india listening with great amusement as they all began talking at once for each was certain she could teach india how to please the dey better than any of the others azura remained to be certain none of the other women misled the bride but they obviously did not consider it being far too interested in imparting their own knowledge to her the older woman shook her head wonderingly everything was going even better than she had hoped baba hassan would be equally pleased when she told him it was simply perfect the chief eunuch bustled into the harem and going to india bowed politely my lady your husband wishes your presence india arose at once i shall never remember everything she said with a small laugh may i come back tomorrow yes they chorused and sent her on her way well samara said as the harem doors closed behind the deys wife i have to admit she is likable or so it would seem prepare yourselves for a drought ladies he will not grow tired of her for some time and we fools as we are are helping her to retain his attentions she will be with child the sooner nila chuckled and then the dey will seek us out for his pleasure and amusement why should she have a child when none of us have leah asked foolish one mirmah told her we are fed something in either our food or drink to keep us infertile it is common practice in the harems of istanbul did none of you know that the lady india however will be given no such cordial indeed she will be fed all manner of delicacies as will the dey to encourage them to produce a child it will be nice to have a baby among us if she does not cease her cheerful mindless prattle samara muttered darkly to sarai i may throttle our little golden bird india meanwhile followed baba hassan back to her own quarters as they entered the apartment a young girl came forward and bowed low on the deys instructions i have been searching the slave markets these last few weeks my lady for a girl who could speak your native tongue and had a modicum of intelligence so you would have someone to serve you in whom you could put your trust the eunuch said i found this wench almost a month ago and have endeavored to train her properly if she pleases you she is yours india turned and smiled at the girl she looked very young and her gray eyes were quite apprehensive she was slight of build and had carrotcolored hair that was quite startling in its brightness what is your name india asked the girl in english margaret lady though i be called meggie the girl replied you are english nay lady i be scots meggie said ahhh india smiled i thought the accent not quite right i am the stepdaughter of the duke of glenkirk meggie i grew up north and west of aberdeen where are you from ayr my lady where the laddies are braw and the lassies are bonnie tis said meggie told her new mistress india turned to baba hassan the girl will do excellently you have chosen well baba hassan but then i would have expected no less of you she is not however english but a scot as i was raised in scotland i am comfortable with her now where is the dey he dines tonight with aruj agha who has this afternoon returned from his voyage he will come to you afterward my lady is my cousin osman the navigator with aruj agha i would inquire after his health baba hassan india said i will see and then bring you word my lady he bowed himself from her chambers come india said leading meggie to a divan tell me how you came to be in el sinut my da is a sea captain my lady meggie said i was always begging him to take me on a voyage like he did me ma when they was young so as i was to be married to ian murray this coming summer before the clans gather da said he would take me to bordeaux where he was to pick up a cargo of wine we was attacked in the bay of biscay the girls eyes grew teary me da was killed right before me eyes lady sliced right through him they did me and the sailors that survived was carried off i was nae harmed though indeed they was most careful of my wellbeing then a rush of tears slid down her freckled face now my ian will marry that smug flora maclean whos always been after him like a cat wi a bird aye he probably will lassie india said bluntly and there is little you can do about it i fear women are rarely if ever ransomed from barbary and besides who would there be to claim you you are fortunate meggie that the chief eunuch of the deys household purchased you you might have been sold to a cruel master or mistress or worse into a brothel you will be safe with me and as the deys first wife you will have a position of status among the servants meggie wiped her tears with the back of her hand and giving a final sniffle said ill be faithful to ye my lady i promise i know you will india reassured the girl do you know your way to the kitchen aye my lady then go to abu the cook and tell him that i desire my supper bring it back and i shall eat in the garden my husband is dining with an old friend very good my lady meggie said and hurried off baba hassan returned to tell india that her cousin was not with aruj agha but had remained aboard their ship he has proved himself worthy of trust my lady and will soon begin to teach our sailors how to manage his round ship we have captured two more in the last few months one from the french and another from the dutch is the girl satisfactory my lady she cannot seem to learn our language but had enough french that i was able to guide her she seems willing enough she saw her father killed when their ship was attacked india told the eunuch he was the captain and she was to be married soon she is just getting over the shock of it all if she is not stupid ill try to teach her the language at least enough to get about she will i believe be a good companion for me thank you but tell me baba hassan you say you purchased her for me over a month ago i was still the deys body slave then but you were falling in love with him my lady and he with you i could see it and azura too i knew it to be a matter of time until you succumbed to his passions you are young and you are beautiful and the juices of life flow deep within you if i had waited until today to seek out a suitable servant for you i might not have found one for months india laughed you are a clever man baba hassan i believe the dey is fortunate to have you looking after his best interests so carefully i am glad you and azura are my friends lady the chief eunuch said i know this is your wedding day but may i speak with you seriously for a moment india nodded i must ask you to say nothing to your husband about the matter i am bringing to your attention it is in your husbands best interests i assure you india was intrigued i will keep your confidence baba hassan i have many contacts throughout the sultans realm my lady it was brought to my attention several months ago that a plot was afoot in istanbul to assassinate the sultan and his mother the valideh the instigators of this perfidy are the janissaries already they have dispatched an agent to the barbary states this man will seek to gain the barbary rulers as allies promising them freedom to rule without answering to the sublime porte and freedom from tribute it is a generous offer but i do not believe this plot can prevail those who associate themselves with this treason risk death the janissaries will be forgiven after some punishment they always are because they are strong anyone else involved will not be forgiven for an example must be made el sinut is the smallest of the barbary states it is possible we may not be approached but if we are azura and i will need your aid in dissuading the dey from throwing his lot in with the conspirators remember aruj agha is his closest friend and aruj agha will be loyal to the corps first even if he disagrees with them he cannot will not betray his fellow janissaries if i were the valideh india said i should punish the janissaries in the barbary states they are the least important men in the corps yet as janissaries can be held liable for the betrayals of their fellows in istanbul without really offending those traitors i would punish the rulers of the barbary states and set men loyal to me in their place is that not right baba hassan that is precisely what the valideh will do my lady how astute you are to see it all so quickly and clearly he told her if my husband is approached india said i will help you and azura to foil any plots against el sinut in the meantime i will remain silent for why should caynan reis be distressed by that which may not even happen how will you discourage the agent of the janissaries if he comes here first the dey will be advised to tell him to go to the other deys in tunis and algiers and morocco and then return to el sinut caynan reis will say as the smallest of the barbary states he is the most vulnerable and must be certain the bigger states will involve themselves first before he commits el sinut if the agent comes to us last we will simply kill him so he may not return to istanbul but we will send his head to the valideh telling her of the plots to dethrone her son and that we did not betray the sultan why not kill him if he comes here first india inquired because if he goes to the others and they are willing to betray the sultan and we are not caynan reis looks the better for it perhaps the sultan and his mother will reward him in some grand manner my lady and aruj agha what of him he will not know until after the agent is disposed of my lady we can keep his loyalty and his friendship if we do not ask him to divide those qualities within him the eunuch answered her i can see that i have much to learn from you baba hassan india replied quietly he bowed low to her smiling i am honored that you think so my lady india he responded meggie now returned struggling beneath the weight of a tray staggering across the day room she placed it with a clunk upon the cedar table abu wasnt certain what would please my ladys palate she said dryly and so he has sent almost everything in the kitchen i will leave you to your meal my lady baba hassan said and he withdrew india walked over to the table and began inspecting the foods the cook had sent her there was chicken a bowl of what appeared to be lamb stew saffroned rice steamed artichokes a bowl of yogurt with peeled green grapes flat bread a honeycomb a bowl of oranges figs a pomegranate and bunch of grapes and a decanter of fresh sherbet you will eat with me tonight meggie india said shall i fill your plate my lady the girl asked india shook her head i will do it she replied and cut herself several slices of the roasted chicken which she lay upon her plate along with some saffroned rice and an artichoke when the servant saw her mistress was content she spooned some of the lamb mixture onto her plate and tore a piece of the flat bread off the round for herself is it good india asked her aye tis certainly flavored better than my mams meggie admitted and tis true lamb not mutton im thinking india took her spoon and lifted a chunk of the meat from its gravy it is good she agreed try some chicken abu has flavored it with onion and sage i believe the two young women finished off their meal with the yogurt and the fruit meggie poured them both some of the tartsweet sherbet to drink and when it was consumed she gathered all the dishes up and returned them to the kitchen when she returned she asked india where am i to sleep my lady that small cubicle is yours india told her pointing across the day room make certain there is a pallet for you there and then come and help me prepare for bed as my husband is entertaining i do not imagine he will call for me this evening meggie undressed her mistress and sponged her with rose water then india slid naked beneath the silk coverlet upon her bed bidding her new servant good night what a day it had been she thought since this time last night she had lost her virginity and had gotten married now the stories of her female relations adventures began to surface in her consciousness she had always listened with but half an ear when they were told it had been fortune who had been fascinated by these tales india had always thought them a little shocking and perhaps not really true just made up adventures to amuse now she wasnt certain there had been her stepfathers greatgreat grandmother janet leslie whose portrait hung in the great hall at glenkirk castle she it was said had been the favorite wife of a turkish sultan and of course her own greatgrandmother the fabled skye omalley who had lived in algiers as both a wife and a harem slave and greataunt aidan who had at one time been wife to a tartar prince and held captive in a sultans harem and aunt valentina who had been kidnapped and held in a pashas harem the very same pasha who had once enslaved her stepfathers mother the beautiful lady stewarthepburn and of course her own grandmother velvet gordon who had been fortieth wife to the great mughal ruler akbar of india it would seem she was following a family tradition india considered wryly the only difference was that all those women had eventually been able to make their way home a tear slid down indias cheek for the first time since her capture a great feeling of homesickness overwhelmed her until recently she had not dared to exhibit an ounce of weakness now however she could not help herself she wanted desperately to see mama and papa and fortune and henry and the rest of their siblings had they cried when news of her capture came did they even know or had they assumed she had run off with adrian leigh and was now his wife and would eventually return did they even miss her or had they washed their hands of her taking fortune off to ireland to find her a husband fortune who had thought it very practical that their parents find her a husband will they ever know what happened to me india wondered and she sobbed softly caynan reis had entered his wifes bedchamber quietly and now hearing the sound of her weeping he hurried to her side what is it my precious he asked joining her upon her bed and gathering her into his arms what has made you sad i mmiss mmy family india wailed ahhh he said understanding her complaint he held her close and smoothed her curls soothingly tthey dont know whwhere i am give me a child so no one can steal you away from me my precious india and i promise you that you may write to your mother the dey told her i have told you that i love you and it is the truth i could not bear it if some misguided parent took you from me i i love you too india told him but i want my family to know of and share in our happiness my lord caynan in time he vowed to her and then he was kissing her passionately you are mine my beloved and i shall allow no one to take you back almost immediately she was swept away by his hungry devotion all thoughts of her past life disappeared as his burning desire overwhelmed her she loved and was loved in return there could be nothing more wonderful than that ohhh my lord she murmured against his lips i do adore you her hand caressed his shoulder gently i am content to be with you let me show you what the harem women taught me this afternoon when i visited them tell me if it pleases you to his great surprise she slipped from his embrace and rolled him onto his back then she straddled him and began letting her hands roam across his smooth chest shy at first she grew bolder taking his nipples between her thumb and forefinger and rubbing them teasingly he was about to reach up and take her tempting little breasts in his own hands when she leaned forward and began kissing his chest then licked at it seductively with her tongue slowly carefully she moved down his torso her dark curls brushing his smooth skin seductively he was scarcely breathing for fear of deferring her progress wondering how far she would go and then her hand closed about his manhood her fingers tightened about him briefly while her other hand brushed over his thighs pushing between them to cup his jewels in the warmth of her palm india bent lower astounded by her own daring but unable to cease her erotic actions it had all sounded so wicked when the harem ladies elucidated upon it but now caught in the throes of her own rising desire she knew she must continue onward she squeezed him gently once again he grew thicker and longer beneath her sensorial ministrations her head dropped and she kissed the rubyred tip of his manhood then licked all around it he shuddered with the voluptuousness of her behavior gasping softly as she enveloped him within her mouth and began to suck upon his throbbing member tongue and teeth teased at him causing his whole body to quiver with excitement then a single finger reached beneath his pouch pressing into a spot so sensitive that his whole frame arced with pleasure and he groaned with sheer delight ohhh sweet witch they have taught you well ahhhhhh enough enough india released him and looked sloeeyed upon caynan reis i do not please you she asked innocently you please me my precious and you kill me too with your skill he pulled her forward and lifting her said come now and mount me my beloved i would encase my weapon within your pleasure sheath now it was india who gasped as she felt him sliding into her eager body her eyes closed her back arched and instinctively she rode him until his lusts burst within her and she fell forward upon his chest whimpering with her own pleasure he maintained the union gently rolling her onto her back so that it was he who was now the dominant one his kisses covered her face and india sighed deeply as she slowly and most reluctantly returned to earth i shall reward the ladies who encouraged and developed your skills he told her smiling into her eyes now india blushed realizing what she had done i was bold she said softly touching his face with her hand very bold he agreed affably i hope you will continue in your daring india i gained great pleasure from it he slowly kissed her thinking as he did that she had the most kissable mouth he had ever known nibbling upon her lower lip he told her so i like kissing you she admitted are my kisses sweeter than your english milord he demanded aye she told him realizing as she did that it was the truth i did not kiss him a great deal she admitted candidly but i do not believe he had your skill my lord caynan perhaps i shall ransom him the dey said it would be kind india agreed if he has survived these past months in the galleys surely that is enough punishment for his rudeness toward you my lord his father is old and sickly and he is his mothers only child did you ever meet his parents the dey asked her india shook her head his father remained at his home in the country he has not left it i am told since his elder son killed lord jeffers and then fled the country as for his mother even poor adrian admitted the woman was little better than a bawd he avoided her as much as he could as i am certain she would have wanted her sons marriage to me to take place she wisely avoided both my family and me my parents were taking me back to scotland to get me away from adrian when i eloped he nuzzled her neck his kisses sending shivers down her spine did you really intend to wed him or were you having second thoughts he gently pressured india it was so hard to think when his body pressed hers so closely and his lips did such delicious things to her senses i didnt like running away she admitted it seemed so precipitous but papa was so obdurate in his opposition to adrian now i think that might have had more to do with encouraging my hasty actions than any love i felt for adrian i realized as we traveled that while the adventure was exciting perhaps we were being dishonest i should have not allowed adrian to push me to such an abrupt act i have only hurt those i love best india concluded but had you not run away i should not have made you mine he murmured softly his tongue pushing into her ear to tease it no she whispered ahhhh my lord you are growing hard inside me she trembled against him how can this be be quiet little fool and let me love you he growled at her you arouse me as no female ever has he began to move upon her oh god this love was so powerful a thing india thought as she felt his length begin to slowly piston her afresh her eyes closed once more and her breathing became shallow as he pleasured her a second time she could actually feel him within her hard and throbbing with heat if she had only known india considered muzzily she never should have resisted him for so long she felt so safe in his arms she trusted him entirely although she didnt understand why she soared with the waves of hot delight beginning to wash over her as he moved within her fevered body i love you he whispered into her ear you are my precious one my adorable and adored wife india i worship you with my body i love you my lord caynan she murmured back i have never known such happiness as i know now in your arms give me your son my dearest lord give me your son their deep passion finally overcame them as they fell from the peak together they tumbled into sleep limbs tangled breathing even she curled against him his arm protectively over her in a sweetly possessive gesture and they slept until almost dawn when the dey awoke he looked at the girl lying against his chest give me your son she had cried out to him in her ardor allah he had emptied himself twice that night into the recesses of her secret garden he very much wanted to grant her request of him for the first time in his life he knew he did indeed want children he had not wanted them with other women and none of his harem women had ever made such a demand of him he sighed if this had been england he would have offered properly for lady india lindley and not rested until she was his wife their first son would have been a future earl of oxton but this was not england this was el sinut and his first son would be in constant danger from outside forces because his father was the dey still if he could get the sultan to grant him his office in perpetuity the child would be his heir he must do the sultan some great service while the boy was yet young or yet unborn the valideh was known to dote on her lad and would be generous caynan reis had not a doubt it was not such an unusual request deyships had been created in the past that continued forever provided the family was loyal he smiled in the dusk of predawn he did not even know if his efforts had made his young wife fruitful he must continue to labor until she showed the signs of being with child it was not a difficult assignment caynan reis suddenly realized he was the happiest of men a month passed and then two aruj agha had left the morning following the deys marriage for another voyage now he had returned and would be in port for some weeks seeing to muchneeded repairs on his vessel his english navigator osman would be working with a crew made up of both europeans and citizens of el sinut on his former vessel teaching the arabs how to sail and man such a complicated ship they went no farther than the outer harbor for the present as the europeans were in a distinct minority aboard the royal charles now renamed the sultan murat i have never known you to be so content the janissary captain teased his friend one day as they shared turkish coffee and the water pipe i would not have thought caynan reis vulnerable to love all men are susceptible to love the dey told him with an easy laugh even aruj agha one day you will find the right woman my friend once there was a woman i loved came the surprising admission but it was not to be besides in my position a wife is a liability in earlier times in the days of sultan selim i and his son suleiman janissaries were not allowed to wed it was better that way i think a man who worries about his wife and offspring is too cautious in battle caution does not win victories wars are won by those who are unafraid of what they might lose those who do not fear death a man with a wife worries as to her fate if he dies i am better without a mate do you not want sons the dey asked him im certain ive fathered a few in my time although i cannot be really certain aruj agha said genially the chief eunuch entered the chamber bowing to his master there is a visitor from istanbul to see you my lord he said can it not wait until the general audience tomorrow baba hassan caynan reis asked i fear not my lord the chief eunuch replied i will leave you my friend aruj agha said nay caynan reis told him you are the captain of the janissaries here in el sinut a visitor from istanbul who would speak privily with me should be heard by you as well i trust few men as i trust you show the man in baba hassan i will receive him now the eunuch bowed his face offering no emotion a moment later he returned with a tall obviously battledhardened man with the enormous mustachios of a traditional janissary who made immediate and respectful obeisance to the dey caynan reis acknowledged the gesture and said speak my lord you have a guest what i have to say is for your ears alone his visitor said this is aruj agha captain of the janissaries here whatever you have to say to me can be said before him the dey replied you support the janissaries then my lord came the question i support all who wish our lord sultan murat may he live a thousand years well and serve to keep his peace was the clever reply his visitor smiled i bring you greetings my lord dey from the court of the janissaries i am hussein aga of the corps the matter i have come to discuss is a delicate one do i have your word you will not repeat to any what is spoken here this day caynan reis nodded speak he said my lord the sultan is young a mere boy who will not rule for himself for several years to come we are governed by a woman the valideh such a thing is not to be tolerated her influence must be purged from the palace from the empire and how is this to be done the dey asked dryly will you murder this woman and then rule for the sultan in her place it is more complex than that my lord sultan murat loves his mother well he cannot really be separated from her it is better that he not rule any longer but rather be disposed of with his parent the dey stroked his chin thoughtfully and who would you place upon the throne of the ottoman hussein aga one of the poor incompetent elderly princes who has been housed a lifetime in the cage the advantage of this sultan is that he has not been in the cage long enough to be spoiled or go mad who will you put in his stead there are two younger brothers was the immediate reply you would have to murder one of those children too lest someone else some other faction use that boy in yet another revolt the dey said in practical tones i suppose you could kill the next eldest and place an infant upon the throne thereby guaranteeing the janissaries a long rule eh how old is the youngest four five such matters are for the corps to decide hussein aga said stiffly why come to me then caynan reis demanded i am the dey of the smallest of the barbary states i have no power other than that given me by the sultan and it does not extend beyond my borders what do you want of me hussein aga your support in this matter the agent of the janissaries replied give us your loyalty we will make you autonomous in el sinut you will be freed from tribute in perpetuity would you not like your son to inherit this little kingdom of yours i have no son the dey said quietly but you are a young man and you could have sons when el sinut is yours you can free your harem women from the draught they are fed to keep them sterile you might be the patriarch of many in time my lord dey hussein aga tempted him then he smiled reminding caynan reis of a ferret he had possessed as a boy have you spoken to the deys of the larger states caynan reis asked his visitor you are the first my lord was the response again the dey stroked his elegant short barbered black beard as if he were giving great consideration to hussein agas words then he spoke once again as the smallest kingdom i have more to lose than the others hussein aga what if i agree to join you in your revolt and the others do not both algiers and tunis have been seeking to annex el sinut for years i have recently taken a wife i would not see her widowed and given to another man because i did not show caution no i will only consider joining you if the others agree first if you fail an example will be made el sinut might be considered expendable by istanbul i must protect my people understand i care not who rules the empire as long as i am left in peace to do my duty to that ruler and oversee the wellbeing of el sinut i am not saying i will not join you just that i would be reassured my more powerful and wealthier neighbors will be part of your scheme when you can bring me that assurance then i will give you my answer hussein aga the mouse is wise to look to the cat eh caynan reis smiled in friendly fashion i appreciate your candor my lord dey and i perfectly understand your position was the silky reply i shall leave tomorrow for algiers tunis and morocco but tonight the dey said genially i insist that you be my guest he clapped his hands and baba hassan was by his side my lord have abu kill a lamb and make a feast for our noble guest baba hassan the dey turned to the janissary you will stay with us of course in the janissary barracks here within the palace walls hussein aga bowed his acceptance aruj agha my friend take our visitor to the baths and see he is made comfortable baba hassan will provide you with fresh clothing for this evening and see that your travelworn garments are cleaned and freshened for your departure tomorrow caynan reis said jovially again the agent from istanbul bowed you are a gracious host my lord dey i shall remember it the two janissaries left the deys private chamber escorted by the chief eunuch caynan reis sat alone contemplating what had just transpired the everresourceful baba hassan had told him but two days ago of the impending arrival of this agent the chief eunuch had built up over the years an invaluable network of informants that stretched all the way from el sinut to istanbul from algiers to damascus whatever was important baba hassan knew in advance the eunuch was a man of great talents and deserved a larger venue but i am glad he is mine caynan reis thought when he had learned of the plot against the sultan he had spoken of it to india as they lay together sated with their passion she had been circumspect in her counsel advising him to prudence and asking has this young sultan been a bad sultan my lord the dey had told his wife that their boy overlord was ruled by his mother who so far had proven wise in her judgments and recommendations the empire was calm and prosperous right now i would avoid committing myself my lord caynan india said i think it dangerous and has any revolt ever executed by the janissaries succeeded avoid giving your loyalty to these traitors he had agreed with her and told both azura and his chief eunuch that he thought his wife very wise for one so young and beautiful now however he realized upon consideration that he had been offered an opportunity to gain the right to have his firstborn son inherit el sinut one day if he could reveal the plot against the sultan to the valideh before it could be enacted would not the sultans mother be grateful caynan reis smiled well pleased chapter i do not like caynan reis hussein aga said to aruj agha as they lounged in the heated bathing pool he spoke turkish why the younger janissary captain asked the visitor from istanbul he is a good public servant and very loyal he answered his superior in turkish the language he had learned as a child the language of the corps of janissaries he is too clever by far telling me to go to the other deys and then return to him i do not trust him he does not mean to support us those who do not support us are our enemies slaves bustled about the two men in the bath preparing the massage benches for the bathers bringing heated towels for them it is his way to be cautious aruj agha defended caynan reis i have known him for ten years now not once have i known him to act dishonorably what you have offered himfreedom from tribute el sinut for himself and his heirsis an irresistible temptation he has only several months ago taken his first wife he will want the security you offer for his sons but his is a little state for years his larger neighbors have hovered like vultures in the desert seeking to annex el sinut for themselves it makes caynan reis a careful man why in allahs name would anyone want this remote piece of earth hussein aga demanded scathingly el sinut has the finest deepwater harbor along the barbary coast that is why our tribute to istanbul has surpassed that of algiers and tunis and beyond the city are date orchards whose harvests exceed any in the region the dates are plumper and sweeter than others it is the soil i am told and we have salt mines as well as a famous mineral spring at the star oasis where the wealthy from all over the easteven from as far as damascus come to be cured aruj agha said i was not aware of how prosperous an area this is hussein aga replied more thoughtfully perhaps you are right and i am seeing jiins where there are none certainly your friendship with this petty dey is not to be discounted i was impressed that he insisted you remain when i asked to speak to him alone it shows a certain respect for the corps of janissaries he has always worked with us hussein aga and frankly he has been more than generous with the wealth we collect on our voyages are you aware that he even sends one ship of tribute to the corps each year and has since he succeeded the previous dey sharif that is why i was sent here first hussein aga said it was believed caynan reis was a friend to us who could be trusted he can be the younger man swore i would stake my own life upon it certainly you now understand his discretion i will accept your word in this matter hussein aga replied i know you for an honorable man i remember you as a boy in the princes school and i know your uncle who is one of our leaders but remember aruj agha if this dey betrays us in any way it will be your duty to kill him you do understand that dont you i hear and obey was the simple reply good good now do you think you can find me a pretty girl to make my evening complete surely a young man as yourself knows a number of pretty girls the older janissary chuckled she will be eagerly waiting for you in your quarters after we have dined with the dey this evening aruj agha said with a smile the two men exited the bathing pool to be enveloped in warm towels by the bath slaves they were dried and massaged and then dressed in clean clothing together they departed the baths to stroll in the palaces public gardens before the evening meal was to be served baba hassan watched them briefly from his high window and then turned to receive the mistress of the baths you have information for me oma not i my lord but refet she drew forward a slight young girl who had been almost hidden behind the bath mistress speak then my child baba hassan said in kindly tones to refet who looked half terrified to be in the august presence of the chief eunuch of the deys palace i am turkish the girl began the two janissaries spoke in that tongue for it is their natural language the older one does not trust the dey because he will not give him an allegiance but aruj agha swore the dey could be trusted thereby soothing the other mans fears nonetheless the visitor told aruj agha that if the dey betrays them aruj agha must kill the dey he agreed then the older man asked for a woman for his bed tonight that is all sir thank you baba hassan said and dismissed the two from his presence then he sat down to consider what he would do of course the woman who pleasured their visitor must be carefully chosen as the dey was little interested in his harem currently perhaps he would allow two of his own women to entertain the two janissaries india of course could not be part of the evening but samara would be happy to be at the deys side and sweet mirmah who had once belonged to aruj agha would be his again for this night the passionate flamehaired sarai would certainly please hussein aga who knew what information the clever sarai might extract from this man in the throes of passion baba hassan arose and went to his master the dey was with his wife and it was obvious they had recently made love the chief eunuch bowed low hiding a smile then he told the dey what the bath attendant had overheard and the plan he had devised for the evening it is better my lord that the two women with the janissaries be those we can trust if however you do not choose to share these two women from your own harem then i shall send for two skilled courtesans from the town who i know are loyal caynan reis laughed softly and his eyes twinkled as he said nay baba hassan my poor ladies have been most neglected of late as i seem to be otherwise occupied with my beautiful wife send my own women and let hussein aga believe i have honored him but why must samara take my place by my husbands side india demanded would it not also do honor to our visitor from istanbul that the deys wife ate with him if this were an ordinary evening my lady baba hassan told her i should not have suggested samara accompany our lord but this is a dangerous situation outside of the palace few know your face it is better for you to be invisible to this man from istanbul i agree the dey replied especially in light of the news my wife has given me this very afternoon my lord baba hassans face broke wide with his smile is there to be a child ahhhh this is what we have all prayed for my lord dey he turned to india may allah rain blessings upon you my lady india may i tell azura india laughed happily i am not entirely certain never having had a child but as the eldest of my mothers children i believe i recognize the signs yes baba hassan you may tell azura and the ladies as well for it will give them some hope of entertaining my husband again it might also take the sting from my choosing only three of the seven this evening to entertain the janissaries if it were i doing the deciding however baba hassan i should give this agent of the janissaries two ladies to amuse himself with for he will surely suspect if only one is sent that she is a spy two though bespeaks the deys generosity i do not believe a fool would have been dispatched upon such a delicate mission why not give him nila as well as sarai he will be so overwhelmed with their voluptuous pulchritude he will not have time to consider anything other than how to gain the most pleasure from those two beauties you plot like a valideh the chief eunuch said admiringly with my lords permission it shall be done my lady india do as my wife suggests the dey agreed is she not clever baba hassan what sons i shall have of her it might just as easily be a daughter india replied my mother had me before my brother henry a daughter would please me too as long as she is as beautiful as her mother the dey declared gallantly and catching up indias hand he kissed it passionately however i hope this first child will be a son my precious not just for me but for el sinut mama has five sons india told him with the hint of a smile then she said you must be prepared for your evening my lord a bath i think for the day has been hot if that vixen samara attempts to seduce you though i shall have her bowstrung baba hassan withdrew chuckling and made his way to azuras apartments where he shared the happy news that india was with child praise allah azura said clapping her hands together then she smiled at the chief eunuch we have been so fortunate baba hassan havent we india is the perfect first wife for caynan reis now let me tell you the rest he replied and went on to explain the decisions that had been made regarding the harem ladies i will instruct sarai and nila myself azura said when he had finished mirmah will be told only to keep aruj agha content i think she retains a weakness for him yet despite the fact she has been in the deys household for several years as for samara you must deal with her yourself i lose my patience with her baba hassan and she will not be pleased that her evening is to end when the dey withdraws for the night i know how to handle her the chief eunuch replied with a smile as long as her dignity is not trampled she will obey the two janissaries arrived in the deys dining chamber to be greeted by mirmah nila sarai and samara richly appareled in fragrant silks their faces quite visible beneath diaphanous veils the dey appeared immediately thereafter smiling and gracious he beckoned samara to his side on the cushions aruj agha recognizing mirmah who sweetly snuggled against him realized that these two women were from the deys own harem and was surprised i considered that perhaps you would enjoy female company this night hussein aga the dey said these women are from my own household he confirmed the flamehaired beauty on your right is called sarai she is extremely skilled in a variety of exotic arts the goldenhaired girl on your left is my own nila she is tireless and will give you exquisite pleasure my sweet mirmah is aruj aghas companion he gave her to me several years ago and i thought he might enjoy her company again hussein aga was almost speechless the two women sent to be his companions were a pair of the most luscious and sensual beauties as he had ever seen their romantic perfume assailed his nostrils lilies and roses unable to help himself he ran a finger down sarais bare arm her skin was like bursa silk she smiled seductively at him showing strong white teeth nila vying for his attention smiled into his eyes running a pointed little pink tongue over her full lips the janissary agent felt suddenly lightheaded and his male member hardened beneath his robes were these women spies who would attempt to extract secrets from him he realized he didnt care particularly when sarai pressed a plump breast against his arm my lord dey he finally managed to speak you honor me far more than i deserve i have never known such fine females as these two they are incomparable my long friendship with aruj agha has always made me favorable toward the corps the dey said sincerely i shall anticipate your return from the other states hussein aga enjoy my women i fear i have ignored them since my recent marriage indeed you have samara said boldly her red lips pouting has he not ladies it is difficult for us to compete with the lady india she is most beautiful accomplished and charming even we cannot dislike her still now she is with child and we shall soon have our chance with our good lord again eh the other women giggled and nodded eagerly your wife is to give you a son then aruj agha smiled warmly at his friend allah has surely blessed you caynan then he chuckled when i think of the first day she arrived in el sinut may i tell hussein aga the tale it is a most amusing one of course the dey replied smiling himself with the memory of a fiery and defiant india as aruj agha began to speak the dey signaled to his servants to begin serving the meal there was a wonderful thick soup of lentils which was accompanied with a hot seasoning of red pepper salt and garlic a couscous covered in a spicy sauce filled with vegetables and chunks of beef a lamb that had been grilled on a spit as well as three chickens stuffed with almonds raisins and rice there were bowls of purple black and green olives in herbed oil and cucumbers in vinegar flat bread warm from the ovens was offered the guests there were bowls of yogurt with peeled green grapes and a platter with a steamed bass caught that very morning lying amid a bed of fennel and carved lemons finally a dessert called khtayef consisting of nuts honey and sugar in thin layers of pastry was served along with cups of mint tea a large silver salver of fresh fruit consisting of green and red grapes sweet cut pink melons peaches apricots pomegranates figs and sugared dates was set upon the table so the deys guests might help themselves there were bowls of shelled almonds and pistachio nuts when all but the fruit and nuts had been cleared away the dey clapped his hands for the entertainment to begin a snake charmer came with his reed baskets of reptiles he was followed by a troupe of sensual female dancers who writhed and twisted themselves in a variety of movements to the high sound of a flute and the deep thump of drums as they removed veil after veil in a teasing and tantalizing fashion until they were quite naked finally a young blind girl was led in and seated accompanied by three other women who played upon a rebec reed pipe and small drum as the girl sang sweetly passionate love songs caynan reis watched the janissaries as his women began a subtle seduction of the pair sarais hand had already slipped between the folds of hussein agas robes and from the look on the mans face she was as skillful as ever after the girl had sung for a time the dey raised his hand saying i believe it is time for me to retire i will personally see you off in the morning hussein aga enjoy your night then arising caynan reis left the dining chamber with samara whom he escorted back to the harem you did well he told the girl kissing her softly upon the lips i am a patient woman my lord she told him dark eyes twinkling do not let my wife hear you saying things like that he chuckled and then brushed her lips a final time sleep well samara she watched him retreat down the dim corridor a smile upon her lips soon the lady india would grow fat with her child and the dey would seek the diversion of his harem she would be favored once again baba hassan had assured her it was bound to happen and it would finally samara turned away and entered the fountain court caynan reis had felt her stare as he walked down the long hallway to baba hassans quarters he needed to speak with his chief eunuch now if his plan was to be put into action he hurried into the eunuchs apartments baba hassan he said without any preamble to his advisor who was seated upon a divan enjoying his water pipe i have a plan that will keep el sinut from treason and give me what i want he sat down in a chair of carved cedar with a leather seat and what exactly is it that you want my lord the eunuch asked his master putting down his water pipe his look attentive and curious the janissaries plot will fail they always fail the sublime porte will seek revenge and it will be more prudent for them to revenge themselves upon the barbary states than upon those who are truly responsible that is truth my lord dey baba hassan agreed but what if el sinut exposed the janissaries plot before they had an opportunity to enact it the dey inquired would not the valideh be grateful would she not want to reward her loyal dey of el sinut would she not give him this tiny kingdom in gratitude if he but asked her tribute would still be paid and fealty given to the sultan but el sinut would be mine and my familys forever baba hassan was silent for several long moments his look was a thoughtful one he was obviously considering his masters words very carefully at last he spoke it is dangerous my lord very dangerous yet there is danger also in knowing of this plot and not notifying istanbul of its existence while you should make a friend of the sultan and his mother you will make deadly enemies of the janissaries we know from the bath attendant refet that aruj agha has been ordered to kill you should you betray the corps and that he has said he would i believe he said it to pacify hussein aga the dey replied our friendship is an old and valued one aruj agha will not kill me my lord one thing you have never really comprehended about your friend aruj aghas first loyalty is to the corps of janissaries his grandfather was a janissary and his uncle is one he was taken from his family in bosnia when he was a little boy and raised in the princes school in istanbul even at his mothers knee the lesson of loyalty to the corps was drummed into him it is a lesson without end his first ranking was as a gardener in the sultans palace the gardeners there are the royal executioners they are all young men eager to prove their worth not so much to the sultan but to the corps and to their officers to date you two have never really been in conflict but do not ask aruj agha to change loyalties to take your part over that of the corps of janissaries he will not do it even if he believes the hierarchy wrong you must not ever trust him again if you decide to do this thing what choice do i have baba hassan caynan reis asked his friend and advisor the other states will jump at the opportunity to be free from istanbul and its tribute if hussein aga returns to me i must pledge my aid if i do not i will be counted their enemy and they will seek to assassinate me the sublime porte will be only too happy to use me as their scapegoat el sinut being small they can afford to punish us while the other states are large and could prove troublesome i am caught between two fires on the other hand if i expose the janissaries plot i have a better chance of remaining alive i will ask that the sultan remove the janissaries from el sinut once we are independent i will form my own guard to protect me el sinut will belong to me and to my sons and my sons sons it is worth the risk tell me if there is another way baba hassan that i can keep us all safe there is no other way my lord it will be as allah wills it the eunuch replied fatalistically caynan reis nodded wearily now my old friend how do we approach the valideh in istanbul you will have a way i am certain we will use two paths my lord our chances will be better at reaching the sultans mother in time if we do i have several pigeons a gift to me from the agha kislar of the royal household most men in my position hold these birds we will release three to make their way back to the capital with our message i shall also send by ship the gift of two young boys to the sultan they will be accompanied by my most trusted aide aliali he will carry a personal message to the agha kislar from me what if he attempts to read your message the dey asked the message will be in a code known only to the agha kislar and those to whom he entrusts his messenger birds it is a good system why are you sending young boys instead of beautiful girls the dey wondered the valideh has encouraged her son in his youth to enjoy the company of boys over girls that way no beautiful young creature will arise to challenge the validehs control over the sultan by either her erotic wiles or by giving the sultan a son of his own in time of course that will change but our way into favor is through pretty young boys right now and not pretty young girls how will we know that the sultan has received our warning baba hassan and will he receive it in time caynan reis asked we will not know until aliali returns my lord i regret that is the fact of it but remember it will take many weeks for hussein aga to complete his mission and return to el sinut then he has a voyage to istanbul the pigeons i release in two days time know only to fly to their home in the yeni serai that is how they are trained they do not forget their way that is why the agha kislar will return the birds to me when aliali rejoins us and we will outflank the traitorous janissaries i understand but why are you waiting two days to send the birds on their way baba hassan should they not be sent at first light tomorrow because my lord hussein aga is undoubtedly aware of the agha kislars pigeons what if he saw one on the wing as he left the palace or the harbor these pigeons are quite unique they are white with blackandwhite markings and very pink feet not your ordinary gardenvariety bird that one sees upon the roofs of the town or cadging tidbits in the marketplace they are recognizable to the knowledgeable so we will wait until this agent of the janissaries has restarted his journey and is away from el sinut we must be extremely cautious in this matter agreed the dey said and then he arose only azura can know of our plan baba hassan your wife must know as well the chief eunuch advised she is a clever girl and will be of use to you if she is aware of all that is going on in this situation but what of the child will she not endanger the child not knowing is more dangerous my lord she is a passionate lady with a great imagination if she worries and frets from a position of ignorance she is more apt to harm her baby the true knowledge of what is happening will give her courage and strength after all my lord you seek el sinut for your son but the child is her son as well you must not forget that women grow irritated and justly so when a man behaves as if his son is his alone and only his doing particularly after a wife has carried her child within her own body for almost a years time how can you have such wisdom baba hassan the dey inquired there have never been any children in this palace at least not in my time or our lord sharifs time in my youth the eunuch said i served upon the young ikbal of a former sultan in the harem of the yeni serai itself my lord such a large place and there were many children including the daughter of my young mistress of course that was the girls downfall and her salvation having a daughter but the sultan was no longer interested in her once she was with child and if the truth be known she was a pretty but stupid creature the female infant she birthed was just one of many little girls born to the sultan my mistress became a troublemaker she was finally sent with her child to the eski serai the old palace i was reassigned to accompany the lady azura to el sinut as a gift from the sultan to his most loyal dey sharif that is how i can tell you about breeding women and their infants the chief eunuch finished with a deep chuckle i have learned much in my fifty years my lord i must bow to your wisdom the dey said with a small smile baba hassan chuckled again i am at your service always my lord dey in the morning caynan reis met with hussein aga before the agent of the janissaries departed the palace for his ship was your evening a pleasant one hussein aga the dey asked his guest pleasantly noting the older man looked as if he had not slept a great deal never have i known such a night was the enthusiastic reply the dey of algiers will surely not be able to equal your hospitality nor the dey of tunis i shall look forward with much anticipation to my return visit both sarai and nila are houriis without parallel he bowed low to the dey i am glad we have been able to offer you a pleasant diversion in your travels was the smooth reply and the dey bowed slightly may allah guide you and give you a safe journey i shall await your return to el sinut farewell hussein aga dismissed the janissary exited the room and did you enjoy your companion last night aruj agha the dey asked turning to his friend i did as always she is a pleasure to bed caynan but why were you so generous to hussein aga from what he has told me your two women almost killed him with pleasure were you attempting to slay him only with kindness so he would not take offense that i did not pledge allegiance to the janissaries plot against the sultan was the answer how can i unless the others do so first but you will pledge us fealty if the larger states do aruj agha probed his friend you know i will do what is best for el sinut the dey said sincerely have i not always and have i not always respected and supported the corps you have indeed aruj agha said placated that is what i told hussein aga in the baths yesterday when he expressed doubts of your loyalty the dey clapped his friend upon the back we are like two draft animals harnessed together my friend he said between us we have kept el sinut prosperous and safe i am a good administrator but i could not have ruled without your cooperation may it always be so as allah wills it aruj agha agreed how go the repairs on your vessel the dey inquired well we should be able to set sail in another month and osman is working very hard to prepare his round ship for service i believe we shall go out together the first time i mean to allow him to captain the sultan murat but of course my troop of janissaries will be aboard it is customary for janissaries to be aboard our ships the dey said calmly i think you wise to take a seasoned captain and restore him to his rank my wife will be pleased you do honor to her cousin and india was indeed delighted with the news perhaps when we send the janissaries packing she said my cousin will help you form your new guard my lord there are many good men from europe who might welcome such an opportunity you must be more discreet my precious he advised nothing has been graven in stone yet and we must not tip our hand he sighed i regret that i dare not trust aruj agha in this matter but baba hassan is right my friends loyalty is to the corps of janissaries perhaps when the time comes he will see the wisdom in your actions india attempted to sooth her husband the dey truly enjoyed this one male friend with whom he hunted in the hills and until india had come played chess it would be lonely for caynan when aruj agha was sent back to istanbul but certainly her cousin tom southwood osman might take his place she wished she might see tom but now it was no longer possible at least not until he was admitted to the deys inner circle as a trusted captain as well as the relation of the deys first wife thomas southwood had heard that the dey had made india his wife he was relieved she had gotten some common sense and was protected he had no doubt that given the chance she would want to return to england and he intended that when he went she would go too he had promised it to her those many months ago and how could he justify leaving her behind to the family enough of their female relations had been in the same situation as india and they had returned home there was no great trarah over it indias fat dowry would erase any number of sins in the eyes of a titled husband particularly one in the highlands who would have never heard of el sinut he had no doubt both indias grandmother and her mother knew of ways of making what was broken quite whole again indias husband would have no doubt as to his brides virginity tom southwood had been patient he understood that if he wanted to succeed he had to bide his time how many poor fools had attempted escape from captivity in the barbary states and ended up dead he had counseled those of his crewmen who had remained with him to practice forbearance they were not illtreated and indeed except for being confined to certain areas they suffered not at all it is a great adventure you will tell your grandchildren in devon one day he assured them learn everything you can from the place enjoy the women enjoy the food enjoy the sun and the warmth i will get us back to england and while he kept their spirits up he thought carefully of how they would make their escape to be successful the planning must be faultless there was so much involved he ruminated over and over again on it like a cow with a cud the lighthouse keepers would have to be incapacitated so they could not raise an alarm the great chain between the two lighthouses at the harbors entrance would have to be lowered and then raised again most believed the chain was raised only when an attack on el sinut was thought to be imminent few realized it was raised each night to protect el sinut from a surprise onslaught it had been the states policy as long as anyone could remember that vessels were not welcome in el sinuts harbor either before sunrise or after sunset the hardest thing however would involve getting into the palace by stealth to bring india and her servant girl out tom southwood had learned that his cousins personal servant was a scottish girl the daughter of a ships captain killed when his vessel was taken few of that crew had survived but three had ended up in el sinut and one had been wise enough to accept islam he had been assigned to osmans crew it was from this seaman captain southwood had discovered indias serving maid was one of them she would therefore be rescued as well but how he was going to do it was a difficult problem and adrian leigh he was another problem there was simply no way they could rescue him as he was chained to his oar with several other men to attempt to free viscount twyford would endanger their plan for his shipmates would want to come too and then so would all the other galley slaves on aruj aghas ship many of them were unsavory types and uncontrollable they would want to rape and pillage el sinut before departing such rash behavior would destroy any chances they had of making a clean escape it just couldnt be done and he hoped that india would not be too distressed over it they would of course notify young leighs family as to his whereabouts when they returned to england it would be up to them to ransom the young man then but at least they would know where he was slowly and carefully tom southwood set everything in place his men were primed and ready to go it was just a matter of time they had to pick the right time for he knew they would only get one chance if they failed they would be killed and their deaths would not be easy or pleasant ones he had seen what had happened to men who attempted to escape their captivity here on the barbary coast he did not intend such a death to happen to him or to any of his men he would be as patient now that the moment approached as he had been over these past months then he would succeed and they would be home in england within a year of their having been gone soon he told his men it will be soon i feel it in my bones each one of you knows your task when i give you the word there can be no mistakes men and then thomas southwood saw the perfect opportunity chapter india lay naked in her husbands arms smiling up at him i understand you wanting to hunt and camp in the hills with aruj agha for a few days she told him sweetly i have five brothers and many uncles and cousins my lord hunting is a mans sport he caressed her beautiful breasts lightly watching with pleasure as her nipples responded did you ever hunt with the men he asked her i had heard women in your land enjoy the hunt some do my mother and my younger sister both enjoyed riding off with my father and brothers to spend a day on the hills or in the forest but i never really enjoyed such sport twisting herself about she licked the flesh of his belly then looked up at him seductively this is the sport i favor she murmured you are insatiable he said laughing softly and pulling her back into his embrace where he might continue to caress her she had the loveliest body and being just newly with child that body had not yet begun to change her belly was yet flat and her rounded limbs in perfect proportion the only change he could see was in her breasts which had become a bit rounder and the nipples more sensitive he pulled her about so that she sat upon his thighs facing him and leaning forward he took one of those nipples into his mouth his hand holding the breast to which it belonged firmly in his grasp her senses were atingle her nipple was like a small stone niblet yet so sensitive that she could feel most distinctly his tongue encircling it over and over again and when she thought she could bear no more of his teasing he pushed her further suckling hard upon her nipple while he pushed a single finger between her plump nether lips to find her pleasure place indias head was whirling as her entire being was suddenly focused in a different area the finger pressed gently and then began to graze the sentient softness until it stiffened and she was moaning helplessly as the swells of hot delight began to overwhelm her sweeping through her body and wracking her with shudders of pleasure you devil she half groaned at him do you enjoy torturing me cease cease i am close to fainting laughing he pushed her onto her back and covered her body with his own his lips nibbling at her mouth aye i enjoy torturing you you exquisite creature he rubbed himself suggestively against her i shall not allow you the upper hand tonight my precious i far too much enjoy your cries of satisfaction his hungry kiss caught her unawares as he pushed his manhood into her trembling body he filled her full gently thrusting to and fro do you enjoy this torture india my love he kissed her again she tightened herself about him pulling her head away from him and demanding boldly and do you enjoy this torture my lord her legs wrapped themselves about his torso squeezing him outwardly every bit as much as she was squeezing him inwardly ahhhh bitch you mean to kill me do you think of me when you are camped in the damp hills my lord she taunted him suggestively in the dark of night remember my warmth he began to move fiercely upon her and you remember my passion as you lay alone in your bed my precious india he said his mouth once more taking hers in an almost cruel kiss she could hardly breathe for a moment it seemed as if his lips were all there were in the worldand it was enough she could feel the tensions building within her fevered body building and building until it burst in a wild frenzy and they collapsed in each others arms sated for the moment india lay against his chest listening as his heartbeat eased slowly from its rapid pulse to a calmer thump she rubbed her cheek against his skin it was smooth and damp with his relieved lust and his fragrance warm and musky she had been surprised to discover that men had their own scent and his was not unpleasant rather it had become familiar and comforting i love you caynan she murmured kissing his nipple with a sigh his arm tightened about her i love you he responded ah yes he did love her so much so that he intended keeping his promise to her when he returned from the hunt he had recently found a protestant minister in the town a gentle lutheran who had agreed to marry the dey to his first wife and keep the secret of their christian marriage i understand well my lord the need for silence it would weaken your position should it be known you yielded to a womans plea still allah will bless you for it it is obvious you respect god no matter the way in which he is worshipped then the old minister smiled conspiratorially i respect god in his many incarnations too which is why i am in el sinut i am not a man for strict doctrine which gave great distress to my superiors i was put here to help redeem protestant captives it was my bishops way of keeping me from corrupting the innocent he concluded with a merry chuckle the dey had smiled at the kind old minister i appreciate your discretion he said it will make india happy and it is important to me that she is happy we will come to you in a few days for it is easier for me to bring her in secret from the palace than if you were seen within my home and in return pastor haussler you will always have access to me in the matter of protestant captives to be ransomed the minister had thanked him profusely tears in his eyes and the dey returned to the palace aye they would be wed as he knew indias parents would want it that way and there was something else he intended to tell india that he was english that he was deverall leigh adrians halfbrother and the true heir to the earl of oxton he knew this would come as a shock to her but he also knew that she would believe him when he told her he did not murder charles jeffers that he had been accused unjustly and being young fled rather than remain to prove his innocence if indeed he could have proved it after all it had been his knife that appeared to have done the deed a dagger of which he was extremely proud because it had come from his mothers family a dagger well known to be his prized possession india would understand and then he would pay a ransom for adrian out of his own coffers and send his halfbrother to his uncle in naples whatever the lad did afterward was his business but he suspected adrian would not go home to england immediately for fear of the duke of glenkirk and finally when india had delivered their child he would allow her to write to her parents he would not let them suffer as his father had been forced to suffer all these years looking down on his wife he stroked her dark curls gently as she slept when the morning came she climbed sleepily from her bed to bathe him a chore she refused to relinquish saw that he ate a hearty breakfast and walked with him properly veiled into the courtyards to see him off with aruj agha the janissary bowed low to her and india nodded graciously in his direction keep my husband safe from danger kapitan she said i will my lady india he told her with a smile reentering the palace she was met by samara who took her by the hand and said come to the harem nila and sarai are going to tell us how they entertained the visitor from istanbul they have saved the tale for just such a time as this so we might all be amused and enlightened although i doubt there is anything they could tell me that i do not already know she concluded smugly india would have preferred to refuse for she wanted to be alone but knew to do so would offend so she allowed samara to lead her into the fountain court where the women were already seated awaiting her mirmah immediately arose and called out to india come my lady and sit here she led india to a comfortable divan insisting she put her feet up i have heard it is good to do so when you are with child she said when the women were finally all settled and cakes fruit and sherbet had been offered samara said impatiently well sarai laughed her smoky laugh we all know that a manhood comes in three lengths the smallest being called the little fish the mediumsized being the naughty monkey and finally the largest being called the stallion hussein aga was none of these the women gasped with surprise what was he deva finally ventured we nicknamed him the bull sarai replied with a wink never in all my days nila told them have i seen a manhood so large this janissary was enormous as we all know our lord the dey is a stallion and has a most magnificent weapon none of us have ever been discontent with him but hussein aga was huge being both lengthy and thick set and he was as randy as a billy goat sarai said we disrobed him and when we had he was already waving his banner at us the women giggled even india she had not thought to enjoy this form of entertainment but she was amused go on go on she encouraged the two women i am the virtual innocent in this room the others giggled again and then sarai continued he had strong limbs and a very broad chest he put an arm around each of us and walked with us to the bed we lay him upon his back and immediately sought to ease his excitement he assured us however that he was a tireless lover we should both be more than well satisfied by the dawn we assured him then that he too would be quite gratified i then began to caress him with my hair nila said he liked that but he liked it even better when i took that lengthy rod within my mouth i practically swallowed him whole and he began to moan like a boy with his first woman i would suckle him until he believed he would erupt and then i would cease and begin to lick at him finally when he could take no more of such pleasure i mounted him absorbing slowly his great length allah he filled me well he was half mad with lust by then sarai took up the tale his eyes were practically bulging from his head she pouted nila was having all the fun and so i put my love box over his face pressing my nether lips against his fleshy mouth and rubbing at first he didnt seem able to breathe but then his tongue poked through finding my pleasure place it was a most clever tongue eager and tireless my love juices were very copious he drank them like a man who has been lost in the desert for three days his pointed tongue going beyond my pleasure place into my sheath while his hot mouth devoured me nila and i entered paradise at almost the same moment and while she took her own pleasure from hussein aga i rode him hard his manhood was stiffer than any i have known previously forcing itself deeper than any man has gone within me i have never partaken of such fierce lust i might have been fearful had it not felt so good before i closed my eyes and gave myself over to this dark pleasure i could see his big hands holding tightly on to sarais ivory bottom nila told them the other women were silent their eyes wide with fascination go on samara finally managed to croak nila was weeping with pleasure but the brute was not satisfied sarai told them he pushed her off his lance and rolling me onto my back pistoned me until i was but half conscious only then did he explode his seed into me did you leah began twice more in those moments sarai told them you named him well laylu told the two women enviously tell us more mirmah demanded did he take either of you as the janissaries are said to do each of us nila told them but only once for we did not like it and reminded him we belonged to the dey who did not use us in such a fashion still i have to admit i found it exciting yet too perverse i did not sarai told them he was so big i was afraid he would hurt me with that huge rod of his india looked puzzled i dont understand she said he entered them through their bottomholes samara said without any pretensions of delicacy janissaries are raised without the company of women they are known when young to experiment erotically upon one another later of course they know women but not as boys it is unhealthy for a boy once his jewels have formed and matured to pen up his juices there is little harm in what they do i think it is awful india said with a shudder the other women but for samara nodded she however smiled knowingly a woman must do that which pleasures her lord no matter her own tastes i deny our lord the dey nothing of my person it was meanly said india was stricken for a moment she but babbles like a brook sarai said to the deys wife and then she glared at samara your tongue is so acid that you could engrave brass pots with it none of us have ever received the dey in such a fashion and you know it samara do not distress our mistress samara shrugged but said nothing else leaving the inference to lie writhing in indias mind she is a terrible liar mirmah whispered we know our master every bit as much as she does and he does not do such things i want to make him happy india said softly you have mirmah replied you are to give him a child and that samara will never be able to do she is bitter do not mind her my lady india mirmahs kind words revived indias spirit and she said go on with your tale ladies i am learning much just listening to you i shall attempt to put into practice very soon much of what you have told me this day some of it sounds very wicked there is nothing wicked in pleasing a man deva said particularly if you receive pleasure in return the women all nodded and sarai and nila took up their story once again they spoke of kisses and caresses of how the janisssary had asked them to make love to each other and been aroused quickly by the sight taking them each in turn immediately afterward he had been as tireless as they had been baba hassan had seen to several basins and love cloths as well as a decanter of a restorative liquid the trio imbibed throughout the night until finally an hour before the dawn they had all fallen asleep he says he will have us when he returns to el sinut sarai told them with amusement i wonder if the dey will be so generous again he told us he was only giving us to this man in order to placate him temporarily i do not think he will do it again aye nila agreed there is a limit to our masters hospitality india remained within the harem to have supper with the ladies returning to her own apartments in azuras company later in the evening meggie hurried to prepare her mistress for bed she is a good servant azura noted as the girl bustled about baba hassan chose well india agreed you are happy the older woman said very happy india assured her ohh azura i love him i would not have thought such a thing possible a year ago i was but a spoiled child but now i am different because of him oh yes i am happier than i have ever been in my entire lifetime i am happy to hear you say so india azura answered the deys young wife i will be frank with you but perhaps you have already suspected it baba hassan and i somehow knew you were the perfect wife for caynan reis and we strove hard to make you see it too india laughed it did occur to me but only when i realized my love for him azura she flung herself into the older womans embrace he is the son you never had isnt he aye he is azura admitted mama has always said that ones life is planned even before one is born no wonder i could not find a husband to suit me in england or scotland caynan reis was here in el sinut if i had not been so silly as to run away with adrian leigh i should have never found my only true love azura how strange life is the older woman hugged india and placed a kiss upon her brow allah who sees all and knows all led you to us my daughter then her tone grew brisk and she released india from her embrace you have had a long day let your little servant help you into bed you carry the heir to el sinut and he must be protected eh india nodded smiling contentedly the next day passed quietly but the weather usually sunny was overcast a rarity in october storm clouds appeared over the sea in midmorning and by late afternoon had swept into el sinut with a driving rainstorm and much thunder the town was virtually deserted and even the intrepid stall owners in the marketplace had closed down we go tonight tom southwood told his men in this storm captain jeremiah james the second mate asked they are not used to having such storms in autumn here and they will all keep to their houses until the morning when it has passed completely it is the best time mr james weve sailed in far worse blows than this one no its indeed a perfect time what are we going to do with the el sinut crewmen captain francis bolton his first mate inquired in all this planning it is the one thing you havent told us if were going tonight we need to know now ive thought long and hard on it mr bolton thomas southwood said i considered giving them leave because of this storm but there is always the chance one or more of them might return to the ship find it gone and raise the alarm i considered killing them but i dont really want to do that if i can avoid it our only option is to capture each of them over the next hour or so bind and gag them and throw them in the hole we will leave them with the lighthouse keepers after we have cleared the harbor by the time any of them gets loose or is discovered we will be well out to sea and away from el sinut and her ladyship knox the steward queried you mr james and i will rescue my cousin and her servant from the palace as soon as it gets dark knox mr bolton you will have charge of the ship until we get back if we do not return an hour before dawn leave sail the royal charles home to england and tell my family what has transpired at least they will know where lady india is how will you get into the palace captain knox asked his master we aint going to just walk in are we thomas southwood laughed no knox we arent going to walk in at all were going to climb a wall i have converted two of our smaller anchors into grapnels they will aid us in climbing over the deys palace wall you however the captain told his horrified steward will await mr james and me on the street side of the wall and help the ladies when we bring them down his three companions looked askance and so thomas southwood continued with a more detailed explanation for months i have been going in and out of the palace always looking always studying it for a weakness the deys living quarters and his harem are located within an inner court it would appear that none of its walls is located on an outer avenue i mentioned this to aruj agha noting it was cleverly done and similar in design to early english castles he told me in confidence that the structure was similar to the sultans palace in istanbul but that it did have one small weakness a far corner in the deys own private garden just about three feet of wall space faced on its far side into a small alley off a quiet little residential street when i asked why the alley had not been blocked to protect such a vulnerable area aruj agha told me that the wall was fifteen feet high and always kept free of vines and any other growth that might aid a trespasser besides he said no one had ever realized what was behind that high wall and the alley was so remote from the main square of the town that not even the street beggars knew of it i have walked this city each time we put into port seeking that little culdesac i found it only recently are you certain captain that it is the correct wall mr bolton the first mate asked him positive was the reply i went only a few days ago into the hills above the city when i found a good vista i sat down and studied the palace eventually i found that little susceptible space i had brought a small glass with me then i followed the wall observing the street niche letting my eye take note of certain landmarks when i returned to the town i went immediately to the alley and matched what i had marked perfectly i have the correct location mr bolton is aruj agha aware of what he told you the careful mr bolton persisted yere sure it aint no trap yer walking into thomas southwood shook his head tis no trap francis aruj agha is proud of his status not only as the janissary agha in el sinut but as the deys confidant he is a good soldier he has a good heart he is loyal to a fault but he is prone to bragging about his knowledge and his importance he did not i assure you even realize what he had said for i was careful not to arouse his suspicions by asking too many questions besides both the dey and the agha are hunting up in the mountains beyond the city they only left yesterday another reason this is the best time for us to make good our escape and the rescue of my cousin lady india well captain mr bolton said you got it figured out just so it would appear god help and protect us all this night i aint so much worried once we get out to sea especially with those cannons the janissaries have installed on the ship well be a match for anyone im thinking particularly if we flys the deys banner here in the mediterranean mr james suggested right now this is a turkish lake captain knox spoke softly perhaps it might be wise to take yer lady cousin to her grandmothers in italy rather than expose her to the long voyage home to england particularly as theres always the chance we might have to fight a battle or two along the way you might be right knox thomas southwood considered aruj agha will assume we have headed for gibralter it will not occur to him that we have gone to naples lady india would be safe with her fathers mother safer there than on the high seas with us i think we will do just that good man knox thank you captain the steward said flushing with pride time we got about the business of sorting the wheat from the chaff captain mr bolton remarked dryly aye tis time thomas southwood agreed the word was passed swiftly among the english and few europeans who made up a portion of the crew the el sinut men were taken without incident bound with strong cords gagged with silk cloths their eyes blindfolded with dark cloths then they were locked in the hole chained three feet apart along the walls you will be safe as long as you make no attempt to escape thomas southwood told them sternly any man foolish enough to try will be killed immediately i will not be deterred and neither will my men he then left them in the fetid and damp darkness on the deck the rain still poured down as the thunder rumbled interspersed by an occasional flash of lightning that brightened the skies briefly how do we get to your alley captain mr james inquired well take the horses assigned to the ship theyre in the dockside stable with only a boy watching over them i told the stableman he might go home and keep his wife company on this wet night i said i expected she would be afraid and he might comfort her then i winked at him broadly and he could hardly wait to go the boy is too young to ask questions and has been fed drugged sweets well only take three horses not to arouse any suspicion should someone actually be about in the streets the women can ride pillion on our return let us go now he said picking up his cloak and tossing it about his shoulders he hurried out the door followed by mr james and the faithful knox leaving the first mate behind to watch over the ship good luck captain and godspeed mr bolton called softly after the trio the stable lad was only a visible lump in a pile of yellow straw recognizable by his snores a halfemptied basket of fruit and candies by his side his face covered with the remains of pink turkish paste they saddled the three horses quietly leading them from the stable and closing the door behind themselves mounting their animals they followed thomas southwood as he led them in a circuitous route through the silent and empty streets of el sinut the rain continued to pour down as they finally gained the little alley which indeed as their captain had said was practically invisible they would have ridden right by it had not the captain been with them entering the alley they dismounted their horses and knox took the beasts in his charge as thomas southwood and mr james took the grapnels from their saddle horns first one and then the other grapnel was flung upward each one burying itself tightly by its fluked spikes into the top of the whitewashed wall without a word the two men began to climb the wall and when they had reached the top they pulled their ropes up behind them and dropped them on the walls far side so they might descend almost immediately they slid away and out of knoxs sight the ships steward waited nervously in the rain with the three horses his heart hammering starting nervously at a clap of thunder but remembering himself calming the horses while praying beneath his breath dropping into the garden thomas southwood looked about him he could see the palace on the far side of the area and lights flickering through the carved screens that were enclosed by delicate arches reaching out he wordlessly touched mr jamess arm indicating that his second mate should follow him silently the two men slipped along the graveled paths it was as he had expected there were no guards in the deys private enclosure he stopped and listened there was enough light now being emitted from behind the latticed screens for he and mr james to see each other thomas southwood put a cautionary finger to his lips and listened good night my lady azura he heard india say and a door closed firmly meggie run and fetch me my supper i am ravenous yes my lady was the reply and again the door opened and closed motioning with his hand for his mate to remain where he was thomas southwood slid a latticed screen softly aside and stepped into the room good evening india he said softly india recognized his voice and stifling her cry whirled about tom southwood are you mad she whispered if you are found here you will be killed and i will have no power to save you her beautiful face betrayed her anxiety for him i have come to rescue you india he said i promised you i would take you with me when i left el sinut i am keeping my promise we go tonight i am told your servant is scotch we will take her too no india said firmly i am married now tom and i am content to remain here with my lord go now before you are caught i wish you good luck tell my family that i am happy i am taking you with me india he said in a determined tone how can i return home to england without you tom try and understand me i am happy i love caynan reis i am his wife we went before the iman months ago i will not desert my husband and my family would certainly understand admittedly it has been an odd courting but it is a perfect pairing i swear to you she told him go now i dare not ask how you gained entry here you havent changed at all he said you are still as headstrong and stubborn as you ever were india i am not leaving without you now fetch your jewel box if you so desire we must go as soon as your servant returns my second mate is waiting outside and we will escort you to the ship we must sail immediately while we have the cover of this unexpected storm from the north my lord will come soon and he will kill you india lied caynan reis is in the mountains with aruj agha he answered do you think i should have been so foolish as to enter this palace when your husband was here and we could not have taken back the ship if aruj agha was among us hurry now they both heard the footsteps at the same time india grew pale but thomas southwood stepped behind the carved door even as it opened and meggie bustled into the chamber ive brought your supper my lady abu thought you would enjoy a nice hot soup tonight do not scream meggie india said taking the tray from her and setting it down on her cedar table the girl looked puzzled momentarily and then her eyes widened as thomas southwood stepped into her line of vision my lady this is my cousin he says he has come to rescue me meggie i will not go with him of course but if you want to i will not stop you i know that you like me fret over your mother theres nothing for me back in scotland but me mam and she probably thinks i am dead along with me da its better left that way im thinking ian will hae wed wi flora maclean and shed make certain i was considered damaged goods she always hated me because my ian preferred me to her nay ill stay wi you my lady you are both coming with me thomas southwood said and ill have no further argument from either of you if you do not leave now tom i shall scream and the guards will come india told him stonily why cant you listen to reason he demanded of her why can you not believe me when i tell you i love caynan reis and i am content to remain here in el sinut she countered glaring angrily at him go tom go now he turned away and then swinging about suddenly hit her a blow on the chin catching her as she collapsed to the floor come on lassie he said to the shocked and wideeyed meggie as he moved through the open screen wait sir let me get us cloaks or we shall be soaked through with this rain and the mistress catch her death meggie pleaded hurry lassie he told her meggie bit her lip as she opened the trunk drawing out two long enveloping capes should she make a dash for the door and alert the guards that this man was kidnapping the deys wife or should she just take the capes and follow along this man was her mistresss blood relation would her lady thank her if the dey had him beheaded it was a terrible quandary meggie finally decided that she didnt want anyones death on her conscience she put one of the capes about her own shoulders and bringing the other to where thomas southwood stood she draped it over her unconscious mistress get a scarf lassie he commanded her and she hurried to comply dont be startled my second mate is with me and hell help you she followed him and his companion across the garden to the farthest wall where two thick ropes hung down there they stopped and mr james using the silk scarf tied indias wrists together and then lifted her up and put her arms about thomas southwoods neck shes dead weight captain it will be harder he said i know mr james but you heard her resisting me in her usual stubborn fashion i had no choice but to clip her on the jaw we could not stay any longer he grasped the rope and began to pull himself slowly and with great effort up the wall put your arms about me neck lassie the second mate said i can make it up sooner than he can and we can help him eh meggie obeyed him wordlessly and before she knew it the mate was shinnying up the rope like a monkey despite the burden upon his back he made her sit atop the wall and then reaching down helped his captain the final few feet the ropes were then drawn up and thrown over the street side the descent was far easier and meggie found herself on the ground before she knew it to her surprise another man was waiting holding three horses is mlady all right he whispered nervously she didnt want to come the silly wench thomas southwood said i had to hit her for her own good to bring her along a rumble of thunder sounded above them and the horses nickered and danced nervously lets get going thomas southwood said as mr james lifted india from his back he mounted his animal and reaching down took india up upon his horse cradling her in his arms drawing her hood up to keep her from getting soaked next to him the other two men had mounted their horses and meggie was riding pillion behind mr james they began their return journey to the harbor reaching it in what seemed like a rather brief time to the young servant girl the horses were replaced in the stables by the captain and mr james while knox carried india aboard followed closely by meggie he settled them in the captains cabin where are we going sir meggie ventured why home lassie god be willing knox said i have to lock you in until we clears the harbor tend to your mistress now theres water and fruit on the table im sorry we have no wine but as you know they dont hold with spirits here he closed the door behind him and meggie heard the key turn in the lock india had been placed upon the captains bed and now meggie hurried to see if her mistress was returning to consciousness quickly she untied the ladys bound wrists she gasped softly and shook her head in disbelief at the purple bruise forming on indias jaw oh the brute the servant said coldly i hope my lady isnt angered at me for not crying out when i had the chance but i couldnt live wi myself if i had hae the deaths of those three men on my conscience she shook her head and going to the table poured some water raising india up she gently tried to force a little water down her throat india coughed and her golden eyes flew open meggie her hand went to her jaw ohh that hurts her glance swept the cabin where are we she asked her servant aboard ship my lady he hit you and then carried you from the palace ohh my lady had i cried for the guards they would have killed him and hes your kin i didnt know what to do its all right meggie ill kill him myself india said have we left port yet theyre getting under way now despite this storm was the frightened reply that knox has locked us in i fear damnation india swore and attempted to arise but she fell back with a groan allah im so dizzy then her hands went protectively to her flat belly but everything else seemed all right give it a few minutes my lady meggie advised and then well try sitting you up there aint nothing we can do now anyhow you must keep my secret meggie india said meaningfully the young servant understood and asked why didnt you tell him my lady then he would have left you in peace i was going to if he continued to persist but he turned away as if he would go then he suddenly pivoted about and hit me i did not have the chance india said now what am i going to do we are locked in and tom is too busy getting his ship under way no i must keep my secret for now i will think of some way to escape him i have escaped my family before that mr knox says we are going home to england my lady meggie informed her mistress it will be weeks before we see land again you have no place to escape to i fear i have learned patience in el sinut india said wisely when we arrive in london we shall give my cousin the slip my parents have shut up the london house but i can get into greenwood and there is no staff there now but the gatekeeper and his wife we can easily avoid them i will get a message to my husband telling him where we are it will all take time and my child will probably be born before caynan reis can come for me but he will come i know it in the meantime however i intend to give my cousin thomas southwood as difficult a time as possible india concluded with a wicked chuckle the heroic fool treated me as if i was still a child instead of a woman grown he will pay for that piece of foolishness the ship moved slowly from its dock edging its way in the choppy waters toward the channel that led between the two lighthouses guarding the harbor the rain continued to beat down the thunder booming the jagged streaks of lightning flashing across the skies when they had reached the vicinity of the two lighthouses the sea anchor was thrown out the longboats were launched carrying four men each the boats were rowed quickly to the lighthouses beached and then its occupants entered the lighthouses to take the two keeps prisoner binding gagging and blindfolding them exactly as they had the sailors in their vessels hole a lantern signal indicated that both keepers were now incapacitated while the longboats carrying two sailors each made their way back to the ship the remaining two sailors at each lighthouse began to turn the winch to lower the chain guarding the harbor the longboats returned twice to each lighthouse carrying the captive seamen who were marched into the lighthouses only to have their legs rebound and their blindfolds refastened each of them was resettled at a distance from the others to prevent any possible contact that might lead to their premature escape as they knew where they were they were no longer frightened the lighthouse doors were locked and barred from the outside the royal charles raised her sea anchor sailed from the harbor and once again moored itself while the occupants of the two longboats moved their crafts to the sea side of the lighthouse islands raised the harbor chain up to protect the entry and rowed back to their ship in very choppy seas about them the storm continued to rage the thunder and the lightning even more pronounced now as they hauled anchor a final time and began to make their way out into the open sea leaving command of his regained vessel in mr boltons hands captain thomas southwood unlocked the door of his quarters and stepped inside neatly dodging the pitcher of water his cousin lady india lindley hurled at him idiot allah help you when my husband learns what you have done aruj agha will scour the seas for me at my lords command and when you are recaptured tom southwood and they lop your arrogant head from its shoulders i shall feel not the slightest twinge of guilt is this the thanks i get for rescuing you he demanded you are yet a spoiled child india i am nineteen tom india told him suddenly serious when my mother was nineteen she had already had two husbands two children and was enceinte with a third my grandmother had birthed my mother and was about to have my uncle james at nineteen there isnt a woman in this family who wasnt grown by nineteen why do you persist in treating me like a child thomas southwood i am a married woman and quite content to be so why did you not listen to me when i said i didnt want to come with you why did you assume i was some mindless infant who needed your protection did i ask for it did you ask me if i wanted to be rescued no you invaded my home brutalized me and then carried me off you are a wellmeaning idiot sir i cannot take you back he said wearily i know that she told him do you think i would endanger these men who have planned and struggled to make good their escape if aruj agha catches up with you there will be no mercy an example will have to be made that is their way do you really love him india he asked her curious aye have i not said it over and over to you i am the wife of the dey of el sinut and proud to be his wife it wasnt a real marriage he said attempting to excuse himself it wasnt a christian marriage india and you are a christian aye i am a christian but if you knew anything really knew about islam you would understand my marriage is quite valid besides he was seeking a protestant minister in el sinut to marry us in my faith although such a thing would have been done in secret you were to be our witness thomas southwood he loves you that much thomas southwood was very surprised that caynan reis would endanger himself and his position in such a manner i think he only told you such a thing to ease your conscience india the sultans dey in el sinut would never risk a christian marriage it could mean his very life he would have done it and allowed nothing to happen to us did you know there is a plot by the janissaries against the young sultan their agent came to caynan reis and sought his allegiance he said he would only give it to them if the deys of algiers and tunis agreed he sent this man on his way and then sent word to istanbul to the valideh of the plot he intended asking the valideh for autonomy for el sinut as a reward when she offered one so that our sons would have their own lands india told her startled cousin do you think i should know these things if i was not my lords beloved and trusted by him do you think the harem women knew of all of this thomas southwood but you would rescue me and force me back to scotland she glared at him thomas southwood had a momentary doubt that perhaps he had not done the right thing in forcing his cousin india aboard his vessel but he quickly pushed it away she didnt understand at all caynan reis would have gotten a child or two on her and then taken a second possibly even a third and fourth wife india he knew would not have stood for such rivals and been unhappy she was better off going back to her family at glenkirk back to the life she knew and understood they would explain away her years absence and find her a husband she would forget caynan reis her great wealth would smooth over any difficulties he looked directly at her it is too dangerous for me to continue on to england with you aboard we may encounter barbary corsairs and have to fight our way out this time particularly now that we are so well armed i am taking you to naples to your grandmother lady stewarthepburn when you return home in a few months time it will be said you have been with her all this time and what will be said about poor adrian leigh india demanded gods boots india you dont still care for that arrogant little toad do you no i care nothing for him india said scathingly i love my husband but adrian ended up in the galleys because of me why didnt you take him with us tonight i couldnt without involving all the galley slaves on aruj aghas ship for gods sake india your former swain is chained with four other men on a bench i didnt have the authority to unlock those chains and if i had attempted to take adrian off that vessel there would have been a riot our entire escape would have been thwarted besides adrian leigh deserves whatever he gets for cajoling you into your rash runaway you really are a bastard tom india said if this is to be my cabin while you make your run for naples then get out of it i dont want to see you again ever again how easy it is for you to ruin other peoples lives and all for the sake of your damned ship this damned ship will help to get you home he said angrily el sinut is my home now she replied stonily the morning after their flight from el sinut dawned clear the mediterranean sun shone golden in a cloudless blue sky and the brisk winds left in the wake of the storm had swung about to the southwest speeding their progress toward naples it would certainly have been discovered by now that the deys wife and her servant were missing it would have been ascertained that the english round ship was no longer in the harbor of el sinut the chief eunuch baba hassan would have connected the disappearance of india and meggie with that of the ship particularly if someone finally saw the single grapnel atop the far wall of the deys private garden mr james had freed and tossed down to the alley the grapnel by which his captain and india had descended but having gotten to the ground with meggie he had been unable to loose his own grapnel they had left it it was unlikely they would be caught before they reached naples by the time caynan reis and aruj agha were sent for returned to the city and sailed in pursuit after them another two days would have gone by they sailed on through virtually unoccupied seas that first day and the next day as well finally on the third morning they approached naples india stood at the rail enchanted with the muted peachandlavender sky pearly gray mist hung suspended in the air like sheer shredded silk here and there tiny islands appeared out of the foggy waters she could just see the small fishing boats in the fog she heard the call of a church bell over the smooth seas a gentle breeze puffed at the sails causing the ship to glide along almost like a fairy vessel the air was very damp and warm well tom southwood said coming up to stand by her side youll be at your grandmothers in a few hours india i want you to stay aboard until i have gone to lady stewarthepburns villa and spoken with her im sure she is aware of your disappearance a year ago shell send a message to your family posthaste i have not a doubt ill be glad to have you off my hands quite frankly youre a very troublesome wench india and youre a pompous fool dear cousin she responded in time you will forgive me and realize that what i did was for your own good india he said gently india turned her face to him her golden eyes almost amber with her irritation go to the devil she told him and then returned to her cabin where meggie was awaiting her captain was seeking you my lady the girl said he found me india replied i shall be glad to be quit of him hopefully lady stewarthepburn will not be so condescending you do not call her grandmother meggie asked she is my stepfathers mother and i only met her in france two years ago she has lived in naples for many years now for my stepfathers sake i call her grandmama but i was never comfortable with it my lindley grandparents were dead before my father and mother were wed the only grandparents i have ever known have been the earl and countess of broccairn mamas parents although the earl is also my mothers stepfather most of the women in my family have been wed to any number of husbands we are very longlived meggie knox had brought them a small repast some flat bread dates and a small carafe of fresh water the two women ate and then meggie fetched a basin of water so they might wash they had no trunks and were wearing the same garments in which they had left el sinut there was not even a comb for their hair and all of indias precious jewelry had been left behind at least that she hoped would tell her husband that she hadnt departed willingly from his side caynan her heart cried out to him over the many miles now between them i love you please find me please the ship anchored in the bay of naples they had exchanged the banner that flew atop their mast earlier that morning for two flags one indicating they were an english ship and the other below it to announce they belonged to the omalleysmall trading company captain thomas southwood left his vessel and was rowed ashore there he immediately registered his ship with the harbormaster explaining they had escaped captivity in the barbary states by stealing back the royal charles he requested that a ships painter be sent out to his vessel to repaint the correct name on its side and stern then asking directions to the villa del pesce doro he rented a horse and made his way to the small estate outside of the city and on the sea it was to this beautiful villa with its gardens that catriona leslie had come to marry francis stewarthepburn it was from this place that she had been kidnapped and taken into slavery in the ottoman empire but francis stewarthepburn would not be denied the great love of his life and discovering where his wife had been taken came to rescue her he had as he later told her crossed three seas and two straits to find her they had not returned to villa del pesce doro for lady stewarthepburn had been badly traumatized by her adventure they had instead gone to another villa in the hills above rome villa mia in the next few years as the shock of her sojourn had eased and finally faded almost away they had taken to going to the neapolitan villa each summer and remaining into the autumn when they would return to villa mia lord bothwell had loved the warmth and the sunshine of naples he had been buried there except for his heart which was taken from his chest upon his death and placed in a carved oak box which was then placed into a decorated silver reliquary and rested on a table by his wifes bed it traveled with her it would be buried with her when she died the gates to the villa were opened by a smiling gatekeeper the door to the house was opened by a craggyfaced scot in a kilt aye the grizzled fellow growled i am captain thomas southwood of the omalleysmall trading ship the royal charles i should like to see lady stewarthepburn and what is yer business captain the doorkeeper demanded my business is private fellow and not to be discussed with servants thomas southwood replied stiffly now dinna get yer breeches in a twist captain the scot said but nae one gets into this house wiout my knowing their business i promised my lord on his deathbed that i would watch over her ladyship and twas nae a promise made lightly i am a son of the earl of lynmouth uncle to the duchess of glenkirk thomas southwood answered tis family business i have come about now are you satisfied and will you let me in aye come in then and ill take ye to her ladyship the scot said calmly he turned and led the way into a bright salon overlooking the colorful gardens of the villa now a riot of bloom captain thomas southwood mlady he announced catriona stewarthepburn had been sitting at an embroidery frame by the open windows she arose now and he saw she had the same elegance that his late grandmother had possessed my lady he said bowing over the outstretched hand southwood are you related to the earl of lynmouth sir she asked him robert southwood is my father he replied how kind of you to visit me she told him i do not often have visitors from the north do you bring messages from my family ive brought your granddaughter lady india lindley he announced smiling at the look of astonishment that crossed her face india oh thank god jemmie and jasmine have been so worried where did you find her is she all right where did she disappear to she sat down heavily waving him into a chair india will tell you everything you need to know in detail my lady but i will tell you briefly almost a year ago adrian leigh viscount twyford convinced india to elope with him neither my cousin jasmine nor her husband approved of this young man with great foresight india had him book them passage out of england upon one of our ships and she came aboard disguised her masquerade was fortunately discovered and i took her in my charge immediately putting her rash young swain into custody shortly afterward we were taken into captivity by a barbary corsair i advised my crew to accept islam which most of them did thus avoiding service in the galleys we were brought to el sinut and led before its dey caynan reis because ours was the first round ship they had ever captured and because i had accepted islam i was first sent back out to sea with the janissary agha of el sinut as his navigator when it was at last decided that i could be trusted i was assigned the task of teaching the deys seamen how to sail my ship i planned our escape for months and at last three nights ago i accomplished our flight rescuing india so she might go with me along with the little scots lass who is her servant catriona stewarthepburn knew the answer to the question she now asked what happened to india when you arrived in el sinut the dey fancied her and she was taken into his harem was the answer as she had expected ahhh the poor child lady stewarthepburn said remembering her own sensual captivity and the trauma she suffered for several years after her husband rescued her how is she sir when may i see her shes mad as hell madame for she fancies herself in love with the dey i had to knock her unconscious to get her to safety as to seeing her i would very much appreciate it if you would take the troublesome wench off my hands and see to the task of getting her back to scotland or england and into her parents charge again she is aboard your vessel aye madame she is he answered i shall send my conall down to the harbor to fetch them lady stewarthepburn said does she have much luggage madame i carried her unconscious over a fifteenfoothigh wall in the clothing she wore thomas southwood said where was the dey hunting in the mountains with the janissary agha or i should have never attempted such an escape he replied honestly stay with me for a few days the older woman said both you and your men could surely use the rest after your great adventure i thank you madame but we must put to sea again as soon as possible and direct our efforts to getting home to england if you sail west captain you certainly risk being recaptured again she said in very practical tones i think if i were planning to foil my enemy i should remain in naples for a few days take on a cargo and sail east to istanbul by the time you return west again the dey and his minions will have tired of the chase and you will have a profit for your trouble she smiled at him and her leafgreen eyes twinkled your legend madame does not do you justice he said please she said would you go to the door and tell conall to fetch lady india and her servant from your ship he is standing on the other side of the panel attempting to hear what is being said but his hearing is not as good as it once was i fear the door snapped open and the scotsman said in glowering tones i hear well enough my lady ye need nae insult me and me so faithful to ye what is yer ship called captain the royal charles but right now its got itself a turkish name on her sides and stern in those wiggly scrolllike lines they call letters the harbormaster can tell you where were moored and arrange for my longboat to take you out to fetch my cousin i thank you conall the kilted scotsman stamped from the room even as his mistress was pouring two exquisite crystal goblets of deep red wine she handed thomas southwood one of the goblets wine sir the captain took the liquid gratefully eyed its beautiful ruby color and sniffed its fragrant bouquet a look of delight passed over his face tis archambault wine madame from my grandmothers family estates in france god i have dreamed of this wine all those long months in captivity while i quenched my thirst with water mint tea sweet sherbets and that damnably thick turkish coffee he took a sip and then another and then drank the entire goblet down before her eyes ahhhh that was good do you know when they captured my ship they threw an entire cargo of sherry overboard she refilled his glass laughing all those barrels floating in the sea he said mournfully and began to sip at his goblet once again conall moreleslie fetched his mistresss carriage and driver then mounting his horse he led the way to the harbor instructing old giovanni to wait for him i hae two ladies to bring back to the madonna he told the coachman they are aboard a ship in the harbor he was rowed out to the royal charles and approaching it saw a painter already hung over the side of the vessel upon a rickety scaffolding painting out the turkish squiggles preparatory to restoring the ships proper name he clambered up the ladder hanging over the vessels side and onto the deck introducing himself to mr bolton ill fetch her ladyship and meggie the first mate said and glad ill be to see the last of them women on a ships bad luck and weve had nothing but bad luck since her ladyship came aboard conall moreleslie nodded as if in agreement but he thought the first mate a damned fool to believe such superstitious nonsense his look was quizzical when india and meggie appeared before him both were attired in foreign garb and they were barefoot then he bowed to india i am conall moreleslie your grandmothers majordomo i hae been sent to bring you to her my lady and the wee lassie too let us go then india said briskly how the hell do we get off this damned boat yell hae to climb down the ladder over the side my lady ill go first and then yer serving girl and then ye he told her mr bolton will ye help the ladies please aye and glad i am to do it the first mate said enthusiastically goodbye knox india called thank you for everything to her surprise both india and meggie navigated the rope ladder in their bare feet without incident safe within the longboat they looked toward the shore shortly afterward they found themselves settled in a large comfortable coach riding through the streets of a noisy city the smells were ferocious india grew dizzy with it all and leaned back against the upholstered seat how can my stomach be so unsettled on such little food she wondered aloud were getting used to being back on the shore again mlady said meggie and perhaps the wee one is hungry for some nourishment ohh i could use a bowl of abus good soup now i could lady stewarthepburn will take care of us meggie although i barely know her i can tell you she is a woman of uncommon good sense the city was left behind and they traveled along a rural road by the sea finally the carriage turned into the gates of the villa del pesce doro the horses trotting smartly up the graveled drive finally stopping before the beautiful double doors of the mansion a servant ran to open the carriage door and lower the steps offering india his hand she stepped out and immediately through the open doors of the villa she saw catriona stewarthepburn the older woman held out her arms to india who felt compelled to fly into them and be well hugged i said youd cause a scandal if they did not marry you off lady stewarthepburn said dryly and here you are safely back from your adventures jemmie will be so relieved come into the house my dear you look exhausted and will want a bath some food a rest and fresh clothing is this your servant werent you a lucky lass child had you not been my granddaughters maid you might not have had the opportunity to go home to scotland again yes mlady meggie said dropping a curtsey to this beautiful woman who didnt look old enough to be anyones grandmother come along now lady stewarthepburn said and led them into the cool of her villa then into her salon where captain southwood awaited ah you are here cousin he said pleasantly get out of my sight india said coldly if it hadnt been for you i should be with my husband now i will never forgive you tom what is this the older woman said looking between the two antagonists you told me the dey fancied india not that she was his wife thomas southwood how could an english noblewoman be married to an infidel he demanded angrily because the iman made it so you arrogant bastard india almost shouted at him then she rounded on her stepgrandmother he would not listen madame he struck me a blow that rendered me unconscious and then kidnapped me from my home she stuck out her jaw and pointed with her finger to the faint purple bruise caynan will be frantic madame you must return me to him he will replace you with another girl from his harem her cousin said cruelly one wench is pretty much alike to these fellows with a shriek india flew at him clawing at his face bastard bastard she screamed i would kill you if i could conall moreleslie leapt forward and pulled the furious girl away from her victim easy now lassie dinna slay the man for doing what he thought was right he wouldnt listen india shouted once more her heart was pounding with her burning anger she couldnt believe the murderous fury thomas southwood had engendered in her she had never been this angry in all her life the captain touched his face looking slightly horrorstruck at the scarlet stains on his fingertips youve blooded me he said incredulously youve actually drawn blood you damned wildcat i would tear your heart out with my teeth if i could she responded darkly her eyes blazing violent rage instinctively he stepped back shocked by the look i think it is best my granddaughter be taken to her room now lady stewarthepburn said quietly i will send my own women susan and may to help her she put her arms about a resisting india we will solve this problem together india i promise you then she sent her off with conall and meggie when they had gone she turned to thomas southwood perhaps you should have listened to her sir she is extremely distraught it is not the attitude of a woman taken from a man who was holding her in bondage if the dey of el sinut took her for his wife then she is his wife i understand your family loyalty but what do you think awaits her back in scotland theyll find a husband for her he said sullenly shes rich enough madame that her wealth will cover her sins oh dear catriona stewarthepburn said softly you are having second thoughts arent you my dear well the deed is done you will have to get on with your life and i shall have to straighten out this unfortunate muddle you will remain in naples for a few days and you will take my advice to take on a cargo and sail to istanbul if the dey of el sinut catches you now i truly fear for you sir go back to your ship and return for dinner we eat in the evening here my son ian will be coming you will like each other like you he has yet to settle down she laughed before you go however allow me to attend to those scratches she peered at his face they are not deep your handsome face will not be scarred i never realized what a troublesome witch india was he grumbled your son has obviously had his hands full raising her my son adores her and she him i think that may have been the difficulty for india in choosing a husband no one could quite measure up to jemmie and then the charming viscount twyford came along rather than being supportive jemmie was jealous although from what i have been told the young man was really quite unsuitable for an heiress of indias social standing my son might have handled the situation a bit more tactfully sometimes he reminds me very much of his father patrick leslie patrick was always quite heedless of the consequences when he wanted his own way lady stewarthepburn said then reaching out she tugged at the tapestried bell pull and moments later a maidservant appeared acqua e uno bacile she said si madonna the girl said with a curtsey you speak italian his older companion laughed i have lived in naples and rome for over twentyfive years captain although some of my servants are scots most of them are local people it was necessary that i gain a good command of the tongue its a beautiful language very lyrical and romantic unlike my own celtic tongue the basin and water were brought and lady stewarthepburn quickly cleaned the blood from thomas southwoods face when she had finished she sent him on his way and hurried upstairs to see how india was faring she found her in a tub of scented water being tended by meggie her own two serving women susan and may were nearby seeing to fresh clothing for their guest and preparing her bed i have instructed captain southwood to return to his ship but he will be back for dinner she told india i cannot bear his company madame please understand india said you do not call me grandmama as you did in france lady stewarthepburn said i only met you for the first time there i do not think of you as my grandmother india answered her honestly then you must call me cat the older woman said i was baptized catriona mairi but i was always cat to my friends and family i hope we are at least friends my child oh yes india said favoring cat with a smile she arose from her tub and meggie wrapped her in a warm towel seating her mistress upon a small chair and drying her wet hair as the two women continued their talk you must forgive poor young southwood cat said he was only doing what he thought was right like all men he didnt listen or if he did he didnt hear india said i have to get back to el sinut you are certain you want to return the leafgreen eyes scanned the younger womans face yes india said ohh cat i love him and he loves me i have never been happier than i was with caynan reis we had so many plans i told my cousin that i was glad to remain i asked him to carry a message to my parents for me but no with his misguided sense of honor and family loyalty he had to steal me away i cannot forgive him the pain he has caused me and my husband i understand she said i truly do india when i was separated from my lord bothwell i thought i should die i could actually feel my heart cracking with my misery the first thing we must do is send a message to your husband in el sinut that you are safe and we will say nothing to your cousin about our decisions as long as you are certain i shall not keep you from the man you love even if the rest of the whole world disapproves india burst into tears ohh thank you she sobbed i shall excuse you from dinner tonight cat said you have had an exhausting voyage your cousin will be here for a short time and before he goes you will reconcile with him he need not know the reason why but you will do it to please me india since i have agreed to help you ohh yes cat i will india sobbed may lady stewarthepburn called to her serving woman go to the kitchens and fetch some of annas hot soup a piece of fresh focaccia some fruit and wine for lady lindley she must eat and then i want her put to bed she turned to meggie what is your name lassie i am told you are one of us where do you come from im meggie your ladyship and im from ayr was the answer go with may then meggie and remain to eat something anna will see you are well fed then come back to watch over your mistress there is a nice trundle beneath this bed which susan will see has fresh bedding and linens for you you look fair worn child thank you your ladyship meggie said curtseying mistress go meggie i will be fine india said she was now quite dry in the warm air as was her dark hair cats other serving woman susan came now with a soft silk nightgown which she slipped over indias body there my lady theres nothing like a nice bath and fresh clothes to make a body feel better youre a scot india noted lord bless you mlady aye and we are may and me is sisters we hae been wi our mistress for longer than i care to remember conall is our uncle we came from glenkirk wi mistress cat many years ago do you ever long for home india wondered not really susan said honestly the climate here and in rome is really far better than in our dear old scotland come along now mlady and get into bed india was glad to climb into a comfortable bed she was certain she would fall asleep before may returned with her meal but she didnt the two serving women bustled about her tucking a napkin beneath her chin settling the tray and then sitting by her side as she ate they were full of stories of their mistress and her early adventures india found herself laughing at the story of how cat was in labor with indias stepfather yet would still not marry his father until patrick leslie returned property of hers that her father had wrongly included as part of her dowry instead of allowing it to remain in her hands did she get it back india asked her mouth full of bread and delicious cheese aye susan said and then her waters broke even as she said her vows to her husband she had spirit india remarked rather fascinated by these new glimpses of cat she still does susan replied even if our life is not quite so exciting as it once was when india had finished her meal and drunk down a goblet of wonderful red wine the two servants took the tray and left her to rest she wasnt certain she could sleep now or that she would sleep well but she slipped into a slumber that lasted until early the next morning when she awoke to find meggie snoring happily upon the trundle india lay quietly in her bed listening to the sounds of early dawn the air coming through the long windows that led onto her balcony was sweet with the scent of flowers only the early chatter of the birds broke the silence it was all very lovely but she missed el sinut cat had said they would send a message to caynan reis but how that was something that had to be settled today surely cat was not attempting to gull her but the older woman was very serious in her attempt to reunite india with caynan reis she had sent conall to the harbor that very morning to find a ship that would travel across the mediterranean and stop at el sinut there were none finally conall found a fishing boat willing to make the passage and take a message to the dey but can he be trusted india asked the highlander who had brought his information to his mistress while india was breaking her fast with lady stewarthepburn the man says he fishes but he and his crew smuggle a little too conall said their little felluca goes back and forth between tunis el sinut and naples wiout any difficulty they pay protection to both ports and half the men aboard are arab they can get there get your message delivered and they can get back and they will do it cat asked her majordomo aye they will ive promised them an extraordinary amount of coin half before they go half when they get back and ive hinted they are doing the dey of el sinut a great service for which they will receive an additional reward when they return to naples wi his answer greed is a powerful spur he finished dryly they will go today india demanded as soon as i put your message in their hands my lady they will depart the port he told her cat supplied the parchment and pen and india immediately sat down to write to her husband she told him of how her cousin had invaded their private garden by coming over that tiny piece of the wall that was vulnerable to the outside world how he had rendered her unconscious and carried her off forcing meggie to go too that she was now in naples at the villa of her stepfathers mother lady stewarthepburn who had agreed she must return to her husband but because of the constant strife between the barbary states and christian europe the women did not know how this end might be accomplished she wrote that she loved him and was desperate to be back in his arms again the waterproof parchment was then folded and sealed then it was placed into a leather envelope and sealed again conall moreleslie returned to the harbor giving the leather carrier into the hands of one captain pietro along with a pouch of coins the captain weighed the pouch in his palm his look thoughtful and assessing tis all there conall told him when you get to el sinut go to the deys palace and ask for the chief eunuch baba hassan tell him the leather envelope contains a message from his mistress and is to be given to the dey immediately then do exactly what this man tells you to do and when it is permitted you will return to naples with any answer coming to the villa del pesce doro to deliver that reply and collect the rest of your reward as i have told you the dey will instruct us to pay you additional for your service so do not fail us captain pietro this is no plot against naples is it the captain asked conall shook his head rather amazed to find this smuggler was a patriotic man it is a private matter he said nothing more the captain nodded bene he said knowing her messenger was on his way back to el sinut softened indias stance somewhat toward thomas southwood but she was not entirely mollified and wouldnt be until a message of reassurance came from her husband still she sat at the table that evening with cat her handsome son ian and thomas southwood it was ian stewarthepburn who kindled his mothers emotions and took the attention completely from india by announcing his intentions to go with thomas southwood what on earth for cat demanded because my dear mama it is time i made something of myself and my life i am thirtythree years of age and i have spent much of my time in idle pursuits i cannot continue to be a wastrel but what will you do on toms ship cat asked somewhat confused you are not a sailor ian nor can you be one at your age but i can be a merchanttrader mama he told her ive bought a cargo of fine olive oil and ive sent to my saddle maker in firenze for a dozen of his best saddles i intend shipping them on the royal charles and finding a market for them in istanbul then i shall buy something there perhaps silk and return to naples ian you are the son of the earl of bothwell cat said what can you be thinking that you would go into trade aye i am the youngest son of francis stewarthepburn once the earl of bothwell cousin to the royal stuarts but my father was outlawed and driven from scotland everything was taken from him they even tried to take you from him mama there is no title or estates to inherit and if there were margaret douglass sons would have long ago laid claim to them for she was his first wife and her children take precedence over we youngest three who were born when you were wed to the earl of glenkirk until our father claimed us we were thought to be leslies mama i am my fathers son mama i cannot live my life in idleness and boredom i cannot return to scotland for there is nothing there for me and i should be considered bothwells bastard and scorned i need to make a life for myself i have been astoundingly well educated and i have spent several years enjoying myself while i played now i need to move onward youj generous allowance allows me to attempt this venture i think i shall be good at it i like the business of business perhaps if i make a small success of this i shall even take a wife at long last i know that would please you eh mama for a moment she stared at this man who looked so much like his father with his blue eyes and auburn hair she wondered what francis would have thought of his youngest sons desire to go into business the world was changing she realized and those who did not change with it would certainly be doomed to extinction francis would have agreed with that sentiment he himself had been a man born ahead of his time at least their son wanted to make something of himself and he had some leslie blood in his veins through her for cats mother had been a leslie the leslies had always been fascinated with trading and the wealth it brought them im surprised she admitted candidly to him but if this is what you want ian then i cannot deny you but make a success of it damn it trade carefully and be clever and get your own vessel as soon as you can thats where the money is my son in owning your own ship and not having to pay someone else to ship your goods exactly madame thomas southwood said the royal charles is mine which is why i was so anxious to regain her custody would you consider selling a third share in her sir cat asked the surprised young man she turned to ian it would be my gift to you which would allow you not only the profits from your own cargo but a third profit from the ship itself she looked back to thomas southwood the third share i buy for ian will ease the loss of the cargo you carried when you were captured last year i know you sail under the banner of the omalleysmall trading company but do they own any share of the royal charles tom southwood shook his head shes all mine madame he said several of my relations have their own vessels now but we still sail under our familys banner for a number of reasons i understand cat said but will you sell me a third share aye he consented i will madame the price you agree upon will indeed ease my loss and allow me to pay my men a small stipend for they lost too by our sojourn to el sinut india had been fascinated by the conversation but now as the talk turned to concluding the bargain her mind wandered how far had her message traveled how would her husband retrieve her safely what would her family think of all of this she was hesitant to write to them just now for fear they might somehow manage to prevent her from returning to el sinut she knew it was a silly fear for they were so far away in scotland or perhaps england at this point in time still she might err on the side of caution and wait several weeks went by during which the royal charles was restored to her full glory but the cannon installed by the janissaries remained aboard thomas southwood had decided that the loss of some cargo space was worth the ability to defend his ship finally one sunny morning he and ian came to bid the ladies a farewell the vessel being fully loaded and ready to set sail for istanbul when do you plan to send india home the captain asked lady stewarthepburn have you written to your son yet there has been no time with all your excitement and ians plans cat said ingenuously i shall of course write to jemmie and jasmine soon i enjoy indias company and think i may take her with me to my villa outside rome for the winter next spring is time enough for her to return home she smiled at him i leave the matter in your hands madame i have done my duty in rescuing my cousin from barbary my conscience is clear tom replied with a smile of his own he kissed her hand then turned to india i am happy to see you are returning to reason cousin go to hell india told him smiling brightly he laughed i think you will be too old by the time you return to scotland for a husband perhaps it will suit you to live out your life without a man i wish you good fortune farewell thomas southwood go safely india said and turned away to bid ian stewarthepburn an adieu i hope your venture will succeed listen to tom he is knowledgeable if pigheaded ian chuckled godspeed india he said with a wink for a moment she looked a bit puzzled and then india realized that ian knew of her plans she laughed aloud then said i thank you ian you may look like your father but you are your mothers son as well i think then she kissed him on the cheek several days later captain pietro appeared at the villa del pesce doro he was shown into the salon where the two women awaited him he tried hard not to gape at the exquisite furnishings and the two beauties only coming to his senses when conall poked him roughly well man what news do you bring conall demanded the smuggler drew the leather envelope from his shirt and handed it to conall we could not deliver it signore why the single word snapped from indias mouth there is a rebellion in el sinut madonna the city was half aflame the people alternating between fleeing into the hills and rioting the janissaries were attempting to restore order it was impossible to even get near the palace besides the dey has been killed by the janissaries he was it appears disloyal or so the rumor being bruited about said i am sorry madonna india never heard him she had already crumpled to the floor never madame did i expect to ever see you standing in this hall again the duke of glenkirk said to lady stewarthepburn welcome home mother welcome home thank you jemmie cat let her eye wander little had changed in all the years she had been gone her greatgrandmother janet leslie still commanded the hall from her portrait above one of the two large fireplaces gods boots she thought did mam ever face the problems i now face and must solve cat doubted it where is india he asked her she is with her mother jemmie they need to talk cat replied india has suffered greatly come and sit by the fire madame he invited her leading her by the hand to a comfortable chair he signaled a servant to bring them refreshment india deserves to suffer for her disobedience james leslie said harshly i suppose haeing had his way wi her that young english fop deserted her i always thought it was indias wealth that attracted him nae just what was between her legs i suppose when he discovered only her mother and i could release that wealth to her he departed still either way shes ruined herself and ill nae forgie her for it gods blood jemmie youve become narrow and pompous in your old age while it is true that india eloped with young leigh she was wise enough to do so on an omalleysmall vessel she went aboard disguised as an old lady being escorted by her nephew to naples fortunately the captain was your wifes cousin thomas southwood her ruse was quickly discovered and india was taken into his custody while her equally foolish swain was confined to his cabin the only intimacy between them were a few stolen kisses unfortunately the ship was taken by barbary corsairs out of the state of el sinut when he saw they would be captured tom southwood advised his men to accept islam and avoid the galleys he did so himself and was eventually able to steal back his own ship young leigh however offended the dey of el sinut and is still today in captivity and chained to an oar we dont even know if he is yet alive and my daughter what happened to india the duke asked the dey was attracted to her and took her into his harem he fell in love with her and made her his first wife she was very much in love with him but tom southwood kidnapped her when he and his men escaped el sinut he would not listen to her when she tried to tell him she was content and happy he brought her to me in naples when i heard the story i of course planned to send her home to her husband but then we received word there had been some sort of civil unrest in el sinut and that the dey was killed trying to put it down she has been inconsolable ever since that was why i decided to bring her home instead of keeping her with me in rome this winter india needs her family now more than she has ever needed them jemmie we told all our neighbors that she hae remained in england and that she was visiting her relations in france and italy he said slowly i doubt anyone in england knew of her foolishness since we hae planned to leave london and hae already taken our leave of the court just before she ran away this misadventure in barbary can be covered up if we are clever and careful she is close to twenty but i believe i can still obtain a good husband for her her wealth will be the key to her salvation jemmie there are things you dont know cat told her son do not be in such a hurry to find india a husband she is not able to face such a prospect right now be patient with her madame i hae surely been more than patient wi india but my patience is at an end the duke of glenkirk said irritably there are several possibilities and ill hae the wench wed before twelfth night then she is nae my responsibility any longer and whatever mischief she may get into twill nae be my problem twill be her husbands problem i love her dearly mother every bit as much as i love the sons and daughters of my own blood but india is a wild wench i canna hae her disrupting my household jasmine would nae go to ireland to find a husband for fortune when india disappeared and she poor lassie is eager to wed and be gone to her own home nay india must be wed as soon as possible madame and what man will have me my lord in my condition india said as she came into the hall she walked directly up to her stepfather james leslies darkgreen eyes grew almost black with his anger as he saw her rounding belly jesu he swore angrily whose bastard do ye carry mistress how dare you speak to me in that manner india said in cold even tones i carry the son my husband and i joyously created this child is all i have left of my lord caynan reis i had a husband papa i will have no other no man will ever take his place the duke of glenkirk was speechless for a long moment you have seen your mother cat asked quietly aye and i have told her all india said she understands and says i am welcome home i have told her i do not intend to stay after the baby is born but rather will purchase a house near my brothers seat at cadby i prefer english winters to highland winters james leslie finally found his voice again and what will you tell people about your bairn mistress who will ye say his sire was some infidel who took you into his harem the child is a bastard india plain and simple you will nae find a husband wi that bairn about yer neck like a millstone i was wed to caynan reis india said wearily in a christian church by a christian minister or priest he demanded furiously his temples were throbbing as they had not throbbed in many months he loved her he had raised her but she was the most irritating female he had ever known in his entire life we were married by the grand iman of el sinut india said but my husband promised me a christian marriage when we could find a protestant minister who would be discreet why did the minister need to be discreet the duke shouted because for an islamic ruler to wed in a christian marriage ceremony would be a cause of strife my lord was the sultans governor in el sinut india explained gods blood papa mamas first husband prince javid khan married her secretly in a christian rite the bairn will be thought a bastard india the duke said as my mother was said to be a bastard india countered your mother was a royal mughal princess he replied she was raised by her father in india your grandfather akbar was wise enough to know that if your grandmother velvet had brought her daughter home with her to england the bairn would hae been considered bastardborn when your mother came to england she was full grown and none but your aunt sybilla dared to question her birth and she only because she fancied herself in love wi me and was jealous of your mother whom i preferred i am a wealthy woman papa i do not need another husband i do not care what anyone may think of my sons parentage if i find england unwelcoming then i shall go to france or italy india told them i think we should end this discussion for now cat said my granddaughter and i have had a long trip jemmie besides i have another matter of great importance to discuss with you india my child return to your mother while i talk with my son india bent to kiss cats cheek and then she hurried off you like her james leslie said i do she is honest and loyal give her time jemmie but now to that other matter as you know bothwell is buried at the foot of our garden in naples however his heart is in a silver reliquary that i have carried with me since his death i have brought it home to bury in scotland the spot will be unmarked as will our future grave here grant me this request and i shall never ask anything of you again cat finished james leslie shook his head you nae ere asked anything of me madame ye always give wi yer whole heart my father was a fool to ever let ye go nay cat said do not criticize patrick for ours was a match made by our families when i was barely out of nappies and he a young man he was as set in his ways as you are my son and i was as wild as a highland pony i loved him well until he betrayed me by allowing the king to victimize me but the truth is and we both know it jemmie francis stewarthepburn was the great love of my life both of us would have gone to our graves never admitting that had your father not been so mindless and jealous in the matter of the king patrick leslie was not foolish he was simply stubborn and every bit as wild and proudhearted as i was though he would not admit to it we will make a place for ye both the duke of glenkirk said only you conall and i shall know the truth cat told her son with a small smile when do you want to do it he inquired as soon as possible i want to return to rome before travel becomes utterly impossible with the winter weather i only came to bring francis home to scotland and india back to you she told him frankly ill sail from aberdeen before christmas remain the winter he pleaded with her she shook her head i cannot take the weather anymore jemmie i am no girl but an old lady of sixtyfive years rome is a milder climate and better for me now tis a bad time to be on the sea he noted there is always that fair time in december before winter sets in cat said quietly i shall be in calais in a shorter time than if i had to travel overland down through england to dover i shall visit your sister and jeanclaude a brief time and then go on to marseilles through monaco san lorenzo and genova and down the boot through firenze and on to rome i have friends in monaco genova and firenze it will be an easy trip we came that way but only stopped each night to rest my horses which are awaiting my return with my coach and coachman in calais how did you get from aberdeen he asked her surprised for he had assumed she had traveled with her own equipage the kira bankers arranged everything she told him they always do for me true to her word catriona hay leslie stewarthepburn stayed only a brief time with her son and his family at glenkirk there was barely time to gather her family but learning she was with jemmie they all came her other sons colin and robert her daughters bess amanda and morag all patrick leslies children she hadnt seen them in so long and while they were her children they were virtually strangers to her and the grandchildren there were so many grandchildren her brothers and their families came and again there was the feeling of strangeness they had always been goodhearted rough highlanders she had been the odd one but still there was that feeling of clan amongst them all and she wept to see them go there was nothing cat could do to ease the anger and the estrangement between her son and india even her daughterinlaw jasmine was at a loss it made no difference to james leslie that both his mother and his wife counseled patience to each side jemmie was angry and india was angry a collision between these two strong wills was inevitable why would she nae listen to me the duke asked his wife for the hundredth time did i nae tell her that viscount twyford was not suitable look now what her willfulness has cost her she is a widow having a child jasmine attempted to put a simple face on the problem she looked at her husbands hands in hers and looked into his face jemmie in el sinut she was legally and lawfully wed and she was loved by whom he demanded some handsome renegade nameless and of unknown origins the duke despaired pulling his hands from hers jasmine we canna allow her to go off on her own to raise her bairn there will always be questions how do we answer those questions what man will take the lass to wife wiout the answers we hae said she was in england in france and finally wi my mother in italy that she hae come home wi mother is to the good it gives substance to that lie but there is nae way we can explain indias big belly or the bairn she will hae in the spring i canna let our lass ruin her life and i will nae then what are we to do the duchess of glenkirk demanded of her husband she must go up to acuil where she will nae be seen once her condition becomes too obvious and that will be soon we will make some excuse for her absence that she is in edinburgh perhaps visiting family when the bairn is born we will foster it out to some cotters wife nae at glenkirk but perhaps at sithean or greyhaven india is nae to be told where the bairn is if the birth is hard we will tell her that the bairn died and that will be an end of it then we will seek a match for her it is the only solution ahh jemmie his wife said you make it all sound so simple but there are factors you have not considered how do we explain the loss of indias maidenhead to this new husband and how will you get my daughter to give up her child so easily my father drugged my mother so that he might take her from me and she never forgot it india loved her husband she will never let you take her child from her she will hae nae choice jasmine he said if you do this thing i will never forgive you the duchess of glenkirk threatened her husband angrily i do what is best for india he countered if ye hae let me make a match for her in the first place instead of allowing the lass to run wild we would hae nae of this trouble jasmine now i will do what i know is best for our daughter what am i to do jasmine despaired to her motherinlaw do not allow this situation to divide your house gat advised wisely i know you love your daughter but you and jemmie love one another too india has made her own fate and now must deal with it herself you cannot protect her forever my dear you agree with jemmie nay i do not but i know my son well enough and so should you jasmine you surely understand you cannot push him in a direction he does not choose to go to get him where you will have him you must draw him first down this path and then the other until you reach the destination that you wanted all along and he is none the wiser she laughed he is as stubborn as i was in my youth and as heedless of the consequences of his actions as was his father god assoil his soul jemmie is not an easy man jasmine i know that and so do you do not let your daughter and her problem blind you to the fact that you love your husband india will recover from her broken heart sooner than later marry and leave you and jemmie you do not want an estrangement between yourselves when that time comes but indias child what will become of that child if it is fostered out and we do not know where cat fretted just make certain you know where the bairn is cat said do what you must but learn where that child is then visit the cotters wife who has it and make certain she knows of your interest in the child and its wellbeing it is the best you can do later you can educate it if it is a lad and even tell of its heritage if it is a lass then educate her and see she has a respectable match one day but never allow jemmie to know of your interest or your involvement and india tell her only one day when she is happy again so that her broken heart may be completely mended cat replied i wish you would stay with us jasmine said tearyeyed her motherinlaw laughed heartily nay my dear i far prefer the quiet life i now lead in rome and naples i am not used to all this agitation aggravation and uproar any longer adventures aplenty i had in my youth but now i simply enjoy sitting in my gardens or watching the sea or dining with friends or reading and writing letters from family and friends india is your problem and while i was happy to help where i could i shall be delighted to depart for aberdeen tomorrow and then home to villa mia which with luck i shall reach by february she patted jasmines hand comfortingly you are a clever woman jasmine but you have allowed your mind to stifle here in the safety of glenkirk use your wits to help india now lady stewarthepburn departed the following morning her coach rumbling over the drawbridge of the castle and down the hill to the high road ten days later a message arrived from calais to say her voyage had been uneventful and she would write from her daughters chateau outside of paris before she departed for rome the weather was getting colder and the rains icy and more frequent one morning as india lay abed her father came to her they had managed to exist without shouting at each other in the time since cats departure but neither spoke to each other unless it was necessary are ye well he asked her gruffly well enough she replied youre leaving glenkirk india he told her ill hae no gossip about yer big belly and if ye remain any longer well nae be able to disguise it ye hae to go to his surprise she agreed saying aye if fortune is to have a decent husband there can be no scandal about me im glad ye understand he said relaxing his stern attitude just a little im happy to see ye thinking of yer sister before yerself india im nae angry wi ye anymore lassie but i must do what is best for ye now he reached out to pat her hand noting it was cold where am i to go papa she queried him to edinburgh wi greatuncle adam and his fiona or to queens malvern none come there now except in the summertime when my brother is in residence yere going up to acuil india meggie will go wi ye and red hughs younger brother diarmid the duke of glenkirk told india ill freeze to death in that place india said are you attempting to kill me then papa the house is stone he said and theres a good fireplace in the main room and yer bedchamber as well yell nae freeze but yell be isolated and yer shame well concealed nae one will know of the bairn diarmid will light a signal fire when yer time hae come and yer mother will come to ye then what will happen to my child india asked bluntly well worry about the bairn when its safely born he soothed her then put an arm about her lassie lassie i just want to protect ye yere my daughter and i hae only wanted whats best for ye india suddenly began to cry ohh papa i am so unhappy i loved him papa i loved caynan reis i should be in el sinut in the palace with baba hassan and the lady azura happily sharing the joy of our child with us she looked up at him papa i dont even know what has happened to him they said he was killed in the rebellion what has happened to the ladies of the harem to baba hassan and azura i should have been with them if i had been then maybe this would not have happened azura always said i was the stable influence in caynan reiss life the arm about her tightened and then the duke said if ye hae been wi them india ye might hae been killed or worse shipped off to some other mans harem or sold on the block thank god ye are home safe wi yer mother and me than wi that rebel you dont understand papa my husband was not a traitor she explained her face tearstreaked the janissaries were plotting against the sultan and it was my husband who warned the valideh and her son of the plot he took a great chance but he did it for us and our children the valideh was certain to reward him for his loyalty and he was going to ask for autonomy for el sinut the people of el sinut would not have revolted they were a peaceful contented and prosperous people it is surely the janissaries who have killed my husband and there is nothing ye can do about it lassie he told her the man is gone god help him but yere alive i cannot weep for a man i dinna know who took my daughter from me and got her wi bairn i must protect ye india tomorrow the weather will be fair as it always is after two days of gray and rain ye go up to acuil then lassie dinna fret for yell hae all the comforts ye want ill nae hae my lass uncomfortable india i just want ye where there will be nae gossip yes papa what else could she say india thought sadly she would be twenty in the summer but had had only a small control over her personal fortune before she fled england with adrian leigh now she had not even that they had made certain she had no access to her wealth but for pin money and she would not now until she married where could she and meggie go without funds she was trapped and for the time being forced to cooperate with her parents let them think she was doing it willingly and when they were lulled into believing her complacent she would take her son and find a safe haven where no one would care about her or her child eventually they would have to relent there had to be someplace in this world where she could go she would sell her jewelry to give them a new start there had to be someplace where she could raise caynan reiss son in safety the duke of glenkirk kissed his daughters forehead i am glad yere being reasonable sweeting i know yeve had a terrible misadventure but dinna fret sweeting papa will make it all right for ye just as i always hae done eh gods boots india thought as he left her does he really still think of me as a child certainly he saw the woman she was or did he james leslie had been a wonderful father he loved all his wifes children the three she had had by her second husband rowan lindley the son she had had by prince henry stuart the sons she had given him he loved them so well that not one of them but india had left the comfort of their family since her departure however her brother henry the marquis of westleigh had made the decision to live at his seat at cadby in england but the rest of them were still at home papa might complain about fortunes not being able to go to her estates in ireland and seek a husband and he might blame indias disappearance for it but he didnt really seem too enthusiastic about sending fortune off next summer james leslie was a patriarch and he obviously enjoyed having his children about him but he would not welcome his first grandchild india knew what he meant to do with her child she had no idea but she would have time to make her escape once the baby was born mama would protect them she was certain for now she knew she needed rest and the security of knowing that she would be safe and well cared for while she carried caynan reiss son who was he she wondered not for the first time while she had been with him it hadnt mattered at all for he was caynan reis the dey of el sinut but he had been someone else before he had been caynan reis and now she desperately wished she knew who that someone was she wanted a name for her child who would never know his father the next day dawned bright and cold as james leslie had predicted the small caravan was prepared by midmorning and ready to depart india had decided to accept the comfort of a cart as opposed to riding her horse a baggage wagon was ladened high as was another wagon with enough provisions to last them the winter jasmine was very teary for she didnt approve of sending her daughter into the mountains to the familys hunting lodge acuil was small she knew for she had spent time there herself but it was far more isolated than jasmine would have wished what happened if indias child decided to come in a snowstorm how could she get to her daughter please jemmie dont send her to acuil she begged her husband at the last minute mama its all right india said i am quite content to go meggie will be with me and diarmid will do the heavy work such as cutting us wood for our fire and hunting for our game i wont be the cause of spoiling fortunes chances in the marriage market my situation is rather unique she finished with a wry smile the lass hae more sense than ye do darling jasmine her husband chided his weeping wife and im going too fortune announced suddenly you most certainly are not jasmine snapped aye i am mama fortune declared with a toss of her red head come mama we are very isolated here at glenkirk who will know if i am here at glenkirk or in edinburgh or wherever i want to be with india i lost my sister once and ill not lose her again there jasmine cried to her husband are you satisfied now jemmie i will lose both my girls because of your stubbornness and excessive pride he knew better than to argue with her he knew better than to argue with fortune go along diarmid and take yer party of ladies up the ben he looked to his second daughter dinna come down the ben alone lassie if ye go ye stay would ye miss christmas and twelfth night at glenkirk twill be yer last if i let ye go off to ireland next year ive enjoyed many a christmas and twelfth night at glenkirk papa fortune said quietly now i would be with my sister for i believe she needs me more than you do then fortune climbed upon the large gray gelding she favored and followed after indias little train jasmine swallowed back her tears saying to her husband does she know what you intend doing with her child jemmie nay he said there was nae need to distress her ye saw she was almost herself again i dinna want to spoil it aye jasmine agreed you were wise not to do so she looked after her two eldest daughters and thought she heard india laugh as fortune caught up with the cart is mama still weeping the younger asked her elder sibling as the gelding danced dangerously near the wheels of the vehicle no she stopped india replied what made you come with me she asked fortune have you ever been to acuil its tiny oldfashioned and dull not to mention very small well probably end up killing each other id rather be with you than stuck at glenkirk all winter fortune responded you can tell me all about your adventures and what its like to be loved by a man i have that ahead of me next summer if papa lets you go india said mama wont let him stop us this time fortune replied so you noticed it too how suddenly he does not want to let his iasses go away she laughed poor papa he really does love us all doesnt he but by this time next year you and i will have husbands henry is already settled at cadby and the king has written to papa that after this winter charlie must become part of the court and take his rightful place at queens malvern as the duke of lundy should hell just have to be content with patrick adam and duncan india laughed in response to her sisters question i dont know but i think it will be up to us to help her escape fortune its so good to hear you laugh again fortune said there hasnt been a great deal to laugh about lately india answered but soon i will have my son and then i will be happy beware fortune warned india papa means to take the bairn from you mama is trying to change his mind in the matter mama will succeed but in the event she does not india said papa will find a deadly enemy in me for i shall not allow my child to be taken from me fortune this is caynan reiss son and i will protect him as will the spirit of his father we will let nothing happen to our son and james leslie be damned if he should attempt to harm my child india said fiercely you have changed fortune said softly aye india agreed i have become a hard enemy to any who would threaten me or mine chapter acuil had come into the possession of the leslies of glenkirk through the current dukes mother lady stewarthepburn it had belonged to cats paternal grandmother jean gordon hay who had given it to cat its value was in its isolated beauty and the mountain forest that belonged to it it had been used as a hunting lodge by several generations of gordons hays and leslies and always kept ready for visitors once in the nottoodistant past jemmie and jasmine had hidden themselves there to escape a rival for jasmines affections the small lodge itself was set upon a cliff that commanded a spectacular view of glenkirk castle sithean castle and greyhaven cats girlhood home as well as several small lochs far below the forest surrounded the lodge and its stables it was beautiful wild and totally isolated built of stone with a slate roof it was virtually undetectable nestled on its cliff the endless sky spread out above it while knowing of its existence neither india nor fortune had ever been to acuil the wellmarked trail from glenkirk castle grew fainter and fainter as they climbed into the hills and finally up the steep ben several times the cart tilted so precariously that india thought it would tip over casting her down onto the gorse and rocks at one point the forest was so deep that the sun scarcely penetrated to the forest floor up and up their little train climbed until finally they entered out into a sunny clearing where the lodge and its stables were set neatly awaiting them gods boots fortune swore it is small isnt it you can go back with the provisions cart india said fortune shook her head nay twill be an adventure and besides the forest looks like good hunting ive hunted with diarmid moreleslie before between us well keep in fresh meat indias cart came to a halt and she exited the vehicle as fortune slid from her horses back lets go inside india said i want to see the living quarters within the lodge was charming but as they had been warned of insignificant proportions on the main floor there were but two rooms the smaller of the two served as a kitchen area with its tiny pantry the larger room with its big fireplace and wall oven would be where they spent most of their time and where they would cook their food for the little kitchen had no hearth the furnishings were simple although over the years a few more comfortable pieces had been added than were originally there there was a small trestle and two chairs in the kitchen jesu india grumbled tis colder than a witchs tit in january in here diarmid she shouted bring some wood were freezing to death in here meggie go and help him yes my lady meggie said running outside where she would have sworn it was far warmer than inside the damp lodge lets see whats upstairs fortune said and began to climb the narrow flight of stairs followed by her elder sister at the top of the stairs they found a single bedchamber and entered it on the door wall was a fireplace to the left was a bank of casement windows overlooking part of the valley view and the forest to the right was a single round window it was not a large room but it comfortably held several pieces of furniture opposite the door was a goodsized canopied and curtained bed at its foot was a carved clothes chest there was a little table beneath the round window and a tapestried chair by the fireplace there was a pier glass on the bit of wall to the left of the door on the floor were several thick sheepskins everything is clean even the windows india noted papa must have been planning this since i returned to glenkirk she turned and slowly descended into the main room of the lodge even here everything is dusted and swept but it really is small when i think of my palace in el sinut why my personal apartments were larger than this by far werent they meggie your day room was bigger than this meggie said frankly this is nae more than a wee mousies hold my lady but more folk hae lived in smaller places i can tell you well manage diarmid had brought the wood and there was already a fire started in the large fireplace ill begin a fire in the bedchamber my lady he told india put enough wood in there for the night she told him i dont want to be frozen in the morning the carters from glenkirk unloaded the provisions and directed by meggie brought them into the lodge where the serving woman put them away there was flour for baking salt and spices bundles of herbs were hung from the kitchens rafters several barrels of wine ale and apples were stored in the larder along with a large wheel of cheese and two whole hams two milk cows had climbed the ben tied to the back of the cart they were now led into their barn a coop holding half a dozen chickens and a rooster were uncrated in the yard a haunch of beef and one of venison were hung in the larder next to the ham there was even a block of sugar and a small barrel filled with honeycombs there was a large fat tomcat to keep the rodent population down a small collie and a deer hound for company protection and hunting last chance to go back to glenkirk india said to fortune as the carts began their return journey it was past the noon hour and the sun would set in another two hours im starving fortune said ignoring the invitation whats for dinner ill see whats in the basket meggie said cook was kind enough to send something along so we would nae hae to fuss today she bustled into the kitchen what a treasure fortune noted to her sister you were fortunate to find each other she isnt any older than we are is she what luck she didnt decide to return to ayr india i dont think she would have left my service india replied but when papa inquired discreetly for her we found her mother had died suddenly even before meggie was captured and her father killed her betrothed of course had done exactly as she had anticipated and wed with his second choice meggies rival there was nothing for her to go back to fortune supper was a roasted capon a rabbit pie reheated in the brick fireplace oven bread cheese and apples india insisted that diarmid eat with them at the trestle dragging two more little chairs from the common room so they might all sit you must go back down to glenkirk tomorrow she told him and tell papa we need carrots onions and leeks we cannot live the winter on just meat bread and cheese aye mlady but i dinna know why not tis good food the clansman said still the duke hae told me to humor ye and so ill go for ye as long as the weather is good i can fetch up whatever takes yer fancy will there be anything else while im about it pears theyll keep in the cold india said and conserves fortune added and perhaps some jam i like jam on my bread check in the kitchen meggie india told her servant and see if there is anything else youll need the clansman nodded and having finished his meal took his leave of the women saying ill leave the collie wi ye bar the doors both front and back mlady ill be sleeping in the stable loft theres a wee room there will you be warm enough india fretted aye the room is tight and i hae the dog for warmth he told her with a small smile then he was gone out the door which meggie shut and firmly barred the three young women slept in the upstairs bedchamber india and fortune sharing the big bed meggie on the trundle pulled from beneath the bed the collie lay down at the head of the stairs as if guarding them until sleep finally claimed her too the following day dawned clear after a meal of oat cakes and ale diarmid moreleslie went down the ben to glenkirk to fetch the required items meggie began to put her kitchen in order while india and fortune explored the nooks and crannies of the lodge discovering an old oak tub in a kitchen recess and some womans clothing in a small trunk in the upstairs hall do you think they were mamas india wondered aloud nay fortune said admiring the doeskin jerkin with the silverandhorn buttons she had just pulled out mama wasnt as longwaisted and the style is oldfashioned besides mama never wore such a garment in her entire life she is far more elegant fortune tried on the jerkin i think it may have belonged to papas mother they say she hid herself up here to avoid marrying her first husband i think ill keep it i like hunting clothes it suits you india said smiling at her younger sister then she caught her breath suddenly what is it fortune said seeing a strange look come over her sisters beautiful face he moved india half whispered the baby moved within me fortune then she burst into tears as she sat down upon the top step of the staircase damn damn damn she swore softly my bairn is alive within me and his father will never know him it isnt fair fortune it just isnt fair you have hardly spoken of him since you came home fortune said sitting down next to her older sister and putting an arm about her did you love him very much india what was he like was he handsome india sniffled wiping her nose on her sleeve aye he was handsome he was tall and had hair like a ravens wing and the bluest eyes you have ever seen his nose was straight and his jaw firm and his mouth she paused a moment then continued his mouth was the most deliciously kissable mouth in all the world whats it like being kissed fortune asked wonderful india replied i cannot explain it someday you will kiss the man you love and you will understand fortune i suppose so fortune replied matteroffactly their days took on a comfortable cadence by virtue of their social status india and fortune had never really done a great deal for themselves now however they arose each morning and after dressing fortune went down to the barn to gather eggs from their hens and drive the cows into the small pasture on sunny days until it snowed the cows could forage but once the winter set in they would be confined to the barn it became indias task to set the table for meals and gather up the clothing that would need laundering but neither of the other two girls wanted india overtaxed for the sake of her child some days fortune rode off into the forest with diarmid to hunt for small game india and meggie walked in the forest and high meadows most early afternoons and meggie cooked and cleaned and did the laundry the sisters however kept the bedchamber neat and dusted each morning they shook out their featherbed as meggie taught them and then drew the bed clothes back over it smoothly and neatly neither had ever done such simple tasks but it helped to fill the lonely hours fortune had requested her lute be sent up from glenkirk and on many evenings she played for them and they sang the old songs of unrequited love great battles heroes and kings diarmid had his pipes and was easily encouraged to play like his brother red hugh he was a big man of few words but practical and kindly his hair was a nut brown and his eyes an amber hue he wore a short beard with his hair drawn back secured by a leather thong he was popular with the ladies the sisters knew but he had never married the winter would be lonelier for him than for his three female charges who at least had each other while deferential to the dukes two daughters diarmid had struck up a budding friendship with meggie up before the first light each dawn he had the fireplaces blazing and water brought into the kitchen even before meggie came down to put the bread dough that had been rising all night in the oven to bake while he spoke little to india and fortune meggie could get him talking and even bring a rosy flush to the big mans cheeks youve made a conquest india teased her maid servant hummph meggie replied but she smiled just before christmas it snowed they awoke to find the white flakes swirling about the lodge diarmid found a yule log for them in the nearby forest and dragged it into the little house on christmas eve setting it in the fireplace where it burned merrily for almost two days they took turns telling the christmas story and sang yule songs they lit a fire outside on the cliff top on twelfth night and watched as the other fires sprang up for as far as the eye could see vying to identify the glenkirk fire first now the winter set in hard india insisted that diarmid sleep before the common room fire at night rather than in his stabletop loft it was just too cold even the cows horses and poultry were brought into a small shed attached to the lodge on the kitchen side it was warmer for them there than the stables the lodge took on an earthy smell but it did not bother either india or fortune survival was more important by february the days were beginning to grow longer again but the weather remained cold and snowy by march the snow came less frequently more often than not mixing with the rain indias belly was now enormous and she waddled when she walked but she never complained instead she would lie upon her bed her hand protectively cradling her stomach a dreamy expression upon her face as she wondered what her child would look like it would be a boy of course her instinct told her that what would she call him she knew that caynan reis had been a european by birth but that was all she knew his origins and his name remained a mystery to her if she had known his name she would have named her child after his father but she hadnt a clue finally she decided i shall call him rowan after our own father india told her younger sister one rainy march afternoon rowan what fortune asked frankly hell have to have my name as i dont know his fathers india replied just as frankly rowan lindley i like it and what will you do after rowan lindley is born you dont still mean to go off by yourself with your child india do you fortune was beginning to worry about her sister it is what i want to do india replied calmly i will not bring shame upon you and ruin your chances of marriage because of my adventures gods blood fortune swore do you think i care what people may say i am lady fortune lindley daughter of the late marquis of westleigh an heiress in my own right and anyone who does not love my familyall my familycan go to the devil think about it india our heritage is greater than anyones our grandfather was a great ruler of a great land our greatgrandmother bested a mighty queen and lived to tell the tale what a woman she was madame skye we are women who make our own rules in life and then live by them we are not mealymouthed pious little kirkgoers who live dully and sin in the shadows we live as we please do as we please and the devil take any who would dare to criticize us india burst out laughing do you know how much i missed you when i was away fortune well fortune replied i am your sister then she jumped up it isnt raining hard get your cloak and lets go for a walk take your boots off before you come into this house then meggie warned them ill nae hae you two tracking mud all over my clean floors she glared at them sternly come with us india begged im nae a duck my lady meggie said and besides i hae to start the dinner rabbit stew again the sisters chorused be glad spring is here meggie said sharply twill be the last of the carrots and onions you see in that stew tonight and lucky we are to hae it almost everything is gone and only that diarmid trapped the rabbit this morning wed be haeing bread and toasted cheese the sisters walked through the forest to a high meadow the light rain stopped and the sun peeped out now and again from behind the thinning clouds when they returned to the lodge meggies stew was bubbling in the pot and it smelled wonderful india slowly climbed the narrow little staircase to the bedchamber to lie down for she was tired and her back hurt she awoke to a piercing pain meggie fortune she called struggling to sit up hearing her call the two girls raced up the stairs and into the bedchamber one look told them that india was probably about to have her child early do you know what to do fortune asked meggie meggie swallowed hard saying i think so i was there when my mother birthed her last child well need hot water clean clothes and for gods sake send diarmid down to glenkirk to tell the duchess shell want to come and be with my lady india this could take hours fortune flew from the room dashed down the stairs filled the cauldron with water and set it to boil then out into the stable yard she ran calling to diarmid as she went the big man took one look at the girl and knew the reason for her fright and excitement get yer horse mistress fortune and ride to fetch yer mam and yer da yere no use here i can see ill be more help to meggie than ye will lassie meaning no offense to ye fortune didnt argue with the big man she knew he was being kind and more important speaking the truth ive put a kettle on to boil and theres a stack of clean cloths we prepared for this occasion in the cupboard in the fireplace wall diarmid he nodded and walked toward the lodge as she hurried into the stable to saddle her gray it was a twohour ride to glenkirk but she would make it before sunset still mama would be coming up the ben in the darkness but come she would fortune tightened the cinch on the gray and clambered onto his back riding him right out the stable doors and onto the track that led down the ben toward glenkirk indias labor was hard but very very short she sweated and she swore blue oaths that turned meggies face bright red and set diarmid to chuckling as he encouraged her onward ohh mlady dinna let the bairn hear such words and him just coming new into the world meggie pleaded with her mistress bloody hell india snarled it hurts damn it why wont the little wretch be born ahhhhh merde merde merde yere doing fine lassie diarmid said quietly now when ye feel the pain again gie us a hard push to help the wee laddie along india nodded i dinna think you should be here meggie fretted he stays india snapped he obviously knows more about this than you do besides i suspect theres nothing i have that diarmid hasnt already seen ooooooooh push lassie push ah theres a good lass diarmid said calmly in the very same tone india had heard him use with the collie and heres his wee head dark as a ravens wing it is gie us another push lassie and when india complied he said hes half born now and bending he opened the infants mouth and pulled a clot of mucus out of it the baby took a breath and began to wail ohhhh ohhh ohhhh india cried and feeling herself swept by another spasm she pushed hard again and felt the baby sliding fully from her body is he all right let me see him she cried out to them meggie had caught the child in a linen cloth as it was born she wrapped it about the baby and lay him on his mothers belly here he is my lady she said tears in her eyes india cradled her son for a long moment he did have black hair and the blue eyes that looked up at her were the eyes of caynan reis tears slipped down her face as she looked at this miracle their love for each other had wrought the baby had stopped crying now rowan lindley is your name my son she whispered to him gie me back the laddie my lady diarmid said i must cut the cord and ye must let meggie finish what ye hae started ye dinna need me here now he took the child neatly cutting and knotting the cord then without another word he left the bedchamber thank you diarmid moreleslie india called after him meggie now wiped the baby free of the birthing blood with warmed oil and wine then she swaddled the infant giving him back to india who pushed the afterbirth from her body into the basin meggie held setting the ewer aside the servant took the child again and set him in his cradle by indias side then she helped her mistress up bathed her gave her a fresh shift settled her in the chair by the fire and changed the linens on the bed finally she helped india back into the bed returning the baby to her to cuddle then gathering up all the debris of the birthing process she said ill leave you wi the bairn mlady ill come back shortly wi a nice hot posset to nourish you and put wee master rowan in his cradle then india lay quietly cuddling her newborn son he was everything caynan reis would have wanted beautiful and strong of limb she searched his small face for some sign of his father but only the blue eyes reminded her of her husband the little baby face was entirely unfamiliar but the look he suddenly gave her was direct and fierce we will do fine you and i rowan son of caynan reis she told him the infant closed his eyes and was immediately asleep safe in the comfort of his mothers arms looking through the window india could see a magnificent sunset she was half dozing when meggie returned bringing with her a mixture of herbs eggs and rich red wine the servant took the baby and set him in his cradle which she moved to the warmth of the fireplace india drank down the nourishment and handing the goblet back to meggie fell asleep meggie tiptoed from the room and back down the stairs to join diarmid in the common room ill get us some supper she said my lady and the bairn are sleeping tis been a long day do you think the duke and duchess will come tonight diarmid aye he answered her the duchess will be anxious over her eldest lass theyll come mistress fortune will hae reached glenkirk long since im thinking tis only sunset now and the twilight will last a bit longer theyll come wi torches up the ben the dogs will let us know when they approach she served them up plates of rabbit stew bread and cheese they toasted rowan lindley in the last of the brown october ale he helped her with the washing up and then together they sat companionably by the fire talking low it was dark when the dogs began to bark diarmid arose and going to the lodges door opened it he could see the flickering of the torches through the trees as the dukes party came out of the forest and into the clearing james leslie duke of glenkirk pushed his horse forward stopping by diarmid moreleslies side and asking is the bairn born yet he dismounted several hours ago my lord a laddie strong and sweet was the reply jasmine dismounted her stallion is my daughter all right very well my lady shes sleeping come into the house meggie can tell ye more the clansman told his duchess see to the men the duke commanded him and taking his wifes arm entered the lodge meggie bobbed a curtsey my lord my lady jasmine smiled at the serving girl and then hurried up the stairs to the bedchamber entering it she saw india sleeping soundly she looked into the cradle and smiled the baby was absolutely beautiful mama india suddenly called to her mother sweeting he is a lovely lad jasmine said softly his name is rowan india murmured then fell back to sleep jasmines heart contracted painfully her daughter had named this infant after her own true father she doubted india could remember anything of rowan lindley but she had chosen to name her child after him the duchess of glenkirk went back downstairs again how is our lass jemmie asked his wife sleeping though she woke a moment she has called her son rowan he is a beautiful boy jasmine told her husband you know what must be done the duke said stonily his handsome face set jemmie in the name of god i beg you not to do this thing india will never forgive you is that what you want for your daughter to hate you for the rest of her life jasmine pleaded with her husband jasmine we hae no other choice we hae discussed this all winter long there is nae other way if indias reputation is to be salvaged we hae had a good offer for the girl and ive taken it but she canna go to her husband wi her bastard my grandson is no more a bastard than i was james leslie jasmine said angrily but her marriage to this infidel and this child are nae easily explained the duke said india will be wed as soon as we can manage it the earl is willing to do it by proxy and then she will be gone down into england before the summer hae come in jasmine his tone softened do ye remember the time that acuil was our refuge do not attempt to wheedle me jemmie his wife said harshly meggie was totally confused but rather than tax herself with the meaning of the conversation between the duke and the duchess she brought them wine instead they thanked her and then the duke told his daughters serving woman to go upstairs and remain with her mistress for the night he and his wife would remain here the baby was beginning to whimper when meggie entered the room india was instantly awake and meggie brought her child to her to be put to the breast the infant nursed until he fell asleep and meggie returned him to his cradle twice more before the dawn the boy was fed at his mothers breast india speaking softly to her son gently touching his soft downy dark hair the sun was just beginning to peep through the bedchamber windows when the duke of glenkirk entered the chamber india awoke as her father reached into the cradle and taking the baby out made to leave the room give me my son india said frightened and meggie sleeping by the fire awoke and looked from her mistress to the duke ye hae nae bairn india the duke said and departed his booted footsteps echoing as he went down the stairs india scrambled from her bed and after him give me my son she shrieked if you hurt him i shall kill you papa give me my son the duke of glenkirk handed the baby now awake and crying to diarmid moreleslie ye know what to do he said the clansman took the swaddled infant and exited the lodge through the front door weakened india lurched down the stairs screaming bring mm back bring my son back she fell the last few steps but struggling to her feet tried to follow after her child the duke shut the door and blocking it with his large body said to her tis for the best lovey yere to be wed in a few weeks time the lad will be taken care of i promise ye he reached out for her india shrank back her eyes wild get away from me you bastard get away i want my son i want my son she flung herself at him and tried to claw him aside there there lassie twill be all right he promised her and caught the hands that would beat at him in her effort to follow diarmid and her child jasmine he called to his wife come and take yer daughter back to her room she will need her rest now if she is to recover and be wed on time jasmine glared at her husband she had never known jemmie to be such an insensitive clod she tried to cradle her daughter but india flung her mother away how could you let him do this madame the distraught girl sobbed how could you allow him to take my son iwill never forgive you i will never forgive either of you then she collapsed to the floor sobbing bitterly she was cold cold as ice the fire caynan reis had roused in her had been extinguished when they had kidnapped her son rowan she felt nothing but emptiness and for a time did not care if she lived or died it made no difference none of it made any difference her eyes once an unusual gold were now dulled amber she spoke only when spoken to and then her answers were monosyllabic or as brief as she could make them she wept more often than not the day her breasts finally dried up of their milk she was completely inconsolable and attempted to fling herself from the battlements of glenkirk castle the duke of glenkirk was furious and frantic by turns he had done what he truly believed was best for his beloved stepdaughter yet she would not see it india was no longer in the first flush of her youth the marriage offer he had received from england had been the answer to his prayers india would have the noble husband she deserved and none but a sworntosecrecy few would be the wiser of her misadventures her intended had agreed to all the conditions laid down by the leslies of glenkirk in order to protect their daughter and her personal wealth the large dowry had already been paid but here it was the beginning of may and the bride was nowheres fit to travel south to her new lord indeed she grew thinner and paler with every passing day a largeeyed darkhaired wraith whose only show of spirit was the look of hatred she fastened on her parents whenever they came into her view i tried to stop him jasmine attempted to explain to her eldest child as she sat with her one afternoon trying to reach her for the first time in all our marriage i could not reason with him india i am attempting to find out where they have taken your son when i do i swear to you that the lad will lack for nothing except his mother india responded bitterly how could you madame you of all people who was forcibly taken from her own natural mother how could you rob me of the only thing i had left of caynan reis at least my grandmother had the comfort of knowing that you were with your father and your foster mother was her dear friend rugaiya begum i have no such comfort my lawful husband is dead in an uprising our son is stolen from me and i am to be sent as wife to some stranger i want my child returned to me she had not spoken so much or so very passionately since they had brought her back to glenkirk from acuil i do not know where rowan is jasmine repeated i am trying to find out india but i am not capable of miracles jemmie has been most adamant in this matter as for your betrothed husband you have little time left to dissemble on the subject your marriage has been arranged and you will go to england as soon as you can travel no later than the end of the month your father says she caught her daughters hands in hers and looked into those dreadful dead eyes india now possessed it is a good match india and he agreed to all our terms considering your age we are very lucky i was content to take my child find my own home and live a quiet discreet life madame india replied she was ready at last to voice her anger how would you have explained rowan her mother asked why would i have to explain my son india snapped did not my greatgrandmother return from algiers enceinte and who dared to challenge her story of a spanish merchant who had been her husband aunt willow was accepted to polite society she even served the old queen as a maid of honor and married quite well too why was i not believed why was my son ripped from my breast just hours after his birth and hidden away as if he was something shameful there has never ever been any question regarding my aunts parentage jasmine said defensively india snorted derisively i suppose it was a simpler time she said mockingly it would have been better if i had lived then rather than now then i should have my child with me i am doing my best jasmine wearily told her daughter your best is not good enough madame india answered her coldly you should have prevented your husband from kidnapping my son india your father did what he thought was right to protect you jasmine cried james leslie is not my father madame rowan lindley was my father as for you you may have given me life but i should have been better off being raised by a shewolf as by you you who played the strumpet before the whole court with prince henry and bore his bastard openly and proudly you who kept the child of that liaison yet i who was lawfully wed to my husband has been robbed of our child now you want me to marry a husband of your choosing and go off to england as if everything is perfect so the bloody leslies of glenkirk and their overproud duke will not be put to scorn and shame well madame i shall indeed go and do your bidding but for one reason and one reason alone to get away from you and james leslie you will never be welcome in my home i never want to see either of you again once i have departed this place jasmine staggered back as if her daughter had physically assaulted her indias words cold hard unforgiving battered her her chest felt tight and she could barely breathe with the pain who is he india demanded what jasmine croaked the single word neither you nor your husband have bothered to tell me who this paragon is that i am to wed india said who is he the earl of oxton jasmine began only to be interrupted by a screech from her outraged daughter the earl of oxton adrians father he is a dying man and he has a wife india shrilled adrians father is dead he died some months ago jasmine murmured his second wife the italian woman was returned to her family by the current earl lord deverall leigh adrians brother the murderer really madame this is too much even for you and your husband to have done india was outraged to her very core they would marry her to a murderer lord leigh has been cleared of all the charges concerning lord jefferss death jasmine began hesitantly waiting for india to shriek again and when she didnt continued hurriedly he returned to england several months ago with the information that exonerated him and the king gave him a pardon he was reunited with his father who died shortly thereafter the dowager countess was then sent to italy banished by royal command from ever entering england again lord leigh saw you at court when you were a child he inquired regarding your marital status and when he learned you were not wed offered for you it is an ideal arrangement india despite the royal pardon he is slightly tarnished by the matter that threatened his good name for so long respectable families will not consider him as a soninlaw as for you while there is no firm ground upon which you may be charged with misbehavior publicly there are too many suspicious and enough wagging tongues who remember your lessthandiscreet conduct regarding adrian leigh which renders you equally difficult to match no matter your vast wealth and excellent connections jasmine concluded you would not let me marry adrian but you will allow me to marry his wastrel halfbrother i am confused india said sarcastically the earls of oxton are a reputable family jasmine explained ignoring her daughters caustic tone deverall leighs mother was susanne deverall daughter of the marquise of whitley another eminent family the unfortunate adrian had a foreign mother of lessthandistinguished lineage according to lady stewarthepburn the di carlo family in naples were merchanttraders less than two generations ago both the leslies and the omalley family are in trade india said what makes us any different from the di carlos really india jasmine answered her daughter surprised our families were noble first and merchanttraders only because we enjoy it and the gold that flows into our coffers from our endeavors had the di carlos not helped some duke avoid a scandal they could not have climbed as high as they did and they have come no further had not their daughters youth and beauty captivated the late lord charles leigh who knows what would have happened to her as it was she was no better than a whore in her behavior which undoubtedly drove poor lord charles to his death his eldest son however is a very suitable match for you he is i am told a pleasantlooking man whose youthful exuberance has been long since tempered by his adventures it matters not india said stonily he wants children jasmine said softly do you think another mans child will make me forget my firstborn india replied icily did grandmother really ever forget you madame how many tears did she weep in hidden silence i will weep far more not even knowing the fate of my son i will find him i swear it jasmine promised her daughter the dead eyes flicked over the older woman i expect a trousseau madame and all my possessions jewels plate linens furs whatever is mine i will take with me for i shall never return here again you shall have everything everything you want dearest jasmine said you are an heiress in your own right and the duke of glenkirks stepdaughter we will not allow you to go to your husband in a beggarly fashion i wish to leave the thirtieth of may i shall go to queens malvern first where is oxton court madame india asked not far from queens malvern but not in worcester in gloscester jasmine told her daughter the estate is very lovely and rural i am informed i believe you will like it there it matters not if i do or nay india replied it will be my home until i die and am reunited with my beloved caynan reis if you die jasmine said pithily then what will become of young rowan lindley will you not live on the hope of finding your little son one day india perhaps if the earl of oxton is a kind man and you win his favor the child can come and live with you do not i beg you tell your stepfather that i said that he would be angry with me for even thinking it and then i would have no chance of finding your son for you my daughter do you think it possible india asked her voice hopeful for the first time if you gain your husbands love and trust it might be possible jasmine encouraged her daughter i must tell him immediately else he wonder why i am not a virgin india said i am certain that the duke has not even considered my predicament in that matter how am i to explain such a thing if i have never been wed he will think me a wanton but your husband did not think of that did he all he considered was a good offer and a chance to rid his conscience of my presence jasmine had no answer to her daughters accusation for the truth of the matter was india was absolutely correct james leslie had been so delighted by a decent offer for india that he had snatched at it like a drowning man at a straw when she had brought up the fact of indias womanly condition her husband in one of his maddeningly rare bouts of scots logic had suggested ways to give india the appearance of virginity and jasmine should see to them the duchess of glenkirk had swallowed back her humorous retort because she could see her jemmie was deadly serious and that he wanted this match for india i think she said carefully that you might tell the earl of oxton that you contracted a marriage while abroad but that your bridegroom died shortly thereafter there are ways of restoring the tightness of your love sheath india and i would advise we consider them there is no reason you should not like your husband mayhap you will come to love him as you are aware of the pleasures a man and a womans bodies can give each other you will surely want to give the earl sweet enjoyment it cannot help but win him over so that he will want to please you in all matters even that of little rowan and when do i explain that to my new husband india asked half sarcastically half warily only when you have gained his full respect and confidence her mother advised india wherever your son is he is safe jemmie may be a hard man but he has never been deliberately cruel the child is unharmed and well cared for by some cotters wife delighted to have the extra income this woman knows she must take good guardianship of her ward else she lose the silver paid her and be severely punished remember the dukes own man brought her the child i have told you and you cannot say i ever broke a promise to you that i will find your rowan then i will begin to make personal visits to him impressing upon his caretaker the importance of this child his health and his happiness while i am doing that it is up to you to make your husband love you or at the very least want to please you enough so you may ask to have little rowan brought to you i shall tell the earl before we wed that i have a son india said stubbornly i cannot be happy without my child and i cannot marry this man unless he agrees to allow me to have rowan with me india in gods name the duchess of glenkirk pleaded with her daughter wait before you inform lord leigh of your child if you ruin this proposed marriage where will you be jemmie will lock you up in glenkirks highest tower and you will never see your child again he will make certain of that if you are clever you can gain everything your heart desires do not spite yourself and your son simply to gain a moments revenge on your stepfather india was silent for what seemed a very long time to her mother then at last she said you are correct madame i would be very foolish indeed should i act in haste now tell me when is my marriage to be celebrated and where here at glenkirk by proxy prior to your departure jasmine answered the earl has left the choice of a proxy to you since neither henry nor charlie are here i think the best choice would be my brother patrick leslie india said it will be good practice for him when he weds one day patrick and my younger brothers seem to know little of the niceties of polite society although i know you strive hard with them madame still they persist in being wild scots fix the day for the thirtieth of may at dawn and then i shall depart immediately thereafter for england will the earl send an escort for me you will be escorted as far as the border by glenkirk men and the earls men will meet you there the duchess told her daughter i am taking meggie with me and diarmid moreleslie would come too he and meggie have asked my permission to wed i have given it they will marry immediately after i have been wed it is far more practical that they travel as man and wife jasmine nodded agreeing with her daughter your father stepfather must give his permission to diarmid she said surely he can have no objection india replied oh i am sure he does not jasmine replied quickly lest india fly into a temper again we havent a great deal of time madame we should begin my trousseau immediately india announced and i will want a full accounting of my possessions as well nothing of mine is to remain at glenkirk i am giving you the stars of kashmir as a wedding gift jasmine said softly you are my eldest child and my first daughter when your first daughter weds one day see that you give the jewels to her they are to remain in the female line jamal khans father gave them to his mother and he gave them to me now i give them to you india mama india was overwhelmed surely you do not want to part with the stars of kashmir now do you jasmine laughed i always meant them for you she said besides we live simply here at glenkirk i have no occasion to wear them anymore and they simply lay alone in their case you will enjoy them i am sure perhaps the earl will take you to court and you can dazzle everyone there with them it would be amusing to visit court as the countess of oxton india remarked i hope however this earl prefers the country i will not leave the raising of my children to others jasmine nodded in agreement the next day seamstresses arrived from the local villages to prepare the trousseau india would be taking with her to england she stood patiently being measured and pinned she chose the finest and richest fabrics in the castle storerooms jeweltoned velvets and rich brocades and silks the farthingale was no longer fashionable skirts were flowing numerous underpetticoats were required to support the gown skirts these were made of fine lacetrimmed cotton and soft white flannel the skirt petticoats which topped the underpetticoats were of silk and brocade there were chemises perfumed and plain but for a lace frill at the neck the necklines were cut low with a short v opening in front where it was tied with silk ribbons the large balloon sleeves of the chemises were finished with lace ruffles india also insisted upon a dozen pairs of calescons or silk drawers and a matching number of halfshirts she had at least two dozen nightgowns all lavishly trimmed with lace there shall be nothing left in the storerooms for my trousseau fortune complained watching enviously as the bejeweled bodices and matching skirts the furtrimmed capes and newly made leather boots and shoes with silver buckles piled up the bodices had beautiful buttons of precious stones as well as ivory and bone there were combs with pearls around the arch lawn handkerchiefs trimmed in lace muffs of fur and luxurious fabrics beautiful fans and painted masques the duchess had gathered all the jewelry that had been given to her by her second husband rowan lindley the marquis of westleigh the pieces that belonged to the lindley family she put aside for the bride her son henry the current marquis would choose one day the jewels that rowan had given her she divided equally between their two daughters india and fortune darkhaired india favored the sapphires and rubies flamehaired fortune preferred the emeralds and diamonds there were other things that belonged to india as well large carved chests of embroidered linens featherbeds pillows and bed coverings with matching draperies there were silver candlesticks and candelabra as well as ornate silver salt cellars there were decorated cups of both silver and gold florentine forks table knives with bone handles and silver spoons porcelain bowls plates and matching cups silver bowls all were gathered and packed carefully the days flew by with a rapidity that even surprised india she will nae forgie me darling jasmine will she the duke sadly said to his wife jasmine shook her head nay jemmie she will not forgive you and you cannot blame her that she does not do you think a husband can make up for the loss of her firstborn son the duchess of glenkirk touched her husbands face with a gentle hand i love you jemmie leslie but i agree with my daughter you have been monstrously unkind even i dont know where our grandson is it would be better if i knew so i might make certain that he is well cared for my lord a mans eye is never as keen as a womans in matters like this i should know if the cottage was truly clean and if the woman into whose hands you have put our grandson is really kindhearted or an abusive slattern india says the laddie was born in true wedlock and i believe her our grandson cannot be raised nameless or of little account jemmie he nodded he did not tell her but he had been to see the child several times now his grandson was safe but in a remote area of the estate lands the cotters wife thought his interest in the lad stemmed from the fact that the duke was his father she treated the child kindly envisioning an even greater reward one day it was not necessary that james leslie enlighten her otherwise rowan was a bright wee bairn his blue eyes darting about at every sound a thatch of black hair upon his tiny head when india is safe away in england james leslie said to his wife i will tell ye where the bairn is i know ye well darling jasmine and yell nae be satisfied until ye can see him again for yourself he caught the hand that caressed his cheek and kissed it the duchess smiled at him i am satisfied then she replied and later when she was alone with her daughter she told india of his words let it set your heart and mind at ease now my daughter she said gently to india jemmie is feeling guilty for he knows i thoroughly disapprove of his actions but he will not relent until he sees you happy again and wed you must make an effort india for all our sakes especially wee rowans i will india promised her mother more than anything i want my son back again two wedding gowns had been made for india she would wear the simpler one at her proxy wedding the bodice of the rosecolored silk gown had a square neckline and the bride wore a wired lace collar about her slender throat the opening of the skirt was decorated with an embroidered golden braid trim the skirt petticoat was silver and gold tissue the puffed sleeves were decorated with clothofgold bows to match the trim about her neck below the lace collar india wore a single strand of fat pearls with matching ear bobs her hair was dressed in a simple chignon on the nape of her neck on her feet she wore rosecolored silk slippers her halfbrother was dressed in his blueandgreen kilt his white shirt trimmed with lace on the sleeves silver buttons on his sleeveless velvet doublet patrick with his fathers dark hair and his mothers turquoisecolored eyes proudly escorted india to the altar where the anglican minister awaited them he made the responses required of him as the earl of oxtons representative in a clear loud voice indias voice was less sure the memory of her marriage day to caynan reis flooded her senses so painfully that she almost wept and was unable to speak for a moment when it was finally over she stood motionless receiving the congratulations of her family and wondering why they bothered tendering their good wishes when they knew she had been forced to the altar wordlessly she witnessed the marriage of her two servants meggie and diarmid a happier event for her as she knew the two were in love the formalities over they repaired to the great hall to break their fast the duke of glenkirk toasted his stepdaughter may ye be happy always and may ye hae healthy sons he lifted his goblet to her and then drank it down india glared outraged at him then she lifted her goblet to my son rowan wherever he may be she said softly james leslies eyes darkened with anger but then he laughed yere nae my problem any longer he said honestly eat yer meal india and then godspeed to ye lassie jasmine squeezed her daughters hand beneath the highboard silently begging india not to quarrel with james leslie the younger woman squeezed back her reassurance as the wedding breakfast of poached eggs in heavy cream and marsala wine was served along with baked apples flavored with cinnamon freshly baked bread still warm from the ovens newly churned sweet butter thick slices of ham and thin slices of salmon simmered in white wine with dill there was a honeycomb for the sweet tooth ale cider and wine were served to drink india gazed about the table her eyes lighting upon her siblings henry and charlie were in england she would see them soon enough her halfbrothers patrick adam and duncan now eleven ten and seven she would probably see rarely if ever again patrick of course would one day be the second duke of glenkirk the younger two would have to marry heiresses well never really know each other india thought sadly how lucky fortune and i were to have each other fortune beautiful practical yet impulsive fortune what did fate have in store for her macguires ford its castle and lands in ireland were of course her marriage portion but ireland was such a disturbed land still her parents had always spoken of seeking a husband for fortune in ireland her sister wasnt getting any younger she would be seventeen in july but who on earth was there in ireland who might make a suitable husband for fortune she looked at her sister fortune gazed up at that moment and smiled encouragingly at her whatever was meant for fortune she obviously had no fear of it i envy her india thought and how fortune would mock and tease her if she ever knew that india considered with a wry smile now that you have married me off madame india said to her mother i expect fortune will be next eh what have you in mind for my sister as you have obtained an earl for me certainly you must do as well for her i dont care who he is as long as he has a brain in his head and a good heart fortune replied laughing i dont need some mans title to make me presentable i have my own title we plan a visit to macguires ford this summer jasmine said we will not be coming to queens malvern i have been in correspondence with rory macguire our estate manager as fortune is the heiress to those lands the folk are very interested in meeting her as they have not seen her since she was an infant i remember when fortune was baptized india said it was in the church at macguires ford i remember telling greatgrandfather adam that i had wanted a pony not a baby sister a black pony who baptized fortune madame my cousin cullen butler the duchess replied a papist fortune looked shocked i was baptized by a papist mama why was i never told jasmine spoke quietly you certainly know how i feel regarding religion fortune i hold to the old queens maxim that there is but one lord jesus christ and the rest is all trifles my father held to such thought allowing all faiths to be practiced in his kingdom it is outrageous arrogance for any one faith in god to believe it is the beall and endall of religion that all other faiths are wrong did not our lord christ himself say that in his fathers house were many mansions surely he did not lie and if there are many mansions then there must be many paths leading to the doors of those mansions in gods kingdom aye you were baptized in what is referred to as the old faith your godparents are a good lady named bride duffy who is the most respected woman in the village and rory macguire our estate manager before the english took away his lands and gave them to me rory was the lord of erne rock castle he has cared for your lands with honest diligence i am very grateful to him as you should be the descendants of nighthawk and nightbird are the most soughtafter horses in both england and europe rory macguire has made you a rich woman fortune remember it well as for your baptism by a papist it is a valid one even in england fortune flushed i think i am going to have a great deal to learn about ireland mama i hope master macguire will help me so i do not offend the people i must care for but tell me this how is it that there has been peace on my lands all these years because both the poor beleaguered catholics and our protestant tenants have been taught to respect one another each has a church the village elders are equally divided and we keep our people as isolated as possible from the rest of the area so they will not be contaminated by the hate generated by the political and religious factions anyone unhappy with our rule is free to leave and go elsewhere the duchess of glenkirk said i will not have our lands in constant turmoil it is unproductive and wasteful that dreadful hate was responsible for your fathers death i will never forget that i do not know if i can keep such order fortune said nervously you are the lady of erne rock castle her mother told her with rory macguires aid and the right husband macguires ford will continue to flourish she now turned to india it is time for you to change your gown daughter and leave us you have a long trip ahead of you and the sooner you are on your way the better india arose from the highboard and departed the hall she found her bedchamber virtually bare and quite sparse for all her belongings had in accordance with her instructions been packed the baggage train that would accompany her was large meggie helped her from her gown shall i pack it she asked nay leave it i do not want it india said i would give it to you but i dont ever want to see it again to remind me of this day tis too grand for me meggie said cheerfully and besides when and where would i wear it i laid out yer riding clothes i thought you would prefer to be ahorse as to being in a closed carriage india nodded in agreement she pulled on the doeskin breeches and stout woolen socks her leather boots were more comfortable than the slippers she had worn a white shirt and doeskin jerkin with silveredged horn buttons completed her outfit along with the small green velvet cap with a single eagle feather she clapped upon her head she took the perfumed leather gloves meggie handed her and then stopped a moment to look about the room meggie discreetly withdrew while india was still furious with her stepfather she did have mixed feelings about departing glenkirk it had been her home for many years she had come as a child with henry fortune and charlie they had all grown up here chasing through the hallways playing hideandseek in the largely unused tower rooms she had been happy here glenkirk had been her refuge but she would now forever associate it with the loss of her son rowan for that she could thank her stepfather in one brutal act he had wiped away all those happy years no she would never forgive james leslie without a backward glance india swept from the room hurrying downstairs and out into the courtyard of the castle she bid the servants she had known since childhood a gracious farewell accepting their good wishes for her happiness she kissed her youngest brothers adam and duncan but patrick the eldest of the leslies thrust out his hand at her brushing it aside india hugged him hard dont be in such a hurry to grow up paddy she whispered its hard to be grown as youll find out one day too soon i fear dinna saw at yer horses mouth he replied squirming out of her grasp yer too impatient with the beastie india and its puir mouth is sensitive will ye remember now aye she said ruffling his dark head her glance swung to her stepfather she nodded curtly at the duke of glenkirk farewell sir she said coldly and then turned to her mother remember your promises to me madame i shall send a message when i have arrived at queens malvern and afterward at oxton court jasmine put her arms about her eldest child you were born from a deep and great love india i have tried whatever you may think to be a good mother to you i do love you she kissed her daughters smooth cheek may the god of us all guard and guide you india may that god keep you safe my child i love you too mama india replied feeling the tears pricking behind her eyelids while she was angry at james leslie the anger she had felt toward her mother had dried up over these past few weeks she kissed her mother back and then india turned mounting the horse that diarmid held for her farewell she said raising her hand to them and then she moved off through the portcullis and over the drawbridge of the castle onto the road south she was surrounded by over a hundred glenkirk menatarms who would accompany her to the border with england there was a large and comfortable traveling coach should she choose to ride in it with meggie who now sat alone within the vehicle and a great train of fifteen baggage carts holding all her possessions as well as a dozen fine horses that were part of her dowry india sat straight in her saddle her eyes forward taking in the familiar landscape in her heart however she could not help but wonder where amid those green hills her son was now hidden she would find him whatever the cost she would find her son caynan reiss son no stranger would raise or claim her blood rowan was out there amid the bens or in some hidden glen and she would find him her intentions resolute the newly married countess of oxton turned her horse south for england chapter deverall leigh earl of oxton had spent the morning riding across his estates after eleven years on the barbary coast he couldnt get enough of the wonderful green of england his lands set in a verdant valley between the rivers severn and avon were both beautiful and fertile the meadows were filled with sheep his vast orchards of apples and pears for which the region was famed were even now at peak bloom there were lush green pastures awaiting the arrival of the horses his bride would bring him and with which he intended to begin breeding race horses his bride lady india anne lindley daughter of a duke sister to a marquis and a duke a conniving deceitful little bitch who had swooned in his arms and sworn she loved him but she hadnt she had taken the first opportunity presented to her to flee el sinut with his child in her bellyif indeed there had been a child and that was not just another lie to lull him into trusting her god only knew he had learned early that women could not be trusted and yet he had allowed the goldeneyed vixen the opportunity to dig her claws deep into his heart and once she had him she had wantonly flung him aside he well remembered his return from the mountains with aruj agha the town was in an uproar for two nights before a group of english captives had taken back their round ship and sailed out of el sinut it had been cleverly executed a wellthoughtout workmanlike plan that had given the english many hours advantage it wasnt worth going after them it was unlikely he would find them in the vast sea he chalked the loss up to fate then he learned that india had disappeared on the same night as it had been her relation captain southwood who had made good the escape it was obvious where she was he was both devastated and furious by turns she was kidnapped my lord baba hassan insisted and azura strongly agreed with him she loves you caynan reis the older woman said she was so happy about your coming child she would not have left you of her own free will she was taken you must go after her my dear lord a part of the garden wall was not secured baba hassan continued on we did not realize it my lord i hold myself completely responsible they came over the wall using grapnels and stout ropes only when we discovered the lady india missing did we search the garden and find the evidence one grapnel and rope remained and so it is obvious that there were two of them when the second man slid down into the street it was impossible to release his grapnel from the top of the wall and so it was left behind the marks of the second grapnel were plainly visible in the top of the wall both your wife and her servant were stolen away they could not leave the girl behind and since she was one of their own they would of course take her too rather than kill her why did india not scream the dey demanded angrily surely she could have cried out and alerted the guards she would not have wanted to endanger her blood kin my lord i am certain that was her reasoning she is a woman and soft of heart and then too there was that terrible storm that night it is doubtful if she had cried out that anyone would have heard her call the eunuch replied logically we must find her my lord she had the advantage over her captors caynan reis persisted they could not have gotten her over that damned wall nor the servant girl either if she had not gone willingly she has betrayed me the false bitch what if the two women were rendered unconscious azura suggested both of them the dey scoffed it would be difficult enough climbing that wall alone or with someone on your back but with a dead weight i think it improbable nay my good azura india was always determined to escape el sinut though she learned to hide her true thoughts from us she has betrayed me she has betrayed you who were her friends she is no better than other women whatever we may have previously thought improbable but not impossible baba hassan persisted those hooks on the grapnels were dug deep into the wall my lord proving what that each rope held two people that we already know my good friend i know you do not like to admit that we have all erred in our judgment but we have she bedazzled us with her beauty and charm and then deceived us i do not wish to hear her name ever again baba hassan do you understand me but what of the child azura cried out to him i suspect she cozened us there too the dey replied sadly nay never azura said boldly not india he sent them away his heart was broken he had loved her nay he loved her yet despite her behavior if she walked into his chamber this moment he would forgive her and as for the child he might deny it to ease his own heart but he could not believe that she would have lied to him about that there was no way she could have been privy to her duplicitous cousins plans until the moment the captain appeared in her apartments to help her escape if she had lied about the child what excuses could she have made when there was no child the earl of oxton turned his horse toward home as his thoughts moved on to the events that had brought him back to england knowing of his interest in the young english milord aruj agha had shortly after their return from the mountains brought the dey word that the young man had a serious fever and was in the slaves hospital by the harbor the physician does not think he will live the janissary told the dey allah the dey swore i must go to him i meant to ransom him long since but in my happiness i completely forgot perhaps if he has the hope of going home he will rally himself now my joy is ashes and the same woman who brought me such misery can also be said to be responsible for adrians demise adrian aruj agha was both fascinated and mystified is that his name and how do you know it my lord he is my younger halfbrother caynan reis admitted i believe that he and his mother are responsible for my having had to flee england i took india to my bed originally to spite him he did not recognize me of course when we met in my audience chamber he was still only a boy when i left my homeland and i did not wear a beard i meant to tell him after i took his betrothed for my own i thought to hurt him as he had hurt me but then things did not go as i had planned i decided i would release him from the galleys and hold him here in el sinut until the ransom had been paid then i would reveal myself to him and tell him how happy i was with my beautiful english wife who might have been his wife both he and his greedy mother would have been quite piqued to learn that not only had i taken a ransom from them but an heiress as well but in my happiness i forgot about him now you tell me he is dying i must go to him at once he is my fathers son too and my brother for all he and his mother have done to harm me the aga brought the dey to the slave hospital caynan reis stood by the younger mans pallet gazing down upon him gone was the soft and foppish arrogant milord a lean hardmuscled young man lay flushed and quiet upon the straw mattress the deys blue eyes filled with tears as he remembered the little brother he had taught to ride he sat heavily when a stool was brought for him waving everyone else from his presence adrian he said quietly open your eyes adrian we must talk together you and i the english words felt strange on his tongue adrian leighs purpleshadowed eyelids fluttered open then closed and then open again who are you he asked softly your brother deverall leigh was the reply adrian leigh stared hard and then hot tears rolled down his gaunt cheeks forgive me dev he said forgive you i should be asking your forgiveness for having so cruelly condemned you to the galleys little brother but i was still angry at what your mother had done to me you knew i knew what poor old rogers babbled to me that night deverall leigh told his brother that jeffers was to be killed and i would be held responsible that i must flee or die on the gallows one way or another i was to go else i stand in your way marielena was quite determined that you succeed our father as earl of oxton of course with my usual stubbornness i waited hidden to see what would happen but when i heard of jefferss death and that my dagger had been found in his chest i boarded the first ship i could how came you here adrian asked curious and then he coughed the dey of el sinut held a cup to his brothers lips feeding him cool water and when the fit had subsided laid him back on his pallet my ship like yours was bound for the mediterranean like yours it was captured and i began my service in the galleys when i proved trustworthy however i was released because i accepted islam i served the captain of the vessel as secretary because of all the languages i speak one day we were anchored in the harbor here when the dey sharif came out in his barge to speak with my captain a freak wave overturned the barge and all were cast into the sea i dove overboard and saved the dey sharif in gratitude he freed me and took me into his service we were close he and i and he formally adopted me as his son and asked the sultan in istanbul if i might succeed him as he was ill and wished to retire permission was given and that is how i became the dey of el sinut little brother i am dying adrian leigh said softly we will heal you the dey replied you will not go back to the galleys but rather home to england adrian leigh shook his head slowly nay i shall never see england again i must right the wrong that my mother and i perpetrated upon you all those years back dev he coughed again but manfully regained control of himself despite his weakened state i need someone to write it all down dev and then i will sign my name to it father has suffered greatly since your departure you must succeed him as it was always meant to be you are viscount twyford not i i am the dey of el sinut adrian it suits me you are going to get well and return to england the dey replied no adrian cried out weakly but desperately i must clear your good name and you must go home again can you tell me that your heart is really not in england but in this hot and sandy land please i beg of you fetch someone to write down my tale so i may go to my god with a clear conscience do not let me die with this stain on my immortal soul dev i will send for your secretary said aruj agha who had not gone and had been privy to all that had been said the dey nodded and took his brothers hand in his to comfort him go was all he said when the scribe finally arrived and was seated crosslegged pen and parchment at the ready the dey asked him if he could transcribe what was said in the english language the scribe nodded i can my lord as well as french and italian too adrian leigh began to speak in a low and halting voice he told how he had at his mothers instructions stolen into his brothers chamber and taken the deverall dagger so prized by his sibling because it had belonged to his mothers family he told how marielena had become lord jefferss mistress for a brief time in order to gain his trust of how she had killed him by putting a mixture of finely ground glass and hair into his wine of how when he was dead she had instructed her child to push the dagger into her lovers chest so it would be thought he had died at the hand of his rival for lady clintons favors the deys secretary wrote on his wrinkled face impassive his only acknowledgment of the tale the occasional raising of his irongray eyebrows adrian continued that by making her son wield the dagger his mother had hoped to bind him to her forever it had disturbed him to see his fathers pain over the charge that deverall leigh had murdered another man and he had felt great personal guilt for his fathers decline growing up he had gone to court escaping his mothers constant company he had caroused with new friends and had a fine time then he had met india lindley she was beautiful she was wealthy and she was innocent of men at first it had been a game to see if he might seduce her succeeding where others had failed then it had dawned on him that this beautiful girl might actually make him a good wife and that her wealth would give him the power over his mother that he had never had india he learned had never been courted he courted her with charm and passion yet he could not convince her to go against her family she was extremely close to them finally his mother hearing of his attempts with india had hurried up to london with the perfect solution he had followed her advice and convinced india to elope with him to his uncles home in naples actually it had been her fathers unqualified disapproval and plans to return india immediately to scotland that had done the trick but the captain of the vessel upon which they had sailed discovered the ruse they had used to travel safely and separated them then they had been captured my arrogance is responsible for my plight adrian leigh finished but i cannot go to my grave without clearing the name of my elder brother deverall leigh viscount twyford he is innocent of the murder of lord charles jeffers and my mother the countess of oxton and i are the guilty parties may god have mercy on us you are finished sir the deys secretary politely inquired i am came the now very weak reply let me put my signature to this document before i will not be able to do it they held him up placing a quill in his hand and adrian leigh grasped it with his last bit of strength and signed his name in a legible hand finished he dropped the pen and slumped back into his brothers arms there he lay until several hours later he finally breathed his last his body was wrapped in a white shroud and quickly buried lest the heat decay it it was placed in the small christian cemetery outside the walls of the city the kindly old protestant minister who was to have married the dey and india came to pray over adrian leighs body seeing the deys open grief he asked no questions the dey of el sinut now shut himself off from his household mourning his loss alone in his hands he held the parchment that would clear him of the charges of murder in england yet he didnt care he fell into a deep depression from which he could not seem to rouse himself he had lost the woman he loved and the brother he had loved too nothing mattered any longer then fate stepped in forcing his hand compelling him to make a decision two troupes of janissaries crossed his borders one from algiers and the other from tunis they marched toward the city and their intent was plainly hostile baba hassans spies brought him the information he needed to save caynan reis but only with scant time to spare the chief eunuch hurried to inform his master it is you they seek my lord the order has been given to assassinate you because you have betrayed them to the sultan in istanbul the rebellion has been squelched although there has been fighting in both algiers and tunis for they have not yet received the word that the rebellion is over so my lord you have been targeted for death who gave the order the dey asked the chief of the janissaries my lord the sultan will look the other way your death is a small price to pay he has managed to keep his throne if the janissaries want revenge on the man who saved that throne he cares not nor does his mother baba hassan said you must leave el sinut my lord before they may kill you no i will fight them caynan reis said with what baba hassan demanded you have no army you have a troupe of janissaries to protect el sinut they will not go against their brothers they will turn their backs on you my lord while the others slaughter you you have the means to return to your own land allah has given you this good fortune just when you needed it go back to england my lord find india and your child and live if you will not do it for yourself then do it for azura and me we have loved you as if you were our own son and what of your blood kin if you do not return to england he has no heir to his family name and lands my lord will you throw your life away when you have been given the chance to regain what you once believed lost what of you and azura what of the ladies of the harem the dey asked him i cannot leave you to suffer for me i have managed this palace for more years than i care to admit said the eunuch and the lady azura too we will be safe as will the ladies of the harem i suspect that aruj agha will hold sway here in el sinut in your place my lord caynan reis for many years to come he had made up his mind in an instant i will go he said why shouldnt he baba hassan was right his father needed him and he had several scores to settle in england the first with his deceitful stepmother and the second with lady india anne lindley he followed the chief eunuch to the lady azuras apartment she knew the moment they entered that the decision had been made going to a cabinet azura drew out a beautiful white wool cloak lined in green silk this is for you my lord dey the green lining is a false one behind the silk and between another layer of silk is a small fortune in gold coins each sewn into a separate pocket the hems of your cloak are filled with precious stones not just the bottom hem but beneath the gold braid edging as well it is little enough for your service to el sinut my lord we wish it might be more she set the floorlength cape about his broad shoulders coming around to fasten the gold frog closures that he saw were diamond studded the dey took her into his arms and kissed her forehead i will never forget you my lady azura he said if i sent for you one day would you not come and run my home as you have done this palace you and baba hassan together she smiled up at him my lord i have lived too long in barbary to ever be content anywhere else but i thank you for the offer i also baba hassan replied there was a small awkward silence and then the eunuch said come my lord i must get you out of the palace before it is too late you can already hear the fighting in the streets for the janissaries have been looting and causing general havoc along their way we have a small felluca for you in the harbor i have chosen several young european captives to escape with you naples is your best bet and the easiest port to make from here the dey kissed azuras hands and then turning he followed baba hassan from her apartment the eunuch led him through the small dark corridors he had never known existed they saw no one as they passed finally they exited the palace crossing a small courtyard and going out through a little door in the walls they hurried down several narrow twisting streets until finally the dey could see the waters of the harbor sparkling in the lateafternoon sunlight and smell the salty tang of the sea he quickened his step as they moved onto a slightly larger thoroughfare they were startled by a young janissary who stepped into their path before caynan reis might draw his sword the janissary slashed at him his blade slicing down the deys handsome face from the corner of his left eye to the left corner of his mouth the injured mans hand went automatically to his face even as aruj agha came behind the younger janissary and ran him through the assassin crumpled heavily to the ground quite dead a young turk who would make a name for himself but one cannot gain honor in the corps through a dishonorable act my lord dey he handed his friend a handkerchief to staunch the flow of blood take care of baba hassan azura and the harem ladies caynan reis said to his friend i will came the reply and then aruj agha turned away disappearing into an alley allah go with you he said as he went let me see baba hassan said worriedly and examined the wound you will have a scar my lord but it is not life threatening he pronounced come there is the felluca you must clear the harbor before sunset else the chain be raised against you three young men were waiting for them they were italian and baba hassan gave each of them a small bag containing a gold coin and five silver coins get this man safely to naples and each of you will be given another gold coin by my agent who will meet your vessel to make certain your passenger is safe you have been given your freedom for this purpose fail me and i will know you shall be punished wherever you attempt to hide the three men nodded thank you baba hassan the dey said quietly and with deeper meaning he stepped down into the felluca the chief eunuch nodded allah go with you my lord leigh he said quietly and turning away disappeared into the maze of streets they had departed immediately clearing the harbor he had had no difficulty from his companions and three days later they had reached naples at the docks a welldressed man had been waiting their arrival and paid off the three sailors the felluca is yours he told them and then turned to deverall leigh my lord leigh i am cesare kira you are to come with me please we will go to my fathers banking house in the ghetto where you will want to make your deposit and then we will arrange for your transportation back to england deverall leigh had followed the young man and been taken to benjamino kira the elder kira had taken the cloak from his guest and handed it to his daughter who had removed the false lining with its goldfilled pockets handing the coins to her father who piled them up upon his counting table when she had finished benjamino kira counted the coins and weighed the gold then he nodded to his daughter who slit the hems of the long garment individually and spilled out its jeweled contents onto her fathers table when she had finally finished she sat down and began to repair the cloak so he might wear it again i do not need a double lining in the cape mistress he said to the girl if it would please you please keep the silk her face lit in a sweet smile thank you my lord i will she then bent her head to sew the hem you are generous benjamino kira said it is a fine piece of bursa silk you have given my daughter it will make her a wedding gown eh soshanna he smiled at the girls blush and turned back to lord leigh baba hassan has sent you with quite a fortune my lord he noted what do you intend to do with it and how may we help you i am the heir to the earl of oxton he had explained how much of my story do you know signore kira i know you have been the dey of el sinut for nine years my lord and left because of the rebellion by the janissaries that caused your life to be in danger it was my warning of that rebellion that saved the young sultan in thanks he threw me to his enemies i had no choice but to leave now i will go home to england to clear my name of a crime i did not commit i carry the proof of my innocence with me he withdrew the rolled parchment from his shirt i hope to gain a royal pardon with this then i will marry and lead the life i was meant to lead the banker nodded fate has an odd way of manipulating us about he said dryly now however we must plan for your trip with your permission my lord i shall make the arrangements and see that your gold and jewels are transported safely to london deverall leigh had traveled to paris in the company of a train of merchants there he had been taken in hand by the banker henri kira and sent on to calais he crossed to dover and was met by master jonathan kira who escorted him up to london to his father james kira your trip was a pleasant one i hope my lord the english banker said i have taken the liberty of inquiring as to your fathers health the earl is frail but in no immediate danger i have also taken the liberty of putting a watch upon the countess so that we can be certain she remains in glocestershire while you complete your business here he indicated a small chest upon the table and opening it said your gemstones my lord will you ascertain that they are all here deverall leigh somewhat amazed by the efficiency of the kiras took out the inventory slip that he had prepared in naples and checked it over everything is here he said finally the gold is on deposit i take it master kira it is my lord said the banker with a smile now then you will need a private audience with king charles will you not i will he had replied it will be arranged the duke of buckinghams family does business with this house he looked into the stillopened jewel chest and plucked a large round diamond forth set in gold a nice gift for the king dont you think he said and a crucifix of gold rubies and pearls for the queen i believe will be quite suitable i shall leave it all in your obviously capable hands deverall leigh replied where am i to stay master kira and how long must i remain in london as you can imagine i am anxious to see my father it will take a few days my lord to arrange an audience with the king for you it would be better if you remained here as my guest i do not want you out wandering the streets where you might be seen until you have been pardoned by the king and are free to do so without danger of arrest he had been grateful to the kiras and gladly accepted their hospitality he was well treated several days later he was presented with a new suit of black velvet the doublet of which had an exquisite fallen lace collar each leg of his knee breeches had a wide silver ribbon garter with a blackandsilver bow his doublet was trimmed with silver buttons and the fine cambric of his shirt shone through the slashes on the puffed sleeves white silk stockings were worn below where his breeches ended and his black leather shoes sported silver rosettes he had silver lace trimming his white leather gloves his hair was short and contrary to the fashion he wore no beard or mustache one side of his face was perfect in profile but the scar running from his eye to his mouth on the left side of his visage gave him a menacing yet tragic appearance he rode to whitehall palace in a coach provided him by his hosts he was met by a gentleman of the court in debt to the kiras a member of the duke of buckinghams family who took him to a private apartment he was told to wait shortly afterward the king arrived he listened to deverall leighs tale and accepted the confession that adrian leigh had dictated before his death charles stuart read the parchment and then he arose requesting that his guest remain until he returned there was wine and there were biscuits to be had deverall leigh waited he poured himself a half a goblet of wine but ignored the biscuits he paced back and forth for a time and finally sat by the fire wondering what the kings decision would be would he accept adrians confession or would he hang deverall leigh it had begun to rain outside he watched the droplets running down the leaded pane windows as the fire crackled noisily finally the door to the privy chamber opened and the king reappeared deverall leigh jumped to his feet bowing low charles stuarts mouth twitched but his mouth was serious when he spoke i have spoken with my counselors viscount he began we are agreed that the confession you have brought us is genuine given your stepmothers reputation it is entirely possible that it happened just as your unfortunate younger brother has dictated we regret his death of course it has also been noted that while you might have been considered an impetuous youth you were never known to be violent nor were you considered dullwitted and given lady clintons notoriety it is considered unthinkable that you would have killed another man for her favors which were so readily available to all we understand your fright at the incident and your belief that it was necessary to flee england given the fact that the alleged murder weapon belonged to you ground glass and hair it is an interesting choice it is a method that was developed in naples deverall leigh said ahhh yes the king replied and of course your stepmother comes from naples it would have never been considered my lord perhaps you were wise indeed to flee england and you have certainly had your share of adventures i imagine you will find life in glocestershire quite dull after all you have been through you will want to marry of course yes your majesty if i am pardoned deverall leigh responded if you are pardoned gods blood did i not say it no i did not say it or you would not have asked aye you are fully pardoned viscount twyford my secretary is even now drawing up the papers for you so you will have no difficulty with the local sheriff now is there some pretty lady who has been awaiting you all these years no my lord in my youth i fear i was far too interested in sowing wild oats than seeking out a respectable woman to wed now however i must begin my search when i was at court years ago i saw a pretty little maid who would of course be grown and of an age to wed if she has not already wed her name is lady india anne lindley you aim high my lord the king said lady lindley is my nephews halfsister and a considerable heiress still it is my recollection that she was quite flighty and could not decide upon a husband i believe her family took her back to scotland i have not heard however that she is married my nephew would have said so if she were he lives here at court with us now she must be at least twenty i would seek a younger wife if i were you i will take your majestys advice under consideration deverall said in a noncommittal tone then he reached into his doublet and drew forth two velvet bags i have brought this for your majesty he said proffering the royal purple velvet bag and this for her majesty he handed the second bag this one of white velvet to the king charles stuart plucked the round diamond which had been set in gold with three carved gold plumes behind it and designed as a pin from its bag he held it up admiring it and then pinned it to his doublet a fine piece my lord he approved then he drew forth the queens gift and a small chuckle escaped him for a man who has been away from england for a time you understand my wife better than i do sir she will indeed esteem your gift he slid the pearlandruby crucifix on its gold chain back into the white velvet bag the kings secretary had come in then with his pardon he was given the rolled parchment with its royal seals and dismissed you are free to go home now my lord godspeed were the kings last words to him he left london that day and a week later beheld oxton court for the first time in eleven years his father wept upon seeing him and learning of his pardon for the crime he had not committed his stepmother wept upon learning of adrians death but afterward she came to his room and attempted to seduce him as she had of old he spurned her telling her what he had not told his father that the king knew the truth of lord jefferss murder and if anything happened to him she would be hung marielena leigh was not a particularly intelligent woman this man was not the easily gulled boy she remembered this man was a dangerous creature and she was afraid for the first time in her life from that moment on she went out of her way to avoid him and when their paths did cross she was deferential toward him his father died a month later worn out but content that his favorite son was free to assume the duties of the next earl of oxton his stepmother was now terrified as to what would happen to her she learned her fate in short order a royal messenger arrived with an edict of banishment marielena di carlo leigh would be sent back to her family in naples and never allowed to set foot in england again you will have a yearly allowance madame paid to the banking house of benjamino kira upon which you may draw the deposits will be made quarterly deverall leigh told his stepmother coldly be glad i have not killed you for what you have done to my family my father might have lived many more years and my unfortunate brother too had it not been for your behavior you may take your clothing and any jewelry that my father gave you but not family pieces and he had searched her luggage prior to her departure with her wizened oneeyed servant woman who had originally come with her from naples because she was dishonest by nature he had removed not only several valuable family pieces from amid her possessions but also a pair of silverandgold candlesticks given his family by king henry viii sophia the serving woman had muttered curses at him under her breath he then sent the two on their way to london where they were put on a vessel bound for naples by an escort from the kira bank who personally watched as the ship sailed down the thames with the dowager countess of oxton aboard now it was deverall leigh turned his attention to the matter of that faithless bitch india lindley he approached her father by his intermediaries and was quite surprised to have his offer of marriage quickly accepted in turn he easily agreed to their conditions that indias wealth remain in indias hands and she continue to manage it as she saw fit the dowry was twice what he expected and just to see how far he might push his future inlaws he had requested a breeding stallion and eleven mares from their horse farms in either ireland or queens malvern his request was accepted the contracts signed the dowry delivered and the proxy marriage celebrated his bride had left her home in scotland several weeks ago and was expected any time at oxton court deverall leigh rode into his stableyard and dismounted his horse soon he would have her in his power again and she would regret that she ever played him false of course she would not recognize him for deverall leigh smoothshaven and scarred with his clipped english accent was not caynan reis with his elegant beard and soft french accent no she would not know him for he was an entirely different man now a man who knew better than to trust or love any woman he would not be patient this time he would bring lady india anne lindley to heel like any bitch in his kennels and he would never again give her the opportunity to betray him he would kill her first after he learned what she had done with their child when indias train reached the designated spot on the scots and english border where they were to meet the earl of oxtons men they found twenty menatarms the earls captain took one look at the brides party and shook his head i cant be responsible for such a great muck he said frankly his eye scanned the baggage carts fifteen what the hell is the lass bringing to oxton court watch yer mouth red hugh the dukes captain warned the englishman her ladyship is a great heiress and nae some wee creature of little worth yer masters a lucky man to hae our mistress as his countess i expect like most men he dinna realize a bride coming to her husband packs everything she owns and my mistress owns a great deal as ye can see he finished with a small chuckle and horses too the earls man said how safe is the road to oxton red hugh demanded safe as any nowadays the englishman replied red hugh grunted thoughtfully finally he said we canna allow ye to attempt to take her ladyship to oxton wi so small a force ill send some of my men home and the rest of us will go wi ye as far as queens malvern in worcester where her ladyship means to rest a few days before greeting her new husband id be damned grateful for your company the earls man said relieved fifteen baggage carts and all those horses is far more than i was expecting i thought a coach and perhaps one cart red hugh diarmids uncle sent twenty of the glenkirk men back home to the duke explaining the dilemma faced by the english escort he knew that james leslie would have expected him to do just what he did the bridal party moved down into england traveling at a good pace but not so quickly that the carts could not keep up with the riders when they had at last reached queens malvern india sent the baggage carts and horses on to oxton but stopped in her brothers house to rest from her journey she was delighted to find her sixteenyearold sibling the duke of lundy in residence brother and sister greeted each other warmly hugging why arent you at court india asked charles frederick stuart rolled his eyes dramatically i couldnt take a moment more of it india the queen and buckingham squabble over the kings attention and favor like two children i dont know which of them is worse i asked my uncles permission to come home to queens malvern to see my estates although there is really nothing to see they are all well taken care of and i have nothing to do but hunt with henry and visit with him over at cadby still it is a pleasant change from court where i am stalked constantly by ambitious mamas forever thrusting their nubile daughters at me i am too young to marry as i keep telling them but all those damned women see is my royal connections my dukedom and my fortune it is really quite annoying sister when the right time comes i shall pick my own bride india laughed and seating herself in a chair next to the fire stretched her legs out how tragic for you to be so handsome rich and sought after charlie am i handsome do ythink he asked her ingenuously very handsome she replied they say i look like my sire he told her proudly india looked closely at her younger brother aye you do she agreed i remember prince henry well he was always so kind to us it was sad when he died shortly after you were born i would have liked to know him but of course if he had lived he couldnt have married mama anyway being old king jamess heir and mamas bloodline not quite up to royal snuff mama was a royal mughal princess india said defensively her fathers family is just as old and their blood as blue as that of the royal stuarts aye charlie responded affably but the mughal empire aint england his sister laughed aye youre right she told him he poured them goblets of wine and they sat together for a time tell me about this earl youve married he said i know nothing about him really india said he made an offer and the duke of glenkirk snapped at it like a hungry trout to a fly he was quite eager to rid himself of me charlie tell me what happened the duke of lundy asked his sister you disappeared for a time and while mama said you were first here and then there i think it not the truth and you are angry at papa why india you were always his especial pet what has happened to change all that tell me i will keep your secrets sister she told him everything in detail her attempted elopement her capture her resistance to caynan reis that grew slowly into a deep love for the dey of el sinut how their cousin had kidnapped her and how she had learned of her husbands untimely death she told of her return home and the dukes decision to hide her away at acuil and his taking her son from her after rowan was born i will never forgive him charlie considering the history of this family how could he have done such a thing and then he jumped at the earl of oxtons marriage offer the young duke said he shook his head i wish i could tell you something of the man india but other than the gossip surrounding deverall leighs flight from england and sudden return last year i know nothing he keeps to himself it doesnt really matter india said he is now my husband the only way i could escape glenkirk was to marry and this man seemed as good a choice as any his reputation is lightly tarnished and so certainly he cannot mind if mine is too you may remain at queens malvern as long as you like her brother said to her i am happy for your company just a few days so i am well rested and able to cope with whatever i must face at oxton india told him henry lindley the nineteenyearold marquis of westleigh arrived the following morning ive come to stay until we escort india to her new husband at oxton he announced kissing his sister soundly on both cheeks youve grown thin lovey tell me what has happened they sat together in the family hall at queens malvern eating baked apples and clotted cream while india told henry what she had told charlie the evening before her brother listened his handsome face impassive but for his eyes which mirrored his emotions youve had a hard time of it he said when she had finally concluded her tale i agree that our stepfather was harsh but i can also understand his fear that you not be considered marriageable after such an adventure times have changed since our greatgrandmother and her contemporaries day the puritans are gaining power they would call you a fallen woman and make your life and your sons a misery india he concluded with a small smile he was a very handsome young man with his fathers tawny hair matching his van dyke mustache and their mothers turquoise blue eyes i might have known you would take his side india said half angry henry lindley shook his head i take no ones side sister as a man however i understand the dukes difficulty if the truth had been known both you and the child would have been ostracized your son aint no royal stuart after all and mama barely got away with it herself but that prince henrys parents were softhearted reaching out he patted her hand set your mind to making a new start lovey and mayhap you will get your child back if this husband youve taken falls in love with you which he is bound to do if you will but smile and half try and just when do you plan to take a wife brother dear india cooed at him the marquis of westleigh rolled his eyes gods blood lovey i aint ready to settle down yet charlie and i have a few more oats to sow he chuckled youve been to court india was surprised the winters are dull at cadby the marquis pronounced aye i spent the winter at court and what a time of it it was the parliament and the king constantly fighting over the muckup thats been made in the war with spain and the fact that parliament dont think enough has been done to help the french protestants i sat in lords a few times and what ive heard was enough to keep me down here in the country in the future charles stuart is a good man but a terrible king i regret to say the duke of lundy nodded i fear for my uncle he said it isnt just those who hate buckingham india its the fanatics as well the king likes the anglican service in church he is accused of advancing and elevating the high churchmen whom the puritans call arminians over those churchmen who they prefer whats the difference india asked him church is church nay sister not in the minds of those men the high churchmen believe in free will rather than predestination to achieve salvation they hold to a more catholic ritual and rites in the church service their sermons are mightily long and they are given to impromptu prayers for the puritans everything must be plain and hard and just so gods mercy extends only to those who do exactly what they say must be done ritual and rite are forbidden its all quite ridiculous on both sides and then there was the petition of rights that was drawn up the duke of lundy said lords concurred we disapprove of forced loans to the royal treasury which are never repaid we dislike having the kings soldiers billeted in our homes without reimbursement and we are against arrest and imprisonment without just cause the king accepted the petition but it is unlikely hell abide by it he dissolved the parliament when it threatened to impeach buckingham for the mess in spain thats when henry and me excused ourselves and came home theres going to be trouble sooner or later henry lindley said darkly and id just as soon be safe at home when it comes for the next few days india and her brothers forgot that they were grown now and romped happily together they hunted and fished they rowed on the lake they sat in the gardens of queens malvern talking they knew it would never be this way again for them they voiced their sadness over the fact fortune was not with them and wondered what would happen to her in the next few months shell not accept any man she doesnt want henry said wisely and his siblings agreed finally they could delay no longer it was less than a days ride over to oxton court and india knew she had to go a dozen glenkirk men would escort her before red hugh took his troupe north again into scotland charlie stuart and henry lindley rode with their sister diarmid and meggie had gone on ahead the day before to tell the earl of oxton that his bride would be arriving the respite from her travels had done india good her brothers servants had fed her and cosseted her for almost a week her eyes had lost their lackluster look and sparkled golden again she wore a rich blue silk riding outfit trimmed lavishly in lace and in creamandgold braid topping her dark curls was a blue velvet cap with two soft white plumes she rode astride as she was accustomed to doing but her full long skirts were draped modestly to prevent any show of leg above her leather boots they left the hour after sunrise stopping at a small inn to rest themselves and their horses at the midday hour they reached oxton court in early afternoon red hugh had sent a rider on ahead to warn the earl of their impending arrival on the hill above oxton india looked down into the valley where the house was set it was very beautiful her new home was of weathered old brick the four wings built about a quadrangle sheep grazed placidly in the green meadows she could see her horses browsing contentedly in the verdant pastures a splash of color on one side of the house indicated gardens it was a large and lovely old house with a slate roof that obviously had been built around the same time as queens malvern a small village with a church was clustered at the far end of the valley india and her party began their descent the road wound through lush orchards whose trees were already heavy with halfgrown apples and pears it was all very peaceful and a wonderful place to raise children india thought please god she prayed let the earl be a kind man who will allow me to bring my son to live here i will be a good wife to him i promise just let me regain my wee rowan again he is all i have left of caynan reis they drew nearer to the house and suddenly from the courtyard a man came walking stopping just past the archway into the quadrangle she strained to see his face but the sun was in her eyes all she could tell was that he was formally dressed in black to greet her india shivered what if they did not like each other what if they could not come to some sort of arrangement the horses stopped before the man and reaching up he lifted india from her mount she gazed shyly up at him and was terrified by what she saw a long scar ran from his left eye to the left corner of his mouth and his blue eyes were icy unable to help herself she shivered her brothers had quickly dismounted and henry stepping forward held out his hand to the earl of oxton i am henry lindley sir the marquis of westleigh he said then he drew his younger sibling forward and this is my brother charles frederick stuart the duke of lundy we have brought our sister lady india your bride home to you my lord deverall leigh shook hands with both young men i thank you my lords he said will you stay the night with us he offered india his arm and began to escort her through the archway into the courtyard thank you my lord henry spoke for them both but we must return to queens malvern so i may go home to cadby tomorrow you will take a cup of wine with us though gentlemen the earl said oxton court is known for its hospitality and i would not want it said i sent my brides brothers on their way without refreshment thank you my lord we will henry replied ohhh how lovely india exclaimed her eyes sweeping about the quadrangle which was lavishly planted with roses and other flowers of all kinds there was also a large fountain with a spray of water cooling the courtyard you enjoy gardens madame the earl asked her oh yes india said and she forced herself to smile up into that harsh face i am glad then for the house and its gardens are yours to do with as you will the earl responded politely they entered the house and he brought them into the great hall a room of soaring arches from which hung multicolored silk banners that had obviously once been carried into battle the tall curvilinear windows that lined the hall allowed the golden afternoon light to pour into the room at one end was a great stone fireplace flanked by lions the highboard was set to one side of the fireplace and at the other end of the room was a minstrels gallery servants hurried forth with goblets of wine for all they smiled shyly at india who smiled back the talk revolved about the earls fine orchards and he promised to send his two brothersinlaw baskets of both apples and pears after the harvest india remained silent until the time came for her two brothers to depart i wish you didnt have to go she murmured softly her eyes filling with tears make your peace quickly with the man henry said softly as he hugged her the scar is a bit frightening but he doesnt seem a bad fellow he kissed her on both cheeks im at cadby if you need me he concluded charlie hugged her too behave yourself my lady he teased her with a grin brushing a tear from her cheek that had despite her best efforts slipped from her eye the pot calling the kettle black she half laughed kissing him and then swatting at him fondly were both near charlie responded softly if you need us big sister and they were gone with her husband who escorted her brothers from the hall and the house india stood alone not knowing what to do or where to go the earl had virtually ignored her since her arrival and she could feel her temper rising his greeting was hardly a warm one and he had not spoken more than a dozen words to her then she caught herself perhaps he too was feeling the strain of this situation meeting his wife for the very first time wondering if they would like each other women were the softer sex and it was up to her to put him at ease with her so she might be at ease with him when deverall leigh entered the hall again india smiled at him i am happy to be here at last my lord she said pleasantly you are very beautiful he responded but i suppose you have been told that by many men not really so many if you count my brothers my uncles and all the rest of my male kin india replied with another smile when the king pardoned me he advised me to seek a younger wife how old are you madame the earl said i was twenty on the twentythird of june india told him why did you not follow the kings advice because i wanted you he told her why is it you were not wed before this madame it is said that you are flighty and yet you chose a man you have never seen to marry why is that india felt her temper rising again but she swallowed it back he was certainly being candid with her and so she would be as honest with him at least to a point i did not choose you my lord my stepfather the duke of glenkirk chose you i had refused all other offers that had come to me because they did not suit me and for your information i have been married before a liaison i contracted in europe when i was with my grandmother he died and i will not discuss it further my stepfather chose you because it was the only offer he had received since my return he was quite insistent that i be married again before there were no offers at all your family is suitable and since your reputation is somewhat tarnished the duke thought us an ideal match indeed he said softly gods blood she was forthright with him the little bitch but then she had always been his eyes could not get enough of her for he had always thought her the most beautiful woman he had ever seen frankly i am relieved you are not a virgin madame he told her virgins are always most difficult to deal with and i have not the patience would you like to see your apartments now your servants are awaiting you we shall have to find something to do for diarmid however what is his position he is my bodyguard india replied sweetly he almost laughed but refrained from his open amusement you will have no need for a bodyguard at oxton court madame the earl told her but as he is your maidservants husband you will find him a suitable place in the household come and taking her gloved hand in his he led her from the great hall up the wide staircase to her new apartments in the south wing of the house meggie curtsied as they entered the room and then ran forward to take her mistresss gloves and cap welcome home my lady she said with a smile tis so very lovely here and his lordship has given us our own room for me and diarmid i am glad you are content with the arrangement meggie india said to her beaming servant diarmid she said to meggies husband who was standing respectfully waiting to greet her can you write and do your numbers aye my lady i can he responded then you shall be steward of my personal household as the earl assures me i do not need a bodyguard at oxton india replied she turned to her husband does that not solve the problem my lord indeed madame quite neatly you are quickwitted i am pleased to note i hope you will pass the trait on to our children he saw the shadow pass quickly over her face so quickly that had he not been looking directly at her he would have missed it is everything all right madame he queried her of course my lord she said swiftly so the mention of children disturbed her false bitch what had she done with their child and that quick admission of a marriage to a husband dead that she would not discuss was he supposed to believe her so distraught with grief that she could not speak of it oh she would pay for her perfidy he promised himself silently then he said to her will you dine with me tonight madame a wedding supper of sorts one might say after the minister blesses our union of course she answered him but she had longed to refuse when he had spoken of children she had wanted to weep with her pain over her son but how could she have explained such behavior will leave you then to rest from your ride he said bowing politely and withdrawing from her apartments she noted that he went through a small door in the wall and not out into the hallway she looked about the salon in which they were standing it was a lovely room with light wood paneling decorated with gold trim the large fireplace was flanked with standing angels the draperies on the window were of a lightblue velvet trimmed with gold braid the furniture was well polished the upholstery and floral tapestry fresh and bright the floors were covered with turkey carpets there were silver candlesticks and bowls of rose potpourri aint it grand meggie declared it is as nice as my own familys houses india agreed come see the bedchamber meggie enthused hurrying to open the door diarmid remained discreetly in the salon india had to admit she liked her new bedchamber very much the draperies were her favorite shade of rose velvet as were the matching bed hangings the bed itself had an eightfoot headboard of linenfold paneling and the carved canopy extended on all four sides of the bed the pillars holding up the canopy were carved with leaves and vines the bed was made with her own scented linens featherbed and pillows on each side of the bed was a table and upon each table a silver nightstick and tiny snuffer the fireplace opposite the bed was flanked on either side with delicate stone deer a doe and a buck the andirons were wellpolished brass by the fireplace a comfortable chair had been set and next to it a candlestand a cushioned window seat was built into the large box window to the right of the bed on the opposite wall was a small refectory table and two straight chairs the rest of the furniture was the usual carved chests on the table was a bowl of roses its lovely india finally spoke and you have put everything away bless you meggie everything nay not by any means my lady diarmid and me will be busy unpacking those baggage carts for days the maidservant said let me take your gown now youll want a bit of a liedown before supper im thinking i want a bath india asked i cannot change from my riding clothes into another dress smelling of horses theres many that does meggie observed ive never known such a one for washing as yerself my lady id rather smell of flowers than stink of my own sweat india replied water is good for the skin it keeps it soft and you want to keep that wild highlander of yours by your side dont you meggie i saw some pretty little faces in the hall below and let one of them try to make free with my husband meggie said glowering and ill snatch the trollop bald india laughed and then she sobered realizing that she had felt the very same way about caynan reis she very much doubted if she would feel that strongly about deverall leigh still she was married to him and would have to make the best of it especially if she was to regain her son rowan she had already begun by telling him she had been previously married he had not thank god asked if she had had any children she was not ready to share that with him he might very well be glad she had not brought her child not wanting another mans son in his house to raise no i must gain his favor and trust before i mention my child to this man she thought with surety he does not look sympathetic or easily led she had a leisurely bath and then napped for a short time awakening she allowed meggie to dress her in creamcolored silk brocade trimmed in lace the gown prepared for the church ceremony here at oxton it was to take place this evening in the estate church the earl had said that he wanted the official formalities celebrated immediately meggie affixed the stars of kashmir about her neck and slipped the ear bobs into her ears india touched them wonderingly what history they held she descended the staircase to find him awaiting her the church is but a short walk he said handing her a nosegay of sweet white flowers and offering her his arm outside the sun was setting to the west over the malvern hills to the east the moon was rising it was very still and only the faintest breeze ruffled her curls the little stone church was filled with the servants including meggie and diarmid it was softly lit with beeswax candles the minister greeted them and announced to the assembled that as the earl of oxton and his bride had accepted the proxy marriage celebrated at glenkirk on the thirtieth day of may in the year of our lord sixteen hundred and twentyeight they were legally and lawfully wed now tonight on this eighteenth day of july he would give the blessing in gods name on behalf of his majesty the king the couple knelt and the minister intoned those whom god hath joined together let no man rent asunder in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost amen amen the congregation replied now my lord the minister said his eyes twinkling you are quite free to kiss your bride indias eyes widened as his lips brushed her coolly kiss she hadnt thought of kissing and lovemaking oh my god in her anger and her eagerness to escape glenkirk she had put from her head these more intimate matters about her the assembled cheered and the earl led her from the church you are surprised i kissed you he said as they walked back to the house it was hardly a kiss my lord she replied more like a butterfly brushing my lips passion should be a private matter between a man and his wife madame he said reprovingly i could hardly avoid the formality when the reverend master barton was encouraging me to it so publicly and in such a loud voice we would have disappointed the servants if i asked for a respite from your company tonight so i might recover from my journey would we disappoint the servants she asked him boldly you would disappoint me he told her besides you had several days in your brothers company at queens malvern to regain your strength madame i am not ready yet for a man in my bed india said frankly why she stumbled but he caught her up before she might fall i dont know really i just know i am not obviously your experience with men is slight he said quietly but i am ready to have a wife in my bed madame and you are that wife you are merely shy which speaks well of your character i am no monster and i cannot wait to have you in my arms again you false bitch he thought to himself you will yield yourself to me whether you will or no i have spent months dreaming of this night and you will not deny me india you will never deny me again it had all gone as he had expected so far she had not recognized the earl of oxton as the dey of el sinut why should she the earl of oxton had short dark hair a rather sinister scar marking his face and was cleanshaven which gave his high cheekbones and jaw a totally different look he spoke english the dey of el sinut had had a closecropped dark black beard that fringed his jaw and encircled itself sensuously about his mouth and chin his skin was bronzed from the hot sun he spoke french to her in a soft voice the voice of a lover in the language of love but when he made love to her tonight it would not be as the dey of el sinut had made love to her all sweetness and passion it would be as the earl of oxton would make love to his wife he was yet angry with her how could she have left him after declaring her love for him when she was ripening with their child adrian had given him the answer when he had said indias loyalty to her family was greater than any other loyalty if he had not been forced to flee el sinut himself he might have never found her again and where was their child he would of course have to reveal himself to her eventually if he was to regain custody of his child but for the moment he intended taking his revenge upon her he could not believe her so insensitive that she would have left the child in danger of any kind there was time and did he have a son or a daughter they ate dinner in the little family hall there were but the two of them there were raw oysters brought to the earl which he swallowed with relish his eyes making deliberate contact with hers at one point and she blushed to her dismay there was a small roast of beef a duck stuffed with fruit and rice in a sauce of wine and plums a lovely broiled trout set upon a bed of braised lettuce surrounded by carved lemons an extravagance a bowl of tiny new peas and another of little carrots fresh bread sweet butter and half a wheel of hard sharp cheese he watched her nibbling unenthusiastically at a slice of beef a spoonful of carrots some bread you are not hungry he asked it is all very good and well prepared india quickly said sipping upon her second goblet of rich red wine my appetite has been poor of late i fear my lord food upon the road is often not of the best quality even at the finest inns when you have finished then he told her you may go to your chamber and prepare yourself for me madame she practically leapt from her place and curtseying to him fled the hall he smiled wolfishly watching her go india was not a woman to admit to fear but she was afraid and he knew it she could feel his eyes those cold blue eyes boring into her back as she went gods blood what kind of a man was he to insist on bedding her immediately true they were man and wife but they had met but a few hours ago they knew virtually nothing about each other then in a flash she understood if the marriage were consummated she could not demand an annulment after all had she not told him quite bluntly that marriage to him had not been her choice he of course would want to take no chances with losing her dowry or a rich wife who controlled her own wealth but could undoubtedly be cozened into parting with some or all of it men they were so obvious he was no different from the rest but then she had not expected that he would be she was no virgin to be terrified of a mans love lance as for her husband he would probably assert his rights in a brusque and perfunctory manner then return to his own bedchamber she wasnt the first woman to be in such a position nor would she be the last it would have been nice if they might have gotten to know each other a bit before coupling but so be it you looked so lovely in that candlelit church mlady meggie said taking the stars of kashmir from her mistress and replacing them in their case ive laid out a lovely nightdress for you she bustled about taking indias garments shaking and brushing them and putting them neatly away the earl seems a pleasant gentleman aye she said tis a terrible scar he wears on his face poor man meggie noted i wonder how he got it he dont seem the type of gentleman to get into a brawl mayhap it were an accident india took the soft flannel cloth that had been laid out and sponged herself off with the warm scented water meggie had put in a silver ewer then she scrubbed her teeth with the cloth rinsing her mouth with minted water she slipped behind the painted screen in the corner of her dressing room and sitting on her commode relieved herself washing herself afterwards finally she pulled off her chemise and meggie slipped the rosecolored nightdress lavishly edged in lace over her head find your own bed now meggie india said quietly and taking up her silver hairbrush she sat on the edge of her bed brushing her long dark curls as with a curtsey meggie hurried out the bedchamber door india smiled after her meggie was obviously finding married life with diarmid a pleasant thing she looked about the room again admiring the serenity and order of it the fireplace burned brightly and but for the two candles on the nightstand there was no other light meggie had drawn the draperies closed the room was comfortably warm and she could smell the heady scent of the roses from the bowl on the table a small door in the paneled wall opened and the earl stepped through into the room to her complete surprise he was naked remove your nightdress he said quietly as the door behind him closed unless you are suffering your womans cycle are greatly advanced with child or i tell you i will not be visiting your bed you will always sleep naked india as do i do you understand me then he stood watching as she removed her garment nodding in answer to his question good he said his eyes swept over her you have a beautiful body madame she was nonplussed she certainly hadnt expected him to behave in such a manner it was very disconcerting reaching out he put his hands about her waist and turned her drawing her back against his hard body a single hand clamped over her right breast his lips touched her shoulder scattering a row of kisses across the warm flesh even as his fingers crushed and marked the skin of her full breast she couldnt breathe her chest felt tight his actions were not what she had anticipated at all she could sense the lust beneath his careful deeds he frankly frightened her he was obviously dangerous he was her husband and she was at his mercy india struggled against her own fright she knew she must not show any fear with this man but when he pushed a finger between her lips and into her mouth she could not prevent a gasp of surprise lick it the two words were snapped into her ear sharply after a moments hesitation her tongue reached out and touched the finger slowly she encircled the digit several times it was long and thick and very suggestive of another member of his body suck it his hand opened then slipped beneath her breast cupping it his thumb began to rub against her nipple india could feel her heart hammering in her ears she drew on the finger within her mouth over and over again while his hand fondled her breast hungrily and her nipples puckered like frosted flower buds the hand moved from her breast finally sliding down her torso caressing her venus mound pushing through the folds of her nether lips he found her pleasure place and began to stroke it with his fingertip what a sweet wanton you are he whispered in her ear you are already wet with your desire you want to be fucked dont you madame he pulled his finger from her mouth so she might speak you are my husband india replied in a shaking voice he laughed and it was a dark sound little whore he murmured you would want to be fucked even if i werent your husband wouldnt you the finger playing with her pleasure place was obtaining the proper results and she squirmed her bottom against his groin desperate to reach that honied place where the tensions in her loins would dissolve in a burst of hot sweetness in that moment she hated him for she was fully aware that he knew what he was withholding from her the knowledge gave her a moment of strength and she pulled away from him whirling about to face those cold eyes how dare you speak to me in such a manner my lord i am your wife and not some servant girl to be insulted he moved quickly one arm wrapping itself about her the other hand tangling into her dark hair his mouth found hers in a long hard deep kiss that left her once again breathless shoving her down onto the bed he flung himself atop her his hands spreading her open without a word he entered her body with strong thrusts of his hips pushing deeply even as she attempted to unhorse him spitting her rage and swearing fiercely at him but it was too late he had prepared her well and while india wanted desperately to deny him her body welcomed him eagerly she was hot and wet her tight sheath encased him they groaned in unison as their linked bodies pleasured each other she clawed at his broad back he caught her hands and pinioned them over her head struggling to propel himself deeper put your legs about me you eager little bitch he growled into her ear and without hesitation she did using her wrapped limbs to lever herself forward and sink her teeth into his shoulder he yelped but continued pistoning her she couldnt she couldnt fight him any longer she fell back gasping like a fish out of water drawing great gulps of air into her lungs even as she felt herself shoved up to the heights of a frenzy of heated passion that burst over her and then receded leaving her weakened and helpless ohh god she sobbed as release flooded her very being ohh i hate you for this and she shuddered with the final spasms of her defeat he lay atop her for some minutes his heart hammering his breathing rough it had been so long so long since he had known the pleasure of her body and the sweet fulfillment that only she could give him he wanted to wrap his arms about her tell her the truth but he couldnt because he couldnt trust her she was a hotblooded and deceitful little bitch no better than his stepmother had been she would yield her body to gain her own way he rolled off india and arose from the bed good night madame he said and returned through the door in the wall from which he had come india lay astounded she was battered and probably bruised every bit of her ached and yet she felt quite relaxed and shamefully satisfied he had called her a wanton a little whore he had almost made her feel like one the single kiss he had given her had been a fiercely passionate one her fingers touched her mouth his lips had triggered a reminiscence that she could not quite pull up from her memories she began to cry softly not even understanding why she was weeping he had behaved like a complete bastard and she had not expected it at all a quick assertion of his marital rights and nothing more was what she had assumed that this cold stern man was capable of such heated passion astonished her india crawled beneath the down coverlet curling herself into a tight knot she realized that she was trembling and the tears were hot on her face what had she done in agreeing to this marriage and what other surprises had her husband in store for her she wanted to be loved loved by a man who no longer existed and not by deverall leigh the earl of oxton were it not for my baby she thought ishould just as soon be dead he heard her weeping and every instinct made him want to go to her but he would not she wept the deceitful bitch only because he had been rough with her but god help him she had inflamed his senses the touch of her skin the familiar scent of her they had all conspired to drive him to madness she would probably hate him in the morning but he didnt care why should he care about how she felt she had deceived him and then deserted him he didnt know if he could ever forgive her but he didnt care he was going to fill her belly again with his seed and this time he would not let her steal this child away india awoke the following morning still feeling as if she had been in a battle she could see a thin ribbon of light through the crack between the two draperies she listened carefully but heard nothing and so she quickly arose and slipped her nightdress back on before meggie could find her without it it had been the oddest wedding night that anyone could imagine she decided climbing back into her warm bed he had she concluded been neither cruel or brutal just simply very determined in his approach to her still she could see she was going to have to teach him better bedchamber manners while he had been careful to see she obtained her share of passion she realized upon reflection he had forced it from her rather than coaxing it he obviously knew little about making love to a woman and that was going to have to change india concluded she did not see her husband until evening when they met at the highboard for their meal she had spent her day helping meggie and diarmid to unpack her belongings she told him so and then inquired about his day and activities i oversee my estates he told her i am not a man for court now that i have the responsibilities of oxton we support ourselves here through our flocks and our orchards perhaps you noticed the fruit ripening as you arrived yesterday with your dower horses i hope to breed racing animals madame are the horses irish stock yes she answered they are the irish lands were given to my mother on her eighteenth birthday by my father the marquis of westleigh her estate manager is the former owner of the land he chose a fine stallion nightsong and the mares personally now the estate will be turned over to my younger sister fortune for her dowry i am grateful to you for the stallion and the breeding stock the earl said to his wife now madame i have something to discuss with you the servants in this house are all old and have been in service here since my late fathers youth it is past time that they were retired to their cottages on the estate and most wish to go it will be your responsibility to staff the household can you do it with the help of the present staff yes i can india said flattered that he was vesting this decision in her diarmid moreleslie will become the majordomo of the household i will ask dover to teach him his duties before he retires will that meet with your approval my lord it is your home first and i would not offend you in any manner the barest ghost of a smile touched his mouth for just a brief moment if you will but consult me before any final decisions are made madame that will suit me well he said they ate the rest of the meal in silence then india arose to excuse herself it is my custom to take a bath before i retire each night she said softly will you be joining me later my lord aye he said and nothing more she curtsied and went to her apartments he was such an odd man she thought meggie had her bath ready undressed she climbed into the warm scented tub and washed herself being careful to pin her curls atop her head when she was dry and in her nightdress meggie and diarmid together emptied the tub and stored it away before bidding her a pleasant night when they had gone india arose removed her gown and laid it carefully upon a chair before climbing back into her bed and snuggling beneath the down coverlet the curtains were drawn once again the firelight lit the room meggie had forgotten to light the tapers on either side of the bed but india didnt mind she dozed half seated against her pillow awakening when she heard the sharp click of the door in the paneling as the previous night the earl entered her bedchamber naked but this time she had a small opportunity to observe him he was well made she could see with no deformities there was a dark mat of hair upon his broad chest that extended into a narrow treasure trail leading to his groin his masculine parts were also extremely well made she noted large and healthy lifting the coverlet he climbed into bed beside her i am pleased to see that you followed my instructions he told her asking me to be naked in my bed for your attentions is hardly an onerous order my lord husband india answered him lay back he said throwing the bedcoverings aside i wish to examine you in more detail madame i did not have the opportunity last night to do so i would see what glenkirk has sent me like one of my mares she mocked him sharply precisely madame he told her and took up her hand our situation is intimate sir she replied will you not call me by my given name and permit me to call you by your name in public formality is required i understand but surely not here in my bed he was kissing each of her fingertips having examined her hand in great detail he put one of her fingers in his mouth and began to suck on it slowly drawing on the finger deeply his tongue working its way about the slim digit his other hand slid between her thighs and began to play with her sex when she was wet with her arousal he took his finger and pushed it into her mouth and without being asked she began to suck upon it that is how you taste he said softly he sucked harder on her finger her eyes were wide with shock but her blood was pulsing with excitement this cold and correct husband of hers was the most sensual man she had ever encountered even her beloved caynan reis had not been so strongly animalistic india shivered and pulled the finger from her mouth are you cold india he asked her solicitously drawing her finger from his mouth and kissing the palm of her hand ardently why do you taunt me deverall she whispered i am attempting to make up for my crude behavior of last night he said innocently i am trying to make love to you india but perhaps you preferred being thrown on your back and roughly fucked leaning over he nuzzled her ear do you like being taken that way no she managed to husk out as his tongue made circles in the shell of her ear i imagine you thought i had no manners suitable for a ladys chamber he almost purred at her aye she quickly answered i did then let me prove otherwise to you india he said pressing her back into her pillows and kissing her his lips warm and firm against her own to her surprise the kiss was a tender one but then it began to deepen and his tongue was pushing into her mouth to meet with hers she trembled his mouth the kisses he kissed her why did they touch a chord somewhere within her she wanted to weep again he was startled to feel the wetness on her cheeks the salty tears against his mouth why was she crying he knew instinctively not to question her instead he took her face between his two hands and kissed the tears from it pretending he believed her emotions stemmed from his passion toward her do not weep india he said i will never be rough with you again he said would you prefer if i left you now i want to be a good wife to you she half sobbed ohh gods blood she was behaving like a perfect ninny he took her declaration to mean that he was to stay he let his kisses move down her throat and across her chest she murmured and calmed he kissed her breasts gently and then he took a nipple into his mouth suckling upon it gently at first and then harder her fingers dug into his shoulder as his mouth worked her she remembered once telling caynan reis that she wondered what manner of woman she was to enjoy his attentions so avidly when such pleasure should be reserved for a husband and wife this man his dark head lowered to her bosom was her husband yet he was making her feel like a perfect wanton she did not truly know him and yet his attentions were arousing her to a frenzy she murmured and caressed his hair bitch he thought wanton bitch she responded to his attentions eagerly although she struggled to hide her feelings how quickly she had forgotten caynan reis now she murmured and moaned with her rising arousal as he stroked and petted her he could have killed her did he not love her so damned much he began to kiss her again his lips wandering across her torso her belly was sweetly rounded and he licked the quivering flesh causing her to cry out softly with her pleasure she needed to be punished he thought irrationally spreading her he drew her slender legs with their silken thighs over his shoulders and sitting back upon his haunches he drew her to him india shrieked her surprise as his mouth made contact with the most intimate part of her he gripped her buttocks firmly in his two big hands and his head buried itself in her sweetness his lips mashing themselves against her nether lips his tongue running up and down her slit before pushing through to find her pleasure place her head spun with her rising passion and she panted like an animal deverall dev ohgod my lord you are killing me the first wave crashed into her she could feel his teeth gently oh so very gently nibbling on her flesh she cried out shuddering violently the second wave raised her up his flickering tongue teased and teased and teased at her sensitivity and then plunged as deeply as it could into her sheath oh god oh god oh god she cried then he released her but a moment before pressing his body against hers and plunging into her she screamed her pleasure as the third wave flung her down and down and down he thrust again and again into the hot honied sheath welcoming him there had never been a woman like india and there would never be one like her no matter she was a lying and deceitful little bitch he could feel himself swelling then breaking his love juices flooding her womb he lifted his dark head a moment to kiss her lips and saw that she was practically insensible with his passion he brushed his mouth across hers whispering softly je taime settlement ma bijou settlement toi india ma femme precieuse seulement toi in her halfconscious state she heard his voice mon seigneur caynan she whispered je taime aussi ahh retournezmoi cest un rêve then she fell into an exhausted sleep i love you also return to me this is a dream her soft words slammed into him with violent force what did she mean by such words she had deserted him or had she both baba hassan and azura had insisted india would not leave him willingly yet he had thought otherwise during most of her time with him she had been defiant and eager to be free when she had disappeared he had assumed that she had been but feigning her love for him and run off with her cousin why had he even thought such a thing because in his heart he had not trusted her he had never trusted women since the time his stepmother had seduced him and then laughingly rejected him when another lover took her fancy she had made a man of him marielena told him but he quickly realized she had done it in order to have a wedge to drive between him and his father worse he was bitterly ashamed of having betrayed his sire then she had warned him mockingly that he must never trust a woman again he had taken her advice to heart but suddenly he was beset by his own doubts that he might have been wrong about india what if she had indeed been kidnapped by her cousin the sea captain what if she had not gone willingly and been forced to return to her family in scotland he had renounced her as dey of el sinut if his rule had not been overthrown and he returned to england what would have become of her the duke of glenkirk would obviously have accepted any decent offer for her believing he was doing the right thing by his stepdaughter but what of their child had she had the baby and what had become of it deverall leigh arose from the bed and returned to his own bedchamber he slipped his nightshirt over his long lean body and began pacing the room how was he to reveal himself to india how could he face her having believed her so unworthy of his trust he knew india she was going to be furious had she not once taken his own dagger to him in a rage and this situation was much much worse he needed time to think he would shut himself off from her for a few days and try to decide how to get himself out of this disastrous mess he had so easily gotten himself into thanks to his overweening pride india did not see her husband for several days he sent word the following morning that he must ride out across his estates for the next few days she was free to pursue her own interests after the furious passion of the previous evening india was relieved this strange intense man was a puzzle she needed time to solve she began the task of replacing the servants and having them trained by their predecessors who were eager to now retire dover who had been the majordomo was full of advice and local information he liked diarmid telling him he had worried about who would replace him aint none here with the polish and snap as is needed in such a position he said i followed poor old rogers because i had been his assistant in london after the earl was accused of murder we never went back to london oh young master adrian did but the family never did the folk hereabouts likes you youll do fine diarmid laughed im flattered that you think so he said to the old man but im naught but a highland lad ill need all the help ye can give me dover taint the experience laddie dover told the scotsman tis the bearing and the attitude and you have both he said wisely the only one of the servants refusing to retire was mrs cranston the cook i only replaced mrs dover when she died some eight years ago she told india im years younger than the rest of them as you can plainly see mlady and im not ready to be put out to pasture yet she stood before her young mistress hands upon her ample hips her white cap bobbing vigorously her plump cheeks red with the constant heat of her kitchens do you need any more help india asked her well mrs cranston allowed most of them is young and suits me fine but if i might have a pot boy and one more lass to scrub id be most grateful yer ladyship have you anyone in mind india asked cleverly well yer ladyship i do tis a young niece and nephew of mine that i would place in your service theyre honest children and will do their work well for theyve had obedience beaten into them by my sister their mother his lordship must make the final decision mrs cranston but i believe he will concur that your niece and nephew are suitable bring them into the house they will have their wages at michaelmas and be given room and board what are their ages the lad is nine and the lass eleven your ladyship mrs cranston replied smiling broadly and i thank you kindly to indias surprise her husband did not arrive back home for some five days entering the house he noted many new faces smiling at him at the evening meal india told him of all the changes she had made with his permission of course he approved it all and india sent immediate word to the staff as she retired to her apartments to await her husbands coming she bathed and dismissing meggie climbed into her bed when he entered her chamber she was surprised to find he was wearing a white silk nightshirt we must talk he said quietly and began to pace back and forth about the room about what she asked him wondering what it was she might have done to displease this strange man tell me about your first husband he said bluntly her heart leapt in her chest what could he possibly have heard had adrian somehow returned and exposed her adventures to his elder brother what do you wish to know she ventured nervously you said he died deverall leigh was looking directly at her yes india answered her fingers clutched at the coverlet how there was a rebellion in his country she answered him he was killed her chest felt tight and she could feel tears coming how do you know he was killed the earl persisted how what did this man want from her she swallowed back her tears yes how i was with my grandmother lady stewarthepburn in naples she was arranging for my return to my husband when word came of the rebellion and that my husband had been killed in it i never returned back to my husbands lands again lady stewarthepburn returned with me to glenkirk i was content to buy myself a house here in england and live quietly the rest of my days but my stepfather would not have it i told you it was he who insisted that i remarry i did so to escape him and to regain control of my own wealth nevertheless my lord i shall endeavor to be a good wife to you in all ways we need not be enemies she had thought him dead but that did not solve the problem of how she got to naples although he was certain it was in the ship stolen by thomas southwood he pressed her further just who was this man to whom you were wed india what was his name india closed her eyes a moment to regain her composure then looking directly at him she said my husbands name was caynan reis and he was the dey of the barbary state of el sinut are you content now my lord i was a captive and i was made the deys wife because we fell in love with each other are you horrified will you divorce me now that you have discovered that i was the beloved of an infidel how did a deys wife get to naples he demanded is it not unusual for a woman of the harem to be allowed to travel so far what does it matter how i got to naples india cried why do you pursue this matter my lord why should you care he ceased his pacing and sat down upon the bed next to her taking her face between his two hands he said to her regardezmoi india look at me the blue eyes softened do you not recognize caynan reis in deverall leigh the beard is gone and i have a scar but can you not see me my love her eyes widened in shock his mouth his kisses that was what had been niggling at her all this time you bastard she hissed venomously at him pulling away from his hands leaping naked from the other side of the bed you bloody bastard how could you have done this to me and you say you love me i will kill you reaching for the nearest object at hand she flung the bowl of roses at him tis i who should kill you he shouted back at her ducking but not before i find out what you did with my child your child your child she shrieked is that what this has been all about your child grabbing up her silver hairbrush she hurled it at him why could you not have come to glenkirk to reclaim me do you know what i have suffered over you my lord her eyes cast about for another object to throw at him but the room was virtually empty of such trinkets she bared her teeth at him moving about the bed toward him then she launched herself at him fists pummeling him nails seeking out his eyes he would have laughed at this naked fury if the situation had not been so serious but now he realized if he did not calm her anger and indeed his nothing would be resolved between them he caught her hands in his and forcing them to her sides wrapped her in his embrace india india he pleaded there is some terrible misunderstanding between us and we must rectify it stop struggling you little wildcat and tell me how you got to naples it was with tom southwood wasnt it she squirmed against him pulling half free of his grasp i can say nothing if you persist in smothering me she snarled at him he loosened his grip slightly but not enough so she might do him a mischief how did you get to naples he repeated that fool of a cousin of mine learned of a small section of wall that surrounded your garden that opened onto a narrow public street he had wheedled the information out of aruj agha by means of flattery he came with one of his men the night of the terrible storm i told him i loved you that i was content to remain in el sinut i tried to reason with him i might have cried out if indeed the guards could have even heard me over all the thunder that night but he was my cousin i did not want to be responsible for his death it meant nothing to me that he chose to escape el sinut just as long as he left me in peace but no tom would not listen he assaulted me knocking me unconscious hauled me over that damned wall and dumped me in naples meggie came too rather than be left behind once we were in naples i told lady stewarthepburn the truth that i loved you and was with child i had never had a chance to tell my cousin that i was enceinte cat that is what i call my stepgrandmother agreed that i should go back but then we heard about the rebellion and were told that the dey had been killed when i learned that i nearly died myself cat brought me back to scotland but when glenkirk learned of my condition he banished me to the familys hunting lodge in the mountains with meggie and diarmid my sister fortune insisted on coming with me and there we remained until rowan was born rowan he stared down into her face our son i named him after my father she said softly where is he deverall leigh demanded i do not know india replied her eyes filling with tears you do not know madame what have you done with my son he shouted at her angrily i have done nothing glenkirk took the lad from me shortly after his birth and hid him away he would never say where india told him her chin quivering with her emotions but none of this would have happened if you had come to glenkirk to reclaim me instead of playing this perverted game with me why my lord why have you done this to me why she sobbed because i am a fool he said sadly i thought you had deserted me india had willingly gone off with captain southwood baba hassan and azura defended you but i would not listen he told her of his stepmother and why he had been unable to trust women india sighed sadly then she asked him but how is it you were able to return to england and how on earth did you get that scar on your face deverall adrian is responsible for my return he caught a fever and i revealed myself to him when i did he told me that it had been a plot of my stepmothers to kill lord jeffers and blame me so he might inherit marielena did the deed herself with poison then she implicated my brother who was still a child by having him place the knife in a dead mans chest adrian dictated a confession and signed it i kept it for myself and had no intention of returning to england but the janissaries had learned of my warning to the sultan which had put an end to their plans to overthrow him and his mother they sent troops from algiers and tunis to invade el sinut and the sultan looked the other way i was to be sacrificed to their revenge fortunately baba hassan learned of it just in time and arranged for my flight on our way to the harbor i was surprised by a young janissary eager to make a reputation the scar is from his cowardly blow fortunately for me aruj agha was nearby he killed the assailant and i was able to make good my escape but what of the others in the palace india asked aruj agha promised to see they were taken care of and as he has been appointed the new dey according to my sources i think we can both rest assured that they are safe the earl told his wife then his arms tightened about her again do you know how much i love you india but you do not trust me my lord and i do not know if i can forgive you that she said quietly i will never mistrust you again he vowed and tipping her face up to his he sealed his words with a kiss diarmid india suddenly cried breaking away from her husband diarmid will know where rowan is for it was he who took the baby away at my stepfathers request glenkirk would not harm the lad no india said firmly his only purpose in taking him was to make certain i appeared respectable to you one reason i mentioned my first husband was that i hoped to gain your respect and perhaps even your love eventually then i would have told you of the child and asked to bring him here to raise with our other children my mother swore she would learn where the child was hidden and make certain rowan was all right i did not desert our son willingly deverall and i did what i could to find him at glenkirk however it is very different from here in england no one will oppose the duke their loyalty is strong many are bound by
