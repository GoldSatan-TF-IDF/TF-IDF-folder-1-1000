steven saylor arms of nemesis contents part one corpses living and dead part two the jaws of hades part three death in a cup part four funeral games epilogue authors note the bays of naples at the time of the spartacan slave revolt bc part one corpses living and dead for all his fine qualities his honesty and devotion his cleverness his uncanny agility eco was not well suited for answering the door eco was mute but he was not and has never been deaf he has in fact the sharpest ears of anyone ive ever known he is also a light sleeper a habit held over from the wretched watchful days of his childhood before his mother abandoned him and i took him in from the street and finally adopted him not surprisingly it was eco who heard the knock at the door in the second hour after nightfall when everyone in the household had gone to bed it was eco who greeted my nocturnal visitor but was unable to send him away short of shooing at him the way a farmer shoos an errant goose from his doorway therefore what else could eco have done he might have roused belbo my strongarmer hulking and reeking of garlic and stupidly rubbing the sleep from his eyes belbo might have intimidated my visitor but i doubt that he could have got rid of him the stranger was persistent and twice as clever as belbo is strong so eco did what he had to do he made a sign for my visitor to wait in the doorway and came rapping gendy at my door rapping having failed to rouse me generous helpings of bethesdas fish and barley soup washed down with white wine had sent me fast asleep eco gingerly opened the door tiptoed into the room and shook my shoulder beside me bethesda stirred and sighed a mass of black hair had somehow setded across my face and neck the shifting strands tickled my nose and lips the odour of her perfumed henna sent a quiver of erotic tingling below my waist i reached for her making my lips into a kiss running my hands over her body how was it possible i wondered that she could reach all the way over and around me to tug at my shoulder from behind eco never liked to make those grunting halfanimal noises eked out by the speechless finding such measures degrading and embarrassing he preferred to remain austerely silent like the sphinx and to let his hands speak for him he gripped my shoulder harder and shook it just a bit more firmly i recognized his touch then as surely as one knows a familiar voice i could even understand what he was saying someone at the door i mumbled clearing my throat and keeping my eyes shut for a moment longer eco gave my shoulder a little slap of assent his way of saying yes in the dark i snuggled against bethesda who had turned her back on the disturbance i touched my lips to her shoulder she let out a breath something between a coo and a sigh in all my travels from the pillars of hercules to the parthian border i have never met a more responsive woman like an exquisitely crafted lyre i thought to myself perfectly tuned and polished growing finer with the years what a lucky man you are gordianus the finder what a find you made in that slave market in alexandria fifteen years ago somewhere under the sheets the kitten was stirring egyptian to her core bethesda has always kept cats and even invites them into our bed this one was traversing the valley between our bodies picking a path from thigh to thigh so far it had kept its claws hidden a good thing since in the last few moments my most vulnerable part had grown conspicuously more vulnerable and the kitten seemed to be heading straight for it perhaps thinking it was a serpent to play with i snuggled against bethesda for protection she sighed i remembered a rainy night at least ten years ago before eco joined us a different cat a different bed but the very same house the house that my father left me and the two of us bethesda and myself younger but not so very different from today i dozed nearly dreaming two sharp slaps landed on my shoulder two slaps was ecos way of saying no like shaking his head no he would not or could not send my visitor away he tapped me again twice sharply on the shoulder all right all right i muttered bethesda rolled aggressively away dragging the sheet with her and exposing me to the dank september air the kitten tumbled toward me sticking out its claws as it flailed for balance numas balls i snapped though it wasnt fabled king numa who found himself wounded by a single tiny claw eco discreetly ignored my yelp of pain bethesda laughed sleepily in the darkness i snapped out of bed and fumbled for my tunic eco was already holding it ready for me to crawl into this had better be important i said it was important just how important i had no way of knowing that night and not for some time after if the emissary waiting in my vestibule had made himself clear if he had been frank about why and for whom he had come i would have bent to his wishes without the least hesitation such a case and such a client as fell into my lap that night are few and far between i would have fought for the chance to take on the job instead the man who curtly introduced himself as marcus mummius affected an air of portentous secrecy and treated me with a suspicion that bordered on contempt he told me that my services were needed without delay for a job that would take me away from rome for several days are you in some sort of trouble i asked not me he bellowed he seemed incapable of talking in a tone of voice reasonable for a sleeping household his words came out in a series of grunts and barks the way that one speaks to an unruly slave or a bad dog there is no language as ugly as latin when it is spoken in such a fashion barracksfashion i mean for as sleepy as i was and as numbed with the evenings wine i was beginning to make certain deductions about my uninvited guest disguised behind his welltrimmed beard his austere but expensivelooking black tunic his finely made boots and plush woollen cloak i saw a soldier a man used to giving orders and being instantly obeyed well he said looking me up and down as if i were a lazy recruit fresh out of bed and dragging my feet before the days march are you coming or not eco offended at such rudeness put his hands on his hips and glowered mummius threw back his head and snorted in a fit of impatience i cleared my throat eco i said fetch me a cup of wine please warmed if you can see if the embers are still glowing in the kitchen and a cup for you as well marcus mummius my guest scowled and shook his head sharply like a good legionnaire on guard duty some warm cider perhaps no i insist marcus mummius the night is cool come follow me into my study look eco has already lit the lamps for us he anticipates all my needs here sit no i insist now marcus mummius i take it youve come here offering me work in the brighter light of the study i could see that mummius looked worn and tired as if he had not slept properly for some time he fidgeted in his chair and held his eyes open with an unnatural alertness after a moment he sprang up and began pacing and when eco came with his warm cider he refused to take it thus does a soldier on a long watch refuse to make himself comfortable for fear that sleep will come against his will yes he finally said i have come to summon you summon me no one summons gordianus the finder i am a citizen no mans slave or freedman and at last report rome was still a republic amazingly enough and not a dictatorship other citizens come to consult me to ask for my services to hire me and they usually come during daylight at least the honest ones do mummius appeared to be working hard to contain his exasperation this is ridiculous he said youll be paid of course if thats what youre worried about in fact im authorized to offer you five times your regular daily pay considering the inconvenience and the travel he said cautiously five days of guaranteed pay plus all your lodging and expenses he had my full attention from the comer of my eye i saw eco raise an eyebrow counselling me to be shrewd children of the streets grow up to be hard bargainers very generous marcus mummius very generous i said of course you may not realize that i had to raise my rates only last month prices in rome keep shooting up what with this slave revolt and the invincible spartacus rampaging through the countryside spreading chaos invincible mummius seemed personally offended spartacus invincible well soon see about that invincible when confronted by a roman army i mean the spartacans have beaten every contingent sent against them theyve even sent two roman consuls running home in disgrace i suppose that when pompey pompey mummius spat the name yes i suppose that when pompey finally manages to bring back his troops from spain the revolt will be quickly disposed of i rambled on only because the topic seemed to irritate my guest and i wanted to keep him distracted while i drove up my price mummius cooperated gloriously pacing gnashing his teeth glowering but it seemed he would not descend to gossiping about a subject as important as the slave revolt well see about that was all he would mutter trying feebly to interrupt me finally he raised his voice to command level and effectively cut me off well soon see about spartacus now then you were saying something about your rates i cleared my throat and took a sip of warm wine yes well as i was saying with prices wildly out of control yes yes well i dont know what you or your employer may have heard about my rates i dont know how you obtained my name or who recommended me never mind that all right though you did say five times yes five times your daily pay trying to sound professionally cool while fountains of silver coins splashed in my head four hundred sesterces a day multiplied by five guaranteed days of work equalled two thousand sesterces at last i could have the back wall of the house repaired have new tiles laid to replace the cracked ones in the atrium perhaps even afford a new slave girl to help bethesda with her duties mummius nodded gravely its as important a case as youre ever likely to be called for and sensitive i take it extremely requiring discretion great discretion he agreed i assume that more than mere property is at stake honour then more than honour said mummius gravely with a haunted look in his eyes a life then a life at stake from the look on his face i knew that we were talking about a case of murder a fat fee a mysterious client a murder i had no resistance left i did my best to make my face a blank mummius looked very grave the way that men look on a battlefield not in the rush of excitement before the killing but afterwards amid the carnage and despair not a life he said slowly not merely a single life at stake but many lives scores of lives men women children all hang in the balance unless something is done to stop it blood will flow like water and the wailing of babies will be heard in the very jaws of hades i finished my wine and set it aside marcus mummius will you not tell me outright who sent you and what it is you want me to do he shook his head ive said too much as it is perhaps by the time we arrive the crisis will be over the problem solved and therell be no need for you after all in that case its best that you know nothing now or ever no explanation none but youll be paid no matter what i nodded how long will we be away from rome five days as i said before you seem very sure five days he assured me and then you can return to rome unless its sooner but no longer than that in five days all will be finished one way or another for better or for worse i see i said not seeing at all and where exactly are we going mummius pressed his lips tightly shut because i said im not at all sure that i care to be traipsing about the countryside just now without even an idea of where im headed theres a little slave revolt going on i believe we were discussing it only a moment ago my sources in the countryside tell me that unnecessary travel is highly inadvisable youll be safe mummius snapped with authority then i have your word as a soldier or is it exsoldier that i wont be placed in tactical jeopardy mummius narrowed his eyes i said youll be safe very well then i think i shall leave belbo here for bethesdas protection im sure your employer can supply me with a bodyguard if i require it but i shall want to bring eco with me i take it your employers generosity will extend to feeding him and giving him a place to sleep he looked over his shoulder at eco with a sceptical gleam in his eye hes only a boy eco is eighteen he put on his first manly toga over two years ago mute isnt he yes ideal for a soldier i should think mummius grunted i suppose you can take him when do we leave i asked as soon as youre ready in the morning then he looked at me as if i were a lazy legionnaire asking for a nap before a battle the commanders edge returned to his voice no as soon as youre ready weve wasted enough time as it is very well i yawned ill just tell bethesda to gather up a few of my things that wont be necessary mummius pulled himself up to his full height still wearylooking but happy to be in charge at last anything you need will be supplied to you of course a client willing to pay four hundred sesterces a day could certainly supply mere necessities like a change of clothing or a comb or a slave to carry my things then ill take only a moment to say goodbye to bethesda i was stepping out of the room when mummius cleared his throat just to be sure he said looking at me and eco in turn i dont suppose either one of you has a problem with seasickness ii but where is the man taking you bethesda demanded to know yes demanded never mind her status as a slave if her impertinence seems unlikely that is because you have not met bethesda who is he what makes you think he can be trusted what if hes been sent by one of your old enemies just to lure you away from the city where he can slit your throat with no one to see bethesda if someone cared to slit my throat they could go to far less trouble and do the job right here in the subura they could hire an assassin on any street corner yes and thats why you have belbo to protect you why arent you taking him with you because i would rather he stayed here to protect you and the other slaves in my absence so that i wont have to worry about you while im gone even roused from sleep in the middle of the night bethesda was spectacular her hair black with strands of silver tumbled about her face in unkempt glory even pouting she maintained that same air of unshakable dignity that had first drawn me to her in the slave market at alexandria fifteen years ago i felt a shiver of doubt as i always do at parting with her the world is an unsafe and uncertain place and the life i have chosen often courts danger i learned long ago not to show my doubts bethesda did the opposite its a great deal of money i told her she snorted if he tells the truth i think he does a man doesnt survive in a city like rome for as long as i have without gaining a grain of judgment marcus mummius is honest insofar as he can be not very forthcoming ill admit but he wont even tell you who sent him indeed he wont tell me but he openly admits that he wont in other words he tells the truth bethesda made a rude noise with her lips you sound like one of those orators youre always working for like that ridiculous cicero saying truth is a he and a lie is the truth however it happens to suit you i bit my tongue and took a deep breath trust me bethesda ive stayed alive until now havent i i looked into her eyes and thought i saw a slight warmth amid the cold fire i laid my hand on her shoulder she shrugged it off and turned away so it always goes i stepped closer and put my hands on the back of her neck sliding them under the cascades of her hair she had no right to refuse me and did not draw away but she stiffened at my touch and held her head high even when i bent to kiss her ear i will come back i said after five days i return so the man promises i saw her cheeks tighten and her jaw tremble she blinked rapidly and i noticed the fan of wrinkles that time had gathered at the outer corner of her eye she stared at the blank wall before her it would be different if i knew where you were going i smiled bethesda had known only two cities in her life alexandria and rome and except for the voyage between has never ventured a mile outside either one what could it matter to her whether i was going to cumae or carthage well i sighed if it will give you any comfort i suspect that eco and i will be spending the next few days somewhere in the vicinity of baiae youve heard of it havent you she nodded its a beautiful little region down the coast i said inside the cape of misenum situated on the bay which the locals call the cup across the water from puteoli and pompeii they say the views of capri and vesuvius are quite splendid the richest of the rich build fine homes on the seashore and bathe in hot mud but how do you know where youre going if the man wont tell you its only a guess bethesda softened beneath my touch she sighed and i knew that she was reconciled to my going and to the prospect of being the mistress of the house for a few days having sole command over the other slaves from previous experience i knew that in my absence she was a thoroughly ruthless tyrant i only hoped that belbo would be able to bear up under her harsh rule the thought made me smile i turned and saw that eco waited in the doorway for an instant his face held an expression of intense fascination then he crossed his arms and rolled his eyes as if to deny any interest or sympathy with the moment of tenderness he had interrupted i quickly kissed bethesdas cheek and turned to go marcus mummius was pacing in the vestibule looking weary and impatient he threw up his hands when i appeared and hurried out the door not even waiting for me to catch up only giving me a look over his shoulder that showed what he thought of wasting so much time to say goodbye to a woman and a slave at that we hurried down the steep path that descends the esquiline hill watching for pitfalls by the light of ecos torch where the path ended spilling into the subura way four horses and two men awaited us mummiuss men looked and acted like legionnaires out of uniform beneath their light woollen cloaks i caught the glint of knives which made me feel safer at the prospect of venturing through roman streets after dark i reached inside my cloak and touched my own dagger mummius had said that all my needs would be supplied but i preferred to bring my own weapon mummius had not counted on eco so i was given the strongest mount and he rode behind me clutching my waist where my body is broad and thick through the shoulders and chest and in recent years through the middle as well ecos is thin and wiry his added weight was hardly enough for the beast to notice the evening was mild with only a faint earlyautumn chill in the air but the streets were nearly deserted in times of trouble romans shun the darkness and lock up their houses at sundown leaving the streets to pimps drunks and thrill seekers so it was in the turmoil of the civil wars and the gloomy years of sullas dictatorship so it was again now that the revolt of the spartacans was on everyones lips terrifying stories were told in the forum about whole villages where citizens had been overwhelmed and roasted alive by slaves who ate their former masters for dinner after sundown romans refused party invitations and vacated the streets they locked their bedchamber doors to keep out even their most trusted slaves while they slept and they woke up from nightmares drenched in sweat chaos was loose in the world again and his name was spartacus we clattered through the subura past alleys that stank of urine and rotting garbage our way was lit here and there by the glow from open windows along the overhanging upper storey snatches of music and drunken laughter wafted over our heads and faded behind us above us the stars looked very far away and very cold a sign of a frosty winter to come it would be warmer down in baiae i thought where summer lingers in vesuviuss shadow the subura way emptied at last into the forum where the hooves of our horses echoed unnaturally loud about the deserted squares and temples we skirted the more sacred areas where horses are not allowed even by night and headed south across the narrow valley between the capitoline and palatine hills the smell of straw and dung predominated as we passed by the great cattle market of the forum boarium quiet except for the occasional lowing of the beasts in their pens the enormous bronze ox on its pedestal loomed above us a great horned silhouette against the starry sky like a giant minotaur poised on a ledge i tapped ecos leg and he leaned forward bringing his ear to my lips its as i thought i whispered we make for the tiber are you sleepy he tapped me emphatically twice good i laughed then you keep watch while we drift downriver to ostia more of mummiuss men waited on the riverbank ready to take our horses as we dismounted at the end of the longest pier our boat was ready if in my sleepiness i had pictured a slow casual journey down the tiber to the coast i was mistaken the boat was not the tiny skiff i had imagined but a small barge oared by a dozen slaves with a helmsman at the rear and a canopy amidships a vessel built for speed and strength mummius wasted no time in ushering us aboard his two bodyguards followed and we cast off immediately you can sleep if you care to he said indicating the space beneath the canopy where a mound of blankets had been haphazardly tossed not very luxurious and theres no slave woman to keep you warm but there are no lice unless theyve crawled off one of this lot he gave a sharp kick to the shoulder of one of the rowers row he bellowed and youd better keep sharper time than you did on the journey upriver or ill have the lot of you moved onto the big ship for good he laughed without mirth back in his element mummius was beginning to show a more jovial personality and i was not sure i liked what i saw he placed one of his men in charge and crawled under the blankets wake me if you need to i whispered to eco squeezing his hand to make sure i had his attention or sleep if you can i doubt theres danger then i joined mummius beneath the tent nestling against its farther edge and trying hard not to think of my own bed and the warmth of bethesdas body i tried to sleep but without much success the creaking of manacles the sluicing of the oars through the water and the unending churning of the river against the bottom of the barge finally lulled me into fitful halfsleep from which i woke over and over always to the sound of marcus mummiuss snoring the fourth time i awoke to the raucous noise i poked my foot from under my blankets and gave him a gentle kick he stopped for a moment and then resumed making noises like a man slowly being strangled to death i heard low chuckles of laughter and rose on my elbows to see his two guardsmen smiling back at me from the prow they stood close together talking quietly wide awake i looked behind and saw the helmsman at his station a bearded giant who seemed to see and hear nothing but the river eco crouched nearby gazing over the low bulwark into the water looking like a statue of narcissus contemplating his reflection beneath the starry sky eventually mummiuss snoring quieted and blended with the slapping of water on wood and the steady rhythmic breathing of the rowers but still the deep healing embrace of morpheus eluded me i tossed and turned uneasily inside the blankets too hot and then too cold my thoughts straying down blind alleys and doubling back on themselves dozing brought sluggishness without rest stillness without refreshment when we at last reached ostia and the sea i was a duller man than the one marcus mummius had lured from his bed some hours before in the strange disjuncture of time and space that clouded my mind i imagined that the night would never end and we would journey in darkness forever mummius ushered us from the barge onto a pier the bodyguards came with us but the rowers were left behind gasping and bent double over their oars in exhaustion i glanced back for a moment at their broad naked backs heaving and glinting with sweat in the starlight one of them leaned over the bow and began to vomit at some point during the journey i had stopped hearing their ragged breathing and the steady grating of the oars i had forgotten them completely as one forgets the wheels of a grinding machine who notices a wheel until it needs oiling or a slave until he turns sick or hungry or violent i shivered and pulled the blanket around my shoulders to shut out the chilly sea air mummius led us along the riverfront beneath the boardwalk i heard the soft lapping of waves against the wooden posts to our right were clustered a fleet of small riverboats chained to the docks to our left ran a low stone wall with crates and baskets piled against it in a wild confusion of shadows beyond the wall was the sleeping town of ostia here and there i glimpsed the lit window of an upper storey and at intervals there were lamps set into the city wall but other than ourselves not a living person was stirring the light played strange tricks i imagined i saw a family of beggars huddled in a comer then saw a rat come racing from the heap which before my eyes resolved itself into nothing more than a pile of rags i tripped against a loose plank eco grabbed my shoulder to steady me then mummius almost knocked me down with a slap across the back didnt you sleep well enough he barked in his barracks voice i can manage on two hours a day in the army you learn to sleep standing up even marching if you have to i nodded dully we walked past warehouses and jetties through shutdown markets and shipyards the smell of salt grew stronger on the air and the vague hissing of the sea joined with the steady lapping of the river we came to the end of the docks where the tiber abruptly broadens and empties into the sea the city wall swung away to the south and a vast starlit prospect of calm waters opened before us here another larger boat awaited us mummius ushered us down the steps and into the hold he barked at the overseer and the boat cast off the dock receded the waves began to swell around us eco looked alarmed and clutched my sleeve dont worry i told him we wont be on this boat for long a moment later as we navigated around a shallow rocky promontory the vessel came in sight a trireme i whispered the fury shes called said mummius seeing my surprise and smiling proudly i had expected a large ship but nothing as large as this one three masts their sails cowled rose from the deck three rows of oars projected from her belly it hardly seemed possible that such a hulking monster had been dispatched merely to fetch a single man mummius lit a torch and waved it over his head a torch was lit on deck and waved back at us as we drew nearer men suddenly swarmed about the deck and up the masts as quiet as ghosts in the starlight the oars retracted from the water stirred like the quivering legs of a centipede and dipped downward sails unfurled and snapped taut in the soft breeze mummius wet his finger and held it aloft not much of a wind but steady to the south good we drew abreast a rope ladder was lowered eco scrambled up first and i followed marcus mummius came last and pulled up the ladder behind him the smaller boat drew away back toward ostia mummius walked quickly up and down the length of the ship giving orders the fury heaved and swung about the steady rhythm of oarsmen groaning in unison rose up through the boards and on either side there was a great splash as the first stroke sliced into the waves i looked back at ostia at the narrow beach that fronted the citys shoreward side and the tiled rooftops that rose above the walls the town receded with stunning speed the walls dwindled the gulf of dark water grew greater and greater rome suddenly seemed very far away marcus mummius busy with the crew ignored us eco and i found a quiet spot and did our best to sleep leaning against each other and huddling in our blankets to shut out the chill of the open sea suddenly mummius was shaking me awake what are you doing on deck a pampered city dweller like you will take a fever and die from this damp air come on both of you theres a room for you at the stern we followed him stumbling over coils of rope and hidden hatches the first rays of dawn were breaking over the dark hills to the east mummius led us down a short flight of steps and into a tiny room with two pallets side by side i fell onto the nearer one and shuddered at the pleasant shock of feeling myself submerged in a thick mattress of the finest goose down eco took the other and began to yawn and stretch like a cat i pulled my blanket up around my neck already halfasleep and vaguely wondered if mummius had allowed us to take his own accommodation i opened my eyes and saw him standing with his arms crossed leaning against the wall in the hall outside his face was barely visible in the pale light of dawn but there could be no doubt from the gende flutter of his eyelids and the slackness of his jaw that marcus mummius an honest soldier and no boaster was fast asleep and dreaming standing up iii i woke with a start wondering where i was it must have been morning because even at my most dissolute i seldom sleep until noon and yet the bright sunlight streaming into the window above my head had the soft quality of afternoon light in early autumn the earth seemed to shudder but not with the sudden convulsion of an earthquake the house creaked and groaned all about me and when i started to rise i felt my elbows sink into a vast bottomless pillow of down a vaguely familiar voice drifted in from the porthole above my head a gruff soldiers voice shouting orders and i remembered all at once next to me eco groaned and blinked open his eyes i managed to pull myself up and sat on the edge of the bed which seemed to be trying to pull me back into the soft forgetful haze of that luxurious mountain of down i shook my head to clear it a ewer of water was hooked into a bracket on the wall i picked it up by both handles and drank a long draught then scooped my hands full of water to splash my face dont waste it a voice barked thats fresh water from the tiber for drinking not washing i looked up to see marcus mummius standing in the doorway with his arms crossed looking bright and alert and flashing the superior smile of an early riser he had changed into military garb a tunic of red linen and red leather beneath a coat of mail armour what time is it two hours past noon or as they say on land the ninth hour of the day youve done nothing but sleep and snore since you fell into that bed last night he shook his head a real roman shouldnt be able to sleep on a bed that soft leave that kind of nonsense to fancy egyptians i say i thought youd taken ill but im told that dying men never snore so i decided it couldnt be too serious he laughed and i enjoyed the grim fantasy of imagining him suddenly spitted on a fancy egyptian spear i shook my head again how much longer on this ship i mean he wrinkled his brow that would be telling wouldnt it i sighed let me ask you this way how much longer until we reach baiae mummius looked suddenly seasick i never said indeed you did not youre a good soldier marcus mummius and you divulged nothing to me that you were sworn to conceal still im curious to know when well come to baiae what makes you think i think marcus mummius exactly i would hardly be the man your employer was seeking if i couldnt figure out a simple riddle such as our destination first we are most assuredly heading south im not much of a sailor but i do know the sun rises in the east and sets in the west and since the afternoon sun is on our right and the coast on our left i deduce we must be sailing south given the fact that you promise that my work will be done in five days we can hardly be going beyond italy where else then but a town on the southern coast and most likely on the cup oh perhaps im wrong in choosing baiae it could be puteoli or neapolis or even pompeii but i think not anyone as wealthy as your employer able to pay five times my fee without a qualm able to send a ship such as this on what seems to be a whim anyone that rich is going to have a house at baiae because baiae is where any roman who can afford it builds a summer villa besides yesterday you said something about the jaws of hades i never yes you said many lives were at stake and you spoke of babies wailing in the jaws of hades now you could have been speaking in metaphors like a poet but i suspect there is a conspicuous absence of poetry in your soul marcus mummius you carry a sword not a lyre and when you said jaws of hades you meant the words literally ive never seen it for myself but the greek colonists who originally settled around the cup believed they had located an entrance to the underworld in a sulphurous crater called lake avemus also known as the jaws of hades hades being the greeks word for the underworld which oldfashioned romans still call orcus the place is only a brisk walk i hear from the finest homes in baiae mummius looked at me shrewdly you are a sharp one he finally said maybe youll be worth your fee after all i heard no sarcasm in his voice instead there was a kind of sadness as if he truly hoped i would succeed at my task but expected me to fail an instant later mummius was swaggering out the door and bellowing over his shoulder i suppose youll be hungry after snoring all day theres food in the mess cabin amidships probably better than what youre used to at home too rich for me i prefer a skin of watery wine and a hard crust of bread but the owner always stocks the best or what the merchants tell him is best which means whatever is most expensive after you eat you can take a long nap he laughed might as well youll only get in the way if youre awake passengers are pretty useless on a ship not much for them to do might as well pretend youre a bag of grain and find a spot to gather mould follow me by changing the subject marcus mummius had avoided admitting that baiae was our destination there was no point in pressing the matter i already knew where we were going and now a greater matter weighed on my thoughts for i was beginning to suspect that i knew the identity of my mysterious new employer who could have afforded so ostentatious a means of transport for a mere hireling and a barely reputable one like gordianus the finder at that pompey perhaps could muster such resources on a private whim but pompey was in spain who then but the man reputed to be the richest roman alive indeed the richest roman who had ever lived but what could marcus licinius crassus want of me when he owned whole cities of slaves and could afford the services of any free man he desired i might have badgered mummius with more questions but decided i had taxed his patience enough i followed him into the afternoon sunlight and caught a whiff of roasted lamb on the bracing sea breeze my stomach roared like a hon and i abandoned curiosity to satisfy a more pressing appetite mummius was wrong to think that i would be bored with nothing to do on the fury at least as long as the sun was up the everchanging vista of the coast of italy the wheeling gulls overhead the work of the sailors the play of sunlight on water the schools offish that darted below the surface the crisp tangy air of a day that was no longer summer but not quite autumn all this was more than enough to occupy me until the sun went down eco was even more entranced everything fascinated him a pair of dolphins joined us at twilight and swam alongside the ship until long after darkness had fallen darting in and out of the splashing wake at times they seemed to laugh like men and eco mimicked the sound in return as if he shared a secret language with them when at last they disappeared beneath the foam and did not return he went smiling to his bed and fell fast asleep i was not so lucky having slept most of the day i faced a sleepless night for a while the shadowy coast and the sparkle of stars on the water charmed me quite as much as had the luminous afternoon but then the night grew colder and i took to my bed marcus mummius was right the bed was too soft or else the blanket was too rough or the faint starlight through the porthole was too distracting or the noises eco made in his sleep mimicking the dolphins laughter grated on my ears i could not sleep then i heard the drum it came from somewhere below a hollow throbbing beat slower than my own pulse but just as steady i had been so exhausted the night before that i had not heard it now i found it impossible to ignore it was the beat that drove the slaves at their oars below deck setting the rhythm that carried the ship closer and closer to baiae the more i tried not to hear it the louder it seemed to rise up through the planks beating beating beating the longer i tossed and turned the further sleep seemed to recede i found myself trying to recollect the face of marcus crassus the richest man in rome i had seen him a hundred times in the forum but his visage escaped me i counted money in my head imagining the soft jingle of coins in a purse and spent my fee a dozen times over i thought of bethesda i imagined her sleeping alone with the kitten curled up between her breasts and i traced a path by memory from room to room through my house in rome like an invisible phantom standing guard abruptly an image rose unbidden in my mind of belbo lying across my portal in a drunken stupor with the door wide open for any thief or assassin to step inside i gave a start and sat upright eco turned in his sleep and made a chattering noise i strapped on my shoes wrapped the blanket around me like a cloak and returned to the deck here and there sailors lay huddled together in sleep a few strolled the deck watchful and alert for any danger from the sea or shore a steady breeze blew from the north filling the sail and raising gooseflesh wherever the blanket did not cover my arms and legs i strolled once about the deck then found myself drawn towards the portal amidships that led down into the galley it is curious that a man can sail upon many ships in his life and never wonder at the hidden motive power that drives them yet this is how most people live their lives every day men eat and dress and go about their business and never give a thought to all the sweat of all the slaves who laboured to grind the grain and spin the cloth and pave the roads wondering about these things no more than they wonder about the blood that heats their bodies or the mucus that cradles their brains i stepped through the portal and down the steps instantly a wave of heat struck my face warm and stifling like rising steam i heard the dull throbbing boom of the drum and the shuffling of many men i smelled them before i saw them all the odours that the human body can produce were concentrated in that airless space rising up like the breath of demons from a sulphurous pit i took another step downward into a world of living corpses dunking that the jaws of hades could hardly lead to a more terrible netherworld than this the place was like a long narrow cavern here and there lamps suspended from the ceiling cast a lurid glow across the pale naked bodies of the oarsmen at first in the dimness i saw only an impression of rippling movements everywhere around me like the writhing of maggots as my eyes adjusted i slowly made out the details down the centre ran a narrow aisle like a suspended bridge on each side slaves were stationed in tiers threedeep those against the hull were able to sit at their stations expending the least effort to power their shorter oars those in the middle were seated higher and had to brace themselves against a footrest with each backward pull then rise from their seats to push the oars forward those on the aisle were the unlucky ones they ran the catwalk shuffling back and forth to push their oars in a great circle stretching onto their toes at full extension then kneeling and lurching forward to lift the oars out of the water each slave was manacled to his oar by a rusted link of chain around one wrist there were hundreds of them packed tightly together rubbing against one another as they pushed and pulled and strained i thought of cattle or goats pressed together in a pen but animals move without purpose here each man was like a tiny wheel in a vast constantly moving machine the drumbeat drove them i turned and saw the drummer at the stern on a low bench that must have been just below my bed his legs were spread wide apart his knees grasped the rim of a low broad drum thongs were wrapped around each hand and at the end of each thong was a leather ball one by one he lifted the balls in the air and brought them down upon the skin of the drum sending out a low pulse that throbbed through the dense warm air he sat with his eyes closed and a faint smile on his face as if he were dreaming but the rhythm never faltered beside him stood another man dressed like a soldier and holding a long whip in his right hand he glowered when he saw me then snapped his whip in the air as if to impress me the slaves nearest him shuddered and some of them groaned as if a wave of pain passed over them i pressed the blanket over my mouth and nose to filter the stench where the lamplight penetrated through the maze of catwalks and manacled feet i saw that the bilge was awash with a mixture of faeces and urine and vomit and bits of rotting food how could they bear it did they grow used to it over time the way men grow accustomed to the clasp of manacles or did it never cease to nauseate them just as it sickened me there are religious sects in the east which postulate abodes of eternal punishment for the shades of the wicked their gods are not content to see a man suffer in this world but will pursue him with fire and torment into the next of this i know nothing but i do know that if a place of damnation exists here on earth it is surely within the bowels of a roman galley where men are forced to work their bodies to ruination amid the stench of their own sweat and vomit and excreta playing out their anguish against the maniacal neverending pulse of the drum to become mere fuel to be consumed drained and discarded with hardly a thought is surely as horrible a damnation as any god could contrive they say most men die after three or four years in the galleys the lucky ones die before that a captive prisoner or a slave guilty of theft if given the choice will go to the mines or become a gladiator before he will serve in the galleys of all the cruel sentences of death that can be meted out to a man slavery in the galley is considered by all to be the cruellest death comes but not before the last measure of strength has been squeezed from a mans body and the last of his dignity has been annihilated by suffering and despair men become monsters in the galleys some ship captains never rotate the positions of the slaves a man who rows for day after day month after month on the same side especially if he runs the catwalk develops great muscles on one side of his body out of all proportion to the other at the same time his flesh grows pale as a fish from lack of sunlight if such a man escapes he is easily detected by his deformity once in the subura i saw a troop of private guards dragging such a man from a brothel naked and screaming eco then only a boy had been horrified by the slaves appearance and then after i had explained it had begun to weep men become gods in the galley as well crassus if indeed he was the owner of this ship took care to rotate his rowers or else used them up more quickly than most for i saw no lopsided monsters among them instead i saw young men with deep chests and great shoulders and arms and among them a few older survivors with even more massive physiques like a crew of bearded apollos sprinkled with a hoary hercules here and there at least from the neck down above the neck their faces were all too human wretched with care and suffering as i looked from face to face most of them averted their eyes as if my gaze could hurt them as surely as the whipmasters lash but a few of them dared to look back at me i saw eyes dulled by endless labour and monotony eyes envious of a man who possessed the simple freedom to walk about at will to wipe the sweat from his face to clean himself after defecating in some eyes i saw lurking fear and hatred and in others a kind of fascination almost a lust the kind of naked stare that a starving man might cast on a glutton a kind of fever seized me warm and trancelike as i walked down the long central aisle between the naked slaves my nostrils filled with the smell of their flesh my skin awash in the humid heat of their straining bodies my eyes roving among the great congregation of suffering constantly asway in the darkness i was a man in a dream watching other men in a nightmare away from the drumbeaters platform and the central stairway the lamps grew fewer but here and there a bit of moonlight found its way into the dim hold shining silverblue on the sweatglazed arms and shoulders of the rowers glinting upon the manacles that kept their hands locked in place upon the oars the dull beat of the drum grew softer as it receded behind me but continued slow and steady setting an easy nocturnal pace its constant rhythm as hypnotic as the hissing murmur of the waves sluicing against the prow i reached the end of the walkway i turned and looked back over the labouring multitude suddenly i had seen enough i hurried towards the exit ahead of me illuminated by lamplight as if on a stage i saw the whipmaster look towards me and nod knowingly even at a distance i could see the disdain on his face this was his domain i was an intruder a curiosity seeker too soft and too pampered for such a place he cracked his whip over his head for my benefit and smiled at the wave of groans that passed through the slaves at his feet i put one foot upon the stair and would have followed with the other but a face in the lamplight stopped me the boy must have reminded me of eco and that was why i noticed his face among all the others his place was in the highest tier along the aisle when he turned to look at me a beam of moonlight fell upon one cheek casting his face half in moonlight half in lamplight split between pale blue and orange despite his massive shoulders and chest he was hardly more than a child along with the filth that smudged his cheeks and the suffering in his eyes there was a strange look of innocence about him his dark features were strikingly handsome his prominent nose and mouth and wide dark eyes suggestive of the east as i studied him in the moonlight he dared to look back at me and then actually smiled a sad pathetic smile tentative and fearful i thought of how easily eco might have ended up in such a place if i had not found him and taken him home that day long ago a boy with a strong body without a tongue or a family to defend himself might easily be waylaid and sold at auction i looked back at the slave boy i tried to smile in return but could not suddenly a man descended the stairs and pushed roughly past me then hurried towards the stern he shouted something and the drumbeat abruptly accelerated to twice its tempo there was a great lurch as the ship bolted forwards i fell against the rail of the stairs the increase in speed was astounding the drum boomed louder and louder faster and faster the messenger pushed past me again heading up to the deck i grabbed the sleeve of his tunic pirates he said with a theatrical hit in his voice two ships slipped out of a hidden cove as we passed theyre after us now his face was grim but as he tore himself from my grip astonishingly enough i thought i saw him laughing i began to follow him then stopped arrested by the sudden spectacle all around me the drum boomed faster the rowers groaned and followed the tempo the whipmaster swaggered up the aisle he cracked his whip in the air loosening his arm the rowers cringed the beat grew faster the rowers at the outer edges of the ship were able to stay in their seats but those along the aisle were abruptly driven to their toes by the heightened motion of the oars scrambling to keep up stretching their arms high in the auto keep the gyrating oars under control manacled to the wood they had no choice the beat accelerated even more the vast machine was at full throttle the oars moved in great circles at a mad tempo the slaves pumped with all their might horrified but unable to look away i studied their grinning faces jaws clenched eyes burning with fear and confusion there was a loud snap and a crack as if one of the great oars had suddenly split asunder so close that i covered my face in the same instant the boy who had smiled at me threw back his head his mouth wrenched open in a silent howl the whipmaster raised his arm again the lash slithered through the air the boy shrieked as if he had been scalded i saw the lash slither across his naked shoulders he faltered against the oar tripping on the catwalk for a long moment he hung suspended from the manacles around his wrists as he was dragged forwards backwards and up again as he hung from the highest point desperately trying to find his balance the whip lashed against his thighs the boy screamed convulsed and fell again the oar carried him for another revolution he somehow found his grip andj oined in the effort every muscle straining the lash struck again the drumbeat boomed the whip rose and fell squealing and gasping from the pain the boy danced like a spastic his broad shoulders convulsed at the whipmasters rhythm out of time with the great machine his face contorted in agony he cried like a child the whipmaster struck him again and again i looked at the mans face he smiled grimly back at me showing a mouth full of rotten teeth then turned and spat across the shoulders of one of the straining slaves he looked me in the eye and he raised his whip again as if daring me to interfere with a single voice the rowers groaned like a tragic chorus i looked at the boy who never ceased rowing he looked back at me and moved his lips unable to speak suddenly i heard footsteps from above the messenger returned holding up his open hand as a signal to the drumbeater all clear all clear he shouted the drumbeat abruptly ceased the oars were still the sudden quiet was broken only by the lapping of waves against the ship the creaking of wood and the hoarse gasping breath of the rowers at my feet the boy lay collapsed atop his oar racked with sobbing i looked down at his broad musclescalloped back livid with welts the fresh wounds lay atop an accumulation of older scars this was not the first time the whipmaster had singled him out suddenly i saw nothing heard nothing the smell of the place overwhelmed me as if the sweat of so many closepacked bodies had turned the fetid air to poison i pushed the messenger aside and hurried up the steps into the fresh air beneath the stars i leaned over the bulwark and emptied my stomach afterwards i looked about disoriented weak disgusted the men on deck were busy taking down the auxiliary sail from the second mast the water was calm the shore dark and silent marcus mummius saw me and approached he was in high spirits lost your dinner eh it can happen when we rush to full speed and youve got a full belly i told the owner not to stock such rich provisions id rather throw up a bellyful of bread and water any day than a stomach full of halfchewed flesh and bile i wiped my chin we outran them then the dangers over mummius shrugged in a manner of speaking what do you mean i looked toward the stern the sea behind us was empty how many were there where did they go oh there were a thousand ships at least all flying pirate banners and now theyve gone back to hades where they belong he saw the look on my face and laughed phantom pirates he explained sea spirits what i dont understand men at sea are superstitious but i could hardly believe that mummius would half kill the galley slaves to outrun a few sea vapours or a stray whale but mummius was not mad it was worse than that a drill he finally said shaking his head and slapping me on the back as if it were a joke i was too stupid to grasp a drill yes a drill an exercise you have to have them every so often especially on a nonmilitary ship like the fury to make sure everyones on his toes at least thats the way we run things under he began to say a name then caught himself under my commander he finished really catches the slaves off their guard when you do it at night a drill i repeated stupidly you mean there were no pirates it was all unnecessary but the slaves below are run ragged good mummius said thrusting his jaw in the air the slaves of a roman master must be always ready always strong or else what good are they the words were not his own he was quoting someone what manner of man commanded marcus mummius and could afford to be so profligate with his human tools i looked down at the oars that projected from the fury suspended motionless above the waves a moment later the oars stirred and dipped into the waves the slaves had been given a brief respite and now were at work once again i hung my head and took a deep breath of salty air and wished i were back in rome asleep in bethesdas arms iv i was awakened by a poke in the ribs eco stood over me gesturing for me to get up sunlight was streaming through the porthole i rose to my knees on the mattress and looked out to see land nearby with here and there a habitation set among the rocky cliffs the buildings lower down nearest the water were ramshackle affairs humble dwellings pieced together with driftwood festooned with nets and surrounded by little shipyards the buildings higher up were markedly different sprawling villas with white columns and grapevine trellises i stood up to stretch as best i could within the cramped quarters i splashed my face with water and sucked in a mouthful swished it to clean my tongue and spat it out the porthole eco had already set out my better tunic while i dressed he combed my hair and then played barber when the ship gave a tiny pitch i held my breath but he did not nick me once eco fetched bread and apples and we fed ourselves on the deck contemplating the view as marcus mummius guided the ship into the great bay which romans have always called the cup likening it to a vast bowl of water with villages all about its rim the ancient greeks who first colonized the region called it the bay of neapolis i think after their chief settlement my sometimesclient cicero calls it the bay of luxury with a derisive tone of voice he himself does not own a villa there yet we entered the cup from the north skirting the narrows between the cape of misenum and the small island of procida directly before us at the far side of the bay loomed the larger island of capri like a craggy finger pointing skyward the sun was high the day was fine and clear without a touch of haze on the water between us and the opposite strait that separates capri from the promontory of minerva the water was spangled with the multicoloured sails of fishing boats and the bigger sails of the trading ships and ferries that circle the bay carrying goods and passengers from surrentum and pompeii on the south side to neapolis and puteoli on the north we rounded the headland and the entire bay opened before us glittering beneath the sun at its apex looming above the little village of herculaneum rose vesuvius the sight always impresses me the mountain towers on the horizon like a great pyramid flattened at the top with its fertile slopes covered by meadows and vineyards vesuvius presides over the cup like a bounteous benevolent god an emblem of steadfastness and serenity for a while in the early days of slave revolt spartacus and his men took refuge on the higher slopes the fury stayed close to the land circling the cape of misenum and then turning her back on vesuvius to glide majestically into the hidden harbour the sails were furled sailors ran about the deck securing ropes and tackles i pulled eco out of the way fearing that without a yoice to protect himself he might be stepped on or tangled in the swinging ropes he gently shrugged my hand from his shoulder and rolled his eyes im not a boy any longer he seemed to be saying but it was with a boys excitement that he turned his head this way and that trying to observe everything at once craning his neck and skittering about with a look of awe on his face his eye missed nothing in the rush of confusion he grabbed my arm and pointed towards the skiff that had pushed off from the docks and was making its way towards the fury the boat pulled alongside marcus mummius leaned over the bulwark shouting a question after he heard the reply he threw back his head and let out a sigh whether of relief or regret i could not tell he looked up and scowled at my approach nothing was resolved in my absence he sighed youll be needed after all at least the journey wasnt wasted then you can tell me officially now that my employer is marcus crassus mummius looked at me ruefully you think youre awfully clever dont you i only hope youll be half that clever when the need comes now off with you down the ladder and you ill follow later after ive seen to the ship for now youre in the hands of faustus fabius hell take you to the villa at baiae and see to matters there eco and i descended to the skiff where a tall redheaded man in a dark blue tunic stood waiting to greet us his face was young but i saw the lines of age at the corners of his catgreen eyes he was probably in his middle thirties about the same age as mummius he clasped my hand and i saw the flash of a patrician ring on his finger but a gold ring was hardly necessary to show that he came from an old family the fabii are as old as the cornelii or aemilii older than the claudii but even without the ring and without the name i would have known him for a patrician only a roman noble of the most venerable ancestry can pull back his shoulders quite so stiffly and hold his chin so rigidly upright even in a small rocking boat without looking either pompous or ridiculous youre the one they call the finder his voice was smooth and deep as he spoke he arched one eyebrow such a typical patrician gesture that i sometimes wonder if the old nobility have an extra muscle in their foreheads for just this purpose gordianus from rome i said good good here wed better sit unless youre an excellent swimmer tm hardly a swimmer at all i confessed faustus fabius nodded this is your assistant my son eco i see its good that youve arrived gelina will be relieved for some reason she took it into her head that mummius might be able to get back by late last night we all told her that was impossible even under the very best conditions the ship couldnt return before this afternoon but she wouldnt listen before she went to bed she arranged to have messengers descend to the harbour one every hour to see if the ship had arrived the household is in chaos as you can imagine he saw the blank look on my face ah but mummius has told you next to nothing i suppose yes those were his instructions never fear all shall be made clear to you he turned his face to the breeze and took a deep breath letting his unfashionably long hair flutter in the wind like a red mane i looked about the harbour the fury was by far the largest vessel the rest were small fishing boats and pleasure craft misenum has never been a particularly busy port most of the trade that flows into and out of the cup is channelled through puteoli the busiest port in all italy yet it seemed to me that misenum was more quiet than it should be considering its proximity to the luxurious district of baiae and its famous mineral springs i said as much to faustus fabius so youve been here before he asked a few times well acquainted with trading vessels and business on the campanian coast are you i shrugged business has brought me to the cup now and again over the years im no expert on sea traffic but am i wrong to say that the harbour appears rather empty he made a slight grimace not wrong at all between the pirates at sea and spartacus inland trade everywhere in campania has come to a standstill hardly anything moves on the roads or the sea lanes which makes it all the more amazing that marcus was willing to send the fury after you by marcus you mean marcus mummius of course not mumrnius doesnt own a trireme i mean marcus crassus fabius smiled thinly oh but you werent supposed to know that were you at least not until you landed well here we are hold on for the jolt these clumsy rowers youd think they were trying to ram an enemy vessel a stint on the fury might do them some good i saw the slaves at the oars cower or pretend to as we stepped onto the dock i looked back again at the harbour you mean to say theres no trade at all these days fabius shrugged i ascribed his grimace to the patricians traditional disdain for all matters of commerce sailboats and skiffs shuttle back and forth across the cup of course exchanging goods and passengers between the villages he said but its a rarer and rarer occurrence to see a big ship from egypt or africa or even spain come in from the sea headed for the big docks at puteoli of course in another few weeks travel by sea will stop altogether for the winter as for goods from inland all of the south of italy is under the shadow of spartacus now hes made his winter stronghold in the mountains around thurii after spending all summer terrorizing the region east of vesuvius crops were destroyed farms and villas were burned to the ground the markets are empty its a good thing the locals neednt live off bread no one around here will starve so long as there are fish in the cup or oysters in lake lucrinus he turned and led us across the dock i dont suppose there are any shortages in rome despite the troubles shortages are not allowed in rome the people fear but suffer not i quoted from a recent speech i had heard in the forum fabius snorted its just like the senate theyll go to any lengths to see that the rabble in rome remains comfortable meanwhile they cant manage to send a decent commander against either spartacus or the pirates what a congregation of incompetents rome has never been the same since sulla opened the doors of the senate as a reward to all his rich cronies now trinket salesmen and olive oil merchants line up to give speeches while gladiators rape the countryside its only luck that spartacus has so far lacked either the brains or the nerve to march on rome itself that possibility is discussed daily im sure it is what else do romans have to talk about these days between plates of caviar and stuffed quail pompey is always a popular subject for gossip i offered they say hes almost put down the rebels in spain popular opinion looks to pompey to hurry back and put an end to spartacus pompey faustus fabius infused the name with almost as much disdain as had marcus mummius not that he doesnt come from a good family of course and no one can discount his military achievements but for once pompey is not the right man in the right place at the right time and who is fabius smiled and dilated his broad nostrils youll be meeting him shortly horses awaited us accompanied by fabiuss bodyguard we rode through the village of misenum and then headed north on a stonepaved road beside the broad muddy beach at length the road turned inland from the beach and ascended a low wooded ridge on either side through the trees i began to glimpse great houses set far apart with cultivated gardens and patches of wilderness between them eco widened his eyes at my side he had met wealthy men and had occasionally been allowed in their homes but such ostentation as that which thrives on the cup was new to him the city houses of the wealthy set close together with plain facades do not impose as do their country villas away from the jealous eyes of the urban masses in settings where no one but slaves or visitors as wealthy as themselves are likely to come knocking the great romans show no fear in advertising their taste and their ability to pay for it oldfashioned orators in the forum say that wealth did not flaunt itself in earlier days but in my lifetime gold has never been afraid to show its face especially on the bay of luxury faustus fabius set a leisurely pace if this errand was urgent he did not show it there seems to be something in the very air of the campanian coast that relaxes even the most harried of city dwellers from the north i sensed it myself a crispness in the pinescented air spiced with sea spray a special clarity of sunlight charging the sky and reflected from the vast bowl of the bay a feeling of harmony with the gods of earth air fire and water such contentment loosens tongues and i found it easy to open up faustus fabius by exclaiming at the views and asking a few questions about the topography and the local cuisine he was a roman through and through but clearly he visited the region often enough to have a thorough knowledge of the coastal campanians and their old greek customs i must say faustus fabius my host on land is certainly more informative than the one i had at sea he acknowledged the comment with a thin smile and a knowing nod i could see he had little affection for marcus mummius tell me i went on just who is this mummius fabius raised his eyebrow i thought you would have known that mummius was one of crassuss proteges in the civil wars since then hes become crassuss righthand man in military affairs the mummii arent a particularly distinguished family but like most roman families that survive long enough they do possess at least one famous ancestor unfortunately the fame goes hand in hand with a taint of scandal marcus mummiuss greatgrandfather was a consul back in the days of the gracchi he won triumphs for his campaigns in spain and greece you never heard of mad mummius also known as the barbarian i shrugged the minds of patricians are surely different from those of us ordinary men how else can they effortlessly catalogue so much glory and gossip and scandal about so many ancestors not just their own but everyone elses at the least prompting they can recount picayune details of life after life going all the way back to king numa and beyond fabius smiled its unlikely but if the matter should happen to come up around marcus be careful what you say hes surprisingly sensitive about his ancestors reputation well then many years ago this mad mummius was commissioned by the senate to put down the revolt of the achaean league in greece mummius destroyed them completely and then systematically looted corinth before levelling the city and enslaving the populace by senatorial decree another glorious chapter in the history of our empire surely an ancestor any roman should be proud of indeed said fabius his teeth slighdy clenched at the irony in my voice and his butchery earned him the name mad mummius oh by hercules no it wasnt his bloodthirstiness or his cruelty it was the indiscriminate way he handled the works of art he shipped back to rome priceless statuary arrived in pieces filigreed urns were scarred and scraped jewels were torn from caskets precious glassware was shattered they say the man couldnt tell a polyclitus from a polydorus imagine that no really they say a juno by polyclitus and a venus by polydorus each lost her head in transit and when mad mummius was having them reassembled he ordered the workmen to attach the wrong heads to the wrong statues the error was evident to any fool with two eyes one of the corinthian captives outraged by the blasphemy advised mad mummius of the error whereupon the general had the old man soundly whipped and sold to the mines then he ordered his men to leave the statues exactly as they were saying he thought they looked better that way fabius shook his head in disgust to a patrician a scandal a hundred years ago is still a scandal this morning old mummius became known as mad mummius the barbarian given that his sensibilities were no better than those of a thracian or a gaul the family has never quite shaken off the embarrassment a pity since our marcus mummius idolized his ancestor for his military skills and rightly so and crassus recognizes the skills of marcus mummius his right hand as i said i nodded and who are you faustus fabius i looked at him steadily trying to pierce his feline countenance but he rewarded my scrutiny with a bland expression that seemed to be a smile on one side and a frown on the other i suppose that would make me the left hand of crassus he said the road grew level as we gainedthe summit of the ridge through the trees to the right i caught occasional glimpses of water below and far away across the inlet the clay rooftops of puteoli shimmering like tiny red beads for some time i had seen no houses on either side it seemed that we were passing through a single large estate we passed grape arbours and cultivated fields but i saw no slaves at work i remarked on the absence of any signs of life thinking fabius had not heard me over the clatter of our horses i repeated my remark more loudly but he only looked straight ahead and did not answer at last a smaller road branched off to the right there was no gate but two pylons flanked the road each redstained column was surmounted by the bronze head of a bull with a ring through its nose the land on either side of the road was wild and forested the way wound gradually downward towards the coast through the trees i could see blue water flecked with faraway sails and again the roofs of puteoli across the water then the way took a sharp turn around a large boulder the trees and thickets abruptly drew back revealing the massive facade of the villa the roof was of clay tiles which blazed fiery red in the sunlight the walls were stained saffron the central mass was two storeys high flanked by wings that projected to the north and south we halted in the gravel courtyard where a pair of slaves ran to help us dismount and to lead the horses to the nearby stables eco dusted his tunic and looked about wideeyed as faustus fabius escorted us to the entrance funeral wreaths of cypress and fir adorned the high oak doors fabius knocked the door opened just enough for a blinking eye to peer out and then was pulled wide open by an unseen slave who cowered behind it fabius raised his hand in a gesture that invited us to follow and at the same time demanded silence my eyes were used to the sunlight so that the hallway seemed quite dark i saw the wax masks of the household ancestors in their niches only as vague shadows on either side of us like ghosts without bodies peering from little windows the dark hallway opened into an atrium the space was square surrounded by a colonnaded portico on the ground floor and a narrow walkway on the floor above cobblestone pathways meandered through a low garden there was a small fountain at the centre where a bronze faun threw back his head in delight as tiny jets of water splashed from his pipes the workmanship was exquisite the creature seemed to be alive ready to leap and dance the sound of bubbling water was almost like laughter at our approach two yellow birds who were bathing themselves in the tiny pool flew in a startled circle about the fauns prancing hooves then upwards to perch nervously on the balustrade that circled the upper storey and then upwards again into the blue sky i watched them ascend then lowered my eyes to the garden again that was when i saw the great funeral bier at the far end of the atrium and the body that lay upon it fabius walked through the garden where he paused to dip his fingers into the basin at the fauns feet and then touch them to his forehead eco and i followed his example and joined him before the body lucius licinius said fabius in a low voice in life the dead man had possessed great wealth either that or his funeral arrangements were being provided by someone with a remarkable purse even very wealthy families are usually content to lay their deceased upon a wooden bed with ivory legs and perhaps some decorative ivory inlays this elegantly carved bed was made entirely of ivory from head to foot i had heard of such lavishness but had never before seen an example the precious substance glowed with a waxen paleness almost as smooth and colourless as the flesh of the dead man himself purple blankets embroidered with gold lay upon the bed along with adornments of asters and evergreen branches the corpse was dressed in a white toga with elegant green and white embroidery the feet were clad in freshly oiled sandals and pointed toward the door of the house as prescribed by tradition eco wrinkled his nose an instant later i did the same despite the perfumes and unguents with which the body had been anointed and the pan of incense set above a low brazier nearby there was a decided odour of decay in the air eco moved to cover his nose with the hem of his sleeve i batted his hand away and frowned at his rudeness fabius said in a low voice this is the fifth day it would be two more days until the funeral then to allow the seven days of public mourning the body would be quite pungent by then with such an ostentatious display of wealth surely the family had paid for the best anointers to be found in baiae or more likely had brought them over from bustling puteoli but their skill had not been good enough there was an added irony in the carelessness with which the deceased was displayed a few stray tendrils of ivy had fallen over his head obscuring not only half his face but any laurel crown that he might have been wearing in remembrance of some earthly honour this ivy i said looks almost as if it had been placed over his face on purpose fabius did not stop me as i gently lifted the green tendrils that had been so skilfully arranged to hide the dead mans scalp the wound beneath was of the sort that makes anointers of the dead throw up their hands in despair almost impossible to purify and seal too large to be hidden in any subtle way too deep and ugly to be looked at for long eco made an involuntary sound of disgust and turned his face away then leaned back to take a closer look hideous isnt it whispered fabius averting his face and lucius licinius was such a vain man a pity he cant look his best in death i steeled myself to look at the dead mans face a sharp heavy blow or blows had destroyed the upper right quadrant of his face tearing the ear smashing the cheekbone and jaw and ruining the eye which despite any efforts to close it after death remained narrowly opened and clotted with blood i studied what remained of the face and was able to imagine a handsome man of middle age greying slightly at the temples with a strong nose and chin the lips were slightly parted showing the gold coin that had been placed on his tongue by the anointers the fee for the boatman charon to ferry him across the river styx his death was not an accident i offered hardly an altercation that came to blows possibly it happened late at night his body was found here in the atrium the next morning the circumstances were obvious yes a runaway slave some fool following the example of spartacus it appears someone else will explain the matter to you in more detail this was done by an escaped slave i am not a slave hunter faustus fabius why was i brought here he glanced at the dead man then at the bubbling faun someone else will explain very well the victim what did you call him lucius licinius he was the master of the house more or less said fabius no riddles please fabius pursed his lips this should have been mummiuss job not mine i agreed to escort you to the villa but i never agreed to explain the matter to you once you arrived marcus murnmius isnt here but i am and so is the corpse of a murdered man fabius grimaced patrician or not he struck me as a man used to being stuck with unpleasant jobs and he did not like it what had he called himself the left hand of crassus very well he finally said this is the way things were with lucius licinius he and crassus were cousins closely linked by blood i gather they hardly knew one another growing up but that changed when they became men many of the licinii were wiped out in the civil wars once things got back to normal under sullas dictatorship crassus and lucius formed a closer relationship not a friendship it was more in the nature of a business partnership fabius smiled but then everything is business with marcus crassus anyway in any relationship there must be a stronger and a weaker partner i think you must know enough about crassus if only by hearsay to imagine which of them was subservient lucius licinius yes lucius was a poor man to start with and he would have stayed that way without crassuss help lucius had so little imagination he wasnt the sort to see an opportunity and seize it unless he was pushed meanwhile crassus was busy making his millions in real estate up in rome you must know the legend i nodded when the dictator sulla finally triumphed in the civil wars he destroyed his enemies by seizing their property and rewarded his supporters pompey and crassus among them with villas and farms thus had crassus begun his ascent driven by an apparently boundless appetite for property once in the streets of rome i had come upon a burning building and there was crassus bidding on the tenement next to it the owner confused and desperate and believing he was about to lose his property to the spreading flames sold it to crassus on the spot for a song whereupon the millionaire called out his private fire brigades to put out the flames such tales about crassus were commonplace in rome everything crassus touched seemed to turn to gold fabius explained his cousin lucius on the other hand muddled about trying to make a living off the land like all good oldfashioned plebeians he lost and lost until he was bankrupt finally he begged crassus to save him and crassus did he made lucius a kind of factotum a representative to look after some of crassuss business enterprises on the cup in a good year without pirates or spartacus theres a great deal of business transacted on the cup its not all luxurious villas and oyster farms crassus owns mines in spain and a fleet of ships that bring the ore to puteoli he owns metalworkers in neapolis and pompeii who turn the ore into utensils and weapons and finished works of art he owns ships that transport slaves from alexandria to puteoli he owns farms and vineyards all over campania and supplies the hordes of slaves that ate needed to work them crassus cant oversee all these small details himself his interests extend from spain to egypt he delegated responsibility for local business here on the cup to lucius who oversaw crassuss investments and enterprises in a plodding but adequate manner the running of this house for example actually crassus himself owns the house and all the land around it he has no need for villas he scoffs at the idea of retreating to the countryside or the coast to relax and read poetry and yet somehow he keeps acquiring them dozens of villas by now he cant keep empty houses all over italy so he prefers to rent them to his family and his factotums then when he travels he can reside in them when and as he needs to a guest and yet more than a guest and the household slaves they are also the property of crassus and the fury the trireme in the harbour that brought me from ostia that belongs to crassus too although it was lucius who oversaw its use and the deserted vineyards and fields we rode through on the way from misenum property of crassus along with numerous other properties and manufactories and gladiator schools and farms in the region from here to surrentum then to call lucius licinius the master of this house licinius gave the orders and acted independently in his own home to be sure but he was nothing more than crassuss creature a servant really if a privileged and very pampered one i see is there a widow her name is gelina and children their marriage was barren no heir crassus as his cousin and patron will inherit liciniuss debts and possessions and gelina she now becomes crassuss dependent from the way you speak faustus fabius it seems that crassus owns the whole world i sometimes think he does or will he said raising an eyebrow v there was a loud booming at the door a slave hurried to answer it the door swung ponderously open illuminating the dim hallway with a wedge of muted sunlight that framed a stocky broadshouldered silhouette in the flowing red cape of a military officer marcus mummius marched towards us through the little garden trampling on a bed of herbs and banging his elbow against the delicate faun he stopped before the body and scowled at the sight of the exposed wound youve already seen it then he said reaching out to replace the camouflage of ivy and making a mess of it poor lucius licinius i suppose fabius has explained everything to you not at all i said good because its not his job to brief you i wouldnt have thought he could keep his lips sealed around a stranger but perhaps well make a soldier of him yet mummius smiled broadly fabius gave him a withering look you seem to be in high spirits i raced my men all the way up from misenum a swift ride to loosen the joints after a few days at sea that and the air of the cup should put any man in high spirits still you might lower your voice just a little in deference to the dead mummiuss smile disappeared in his beard sorry he muttered and returned to the fountain to dab at the water and touch his moistened fingers to his bowed forehead he looked uneasily at the body and then at each of us waiting for any notice of his impiety to the shade of lucius licinius to pass perhaps we should call on gelina he finally said without me fabius said i have business to attend to in puteoli and not much time if im to get there and back before sundown and where is crassus mummius called after him in puteoli as well on business of his own he left this morning with word that gelina should not expect him back before dinner this evening the door opened for him pulled by an invisible slave in the shadows so that it seemed to open by magic at his approach he stepped into the light and disappeared what a prig mummius muttered under his breath and for all his highflown attitude they say his family could barely afford to buy him a decent tutor good blood but one of his ancestors emptied the family coffers and no one ever filled them up again crassus took him on as a lieutenant only as a favour to fabiuss father he hasnt turned out to have much talent as a military man either i could name a few plebeian families whove made more of a mark in the last hundred years or so he smiled a bit smugly then called to a little slave boy who was crossing the atrium you there meto go and find your mistress and tell her ive arrived with her guest from rome as soon as weve refreshed ourselves in the baths we shall call on her is that necessary i asked after the insane rush to get me here do you really think we should spend time in a tub of water nonsense you cant meet gelina smelling like a sea horse he laughed at his own joke and put a hand on my shoulder to lead me away from the corpse besides taking the waters is the first thing anyone does when he arrives in baiae its like praying to neptune before setting out to sea the waters here are alive you know homage must be paid it seemed that the relaxing airs of the cup could loosen even mummiuss staid and stodgy discipline i put my arm around ecos shoulders and followed our host shaking my head in wonder what mummius had casually referred to as the baths was in fact an impressive installation within the house that seemed to have been built over a natural terrace on the side of the hill facing the bay a great coffered dome lacquered with gold paint arched over the space pierced by a round hole at the summit that admitted a beam of pure white light beneath this was a round pool with concentric steps leading into its depths its surface obscured by roiling masses of sulphurous steam an archway on the eastern side opened onto a terrace furnished with tables and chairs with a view of the bay a series of doors around the pool defined a semicircular arcade the doors were of wood painted dark red the handles were of gold in the shape of fish with their heads and tails attached to the wood the first door led into a heated changing room the other rooms so mummius explained as we shed our tunics contained pools of various sizes and shapes filled with water of various temperatures built by the famous sergius orata himself mummius boasted youve heard of him no the most famous puteolian of all the man who made baiae what it is today he started the oyster farms on lake lucrinus that earned him his first fortune then he turned out to be a master engineer at building pools and fish ponds and villa owners all around the cup showered him with commissions this house contained a modest bath when crassus acquired the estate with crassuss permission not to mention crassuss money lucius licinius added an upper storey here a new wing there and had the baths completely rebuilt employing sergius orata himself to draw up and execute the plans id prefer a little grotto in the woods or a common city pool myself this kind of luxury is rather absurd isnt it impressive but excessive as the philosophers say mummius stepped up to a brass hook cast as the heads of cerberus and mounted in the wall he hooked his shoes over two of the heads and hung his belt in the open jaws of the third he pulled the heavy chain mail over his head and set about unbuckling leather straps but you have to admire such feats of plumbing theres a natural hot spring that comes out of the earth at just this spot thats why the first owner chose to build here that and the view when orata rebuilt he designed the pipes so that some of the pools are piping hot while others are mixed with cool water from a different spring up the hill you can pass from the coolest to the hottest and back again in winter some of the rooms in the house are even heated by water from the hot spring piped under the floors this changing room for example is kept warm all year long most impressive i agreed pulling my undertunic over my head i started to place it in one of the coffers in the wall but mummius intervened he called to an old stooped slave who stood at a discreet distance across the room here take these and have them washed he said indicating my things and ecos and pulling his own tunic over his shoulders bring back something suitable for an audience with your mistress the slave gathered up the garments and studied us for a moment estimating our sizes then slunk from the room naked marcus mummius looked something like a bear with big shoulders a broad middle and dense swirls of black hair all over his body except where he was marked by scars eco seemed particularly intrigued by a long slash that ran across his left pectoral like a cleared furrow in a forest battle of the colline gate mummius said proudly looking down and pointing to the scar crassuss proudest moment and mine that was the day we retook rome for sulla the dictator never forgot what we did for him i was wounded early in the day but fortunately it was on the left side which allowed me to go on using my sword arm he mimed the action bolting forward and swinging his right arm causing the rather stout sword between his legs to swing heavily back and forth as well in the pitch of battle i hardly noticed the wound just a dull burning it wasnt until late that night when i went to deliver a message to crassus that i passed clear out they say i was as white as marble and didnt wake up for two days oh but that was over ten years ago i was just a boy really couldnt have been that much older than you he said punching eco on the shoulder eco smiled back at him crookedly and curiously examined mummius for more scars of which there was no shortage tiny nicks and plugs were scattered all over his limbs and torso like badges easily discernible where they interrupted the general hairiness of his flesh he gathered a towel about his waist and gestured for us to do likewise then led us from the changing room back into the great domed vault with the circular pool the day was beginning to cool and the steam rose in great clouds from the water hissing and smelling strongly of sulphur apollonius mummius smiled broadly and strode to the far side of the pool where a young slave in a green tunic stood at the waters edge obscured by the mist as we drew closer i was impressed by the slaves extraordinary beauty his hair was thick and almost blueblack the colour of the sky on a moonless night his eyes were a vibrant blue his forehead nose cheeks and chin were perfectly smooth and followed the serene proportions from which the greeks defined perfection his full bowshaped lips seemed to hover on the edge of a smile he was not tall but beneath the loose folds of his tunic he clearly had an athletes physique apollonius mummius said again he looked back at me over his shoulder i shall begin with the hottest pool he announced pointing at a door across the way followed by a vigorous massage from apollonius and you i think ill test these waters first i said dipping my foot into the main pool and quickly drawing it back or perhaps one a little less scalding try that one its the coolest said mummius indicating a chamber next to the changing room he strode away with his hand on the slaves shoulder humming a boisterous marching tune we sweated and scraped ourselves clean with ivory strigils we immersed ourselves in one pool and then in another going from cool to hot and back again and when we were done with our ablutions marcus mummius rejoined us in the heated dressing room where fresh undergarments and tunics had been laid out for us mine was of dark blue wool with a simple black border befitting a guest in a household in mourning the old slave had a sharp eye it was a perfect fit not even tight across my shoulders as i often find borrowed garments to be mummius dressed in the plain but welltailored black tunic he had worn on the night he summoned me eco was less pleased with his costume the slave apparently thinking him younger than he was or else too goodlooking to be seen barelimbed about the house had brought him a longsleeved blue tunic that reached to his knees it was so modest that it would have been more suitable for a boy or girl of thirteen i told eco he should be flattered if the old slave found him so dazzling that he should hide himself mummius laughed eco blushed and would have none of it he refused to dress until the slave brought him a tunic that matched mine it was not quite as good a fit but eco made do by tightening the black woollen belt about his waist and seemed happy to be dressed in a more manly garment that showed his arms and legs mummius guided us down long hallways where slaves bowed their heads and stepped meekly out of the way down one flight of stairs arid up another through rooms decorated with exquisite statues and sumptuous wall paintings across gardens breathing the last sweet breath of summer at last we came to a semicircular room at the northern end of the house set above a crag of rock overlooking the bay a slave girl announced us and then departed the room was shaped like an amphitheatre where the stage would have been steps led up to a colonnaded gallery it opened onto a spectacular vista of sparkling water below and the port of puteoli in the distance and far away to the right an unimpeded view of mount vesuvius on the horizon and the towns of herculaneum and pompeii at its feet the interior of the room was so dark and the light from outside so dazzling that i could see the woman who reclined on the terrace only as a stark silhouette she sat with her legs extended and her back upright on a low divan beside a small table set with a ewer and cups she stared out at the bay and made no reaction as we entered she might have been another statue except that a gende breeze wafted through the colonnade and caused the hanging folds of her gown to sway in the air she turned towards us i could not yet distinguish her features but there was a warm smile in her voice marcus she said extending her right arm across her body in a gesture of welcome mummius stepped onto the terrace took her hand and bowed your guest has arrived so i see two of them in fact you must be gordianus the one they call the finder yes and this one my son called eco he does not speak but he hears she nodded and gestured for us to sit as my eyes adjusted to the light i began to make out the austere rather stark features of her face a strong jaw high cheekbones a high forehead softened by the lush blackness of her eyebrows and eyelashes and the softness of her grey eyes in deference to her widowhood her black hair touched with grey at the temples was not dressed or arranged but simply brushed back from her face from her neck to her ankles she was wrapped in a black stola loosely belted beneath her breasts and again at her waist her face was like the vista behind her more lofty than lovely animated and yet serenely detached she spoke in even measured tones and seemed to weigh each thought before she spoke it my name is gelina my father was gaius gelinus my mother was of the cornelii distantly related to the dictator sulla the gelinii came to rome long ago from inland campania in recent years many died in the civil wars fighting cinna and marius on behalf of sulla we are an old and proud family but neither wealthy nor particularly prolific there are not many of the gelinii left she paused to take a sip from the silver cup on the table beside her the wine was almost black it gave her lips a vivid magenta stain she gestured to the cups on the table which had already been filled for us having no dowry to offer she went on i was very lucky to marry a man like lucius licinius the marriage was our own choice not a family arrangement you must understand this was before sullas dictatorship during the wars times were cruel and the future was very uncertain our families were equally impoverished and unenthusiastic about the match but they acquiesced i am sorry to say that in twenty years of marriage we had no children nor was my husband as wealthy as you might think from the evidence of this house but in our way we prospered she began idly to rearrange the folds of the gown about her knee as if to signal a change of subject you must wonder how i know of you gordianus i learned of you from our mutual friend marcus tullius cicero he speaks of you highly does he he does i myself met cicero only last winter when lucius and i happened to be seated at the divan next to his at a dinner in rome he was a most charming man that is a word some people use in describing cicero i agreed i asked him about his career in the law courts men are always happy to talk about their careers said gelina usually i only half listen but something in his manner compelled me to pay attention they say he is a most compelling speaker oh he is most certainly surely youve heard him yourself speaking from the rostra in the forum often enough gelina narrowed her eyes in recollection as serene as the profile of vesuvius just above her head i found myself quite enthralled by his tale of sextus roscius a wealthy farmer accused of murdering his own father who called upon cicero for legal counsel when no one else in rome would come to his aid it was ciceros first murder case i understand it made his reputation cicero told me he was assisted by a man named gordianus called the finder you were absolutely invaluable to him as brave as an eagle and as stubborn as a mule he said did he yes well that was eight years ago i was still a young man and cicero was even younger since then he has ascended like a comet the most talkedabout advocate in rome quite a feat for a man from such an obscure family i understand that he has called upon your services a number of tunes roman blood robinson i nodded there was of course the matter of the woman of arretium only shortly after the trial of sextus roscius while sulla was still alive and various murder trials cases of extortion and property disagreements over the years not to mention a few private affairs concerning which i cannot mention names it must be very rewarding to work for such a man sometimes i wish i were mute like eco so that i would not have to bite my tongue i have fallen out and made up with cicero so many times i am weary of it is he an honest man or a crass opportunist a principled man of the people or an apologist for the rich nobility if he were clearly one thing or the other like most men i would know what to think of him instead he is the most exasperating man in rome his conceit and superior attitude no matter how well deserved do nothing to endear him to me neither does his propensity for telling only half the truth even when his purpose may be honourable cicero gives me a headache gelina sipped her wine when this matter arose and i asked myself on whom i could call someone trustworthy and discreet someone from beyond the cup a man who would be dogged in pursuit of the truth and unafraid brave as an eagle as cicero said and stubborn as a mule and clever above all clever gelina sighed and looked out at the water she seemed to be gathering strength you have seen the body of my husband yes he was murdered yes brutally murdered it happened five days ago on the nones of september although his body was not discovered until the next morning her serenity suddenly departed her voice quavered and she looked away mummius moved closer to her and took her hand strength he whispered to her gelina nodded and caught her breath she gripped his hand tightly then released him if i am to help you i said quietly i must know everything for a long moment gelina studied the view when she looked back at me her face had recomposed itself as if she were able to absorb the serene detachment of the panorama by gazing upon it her voice was steady and calm as she continued he was discovered as i said early the next morning discovered where by whom in the front atrium not far from where his body lies at this moment it was one of the slaves who found him meto the little boy who carries messages and wakes the other slaves to begin their morning duties it was still dark not a cock had crowed the boy said and the whole world seemed as still as death what was the exact disposition of the body perhaps we should summon this meto no i can tell you myself meto came to fetch me right away and nothing was touched before i arrived lucius lay on his back his eyes still open flat on his back yes and his arms and legs were they crumpled about his body was he clutching his head no his legs were straight and his arms were above his head like atlas holding up the world i suppose and the weapon that was used to kill him was it nearby it was never found no surely there was a stone with blood on it or a piece of metal if not in the house then perhaps in the courtyard no but there was a piece of cloth she shuddered mummius sat up in his chair this was apparently a detail that was new to him cloth i said a mans cloak soaked with blood it was found only yesterday not in the courtyard but about half a mile up the road that heads northwards toward cumae and puteoli one of the slaves going to market happened to see it among the brush and brought it to me was it your husbands cloak gelina frowned i dont know its hard to tell what it must have looked like you would hardly know it was a cloak at all without examining it all rumpled and stiff with blood you understand she took a deep breath its simple wool dyed a dark brown almost black it might have belonged to lucius he owned many cloaks it could be anyones surely not was it the cloak of a rich man or a slave was it new or old well made or tawdry gelina shrugged i cant say ill need to see it of course ask meto later i couldnt bear to look at it now i understand but tell me this was there much blood on the floor beneath the wound or was there little blood i think only a little yes i remember wondering how such a terrible wound could have bled so little then perhaps we can assume that the blood on this cloak came from lucius licinius what else can you tell me gelina paused for a long moment i could see she was faced with a disagreeable but unavoidable declaration on the morning that lucius was found dead there were two slaves missing from the household theyve been missing ever since but i cannot believe that either of them could possibly have murdered lucius who are these slaves their names are zeno and alexandros zeno is was my husbands accountant and secretary he wrote letters balanced accounts managed this and that he had been with lucius for almost six years ever since crassus began to favour us and our fortunes changed an educated greek slave quiet and softspoken very gende with a white beard and a frail body i had always hoped if we ever had a son that zeno could be his first tutor it is simply not conceivable that he could have murdered lucius the idea that he could murder anyone is preposterous and the other slave a young thracian called alexandros we bought him four months ago at the market in puteoli to work in the stables he has a marvellous way with horses he could read and do simple sums as well zeno used him sometimes in my husbands library to add figures or copy letters alexandros is very quick to learn very clever he never showed any signs of discontent on the contrary it seemed to me that he was one of the happiest slaves in the household i cant believe that he murdered lucius and yet both these slaves disappeared on the night your husband was murdered yes i cant explain it mummius who until then had been silent cleared his throat there is more to the story the most damning evidence of all gelina looked away then nodded in resignation she gestured for him to continue on the floor at luciuss feet someone used a knife to carve out six letters theyre crude and shallow hastily done but you can read them clearly enough what do they spell i asked the name of a famous village in greece said mummius grimly although someone as clever as you might presume that whoever did the scrawling simply didnt have the time to finish the job what village i dont understand mummius dipped his finger into his goblet and wrote the letters in bloodred wine on the marble table all straight lines and sharp points sparta yes i see i said a village in greece either that or a hurried interrupted homage to the king of runaway slaves the murderer of roman slave owners the escaped thracian gladiator spartacus vi that night no one heard anything saw anything no said gelina and yet if the name spartacus was left incomplete that would seem to indicate that whoever carved it was disturbed and fled very odd perhaps they simply panicked said mummius perhaps the next morning what else was discovered missing from the household besides the two slaves gelina thought for a moment then shook her head nothing nothing no coins no weapons knives from the kitchen i should think that escaping slaves would loot the house for silver and weapons unless as you say they were disturbed said mummius what about horses yes said gelina two horses were gone the next morning but in the confusion no one even noticed until they both came wandering back that afternoon without horses they couldnt have gone far i muttered gelina shook her head youre already assuming what everyone else assumes that zeno and alexandros murdered lucius and set out to join spartacus what else can i assume the head of the household is found murdered in the atrium of his home two slaves are missing having evidendy escaped on horseback and one of the slaves is a young thracian like spartacus so proud of his infamous countryman hes insolently carved the name at his dead masters feet you hardly need my skills to figure it out for yourself its a story thats been repeated all over italy with many variations in the past months what do you need me for as i told faustus fabius earlier today i dont track down escaped slaves i regret the absurd efforts that were squandered on my coming here but i cannot imagine what you want from me the truth said gelina desperately cicero said you have a nose for it like a boar for truffles ah now i understand why cicero has treated me so shabbily over the years im a menagerie not a man gelinas eyes flashed mummius scowled darkly and from the corner of my eye i saw eco give a twitch unseen beneath the table i gave his foot a tap with mine to let him know that all was under control he glanced at me and gave a conspiratorial sigh of relief i have been through many interviews with wealthy clients under many circumstances even those who most need and sincerely want my help are often maddeningly slow to come to the point i much prefer conferring with common merchants or simple shopkeepers men who will say right out what they want from you the rich seem to think i should surmise their needs without being told sometimes abruptness or a feigned bit of rudeness will speed them along you dont understand said gelina hopelessly no i do not what is it you want from me why did you have me brought here so mysteriously and in such an extravagant manner what is this strange game gelina the animation left her face like a pliable mask her serenity changed to simple resignation dulled by a bit too much red wine ive said all i can say i dont have the strength to explain it all to you but unless someone can uncover the truth she stopped short and bit her lip they will all die every one of them she whispered hoarsely the suffering the waste i cannot bear it what do you mean who will die the slaves said mummius every slave in the household i felt a sudden chill eco shuddered and i saw that he felt it as well even though the air was mild and calm explain marcus mummius he drew himself up stiffly like a commander briefing his lieutenant you know that marcus licinius crassus is the actual owner of this household so i gathered very well it so happens that on the night of the murder crassus and his retinue including fabius and myself had just come down from rome we were busy setting up camp on the plain beside lake lucrinus only a few miles up the road along with our recruits recruits soldiers many of them veterans who served under crassus in the civil wars how many soldiers six hundred a whole cohort mummius looked at me dubiously you might as well know certain events are transpiring in rome marcus crassus has begun to lobby for a special commission from the senate that will allow him to raise his own army and march against spartacus but thats the job of praetors and consuls elected officials the elected officials have failed disgracefully crassus has the military skill and the financial means to dispose of the rebels once and for all he came down from rome to muster recruits and to consolidate his political and financial support here on the cup when hes ready hell prod the senate in rome to vote him the special commission just what the republic needs i said another warlord with his own private army exactly what rome needs said mummius or would you rather have slaves marauding across the countryside and what does this have to do with the murder of crassuss cousin or with my being here ill tell you on the night that lucius licinius was killed we were camped at lake lucrinus the next morning crassus assembled his staff and we headed for baiae we arrived here at the villa only hours after lucius had been found dead crassus was outraged naturally i myself organized teams of men to search for the missing slaves in my absence the hunt has continued but the escaped slaves are still missing he sighed and now we come to the crux of the problem the funeral of lucius licinius will take place on the seventh day of mourning thats the day after tomorrow on the day after that crassus has decreed there will be funeral games with gladiators in keeping with ancient tradition that will be the ides of september the date of the full moon a propitious date for sacred games and after the gladiators have fought their matches i said suspecting what the answer would be every slave in this household will be publicly executed can you imagine murmured gelina even the old and the innocent all of them will be killed have you ever heard of such a law oh yes i said a very ancient and venerated law handed down by our forefathers if a slave kills his master all the slaves in the household must die such harsh measures keep slaves in their place and there are those who would argue that having seen another slave murder their master even the meekest slave is contaminated by the knowledge and can never be trusted again these days the application of the law is a matter of discretion the slaying of a master by a slave is a rare atrocity or was before spartacus faced with a choice of killing every slave in a household or punishing only the miscreants most heirs would choose to preserve their property crassus has a great reputation for greed why would he choose to sacrifice every slave on the estate he wants to make a point said mummius but it means the death of children and old women protested gelina let me explain it so that you will understand gordianus mummius looked like a glum commander addressing his troops before a dubious battle crassus has come to campania and the cup gathering support for his bid to be awarded the military command against spartacus the senates campaign has been one long disaster roman armies defeated generals humiliated and sent home in disgrace consuls forced out of office by public outrage the state left leaderless so much havoc wrought by a ragtag army of escaped criminals and slaves all of italy quakes with fear and outrage crassus is a fine commander he proved that under sulla with his wealth and the defeat of spartacus to his credit hes well on his way to the consulship while lesser men are fleeing from the job crassus sees the command as an opportunity the roman who stops spartacus will be a hero crassus intends to be that man because otherwise that man will be pompey mummius made a face probably half the senators in rome have run off to their villas to try to save their own property while the other half bite their nails and wait for pompey to return from spain praying the state can survive that long as if pompey were another alexander a qualified commander is all thats needed to put an end to spartacus crassus can do it in a matter of months if the senate will only give him the nod he can gather up the remnants of the surviving legions here in italy add to them his own private army raised largely from his clients here in the south and make himself the saviour of the republic overnight i looked out at the bay and vesuvius beyond i see thats why the murder of lucius licinius is more than just a tragedy its an incredible embarrassment thats what it is said mummius to have slaves murdering and running free from one of his own households even as hes asking the senate to hand him a sword to punish spartacus in the forum theyll laugh until they weep thats why he feels compelled to exact the sternest judgment possible to fell back on tradition and ancient law the harsher the better to turn an embarrassment into a political boon you mean exactly what might have been a disaster could turn into just the sort of propaganda victory he needs crassus soft on runaway slaves hardly the man slew a whole household of them down in baiae men women and children showed no mercy at all made a public spectacle of it a feast day just the sort of man we can trust to take on spartacus and his murderous rabble thats what people will say yes i see but zeno and alexandros are innocent said gelina wearily i know they are someone else must have murdered lucius none of the slaves should be punished yet crassus refuses to listen thank the gods for marcus mummius who understands together we convinced crassus to at least let me summon you from rome there was no other way to get you here in time except to send the fury crassus made a great show of his generosity in allowing me to use it he offered to pay for your services as well just to humour me i can ask no more favours of him no postponements we have so little time only three days until the funeral games and then how many slaves are there in all not counting zeno and alexandros i asked i lay awake last night counting them ninetynine there were a hundred and one counting zeno and alexandros so many for a villa there are vineyards to the north and south she said vaguely and of course the olive orchards the stables the boathouse do the slaves know i asked mummius looked at gelina who looked at me with her eyebrows raised high most of the slaves are being kept under guard in the annexe on the far side of the stables she said quietly crassus wont allow the field slaves to go out and hes let me have only the essential slaves here in the house theyre in custody they know that but no one has told them the whole truth certainly you must not tell them who knows what might transpire if the slaves suspected i nodded but i saw no point in secrecy except for young apollonius in the baths i had hardly glimpsed the face of a single slave in the household only a succession of bowed heads and averted eyes even if they had not been told somehow they knew we took our leave of gelina the interview had exhausted her as we left the semicircular room i glanced back to see her silhouette reaching for the ewer to replenish her cup with wine mummius led us back to the atrium and showed me where the letters sparta had been scrawled into the flagstones each letter was as tall as my finger as mummius had said they appeared to have been hastily made crudely scraped rather than chiselled i had stepped right over them without noticing when faustus fabius had first shown us into the house in the dim light of the hallway they were easily overlooked how strange the hallway and atrium suddenly seemed with the death masks of the ancestors staring from their niches the piping faun prancing in his fountain the dead man on his ivory bier and the name of the most dreaded and despised man in all of italy halfscrawled on the floor the light in the atrium was beginning to grow soft and hazy it would soon be time to light the lamps but there was still enough sunlight before dinner to ride out and see where the bloodied cloak had been found mummius summoned the boy meto who fetched the cloak and the slave who had found it and we rode out past the pylons onto the northern road the cloak was as nondescript as gelina had indicated a dark muddycoloured garment neither tattered nor new there was no decoration or embroidery to indicate whether it might be locally made or from far away the cloak of a rich man or a poor one the bloodstain covered a great deal of it not just in one place but spattered and smeared all about one corner appeared to have been cut away to eradicate an identifying insignia or seal the slave had found it along a secluded narrow section of road that clung to a steep cliff above the bay someone must have cast it from the cliffs edge trying to throw it into the water below the crumpled cloak had been caught on a scraggly tree that projected from the rocky hillside several feet below the road a man on foot or horseback could not have seen it without stepping to the edge of the cliff and peering over the slave mounted atop a high wagon had barely glimpsed it on his way to market and indeed had left it there until his return from puteoli when he took a closer look and realized that it might be important the fool says that he wasnt going to bother getting it because he could see it had blood on it said mummius under his breath he figured it was ruined and of no use to him then it occurred to him that the blood might have come from his master or from zeno or alexandros i said tell me who else knows that this cloak was found only the slave who found it gelina and the boy meto and now yourself eco and i good i think marcus mummius that there may be some cause for hope yes his eyes lit up for a hardened military man who could treat his galley slaves so harshly he seemed oddly eager to save the slaves of gelinas household i say this not because i have any solution but because things as they stand are more convoluted than they should be for instance though it has not been found it appears that the killer used a bludgeon of some sort to murder lucius licinius why when a knife was at hand a knife the killer must have used some sort of blade to scrape the letters and why was the body dragged into position instead of being left where it fell why do you think it was dragged at all because of the posture gelina described think legs straight arms above the head not likely to be the pose of a man who collapses to the ground after being struck in the head but exacdy the posture of a body that has been dragged feet first across a floor dragged from where and for what reason then there is the matter of this cloak yes there is no way of knowing whose blood is on it but for now and because there is so much blood we shall assume that it came from the dead man gelina told us that there was not much blood on the floor beneath the wound and yet lucius must have bled profusely it seems likely this cloak was used to absorb the blood and yet this garment could hardly have belonged to lucius himself having seen the extravagant sort of house he lived in i can hardly believe that he would choose such a drab garment no this is the very best cloak that a common man might own or the sort of common cloak that a rich man with pretensions to oldfashioned roman virtue might affect to wear or simply the sort of dark common cloak that a man or woman might choose so as to move about unseen at night an assassins cloak somehow this cloak must be incriminating otherwise why carry it away from the scene of the crime and why attempt to cast it into the sea and why cut away a corner of it if the escaped slaves did indeed kill lucius they were evidently bold enough to brag about it by inscribing the name of spartacus on the floor why would they bother to hide the cloak after so brazenly proclaiming their allegiance why wouldnt they leave it behind for all to look at in horror i think we must be very careful to see that no one else discovers this cloak has been found the true killer must continue to think that it was successfully cast into the water i shall take it and hide it among my own things eco who had been listening intently tugged on my tunic at his insistence i handed him the bloodstained cloak whereupon he pointed to the various patches of blood and mimed a series of motions with his open palm mummius looked on baffled what is he saying eco makes an excellent point see here where the blood is most concentrated roughly in a circle as if it had been placed under a gushing wound to catch the blood while elsewhere the blood is smeared in swathes about the width of a mans hand as if it had been used to wipe up blood perhaps from a floor eco pantomimed again lying backward and putting his hands behind his head then extending both arms as if dragging a heavy object all done so enthusiastically that i feared he might fall from his horse and what is all that about said mummius eco points out the possibility that the cloak was first placed under the dying mans head so as to catch the blood while his body was dragged across the floor then the murderer might have used the clean portion of the cloth to wipe up the spatters of blood from the room where the blows were actually delivered as well as what had been smeared on floor in transit mummius crossed his arms is he really that eloquent i scarcely do him justice so much for the cloak most disturbing of all is the fact that the two missing hones returned to the stable the next day surely zeno and alexandros would not have relinquished them willingly unless they obtained horses elsewhere mummius shook his head my men made inquiries no horses have been stolen in the area then zeno and alexandros would have been reduced to travelling on foot in an area as civilized as this with so much traffic on the roads so much suspicion and fear of escaped slaves among the populace and with your men actively searching it seems hardly possible that they could have escaped eco intersected one hand with the other in pantomime of a sail on the sea mummius looked puzzled for a moment then glowered of course we inquired among the ship owners none of the ferries to pompeii or herculaneum would have taken two runaway slaves and there have been no stolen vessels neither of them would have known the first thing about sailing a boat anyway then what possibilities remain i said mummius shrugged theyre still somewhere in the area hiding or else more likely they are both dead the light had begun to fade rapidly the cliff cast a long shadow onto the water i looked back towards the villa and above the trees could see only a few tiles of the rooftop and some plumes of smoke the evening fires were being stoked i turned my horse around tell me mummius who currently resides in the villa besides gelina only a handful of people this is the end of the holiday season in baiae there werent that many visitors this year even in the spring i was here myself in may along with crassus and fabius and a few others baiae seemed a shadow of itself between spartacus and the pirates everyone is afraid to leave rome yes but who is staying here now let me think gelina of course and dionysius her philosopher in residence calls himself a polymath writes plays and histories and pretends to make witty conversation but he puts me right to sleep then theres iaia the painter iaia a woman he nodded originally from cyzicus crassus says she was all the rage when he was a boy with paintings in the best houses in rome and all around the cup specialized in portraits mainly women never married but seems to have made quite a success on her own shes retired now and paints for pleasure together with a young assistant shes instructing theyre here doing some project as a favour for gelina painting an anteroom in the womens baths and who is iaias assistant olympias originally from neapolis across the bay a girl i asked a very beautiful girl mummius assured me at which ecos eyes lit up iaia treats her like a daughter they have their own small villa on the sea coast up in cumae but they often stay here for days at a time working in the mornings and keeping gelina company at night were they in the house on the night lucius was killed actually no they were up in cumae is that far not very an hour away on foot closer on horseback besides the philosopher and the painters are there any guests in the house mummius thought yes two and they were here on the night of the murder yes mummius said slowly but neither of them could possibly be suspected of murder even so very well the first is sergius orata i mentioned him to you before the builder of the baths in the south wing he comes from puteoli and has villas all around the cup but as often as not youll find him staying in other peoples houses thats the way they do it here the rich move about playing guest in each others villas gelina says he was here talking business with lucius when word came that crassus was on his way from rome and wanted to consult with them both orata decided to stay on so that the three of them could transact their business together in one place he was here on the night of the murder and is still here staying in a suite of rooms in the north wing and the other house guest metrobius up from his villa across the bay in pompeii metrobius the name sounds familiar famous from the stage once the bestloved female impersonator in rome a favourite of sullas thats how he got his villa back when sulla was dictator and was handing out the confiscated property of his enemies like party favours to his inner circle ah yes i did once see metrobius perform i never had the privilege mummius said with a sarcastic edge in his voice doing plautus or some creation of his own neither he was performing a rather lewd mock homage to sulla at a private party in the house of chrysogonus years ago and you were there mummius seemed sceptical that i could have moved in such rarefied and debauched circles i was an uninvited guest very uninvited but what is metrobius doing here hes a great friend of gelinas the two of them can carry on for hours trading local gossip or so im told between us i cant stand to spend more than a few minutes in a room with him you dislike metrobius i have my reasons but you dont suspect him of murder mummius snorted let me tell you something gordianus i have killed more than my share of men always honourably and in battle you understand but killing is killing ive killed with a sword ive killed with a bludgeon ive even killed with my bare hands i know something of what it takes to snuff out the life of another man believe me metrobius hasnt the mettle to have bashed in luciuss skull even if he did have a reason what about zeno or alexandros the two slaves it hardly seems likely but not impossible he shrugged so i said we know that these people were in the house on the night of the murder dionysius the resident polymath the puteolian businessman sergius orata and the retired actor metrobius iaia the painter and her assistant olympias are often here but not on that night so far as i know of those who were here each was alone and asleep in his or her own private bed or so they say none of them heard anything which is perfectly possible given the distance between rooms none of the slaves claims to have heard anything either which also seems plausible since they sleep in their own quarters out by the stables surely at least one slave has the duty to keep watch through the night i said yes but on the grounds not in the house hes supposed to make a circuit keeping one eye on the road in front of the house and another on the coast behind pirates have been known to attack private villas on the coast though never in baiae so far as i know when the slaves made their escape the watchman must have been at the back he saw nothing is there anyone you suspect any of the residents or guests in gelinas house who seem more likely to have killed lucius than the slaves in answer he only shrugged and scowled which makes me wonder mummius why youve expended so much of your own time and energy to help gelina prove that the slaves are innocent i have my reasons he said curdy thrusting out his jaw and staring straight ahead he spurred his horse to a gallop and raced on to the villa alone part two the jaws of hades vii dinner began at the twelfth hour of the day just after sundown in a modestly appointed room in the southeast corner of the upper floor windows opened onto views of puteoli to the east and vesuvius farther south a coterie of slaves unobtrusively hurried about the room and the adjoining hallways lighting braziers against the slight chill in the air and illuminating the richly coloured walls with an array of hanging lamps the air was windless empty of bird song or the noise of any other living thing the only sound from the world outside was the vague murmur of the sea like a distant sighing looking out of the southern window i saw a single star glimmering above vesuvius in a sky of darkest blue a sensation of hushed luxury descended upon the villa that special feeling of comfort and sumptuous privilege peculiar to the homes of the rich at twilight gelina already reclining on her divan welcomed her guests as they arrived separately or in pairs all dressed in sombre dark blue or black there were places for eleven people in all an awkward number for a dinner but gelina managed it by placing the company in a square with three divans on each of three sides and two on the last one for herself and another reserved for crassus the small tables before each divan were already set with cups of honeyed wine white and black olives and an appetizer of sea urchins in a cumin sauce the painter iaia and her protegee olympias along with the polymath dionysius sat opposite gelina marcus mummius faustus fabius and sergius orata sat to her right eco and i were to her left along with the actor metrobius gelina introduced us simply as gordianus of rome and his son with no further explanation from their expressions i gathered that gelinas guests already had some idea of my purpose in being there in their eyes i saw varying degrees of scepticism suspicion and disinterest iaia striking in her jetblack stola silver jewellery and voluminously coiffed magenta hair surely dyed had clearly been a great beauty in her day now she exuded that mellow selfconfident appeal of women who have lost their youth but kept their charm her high cheekbones were generously rouged her eyebrows shaved and pencilled while iaia gave me cool glances her young protegee a dazzling blonde staredat me brazenly as if my presence were some sort of affront olympias could afford to be careless with her beauty her undressed hair was like a mane of spun gold and silver in the lamplight her eyes an almost purple shade of blue that would have made the least trace of makeup had she bothered to use it look pale and tawdry on her perfect flesh her sleeveless dark blue stola was absolutely plain even plainer than the tunics eco and i wore having no embroidery or border she wore no jewellery i noticed traces of pigment on her fingers and a few dabs of paint near the bottom hem of her gown dionysius a gaunt greybeard with a supercilious expression gave me shiftyeyed glances between dabbing at his olives with the fingers of his left hand he was almost silent during the first part of the evening as if holding his words in reserve for later use he looked to me like a man with a secret but perhaps that was only due to the appearance of smug sagacity which he affected like so many other philosophers dionysiuss reserved sour countenance offered a striking contrast to that of the local businessman and engineer orata who shared the polymaths corner almost bald except for a fringe of orange hair like a victory wreath orata had the portly build of a man grown fat on his successes his plump bemused face seemed out of place amid the general gloom when he happened to look my way i could not tell whether he liked me at first sight or was craftily smiling to conceal some other reaction for the most part he seemed to take little notice of me at all as he busily ordered the table slaves assigned to his divan to slice the pits from his olives and fetch more cumin sauce the elderly actor metrobius who reclined at my right gave me a nod as i was introduced and then immediately turned his attention to gelina he reclined on his right side she on her left so that their heads were together they spoke to each other in hushed voices and occasionally metrobius would reach out and clasp her hand reassuringly his long flowing robe covered him from head to foot the finely spun linen appeared funereal black at first glance but upon closer inspection i saw it was actually a very dark purple he wore gold around his neck and wrists and a great jewelencrusted ring on his left hand which flashed in the light whenever he lifted his cup metrobius had been sullas great love it was said the dictators companion and friend throughout his life outlasting all of sullas many marriages and liaisons whatever physical allure he had possessed in youth was long gone but there was an assertive dignity in his great mane of white hair and a kind of robust beauty in the weathered wrinkles of his face i recalled the night ten years ago when i had seen him perform for sulla and remembered the spell cast by his presence even with his attentions directed toward gelina i could feel the charismatic power he exuded as palpable as the smell of myrrh and roses that spiced his clothing his every movement was accomplished with an unstudied grace and the low calm murmur of his voice had a soothing quality like the drumming of rain on a summer night or the soughing of wind in treetops except for eco and myself it seemed a typical dinnertime gathering for a baian villa a military man and a patrician a painter and her protegee a polymath and a builder an actor and their hostess the host was missing or more precisely laid to rest on an ivory bier down in the atrium but to take his place we would have the richest man in rome so far however marcus crassus had not deigned to appear given such a sparkling gathering the conversation was surprisingly desultory mummius and faustus quiedy discussed the days business and the provisions for crassuss camp on lake lucrinus iaia and olympias exchanged inaudible whispers the philosopher brooded over his food while the businessman relished each bite gelina and metrobius seemed oblivious of everything but each other at length the slave boy meto entered and whispered in gelinas ear she nodded and sent him off i fear that marcus crassus will not be joining us tonight she announced i had thought that the vague tension in the room was due to my presence or to the air of death in the house but in that instant the gathered household seemed to give a collective sigh of relief detained by his business in puteoli is he asked mummius through a mouthful of sea urchin yes he sends word that he will make provision for his own supper and ride back afterwards so we need not wait any longer she signalled to the slaves who cleared away the appetizers and served the main dishes a sweet citron ragout of ham and apples seafood dumplings spiced with lovage and pepper and fish fillets with leeks and coriander all served on silver platters along with a barley soup with cabbage and lentils that we sipped from tiny clay pots as the meal progressed the conversation grew more animated the principal subject was food death and impending disaster political ambition and the threat of spartacus were ignored in favour of the relative merits of hare and pork beef was debated and roundly declared inedible faustus fabius declared that cattle were useless except for their hides but the philosopher dionysius who spoke in a lecturing tone claimed that the barbarians of the north actually preferred the milk of cows to that of goats sergius orata seemed to be something of an expert on trading spices and other delicacies with the east once he had travelled as far as parthia investigating the potentials of the market and on the euphrates had been induced by good manners to drink a local beverage made of fermented barley which the parthians preferred to wine it was the exact colour of urine he laughed and tasted like it but how would you know are you in the habit of drinking urine asked olympias who demurely lowered her face so that a strand of blonde hair fell over one eye iaia looked at her sidelong suppressing a smile oratas bald pate blushed pink mummius laughed raucously better urine than beans exclaimed dionysius you know the advice of plato one must set forth for the realm of dreams each night with a pure spirit and what does that have to do with beans asked fabius surely you know the opinion of the pythagoreans beans produce great flatulence which induces a condition at war with a soul in search of truth really as if it were the soul and not the belly that gets filled with wind exclaimed metrobius who leaned towards me and lowered his voice these philosophers no idea is too absurd for them this one is certainly a windbag but i think it all comes out his mouth and not the other end gelina seemed immune to both wit and crudity and ate in silence picking restlessly at her food and calling for fresh wine in her cup more often than any of her guests metrobius began to enlighten me about the differences between roman and baian cuisine there is a greater variety of fresh seafood in the markets here of course and many maritime specialities unknown in rome but the distinctions are more subtle than that for instance any cook will tell you that the best cooking pots are made from a special clay found only in the vicinity of cumae in rome such pots are precious and hard to replace but here even the lowliest fisherman owns one and so we have all sorts of peasant dishes that are as sublime as they are simple this barley soup for instance then there are the famous baian green beans more tender and sweet than those grown anywhere else gelinas cook makes a dish with green beans coriander and chopped chives fit for a bacchanalia ah but the slaves have begun to clear away the main dishes which means the second course must be on its way slaves entered bearing silver trays that flashed in the lamplight bringing baked pears stuffed with cinnamon roasted chestnuts and cheese seasoned in fermented berry juice outside the sky darkened from deep blue to black spangled with bright stars gelina shivered and ordered the braziers to be brought nearer the leaping flames were reflected in the silver platters so that the delicacies on each table seemed to float upon pools of fire a pity marcus crassus is not here to enjoy such a feast said metrobius picking up a stuffed pear and breathing in its aroma of course with crassus here the discussion would have turned on nothing but politics politics politics mummius glowered at him about which some people know less than nothing a good political discussion might keep certain people quiet for a change he popped a chestnut into his mouth and smacked his lips the table manners of a barbarian metrobius muttered to me under his breath what did you say mummius bolted forward i said you have the able manner of an agrarian your family still farms do they not mummius sat back slowly looking sceptical perhaps we should discuss something we all have in common suggested metrobius what about art iaia and olympias create it dionysius contemplates it orata buys it is it true sergius that youve contracted to construct and decorate a new fish pond for one of the cornelii down in misenum true said sergius orata ah these villa owners on the cup and their love of a decorative fish pond how they cherish each and every bearded mullet ive heard of senators who give each fish a name and feed them by hand from infancy and when the mullets are grown they cannot bear to eat them gelina finally smiled oh stop metrobius no one is that silly oh yes they are i hear the cornelii insist on surrounding thennew pond with all sorts of pretty statues not for the enjoyment of their human guests but for the edification of their fish nonsense gelina giggled and drained her cup then held it up for a slave to refill it metrobius looked utterly serious of course the problem is that the mullets well i hate to pass on such vicious gossip but they say that the mullets of the cornelii are so stupid that they cant even tell the difference between a polyclitus and a polydorus you could switch the head of juno and venus and they wouldnt know imagine that amid the general laughter metrobius wagged his finger at orata so be careful sergius what kind of statuary you bring over for the corneliis new pond no need to spend a fortune on a mad mullet who wont appreciate the difference orata blushed amiably mummius looked apoplectic faustus fabius i noticed had one restraining hand on mummiuss thigh clutching hard enough to whiten his knuckles while with his left hand he raised his cup to his lips to hide his smile gelina was suddenly talkative if you wish to discuss art we should talk about iaias project downstairs in the anteroom to the womens baths its delightful from the floor to the ceiling on all four walls octopi and squid and dolphins all cavorting beneath the skylight it makes me feel so serene and protected as if i were at the bottom of the sea such shades of blue dark blue and pale azure and bluegreen seaweed i love blue dont you she said tipsily smiling at olympias such a lovely blue colour youre wearing tonight so lovely with your lovely blonde hair what talent you both have iaia pursed her lips thank you gelina but i think everyone here has already seen the work in progress no gelina said gordianus hasnt nor has his charming boy eco they must be shown everything do you understand we must conceal nothing from them nothing at all thats why theyre here to see to observe he has a sharp eye they say not the eye of a connoisseur i mean but the eye of a hunter or a finder thats what you call yourself isnt it perhaps tomorrow iaia you can show him your work and let him contemplate the wonder of your flying fish and terrible squids yes i dont see why not as long as there are no women in the womens baths no women bathing that is why not im sure gordianus appreciates art as much as any of us olympias cocked one eyebrow and looked at me coolly then at eco who fidgeted under her gaze iaia imperturbable smiled and nodded certainly gelina ill be happy to give gordianus a look at our work perhaps in the morning when the light is at its best but as long as were speaking of art i know that dionysius has a new play in progress and weve hardly heard a thing about it that because crassus always shuts him up metrobius whispered in my ear actually ive set aside my comedy for the time being dionysiuss thin lips compressed into a smile the events of the last few months and especially of the last few days have turned my thoughts to more serious matters i am engrossed in a new work a treatise with a timely subject an examination of previous slave revolts with some observations on how best to avoid such disruptions in the future previous revolts gelina said you mean such things happened before spartacus oh yes the first that we know of was about a hundred and twenty years ago after the war with hannibal romes victory resulted in a great capture of carthaginians who were held as hostages and prisoners of war the slaves of these carthaginians were captured as well and were sold as booty it happened that a large number of these hostages and slaves came to be concentrated in the town of setia near rome the hostages contrived a plot to free themselves and in this enterprise they embroiled their former slaves promising them their freedom if they should rise up against their new roman masters and help their former masters return to carthage gladiator games were to be held in a few days time at setia the plan was to rise up then and to slaughter the unsuspecting populace fortunately two of the slaves betrayed the conspiracy to the praetor in rome who gathered a force of two thousand men and rushed to setia the leaders of the conspiracy were arrested but there was a great flight of slaves from the town eventually they were all recaptured or slaughtered but not before spreading terror through the vicinity the two slaves who had wisely informed on their fellows were rewarded with twentyfive thousand pieces of bronze and given their freedom ah gelina who had been listening wideeyed nodded approvingly i like a story with a happy ending the only thing more boring than politics is history said metrobius with a yawn in times of great crisis such as we live in now it seems to me that dionysius would be doing the world a far greater service by producing a decent comedy instead of rehashing the dead past what on earth did a man like sulla ever find to talk about with a man like you muttered mummius metrobius looked at him balefully i might ask the same question about you and your please no unpleasantness after the meal insisted gelina it disturbs the digestion dionysius do go on how did you ever discover such a fascinating tale i have often given thanks to minerva and to the shade of herodotus for the magnificent library so assiduously collected by your late husband said dionysius delicately for a man such as myself to reside in a house full of knowledge is almost as great an inspiration as to reside in a house full of beauty here in this villa happily i have never had to choose between the two gelina smiled and there was a general murmur of approval at such a pretty compliment but to continue the aborted uprising at setia was the first instance i can find of a general revolt or attempted escape by a large organized body of slaves there followed a few other similar occurrences over the years in italy and elsewhere but i can find only scanty documentation of them and they are of no account compared to the two sicilian slave wars the first of which began about sixty years ago in the year of my birth in fact i often heard tales of it when i was growing up it seems that in those days the landowners of sicily first began to accumulate great wealth and to amass vast numbers of slaves their wealth made the sicilians arrogant the constant influx of slaves from captured provinces in africa and the east made them treat their slaves with little regard for a slave crippled by overwork or malnutrition was easily replaced indeed many landowners would send out slaves to work as shepherds without proper clothing or even food when those slaves complained of their nakedness and hunger their masters would tell them to steal clothes and food from travellers on the road for all its wealth sicily degenerated into a lawless and desperate place there was one landowner antigenes by name who was known to everyone for his excessive cruelty he was the first man on the island to brand his slaves for identification and the practice soon spread all over sicily slaves who came to him begging for food or clothing were beaten chained and put on humiliating display before being sent back to their tasks as naked and hungry as before this antigenes did have a favourite slave whom he delighted in both coddling and humiliating a syrian called eunus who fancied himself a wizard and wonderworker this eunus would tell of dreams in which the gods had spoken to him people always like to hear such stories even from a slave soon eunus began to see the gods or pretend that he did in broad daylight and to converse with them in strange tongues while others looked on in wonder he could also spit fire from his mouth fire gelina was aghast an old theatrical trick metrobius explained you bore holes into either end of a walnut or something similar stuff it with fuel light it and pop it into your mouth then blow flames and sparks any conjurer in the subura can do it ah but it was eunus who first brought the trick from syria said dionysius his master antigenes would display him at dinner parties where eunus would fall into his trance spit fire and afterwards reveal the future the more outlandish the tale the better it was received for instance he told antigenes and his guests that a syrian goddess had appeared to him promising that he a slave would become king of all sicily but that they should not fear him for he would have a very tolerant policy toward the slave owners antigenes guests found this highly amusing and rewarded eunus with delicacies from the table telling him to remember their kindness when he became king little did they realize the dark course of the future it came about that the slaves of antigenes decided to revolt against their master but first they consulted eunus asking him if the gods would favour their enterprise eunus told them that their revolt would be successful but only if they struck brutally and without hesitation the slaves about four hundred of them held a ceremony in an open field that night exchanging oaths and perforrning rites and sacrifices as eunus instructed they worked themselves into a murderous frenzy and then broke into the city killing free men raping women even slaughtering babies antigenes was captured stripped beaten and beheaded the slaves dressed eunus in rich garments and a crown of gold leaf and proclaimed him their king news of their rebellion spread like wildfire across the island inciting other slaves to revolt rival groups of rebel slaves rose up and it was hoped they would turn against one another instead they banded together taking into their army all sorts of bandits and outlaws word of their success spread beyond sicily and encouraged widespread unrest a hundred and fifty slaves conspired to revolt in rome more than a thousand rose up in athens and there were similar disturbances all over italy and greece all these were quickly suppressed but the situation in sicily deteriorated into utter chaos sicily was overwhelmed by rebelling slaves all proclaiming eunus their king the common folk in an access of hatred against the rich actually sided with the slaves for all its madness the revolt was conducted with a certain intelligence for while many a landowner was tortured and killed the slaves took thought for the future and avoided destroying harvests and property that would be useful to them how did it end asked gelina armies were sent from rome there was a series of battles all over sicily and for a time it seemed that the slaves were invincible until at last the roman governor publius rupilius managed to trap them in the city of tauromenium the siege continued until the insurgents were reduced to conditions of unspeakable hunger and finally cannibalism they began by eating their children then their women and at last each other oh and the wizard gelina whispered he escaped from tauromenium and hid himself in a cave until at last rupilius flushed him out just as the slaves had consumed one another so the king of the slaves was discovered halfeaten by worms yes just such worms as were said to have plagued the great sulla in his last years here on the cup before his death from apoplexy which demonstrates that these devouring worms like the lower grade of humans will take sustenance from any leader high or low eunus was dragged from his cave screaming and clawing at his own flesh and put in a dungeon at morgantina the wizard continued to see visions which became more and more horrible at the end he was raving at last the worms consumed him and so the first of the great slave revolts came to its miserable end there was a deep silence the faces of gelinas guests were impassive except for eco who sat wideeyed and young olympias who seemed to have a tear in her eye mummius fidgeted on his couch the silence was broken by the soft shuffling footsteps of a slave retreating towards the kitchens with an empty platter i looked about the room at the faces of the table slaves who stood rigidly at their posts behind the guests none of them would meet my eyes nor would they look at one another instead they stared at the floor you see said metrobius his voice sounding unnaturally loud after the stillness you have all the elements for a divine comedy right at your fingertips dionysius call it eunus of sicily and let me direct it for you metrobius really protested gelina im serious all you need to do is cast it with the standard roles let me see a bumbling sicilian landowner and his son who of course will be lovestruck by a neighbours daughter add to that the sons tutor a good slave who will be tempted to join in this slave revolt but will choose virtue instead and save his young master from the mob we can bring this eunus onto the stage for a few grotesque comedy turns spitting fire and babbling nonsense introduce the general rupilius as a bombastic braggart he mistakes the good slave the tutor for eunus and wants to crucify him at the last instant the young master saves his tutor from death and thus repays him for saving his own life the revolt is suppressed offstage and all ends with a happy song really plautus himself never came up with a better plot i believe youre halfserious said iaia shrewdly it all sounds a bit distasteful complained orata considering current circumstances oh dear you might be right admitted metrobius perhaps ive been away from the stage too long go on then dionysius i only hope your next account of past atrocities will be as amusing as that last one the philosopher cleared his throat i fear you will be disappointed metrobius since eunus there have been a number of slave revolts in sicily something about the island seems to encourage depravity among the rich and insurrection among the slaves the last and greatest of these revolts was centred in syracuse in the days when marius was consul thirtyfive years ago its scale was as great as the first uprising under eunus but i fear that the story is not nearly as colourful no firebreathing wizards said metrobius no said dionysius only thousands of dangerous slaves rampaging across the countryside raping and pillaging crowning false kings and defying the power of rome and in the end a general comes to crucify the ringleaders and put the rest in chains and law and order are restored so it shall always be said faustus fabius darkly as long as slaves are foolish enough to upset the natural order at either side of him orata and mummius nodded sagely in agreement enough of this gloominess said gelina abruptly lets move to another subject i think its time we had an amusement metrobius a recitation the actor shook his white head gelina did not press him then perhaps a song yes a song is what we need to lift everyones spirits meto meto meto fetch that boy who sings so divinely you know the one yes the handsome greek with the sweet smile and the black curls i saw a strange expression cross mummiuss face while we awaited the slaves arrival gelina drank a fresh cup of wine and insisted that we all follow her example only dionysius declined instead a slave brought him a frothy green concoction in a silver cup what in hercules name is that i asked olympia laughed dionysius drinks it twice a day before his midday meal and after his dinner and hes tried to convince the rest of us to do likewise an awfullooking potion isnt it but of course if orata can drink urine it wasnt urine it was fermented barley i only said it looked like urine dionysius laughed this contains nothing as exotic or should i say as common as urine he drank from the cup and then lowered it revealing greenstained lips nor is it a potion theres nothing magical about it its a simple puree of watercress and grape leaves together with my own blend of medicinal herbs rue for sharp eyes silphium for strong lungs garlic for stamina which explains said faustus fabius affably how dionysius can read for hours talk for days and never feel faint even if his audience does there was a round of laughter and then the young greek arrived carrying a lyre it was apollonius the slave who had attended marcus mummius in the baths i glanced at mummius he yawned and showed little interest but his yawn seemed too elaborate and his vacant gaze was uneasy the lamps were lowered casting the room in shadow gelina requested a song with a greek name a happy song she assured us and the boy began to play apollonius sang in a greek dialect of which i could apprehend only scattered words and phrases perhaps it was a shepherds song for i heard him sing of green fields and great mountains of fleecy clouds or perhaps it was a legend for i heard his golden voice shape the name of apollo and sing of sunlight on the shimmering waters of the cyclades like pebbles of lapis in a sea of gold he sang like the eyes of the goddess in the face of the moon perhaps it was a love song for i heard him sing of jetblack hair and a glance that pierced like arrows perhaps it was a song of loss for in each refrain he sang never again never again never again whatever else it was i would not have called it a happy song perhaps it was not the song that gelina had expected she listened with a sober intensity and slowly her expression became as despondent as when i had met her that afternoon there were no smiles among the guests even metrobius listened with a kind of reverence his eyes halfshut strangely for so sad a tune so soulfully sung there was only one tear in the room i watched it descend the grizzled cheek of marcus mummius a glistening track of crystal in the lamplight that quickly disappeared into his beard and was as quickly followed by another i looked at apollonius at his trembling lips parted to sing a perfect note full of all the heartbreak and hopelessness of the world i shivered my skin prickled and turned to gooseflesh not from the pathos of his song or from the sudden chill breath of the sea that blew into the room i realized that in three days he would be dead along with all the other slaves never to sing again across from me hidden by shadows mummius covered his face and silently wept viii our accommodations were generous a small room in the south wing with two sumptuously padded couches and a thick rug on the floor a door facing east opened onto a small terrace with a view of the dome above the baths eco complained that we couldnt see the bay i told him we were lucky that gelina hadnt put us in the stables he stripped down to his undertunic and tested his bed bouncing up and down on it until i slapped him on the forehead so what do you think eco how do we stand he stared for a moment at the ceiling above then swung his open palm flat against his nose yes im inclined to agree were up against a brick wall this time i suppose ill be paid no matter what but how much can the woman expect me to do in three days only two days really tomorrow and the funeral day then comes the game day and if crassus has his way the execution of the slaves only one day if you think about it because how much can we hope to accomplish on the funeral day so eco did you see any murderers at the meal eco indicated the long tresses of olympias the painters protegee you cant be serious he smiled and made his fingers into an arrow piercing his heart i laughed softly and pulled the dark tunic over my shoulders at least one of us will have pleasant dreams tonight i put out the lamps and sat for a long time on my bed with my bare feet on the rug i looked out of the window at the cold stars and the waxing moon beside the window there was a small trunk in which i had hidden the bloodstained tunic and had stored our things including the daggers we had brought from rome above the trunk a polished mirror was hung on the wall i rose and stepped toward the starkly moonlit reflection of my race i saw a man of thirtyeight years surprisingly healthy considering his many journeys and his dangerous occupation with broad shoulders and a wide middle and streaks of grey amid his black curls not a young man but not an old man either not a particularly handsome face but not an ugly one with a flat slightly hooked nose a broad jaw and staid brown eyes a very lucky man i thought not fawned over by fortune but not despised by her either a man with a house in rome steady work a beautiful woman to share his bed and run his household and a son to carry his name no matter that the house was a ramshackle affair handed down from his father or that his work was often disreputable and frequently dangerous or that the woman was a slave not a wife or that the son was not of his blood and stricken with muteness still a very lucky man all in all i thought of the slaves on the fury the vile stench of their bodies the haunted misery in their eyes the utter hopelessness of their desperation property of a man who would never see their faces or know their names who would not even know if they lived or died until a secretary handed him a requisition asking for more slaves to replace them i thought of the boy who had reminded me of eco the one the whipmaster had singled out for punishment and humiliation and the way he had looked at me with his pathetic smile as if i somehow had the power to help him as if merely by being a free man i was somehow like a god i was weary but sleep seemed far away i pulled up a chair from the corner and sat staring at my own face i thought of the young slave apollonius the strains of his song echoed through my head i remembered the philosophers tale of the wizardslave eunus who belched fire and roused his companions into a mad revolt at some point i must have begun to dream for i thought i could see eunus in the mirror beside me hissing wearing a crown of fire with little wisps of flame leaking from his nostrils and between his teeth over my other shoulder the face of lucius licinius loomed up one eye halfshut and matted with blood a corpse and yet able to speak in a vague murmur too low for me to understand he rapped on the floor as if in a code i shook my head perplexed and told him to speak up but instead he began to dribble blood from his lips some of it fell over my shoulder onto my lap i looked down to see a bloody cloak it writhed and hissed the thing was crawling with thousands of worms the same worms that had eaten a dictator and a slaveking i tried to cast the cloak aside but i could not move then there was a strong heavy hand on my shoulder not a dream but real i opened my eyes with a start in the mirror i saw the face of a man abruptly roused from a deep dream his jaw slack and his eyes heavy with sleep i blinked at the reflected glare of a lamp held aloft behind me in the mirror i saw a looming giant dressed like a soldier his face was smudged with dirt ugly and stupid looking like a mask in a comedy a bodyguard a trained killer i thought instandy recognizing the type it seemed cruelly unfair that someone in the household had already sent an assassin to murder me before i had even begun to make trouble did i wake you his voice was hoarse but surprisingly gentle i knocked and could have sworn i heard you answer so i came in with you sitting up in the chair like that i thought you must be awake he cocked an eyebrow at me i stared back at him dumbly no longer quite sure i was awake and wondering how he had stumbled into my dream what are you doing here i finally said the soldiers ugly face opened in an ingratiating smile marcus crassus requests your presence in the library downstairs if youre not too busy that is it took only a moment to slip into my sandals i began searching in the lamplight for a suitable tunic but the bodyguard told me to come as i was eco softly snored through the whole exchange the day had worn him out and his sleep was uncommonly deep a long straight hallway took us to the central atrium winding stairs led down to the open garden where the light of tiny lamps on the floor cast strange shadows across the corpse of lucius licinius the library was a short walk up a hallway into the north wing the guard indicated a door to our right as we passed and put a finger to his lips the lady gelina is asleep he explained a few steps farther on he pushed open a door on our left and ushered me inside gordianus of rome he announced a cloaked figure sat at a square table across the room his back to us another bodyguard stood nearby the figure turned a bit in his backless chair just enough to give me a glimpse of one eye then turned back to his business and gestured for both guards to leave the room after a long moment he stood tossed aside the simple cloak he wore a greek chlamys such as romans often adopt when they visit the cup and turned to greet me he wore a plain tunic of durable fabric and simple cut he looked slightly dishevelled as if he had been riding his smile was weary but not insincere so you are gordianus he said leaning back against the table which was strewn with documents i suppose you know who i am yes marcus crassus he was only slighd tly older than myself but considerably greyer not surprising considering the hardships and tragedies of his early life including his flight to spain after the suicide of his father and the assassination of his brother by antisullan forces i had seen him often in the forum delivering speeches or overseeing his interests at the markets always attended by a large coterie of secretaries and sycophants it was a little unnerving to see him on so intimate a scale his hair untidy his eyes tired his hands unwashed and stained from handling a rein he was quite human after all despite his fabulous wealth crassus crassus rich as croesus went the ditty and the popular imagination at rome pictured him as a man of excessive habits but those powerful enough to move in his circle painted a different image which was borne out by his unpretentious appearance crassuss craving for wealth was not for the luxuries that gold could buy but for the power it could harness its a wonder weve never met before he said in his smooth orators voice i know of you certainly there was that affair of the vestal virgins last year you played some part in saving catalinas hide i understand ive also heard cicero praise your work if in a somewhat backhanded way hortensius too i do recognize your face from the forum i suspect generally i dont hire free agents such as yourself i prefer to use men i own or to own the men you use you understand me exactly if i want say to build a new villa its much more efficient to purchase an educated slave or to educate a bright slave i already own rather than to hire whatever architect happens to be fashionable at some exorbitant rate i buy an architect rather than an architects services that way i can use him again and again at no extra cost some of the skills i offer are beyond the capacities of a slave i said yes i suppose they are for instance a slave could hardly have been invited to join gelinas dinner guests and to question them at will have you learned anything of value since you arrived as a matter of fact i have yes speak up after all im the man whos hired you i thought it was gelina who sent for me but it was my ship that brought you and its my purse that will pay your fee that makes me your employer still if you would permit i should prefer to keep my discoveries to myself for a time sometimes information is like the pressed juice of the grape it needs to ferment in a dark and quiet place away from probing eyes i see well i shall not press you frankly i think your presence here is a waste of my money and your time but gelina insisted and as it was her husband who was murdered i decided to indulge her youre not curious yourself about the murder of lucius licinius i understand he was your cousin and a steward of your property for many years crassus shrugged is there really any question at all about who killed him surely gelina has told you about the missing slaves and the letters scrawled at luciuss feet that such a thing should happen to one of my kinsmen in one of my own villas is outrageous it cannot be overlooked and yet there may be reasons to believe that the slaves are innocent of the crime what reasons ah i forgot your head is some sort of dark casket where the truth slowly ferments he smiled grimly metrobius could no doubt come up with more puns on the same theme but im too tired to make them ah these accounting ledgers are a scandal he turned away from me to study the scrolls laid out on the table apparently no longer interested in my reason for being there i had no idea lucius had become so careless with the slave zeno gone theres no making sense of these documents at all are you done with me marcus crassus he was absorbed in the ledgers and seemed not to hear me i looked about the room the floor was covered with a thick carpet with a geometric design in red and black the walls on the left and right were covered with shelves full of scrolls some of them stacked together and others neady stored in pigeonholes the wall opposite the door was pierced by two narrow windows that faced the courtyard in front of the house shuttered against the cold and covered by dark red draperies between the windows above the table where crassus laboured was a painting of gelina it was a portrait of rare distinction touched with life as the greeks say in the background loomed vesuvius with blue sky above and green sea below in the foreground the image of gelina seemed to radiate a sense of profound equanimity and grace the portraitist was evidendy quite proud of her work for in the lower righthand corner was printed iaia cyzicena she made the letter a with an eccentric flourish tilting the crossbar sharply downward towards the right on either side of the table stood squat pedestals supporting small bronze statues each about the height of a mans forearm the statue on the left i could not see for it was covered by crassuss carelessly discarded chlamys the one on the right was of hercules bearing a club across his shoulders naked except for a lionskin cloak with the lions head for hood and its paws clasped at his throat it was an odd choice for a library but the workmanship could not be faulted the tufts of the lions fur had been scrupulously modelled the texture of fur contrasted with the smooth muscularity of the demigods flesh lucius licinius had been as careless of his art as of his ledgers i thought for it appeared that the scalloped fur of the lions head had somehow begun to rust marcus crassus i began again he sighed and waved me aside without looking up yes go now i suppose ive made it clear that i have no enthusiasm for your project but i will support you in whatever you need go to fabius or mummius first if you cannot find satisfaction on some point come to me directly although i cant guarantee youll be able to find me i have a great deal of business to transact before i return to rome and not much time the important thing is that when this matter is done no man will be able to say that the truth was not sought or that justice did not prevail he at last turned his head only to give me a weary and insincere smile of dismissal i stepped into the hall and closed the door behind me the guard offered to show me the way to my room but i told him that i was quite awake i paused for a moment in the central atrium to look again at the corpse of lucius licinius more incense had been put out but the smell of decay like the odour of roses seemed to grow stronger at night i was halfway to my room before i turned abruptly back the guard was surprised and a little suspicious he insisted on entering the library first and consulted with crassus before allowing me to enter he stepped into the hall and shut the door leaving us alone once more crassus was still poring over the ledgers he now sat in his undertunic having stripped off his riding tunic and thrown it over the hercules in the few moments i had been gone one of the slaves had delivered a tray with a steaming cup from which he sipped the infusion of hot water and mint filled the room with its smell yes he cocked one eyebrow impatiently was there some point i neglected to discuss its a small thing marcus crassus perhaps im entirely mistaken i said as i lifted his tunic from the hercules the cloth was still warm from his body crassus looked at me darkly clearly he was not used to having his personal things touched by people he did not own a very interesting statue i remarked looking down on the hercules from above i suppose its a copy of an original i have in my villa at falerii lucius admired it once on a visit so i had one made for him how ironic then that it should have been used to murder him what i think were both sufficiently acquainted with the sight of blood to know it when we see it marcus crassus what do you make of this rusty substance trapped in the crevices of the lions fur he rose from his chair and peered down then picked up the statue with both hands and held it beneath a hanging lamp at length he set it down on the table and looked at me soberly you have very sharp eyes gordianus but it seems quite unlikely that such a cumbersome bludgeon should have been carried all the way down the hall to the atrium for the purpose of murdering my cousin lucius and then carried back again it was not the statue that was moved i said but the body crassus looked doubtful consider the posture of the corpse as it was found like that of a man who had been dragged certainly from this room to the atrium is not too far for a strong man to drag a body easier for two men he said and i saw he meant the missing slaves but where is the rest of the blood surely there must have been more on the statue and a dragged body would have left a trail not if a cloth was placed beneath the head and the same cloth was used to clean whatever blood was left behind was such a cloth found i hesitated marcus crassus forgive my presumption when i ask that you share this knowledge with no one else gelina mummius and two of the slaves already know yes such a cloth was found soaked with blood down the road where someone attempted to fling it into the sea he looked at me shrewdly this bloodstained cloth was one of the discoveries you mentioned earlier the secrets you prefer to withhold from me while the evidence ferments in your head yes i squatted down and looked for traces of blood on the floor a cloak would hardly have been adequate to clean blood from the dark carpet but in the dim light it was impossible to see any stains but why should the assassins have moved his body he picked up the statue with his left hand and fingered the encrusted blood with his right then set it on the table with a grimace you say assassins not assassin marcus crassus the slaves perhaps the body was moved and the name of spartacus carved precisely to implicate the slaves and distract us from the truth or perhaps the slaves moved his body to the most public part of the house precisely to make their point where all would be sure to see it and the name they carved to that i had no answer one doubt led to another it does seem unlikely that the killing could have occurred in this room without anyone hearing especially if it followed an argument or if lucius was able to make any noise at all gelina sleeps just across the hall surely the noise would have awakened her crassus smiled at me sardonically gelina need not figure in your calculations no gelina sleeps like the dead perhaps youve noticed her liberal consumption of wine its not a new habit dancing girls with cymbals could parade down the hallway and gelina wouldnt stir then the question must be why was lucius murdered here in his library no gordianus the question is the same as it always was where are the two escaped slaves that zeno his secretary should have murdered lucius here in the room where they often worked together is hardly surprising the young stableman alexandros may have been here with them i understand he could read and do figures and zeno used him sometimes as a helper perhaps it was this alexandros who committed the crime a stableman would have had the strength to drag lucius down the hall and a thracian would have had the gall to scrawl his countrymans name on the floor something interrupted him in the act and he fled before he could write the whole name but no one interrupted them the body wasnt discovered until morning crassus shrugged an owl hooted or a cat stirred a pebble or perhaps this thracian slave simply hadnt yet learned the letter c and was stumped he said facetiously rubbing his eyes with his forefinger and thumb forgive me gordianus but i think ive had enough for tonight even marcus mummius has gone to bed and we should do the same he picked up the hercules from the table and replaced it on its pedestal i suppose this is another of your secrets that needs fermenting i shall mention it only to morpheus in my dreams the lamp that illuminated the hallway had grown dim i stepped past gelinas door treading lightly despite crassuss assertion that nothing could wake her in the darkness an eerie sensation crept over me this was the very route by which luciuss lifeless or dying body had been dragged i glanced over my shoulder almost wishing that i had accepted the bodyguards offer to escort me back to my room in the moonlit atrium i paused for a long moment the place was still but not entirely quiet the fountain continued to splash the sound echoed in the welllike atrium and was certainly loud enough to cover the incidental noises made by a man moving with intentional stealth but would it have concealed the highpitched screeching of a knife carving letters on a hard flagstone the very idea of the noise set my teeth on edge from the corner of my eye i saw a strange shape like a white veil floating beside the funeral bier i started back my heart pounding and then realized it was only a plume of smoke from the incense captured for a moment in a beam of blue moonlight i shivered and blamed it on the clammy night air i ascended the stairway to the upper storey i must have turned down the wrong hallway and somehow lost my way tiny lamps lit the passages at intervals and windows let in shafts of moonlight but still i found myself confused i tried to determine the direction of the bay by listening and instead found myself hearing the faint gurgling of hot water through oratas muchesteemed pipes where they were invisibly laid beneath the floor and along the walls i passed a closed door and thought i heard faint laughter within the deep voice of marcus mummius i was almost certain and another softer voice replying i walked on and came to an open doorway from which came a steady raucous snoring i took a step inside squinting in the darkness and saw what appeared to be the bulbous profile of sergius orata reclining on a wide couch with a gauzy canopy i returned to the hall and pressed on until i came to the semicircular room where gelina had greeted us earlier gordianus the finder you call yourself i thought with disgust thanking the gods that no one was there to laugh at me i had come to the northern end of the house having turned in exactly the wrong direction after i ascended the stairway in the atrium i was about to turn back when i decided to step onto the terrace for a breath of air to clear my head beneath a waxing moon the bay was a vast expanse of silver scalloped with tiny black waves and circled by black mountains pierced here and there with a point of yellow light to indicate a distant lamp within a distant house the sky above was rent by a few ragged clouds aglow from the moon but otherwise was full of stars entranced by the view i almost failed to catch the tiny glimmer of a lamp on the shore below where the land steeply descended to meet the water gelina had mentioned a boathouse an outcropping of rock and the tops of tall trees obscured the view but almost directly below me i could see a bit of roof and what must have been a pier projecting into the water very small in the distance i could also see at intervals a tiny flash of flame coming and going i listened more closely and it seemed that each appearance of the lamp coincided with a soft splashing noise as if something were being quietly dropped into the water i looked around trying to locate a stairway and saw that a broad descending path began at one end of the terrace on which i stood i stepped carefully forward the path began as a paved ramp that doubled back on itself then narrowed to a steep stairway that joined with another flight of stairs descending from elsewhere in the villa the stairs narrowed into a trail paved with cobblestones that wound back and forth down the hillside beneath a canopy of high shrubs and trees i quickly lost sight of the villa above and for a while could not see the boathouse below at last i rounded a comer and saw below me the roof and beyond it the far end of the pier projecting into the water a lamp flashed on the pier there was a splash and the lamp as quickly disappeared in the same instant i felt my feet slip from beneath me and found myself skidding down the pathway setting loose a spray of gravel that rained like hail onto the roof of the boathouse below i sat stockstill in the silence that followed catching my breath and listening wishing i had brought my dagger the light did not reappear but i heard a sudden loud splash followed by silence then a noise in the underbrush below like the leaping of a frightened deer i scrambled up and trotted down the pathway until it ended between the foot of the path and the boathouse there was a deeply shadowed patch of almost impenetrable darkness overhung by trees and vines i stepped forward slowly listening to the magnified sound of my own footsteps on the grass and the gentle lapping of water against the pier beyond the circle of shadow the boathouse and the pier were illuminated by full moonlight the pier projected perhaps fifty feet into the water it had no rail but was studded along either side with mooring posts no boats were moored to it and the pier was deserted the boathouse was a simple square building with a single door that opened onto the pier the door stood open i stepped into the moonlight towards the open door i peered inside listening intently hearing nothing a window high up in the wall admitted enough light to show me the coils of rope that lay on the floor a few oars stacked beside the door and the obscure implements that were hung on the opposite wall deep shadows filled the corners of the room in the utter stillness i could hear my own breathing but no one elses i withdrew and stepped onto the pier i walked to the end where the disk of the moon seemed to hover on the water just beyond the pier the curving shore on either side was dotted with the lights of distant villas and far away across the great flat water the lamps of puteoli were like stars i looked over the side of the pier but there was nothing to see in the black water except the reflection of my own scowling face i turned back the blow seemed to come from nowhere like an invisible mallet swung from a black abyss it struck my forehead and sent me staggering backwards i felt no pain only a sudden overwhelming dizziness the invisible mallet swung out of the darkness again but this time i saw it a short stout oar i avoided the second blow by accident as much as by design a staggering man makes an uncertain target flashes of colour swam before my eyes but beyond the oar i glimpsed the dark hooded figure who swung it then i was in the water men who hire me sometimes ask if i can swim i usually tell them i can which is a lie i shouted i splashed i somehow stayed afloat and desperately reached for the pier even though the hooded figure waited there with the oar uplifted i reached for one of the mooring posts my fingers slipped on the green moss the oar swung down to strike my hand but somehow i caught it in my grasp i pulled hard more to lift myself out of the water than to pull him into it but the result was that my attacker lost his balance an instant later with a great splash he joined me in the black water he came up beside me struck me in the chest with his flailing elbow and reached for the pier i grabbed onto his cloak frantically trying to climb over him onto the pier together we thrashed and struggled salt stung my eyes i opened my mouth and sucked in a burning draught of saltwater i lashed out at him blindly i think he knew that if he struggled with me i would only kill us both he broke away and swam away from the pier towards the overgrown shore beyond the boathouse i clung to the slippery mooring post and watched him retreat like a ponderous sea monster weighted down by his drenched clothing his hooded head bobbed and retreated bobbed and retreated when he was safely far away i struggled onto the pier and lay gasping for breath he disappeared into the shadows beyond the boathouse i heard him climb out of the water slipping and splashing and then tearing through the underbrush the world was quiet again except for the noise of my own laboured breathing i stood up i touched my forehead and hissed at the stinging pain but i felt no blood i staggered forward my legs trembling but my head clear i should never have come to the boathouse by night alone and weaponless i should have brought eco with me and a lamp and a good sharp knife but it was too late for that i fished the oar from the water to use as a weaponand hurried to the foot of the pathway the way was hard and steep but i ran all the way to the top staring into every dark patch and swinging the oar at the invisible assassin who might be lurking there the trail became stairs the stairs became a ramp the ramp opened onto the terrace where at last i felt safe i paused for a long moment to catch my breath i began to feel the cold through my wet tunic i hurried through the darkened house shivering and still carrying the oar i came at last to my room i stepped inside and closed the door behind me eco was peacefully snoring i reached down and touched the soft shock of hair across his forehead feeling a sudden welling of tenderness for him and a longing to protect him but from whom and what most of all i felt cold and wet and so weary i could hardly take another step or think another thought i stripped off my sodden tunic and dried myself as best i could with a blanket then pulled back the coverlet on my bed and fell onto my back desperate for sleep something hard and sharp stabbed my back i jumped to my feet the nights surprises were not over i stared down and could only see a dark shape on the cushion i bolted naked from the room to fetch a lamp from the hall by its lurid glow i studied the thing that someone had left in my bed it was a figurine the size of my hand carved in porous black stone a grotesque creature with a hideous face its eyes were set with tiny shards of red glass that glinted in the light it was the sharp beaked nose that had stabbed me have you ever seen anything uglier i muttered eco made a noise in his throat and rolled towards the wall sound asleep like gelina he would have slept through a train of dancing girls with cymbals i set the little monster on the windowsill not knowing what else to do with it and too weary to think about it i set the lamp on a table and left it burning not because i trusted the lights protection but because i was too tired to put it out i fell into my bed and was almost instantly asleep just before morpheus claimed me i realized with a shiver why the thing in my bed had been put there friendly or not gift warning or curse it was an act of sorcery we had come to the region of the cup where the earth breathes sulphur and steam where the ancient inhabitants practised earth magic and the colonizing greeks brought new gods and oracles that knowledge unsettled my dreams and clouded my sleep but nothing not even dancing girls in the hallway could have kept me awake an instant longer ix i winced at a sharp pain in my head as if someone were poking me with a nettle and opened my eyes to see eco peering down at me pursing his lips thoughtfully he was reaching out to tap at a spot on my forehead just below the scalp i grunted and pushed his hand away he winced sympathetically and drew back shaking his head is it that bad i said swinging my feet onto the floor and leaning forward to look into the mirror even by the grey light of dawn the bump was quite evident a raised red knob that looked more painful than it felt eco held up my stilldamp tunic with one hand and the oar with the other he looked at me disapprovingly demanding an explanation i began with my interview with crassus the bloodstains on the statue of hercules the evidence that lucius licinius was killed in his library our employers determined disinterest i told him about the moving lamp at the boathouse the periodic splashing as of something being dropped into the water the steep descent the deserted pier and boathouse the oar swung against my head the struggle in the water eco shook his head at me angrily and stamped his foot yes eco i was a fool and a lucky one at that i should have fetched you out of bed to come with me instead of rushing down to investigate or better yet i should have brought belbo along to play bodyguard and left you in rome to look after bethesda that suggestion riled him even more i have no idea who struck me as for the boathouse and the pier there was nothing to be seen at least not by night how i hate the water i remembered the burning draught of saltwater in my throat the struggling and thrashing my hands were suddenly shaky and i had to struggle for breath ecos anger vanished and his arm was around me holding me right i caught my breath and patted his hand and if my adventure at the boathouse was not enough i came back to find this in my bed i stepped to the window and picked up the figurine the black porous stone seemed clammy to the touch i had kept waking up during the night to see it staring down at me from the windowsill its ugly face weirdly illuminated by the lamplight its red eyes shining at one point i actually thought i saw it moving undulating in a kind of dance but that was only a dream of course what does it remind you of eco shrugged ive seen something like it before it reminds me of an egyptian household god of pleasure bes they call him an ugly little fellow who brings bliss and frivolity into the house so hideous if you didnt know he was friendly you might be frightened of him a huge gaping mouth staring eyes a pointed nose but this isnt bes its an hermaphrodite for one thing see the tiny round breasts and the little penis moreover the workmanship is not egyptian it seems to have been made from local stone that soft porous black stuff one finds on the slopes of vesuvius not an easy medium to work in i imagine too crumbly so its hard to say whether the workmanship is crude or simply rushed who could have fashioned such a thing and why was it put in my bed the practice of sorcery is very popular here on the cup much more so than in rome theres a great deal of indigenous magic among those whose families have always lived here whose race predates the romans in these parts then the greeks settled here bringing their oracles with them even so this strikes me as a thing someone from the east might carve and more likely a woman than a man what do you think eco is one of the household slaves trying to cast a spell on me or could it be eco clapped and gestured toward the door behind me where the little slave boy meto stood waiting expectantly bearing a tray of bread and fruit i saw his eyes dart nervously about the room i hid the figurine from sight while i turned so that when i faced him i held it behind my back i smiled at him he smiled back then i produced the figurine and thrust it onto the tray he let out a little gasp youve seen this thing before i said accusingly no he whispered that might be literally true given the frantic way he averted his eyes but you know what it is and where it comes from he was silent biting his hp the tray trembled an apple pitched onto its side and rolled into a bunch of figs i took the tray from him and set it on the bed picked up the statuette and thrust it against his nose he peered at it crosseyed and then shut his eyes tightly well i pressed please if i tell you it may not work what speak clearly if i explain it to you the test may come to nothing do you hear that eco someone is testing me i wonder who and why meto quailed under my glare please i dont really understand it all myself its just something i happened to overhear overhear when last night here in the house yes i suppose you must overhear many things coming and going as you do sometimes but never on purpose and whom did you overhear last night please i looked at him for a long moment then stepped back and let the sternness fall from my face you understand why im here dont you meto he nodded i think so im here because you and many others are in very grave danger i want to help you if i can he looked at me sceptically if i could be sure of that he whispered in a very small voice be sure of it meto i think you know how great the danger is he was only a little boy far too young to be facing the prospect crassus had planned for him had he ever seen a man put to death was he old enough to really understand trust me meto tell me where this statue came from he stared at me for a long moment then looked uiinlnchingly at the grotesque in my hands i cant tell you that he finally said eco moved toward him in exasperation i blocked him with my arm but i can tell you yes meto that you must show the figurine to no one else and you must tell no one about it and yes he bit his lower hp when you leave this room dont take it with you leave it here but not on the table or the windowsill where then where i found it he looked relieved as if his honour were less compromised if i spoke the words instead of him yes only meto speak up only leave it opposite of how you found it facedown you mean yes and with its feet toward the wall he nodded then quickly looked at the statue he clapped his hand over his mouth and cringed look how it stares at me oh what have i done youve done the right thing i assured him placing the statue out of his sight here i have an errand for you return this oar to the boathouse now go and tell no one that we talked no one stop trembling people will notice youve done the right thing i said again closing the door behind him and then added i hope after a hurried breakfast we made our way to the library the slaves were up and about sweeping and carrying and spreading baking smells from the kitchens but no one else seemed to be stirring a few lamps still burned in the hallways and shadows lurked in the more remote corners but most of the house was suffused with a soft blue light we passed by a long window that faced eastwards the sun not yet risen behind vesuvius cast a halo of pale gold about the mountains shoulders it was the first hour of the day when most romans would be up and about the denizens of the cup keep a more leisurely schedule the library was unguarded and empty i opened the shutters to let in as much light as possible eco stepped to the right of the table and studied the dried residue of blood on the hercules statue to confirm what i had told him then shivered at the earlymorning chill that crept in through the windows from the gravelled courtyard outside he picked up the chlamys that crassus had draped over the other statue which turned out to be a centaur and wrapped it around his shoulders i wouldnt borrow that particular cloak if i were you eco im not sure how a man like crassus would react to people of our ilk handling his personal things eco only shrugged and walked slowly around the room gazing at the multitude of scrolls most of them were neatly rolled and inserted into long jackets of cloth or leather and identified by little tags it appeared that the more literary works intended for pleasure or instruction philosophical treatises quaint greek novels plays histories had been given red or green tags and were rather haphazardly catalogued heaped atop one another in tall narrow shelves documents relating to business transactions were more fastidiously arranged in individual pigeonholes and given blue or yellow tags all in all there were hundreds of scrolls filling two walls from floor to ceiling eco let out a low whistle yes quite impressive i agreed i dont think ive ever seen so many scrolls in one place not even in ciceros house but for now id rather you directed your eyes downward to the floor if ever a carpet was designed to hide a bloodstain it must be this one all dark red and black still if lucius bled on the floor and the assassin used only a cloak to wipe it up there should be some sign of the stain eco joined me in peering down at the geometric pattern the morning light grew stronger moment by moment but the longer we studied it the more baffling the dark pattern seemed to become together we crossed the carpet step by step eco eventually dropped to his hands and knees like a hound but to no avail if there had ever been a drop of blood on the carpet some god must have turned it to dust and blown it away the tile floor where it showed beyond the carpets edge was no more revealing i lifted the edge of the carpet and folded it back thinking it might have been moved to cover a bit of bloodstain but i found nothing perhaps lucius wasnt killed in this room after all i sighed he must have bled somewhere and theres nowhere to bleed except on the floor unless i stepped towards the table unless he was standing here where he naturally would be standing in his library in front of the table the blow was to the front of his head not the back so he must have been facing his assailant and the blow was on the right not the left so he must have been facing north with his left side toward the table and his right side exposed to strike the right temple headon the assailant must have used his left hand that could be very important eco anyone who picked up a heavy statue to use as a bludgeon would use the arm he favoured we assume the killer was lefthanded then lucius would have been knocked sidelong onto the table eco obligingly pitched himself onto the table amid the clutter of documents crassus had been studying the night before he fell facedown with one arm beneath him and the other outstretched in which case the blood might well have been spattered above the table onto the wall where it might as easily have been wiped away i see no blood there now unless it spattered even higher i climbed onto my knees on the table eco pushed himself up to join me in studying the painting of gelina encaustic on canvas set in a frame of black wood with motherofpearl inlay easy to wipe clean and encased in the wall had any blood landed on the painting itself i doubt the murderer would have dared to scrub the wax too vigorously for fear of damaging it if indeed he saw the blood among all these pigments amazing isnt it how many colours there are in a painting when you see it this close at this distance iaias signature is certainly large enough done in red but more likely cinnabar than blood the folds of gelinas stola are a mottled red and black no doubt she chose these carpets to match her gown in the painting red here black there and eco do you see it eco anxiously nodded dribbled across a patch of green background where no painter would have been so careless as to spill it was a spray of redblack drops the colour of dried blood eco peered closer and then began pointing out more drops on the background on the stola everywhere across the bottom of the painting even a smear across the first letter of iaias signature the more we looked the more we saw in the growing morning light the drops seemed to blossom before our eyes as if the painting itself wept blood eco made a face and i grimaced in agreement what a grisly blow must have been struck across the head of lucius licinius to have scattered so much gore i drew back from the painting repulsed ironic i whispered that lucius should have polluted with his own blood the painting of the wife he married for love and ended here a corpse prostrate before her image a jealous lover eco did someone intentionally murder him here in front of the painting it must have made quite a tableau the dead husband crumpled lifeless before the serene image of his wife but if someone intended it that way then why was the body moved and the spectre of spartacus invoked i stepped off the table followed by eco there must have been blood on the table easily wiped clean which means there must have been no documents lying here as there are now or else they would have been bloodied as well and impossible to clean blood will wipe off lacquered wood but not parchment or papyrus i wonder though here help me pull the table from the wall it was easier said than done the table was heavy too heavy perhaps for one man alone to lift it even with one of us at either end the job was awkward we knocked over the chair bunched the carpet and caused a loud screech as one table leg scraped across the tiled floor our reward was blood on both the wall and the back edge of the table trapped where no cloth could have reached it there were patches of a gummy redbrown residue luciuss blood had run across the table and pooled in the narrow space between table and wall leaving its trace on both eco wrinkled his nose more proof that lucius was murdered here if we needed it i said but what does that tell us it makes no sense that the missing slaves would have wiped up the blood especially if they were proud of the crime still it will take stronger proof than that to shake crassus from his intention here eco help me replace the table as it was i hear footsteps in the hall just as i was picking up the chair and eco was straightening the carpet an inquiring face peered around the corner meto just the one i wanted to see step inside and shut the door behind you he did as i ordered but not without hesitating are you sure we should be in this room he whispered meto your mistress made it clear that i should have access to any part of the house did she not i suppose but no one was ever allowed in this room without the masters permission no one not even the scrub maids only when the master would let them in and even then he usually wanted himself or zeno to be in the room but theres nothing here for a slave to pilfer no small coins no jewellery or trinkets even so once i snuck in just because i wanted to have a closer look at the horse horse ah the centaur statue yes and the master himself walked in on me he was angry in an instant and the master wasnt normally an angry man but his face turned all red and he shouted at me till i thought i would die from the pounding in my chest metos eyes opened wide at the memory he puffed out his cheeks and shook his head like a man trying to recover from a terrible dream he called in alexandros and ordered him to give me a beating right here normally it would have been clito who also works in the stables and likes to give beatings but i was lucky because clito was working in puteoli that day i had to bend over and touch the floor while alex gave me ten blows with a cane he only did it because the master made him he could have hit me a lot harder im sure but it still made me cry i see you like this alexandros the boys eyes sparkled of course everyone likes alex and what about zeno did you like him too he shrugged nobody liked zeno but not because hes cruel or a bully like clito hes haughty and speaks languages and thinks hes so much better than any of the other slaves and he farts a lot he sounds thoroughly disagreeable tell me on the night your master was killed was anyone up and about you perhaps or some other slave he shook his head youre sure no one heard anything saw anything everyones been talking about it of course but no one knows what happened the mistress told us the next day that if anyone knew anything he must go directly to master crassus or to mummius or fabius if anyone had seen or heard what happened they would tell im sure and among the slaves themselves there are no rumours no whispers nothing and if anyone had said anything at all even in secret im the one whos most likely to have overheard not that i eavesdrop i understand your duties take you all over the house from room to room dawn to dusk while the cooks and stablemen and cleaners stay in one place all day and gossip to each other hearing things and seeing things is nothing to be ashamed of meto i do it for a living when i first saw you i could tell right away that you are the very eyes and ears of this house he looked at me in wonderment and then cautiously smiled as if no one had ever perceived his true worth before tell me meto on that night might zeno have been in this room with your master its possible they often came here and worked together after dark sometimes very late especially if a ship had just arrived or was about to leave from puteoli or if master crassus was on his way and might alexandros have been here as well possibly but on that night you saw no one going in or out of this room heard nothing from the stables or the atrium i sleep in a little room with some of the others he said slowly over in the east wing of the house behind the stables usually im the last one in bed alex laughs and says hes never seen a boy who needed less sleep on any other night i might have been up and about i might have seen whatever it is you want to know but that night i was so tired from running so many errands and carrying so many messages all day his voice began to quaver im sorry i put my hands on his thin shoulders you have nothing to be sorry for meto but answer one more question last night were you up late wandering about the house he looked thoughtful yesterday was so busy with you and mummius arriving on the fury and the extra work for the dinner last night so you went to sleep early yes then you saw nothing unusual heard no one wandering in the hallways or going down the hillside to the boathouse he shrugged helplessly and bit his hp sad to disappoint me i looked at him gravely and nodded its all right i only thought you might know something i dont but here before you go i want you to see something i guided him with a hand on his shoulder until we stood beside the centaur statue look at it all you want touch it if youd like he looked at me for reassurance then reached out with trembling fingers and a glow in his eyes then abruptly pulled back and bit his hp no no its all right i said i wont let anyone punish you and i will not let marcus crassus destroy you i thought though i dared not speak aloud so rash a pledge fortune herself might hear and smite me for making promises even a god could not be sure of keeping x when i was a girl i would never have stooped to painting a fresco one painted in encaustic on panels of canvas or wood using an easel and never never in fresco on a wall so my mentor taught me wall painters are mere workmen he would say while an easel painter ah an easel painter is treated like the very hand of apollo easel painters receive all the glory and the gold make your reputation on the easel and they will flock to you like pigeons to the forum my thats a nasty bump on your forehead iaias appearance was very different from that of the night before at dinner gone were the jewellery and the elegant gown instead she was dressed in a shapeless longsleeved garment that reached to the floor it was made of coarse linen and spattered all over with dabs of colour her young assistant was similarly dressed and even more remarkably beautiful by the light of day together they looked like priestesses of some strange cult of women who wore their paints upon their clothing rather than their faces the skylight above filled the little circular anteroom with a cone of yellow light around which swirled a vortex of underwater blues and greens populated by silvery wisps of fish and weird monsters of the deep the figures were remarkably fluid and superbly shaded and the rendering of the water itself produced illusions of impossible depth eco and i together with arms outstretched could have reached from wall to wall but in places the murky depths appeared to recede forever had it not been for the jumble of scaffolding and drop cloths the scene might have been almost frighteningly real like a dream of death by drowning of course these days im long past scrambling for commissions iaia continued i made my fortune back in the good old days did you know that in my prime i was better paid than even sopolis its true every rich matron in rome wanted her portrait painted by the strange young lady from cyzicus now i paint what i want and when i want this project is just a favour for gelina one day we were leaving the baths feeling all fresh and relaxed and she complained about how plain this room was suddenly i had a vision offish fish fish everywhere fish flying above our heads and octopi coiling at our feet and dolphins darting through the seaweed what do you think astounding i said eco gazed about the room and shook out his hands as if he were sopping wet iaia laughed its almost finished now theres no real painting left to be done were at the stage of sealing the watercolours with an encaustic varnish which is why these slaves are helping theres no real skill to the job just smoothing on the varnish with a brush but i have to watch them to be sure nothings damaged olympias nudge that one over there on the top scaffold hes putting it on too thick the colours will never show through olympias looked down from above our heads and smiled i secretly pinched eco whose slackjawed stare was not in response to the artwork around us ah yes in the good old days i could never have taken on a project like this one iaia went on my mentor wouldnt have allowed it i can just imagine his reaction too vulgar hed have said too merely decorative painting histories or fables with a moral point is one thing but painting fish portraits are your strong point iaia and portraits of women at that no man can paint a woman half so well as you can but one look at these staring fish heads and no roman matron will ever allow you to paint her shed be looking for traces of satire in every brushstroke well thats what my old mentor would have said but now if i wish to paint fish by neptune ill paint fish i think theyre lovely she seemed quite enraptured by her own skill an immodesty perhaps forgivable in an artist in the final stages of an almostdone creation i can see why you became renowned for your portraits i said i saw your picture of gelina in the library her smile wavered yes i did that only a year ago gelina wanted it for a birthday present for lucius we spent weeks working on it out on her private terrace at the north end of the house in her room where lucius never went so it would be a surprise didnt he like it frankly no it was done especially to fit the wall above his table in the library well he made it quite plain that he didnt want it there if youve seen the room youve seen his taste those awful statues of hercules and chiron the painting above his table was even worse a horrible thing that purported to show the argonauts attacked by harpies such a hideous embarrassment i cant imagine how he dared to allow visitors in the room a really terrible painting done by some unknown hack in neapolis a mishmash of naked breasts and nailing claws and stiffly painted warriors brandishing swords words cannot exaggerate how awful it was am i not right olympias the girl looked down from her work and laughed it was a very bad painting iaia in the end lucius acquiesced and had the thing removed so that we could mount gelinas portrait into the wall but he was most ungracious gelina had ordered a rug to match and he complained endlessly about the expense she was in tears more than once thanks to that episode of course misery about money was an old story in this house what a failure lucius was what an impostor whats the point of living in a villa like this if you have to count every sesterce before you spend it there was a sudden tension in the room olympias no longer smiled one of the slaves knocked over a pot of varnish and cursed even the fish seemed to quiver with unease iaia lowered her voice lets step into the baths the rooms are all empty and the light at this time of day is quite delightful let the boy stay here and watch olympias work the plan of the womens baths mirrored that of the mens except for the scale which was considerably smaller across the open terrace the view was much the same beneath the rising sun the bay shone with thousands of tiny points of silver light we walked around the circular pool which billowed with steam in the crisp morning air beneath the high dome our hushed voices echoed strangely i thought that lucius and gelina were a happy couple i said does she seem happy to you her husband died a horrible death only days ago i hardly expect to find her smiling her mood now is little changed from before she was miserable then thanks to him and she is miserable now thanks again to him and his messy death she doesnt look miserable in the painting does the image lie the image captures her just as she was and why does she seem so happy and at peace in the portrait consider that it was posed for and painted in the one room in the house where lucius never set foot i was told they married for love so they did and you see what comes of that sort of match i knew gelina when she was a girl before she married her mother and i were about the same age and great friends when gelina married lucius it was hardly my place to criticize but i knew that only sorrow would come of it how could you be so sure was he such a wicked character she was silent for a long moment i dont claim to be a great judge of character gordianus at least not when it comes to men do you know what they called me in the good old days iaia cyzicena always virgin they called me and not without reason when it comes to men i have little experience and i claim no special insight im sure my judgment of a mans character is less reliable than most womens but judgment based on experience goes only so far there are other surer ways of foreseeing the future she gazed into the swirling mists above the water yes and what does the future hold for this house and its inhabitants something dark and dreadful no matter what she shivered but to answer your question no lucius was not wicked only weak a man of no vision no energy no ambition were it not for crassus he and gelina would have starved long ago a villa and a hundred slaves are far from starvation but lucius himself owned not a bit of it from what i gather his income was entirely consumed in running this palace and maintaining a facade of great wealth given his connection to crassus any other man would have made himself independently wealthy long before now not lucius he was content to amble along taking what was given him and asking for no more like a pampered dog begging for scraps from his masters table to be sure the same hand that lifted him up held him down crassus seemed determined that lucius should always be the cringing everthankful kinsman never an equal or a rival and crassus has ways of seeing that people stay in their places well gelina deserved better than that now shes completely at the mercy of crassus not even able to say whether her own household slaves should live or die and if that should come to pass iaia stared deeply into the mist and did not answer we circled the pool in silence no matter what their differences i think that gelina has suffered greatly from the death of her husband i said quietly she will suffer even more if crassus proceeds with this terrible scheme of his yes said iaia in a dull faraway voice and she will not be alone in her suffering surely if it was someone here in the house who murdered lucius that person cannot stand by and see so many people slaughtered in his stead not people she corrected slaves still and for slaves to die even ninetynine slaves for the benefit of a great and wealthy man is that not the roman way to that i had no answer i left her standing by the pool staring into its sulphurous depths in the anteroom eco stood on the scaffold holding a horsehair brush while olympias hovered behind him her hand laid gendy atop his to guide his strokes a single sweeping motion she was saying lay it on in a thin even coat really eco i called up to him i had no idea you had a gift for painting he gave a start olympias looked over her shoulder with a cheerful smile he has a very steady hand she said im sure he does but i think we will take our leave come eco he scrambled nimbly down looking flushed and slightly disoriented and glancing awkwardly over his shoulder as we stepped into the portico outside did you press your attentions on her eco or was it olympias who suggested that you join her on the scaffold eco indicated the latter ah it was she who stepped so close putting her arm around you he nodded dreamily then frowned at the way i pursed my lips i would not be entirely trusting of that young womans friendliness eco no dont be silly im not jealous of you theres something about the way she smiles that makes me uncomfortable a voice hailed us from behind and i turned to see metrobius and sergius orata each attended by a slave are you on your way to the baths too asked the businessman with a yawn that indicated he had just got out of bed yes i said why not while orata and eco relaxed in the hot pool i accepted an offer from metrobius to share his masseur we stripped and reclined side by side on pallets in the changing room the slave went back and forth between us kneading our shoulders and poking at our spines the slave was a tall wizened man with extraordinarily strong hands if i were rich i grunted i think i would have this done to me every day i am rich said metrobius and i do how did you ever get that awful bump on your head oh its nothing a doorway was shorter than i expected oh thats good yes there that spot below my shoulder these baths are quite wonderful arent they eco and i came here yesterday after we first arrived mummius wanted to show off the plumbing he had a massage from the boy who sang last night apollonius i think hes called but i doubt that apollonius could be half as skilful as your man i wouldnt know said metrobius cautiously lying on his side with his head propped on one hand and looking at me with sudden suspicion no youre such a frequent house guest i thought you might have taken the opportunity to use this apollonius yourself metrobius hummed and raised an eyebrow only mollio here massages me he was a gift from sulla yean ago knows every aching muscle and cracked bone in this tired old body a callow youth like apollonius would probably give me a sprain yes i suppose mummius can take that risk hes not exactly delicate tough as an ox by the looks of him and nearly as smart oh could you do that again mollio for some reason metrobius i dont believe you like marcus mummius im indifferent to him you detest him i confess here mollio attend to me gordianus has had enough for the moment i lay in a state of bliss as limp as pummelled dough i closed my eyes and saw visions of starfish and octopi attended by strange gasping noises it was metrobiuss turn to grunt and wheeze why does the grudge run so deep i asked i never liked mummius from the first moment i met him but there must have been some incident some offence oh very well he sighed this was ten years ago just after sulla was made dictator you remember that sulla set up the proscription lists and posted them in the forum offering rewards to whoever would bring him the heads of his enemies i remember it well it was an ugly process but unavoidable the republic had to be purged for sulla to restore order and put an end to years of civil war the opposition had to be eliminated otherwise the conflicts and vendettas would have gone on endlessly and what does this have to do with your feud with mummius the estates of sullas enemies were made property of the state and sold at public auction i need not tell you that the first people in line at these socalled public auctions were usually sullas close friends and associates how else could a mere actor like myself end up with a villa on the cup but there were others in line ahead of me including mummius yes crassus was much in favour then almost as important as pompey eventually he overstepped himself and embarrassed sulla you may remember a certain scandal involving an innocent man added to sullas lists just so crassus could obtain the poor mans property there was more than one such scandal yes but crassus was a roman of good birth a general the hero of the colline gate thought to be above such grubbiness even so sulla only slapped his wrists for that offence but before the scandal crassus came first in all things just behind pompey and crassuss men were to be pampered and coddled even above many of sullas oldest friends and supporters like yourself yes i take it mummius got the best of you in something and sulla took his side there was a certain property we both coveted real estate or a human a slave i see no you dont the boy had been the property of a certain senator in rome once i heard him sing at a dinner party he came from my own hometown in etruria he sang in the dialect i learned as a child to hear him made me weep when i learned that he was being sold in a lot with the rest of the household slaves i rushed down to the forum the auctioneer happened to be a friend of crassuss it turned out that mummius desired the boy as well and not for his singing the auctioneer ignored my bids and marcus mummius was awarded the entire lot of slaves for the price of a used tunic how smug he was when he passed by me to collect his receipt we exchanged threats i drew a knife the crowd was packed with crassuss men and i had to flee for my life while they jeered after me i went to sulla demanding justice but he refused to intervene mummius was too close to crassus he said and at that moment he could not afford to offend crassus so mummius bested you over a boy that wasnt the end of it it took him only two years to tire of the slave mummius decided to get rid of him but he refused to sell him to me purely out of spite by then sulla was dead and i had no influence at rome i wrote a letter to mummius and asked him as humbly as i could to let me buy the boy do you know what he did he passed the letter around at a dinner party and made a joke of it and then he passed the boy around he made sure i heard all about it and the boy mummius sold him to a slave trader bound for alexandria the boy disappeared forever mollio he snapped your hands are useless this morning patience master cooed the wizened slave your spine is as stiff as wood your shoulders are like rusty hinges the door opened a rush of cool air brought with it the high piping voice of sergius orata and more ducts run under this floor and along both of these walls he was saying you can see the vents that release the hot air spaced evenly apart eco followed him nodding without much enthusiasm orata was naked except for a very large towel wrapped around his middle clouds of steam rose from his plump pink flesh gordianus your son is an apt pupil a better listener ive never encountered i do believe the boy may have some talent for engineering really i glanced over the fat mans shoulder at eco who looked quite bored no doubt his thoughts were in a more briny milieu floating across the seascape of the womens anteroom with olympias ive always thought so myself sergius orata no doubt he finds it difficult to pose complicated questions but i seem to remember yesterday that he was most curious about how the waters were disposed of after circulating through the pools i told him i assumed some system of pipes led down to the bay but my explanation failed to satisfy him oh yes orata looked pleased eco stared at me perplexed then perceived the wink i gave him when oratas back was turned then i shall have to explain it to him in detail and leave nothing out come along young man orata disappeared through the door and eco trudged after him metrobius laughed then grunted as the slave mollio recommenced pinching and pounding his flesh sergius orata isnt quite the simple soul he pretends to be he said with a wry smile theres quite a head on those shoulders always calculating and counting his profits hes certainly rich enough and rumours allude to a weakness for gambling and dancing girls still in this house he must seem a paragon of virtue neither as greedy as crassus nor as wicked as mummius not by a long shot about crassus i know very little i confessed only what they say behind his back in the forum believe every word really im surprised he hasnt stolen the coin from the corpses mouth as for mummius the swine he seems an odd mix of a man to me ill grant you that theres harsh side to him i saw an example of it on the journey here for a drill he ordered the galley slaves driven to the maximum as frightening a spectacle as ive ever witnessed that sounds like mummius with his stupid military discipline discipline is a god he uses to excuse any act of wickedness no matter how vile just as crassus can justify any crime for the sake of acquisition theyre two faces of a coin opposites in many ways but essentially alike such criticism struck me as odd coming from a man who had been so closely allied with sulla but as the etruscans say love turns a blind eye to corruption while jealousy sees every vice and yet i said i think i glimpse in both of them a certain weakness a softness that shows through their armour mummiuss armour is of steel crassuss is of silver but why does any man cover himself with armour except to shield his vulnerability metrobius raised an eyebrow and looked at me shrewdly well gordianus of rome you may be more perceptive than i thought what are these weaknesses evinced by crassus and his lieutenant i shrugged i dont yet know enough about either of them to say metrobius nodded search and you may find finder but enough about those two he rolled over and allowed the slave to stretch his arms above his head lets change the subject perhaps you could tell me something about lucius and gelina i understand that you and gelina are very close friends we are and lucius didnt you just come from viewing iaias painted room yes then you must have seen his portrait oh the jellyfish just above the door what oh i see youre joking im not have a good look at it the next chance you get the body is that of a jellyfish but the face is quite unmistakably lucius its in the eyes a brilliant piece of satire all the more satisfying because lucius himself would never have got the joke it elevates the whole mural to the level of high art iaia was once called the finest portraitist in rome and for good reason then lucius was a jellyfish he snorted a more useless man i never met a mere footrest for crassus though a footrest might have had more personality hes better off dead than alive yet gelina loved him did she yes i suppose she did love turns a blind eye as the etruscans say i was just thinking of that proverb myself but i suppose gelina is by nature an emotional woman she certainly seems distraught about the fate of her slaves he shrugged if crassus insists on killing them its a stupid waste but im sure hell give her others crassus owns more slaves than there are fish in the sea it impresses me that gelina was able to convince crassus to send a ship for me gelina metrobius smiled oddly yes it was gelina who first mentioned your name but by herself i doubt that she could have talked crassus into going to so much effort and expense on account of mere slaves what do you mean i thought you knew there is another who longs to see these slaves plucked from the jaws of death whom do you mean who journeyed all the way to rome just to fetch you marcus mummius a man who would drive a whole ship of slaves to the point of death on a mere whim why would he lift a finger to save gelinas slaves especially in defiance of crassuss will metrobius looked at me oddly i thought surely you knew when you spoke of mummius having a weakness he frowned you disappoint me finder i think perhaps you are as dense as i originally thought you were sitting beside me at dinner last night you saw as clearly as i did the tears that sprang from mummiuss eyes when the slave boy sang do you think he wept for cheap sentiment a man like mummius weeps only because his heart is breaking you mean the other day when crassus made up his mind that the slaves should die they argued and argued mummius was practically on his knees begging crassus to make an exception but crassus insists that they shall all be punished including the beautiful apollonius no matter how harmless or innocent the boy may be and no matter how much mummius desires him and so the day after the funeral marcus mummius will have to watch as his own men herd the boy into the arena and put him to death along with the rest of the household slaves i wonder if theyll behead them one by one surely not it would take all afternoon and even a jaded baian audience would start to fidget perhaps theyll have the gladiators do the dirty work trapping the slaves under nets and rushing at them with spears then mummius wishes to save them all simply for the sake of apollonius of course hes quite willing to make a fool of himself on the boys behalf it all began on his last visit here with crassus back in the spring mummius was instantly smitten like a stag struck with an arrow between the eyes during the summer he actually wrote the boy a letter from rome lucius intercepted it and was quite disgusted because the letter was pornographic pornography from mummius please im sure he has neither the imagination nor the literary skill on the contrary it was quite chaste and cautious rather like an epistle from plato to one of his students full of pious praise for apolloniuss spiritual wisdom and his transcendent beauty that sort of thing but lucius married for love i should think he might have sympathized it was the impropriety of it that scandalized lucius a citizen consorting with one of his own slaves is one thing it need never be known but a citizen writing letters to another mans slave is an embarrassment to everyone lucius complained to crassus who must have said something to mummius since there was never a second letter but mummius remained smitten he wanted to buy apollonius for himself but to do that required going through both lucius and crassus one or the other refused to sell perhaps lucius to spite mummius or perhaps crassus wanting to avoid further embarrassments from his lieutenant and now mummius finds himself awaiting the slaves destruction yes hes tried to hide his anguish from faustus fabius and the rest of crassuss retinue and most of all from the men under his command but everyone knows rumours spread very quickly in a small private army it was quite a spectacle to hear him prostrating himself before crassus in the library the other day scrambling to come up with the most ludicrous arguments to save apollonius this was behind closed doors i assume can i help it if i could hear every word through the windows that face the courtyard mummius pleaded for the boys life crassus invoked the stern majesty of roman law mummius argued for an exception crassus told him to stop playing the fool i believe he even called mummius unroman at one point the direst insult a stolid soldier like mummius can receive from his commander if you think gelina is distraught you should have heard mummius that day i cant imagine how he will react when a roman blade cuts into the tender young flesh of apollonius and the pretty slave begins to bleed metrobius slowly shut his eyes and a strange expression settled on his face youre smiling i whispered and why not mollio gives the finest massage on the cup i feel quite delicious and am ready for my bath metrobius stood and held his arms aloft while the slave wound the long towel around him i sat up and mopped my perspiring forehead do i only imagine it i said quietly or are there those in this house who actually look forward to seeing the slaves executed a roman seeks justice not vengeance metrobius did not answer but slowly turned and left the room a pity youre no better at swimming than i am i said to eco as we left the baths he gave me a pained look but did not dispute the fact our next task must be to have a look at the waters around the boathouse what was being dumped from the pier last night and why i looked down from the terrace outside the baths from where we stood i could see the boathouse and most of the pier there was no one about the coastline was dotted with craggy rocks and the water looked sufficiently deep to be daunting i wonder if that boy meto is a swimmer he probably grew up here on the cup arent all the local boys divers and swimmers even the slaves if we can find him quickly perhaps we can explore the boathouse and its environs before time for the midday meal we found him on the upper floor when he saw us he smiled and came running i began to speak but he seized my hand and tugged at it you must go back to your room he whispered i tried to make him explain but he only shook his head and repeated himself eco and i followed while he ran ahead the room was flooded with sunlight no one had come to tidy our beds yet but i sensed that someone had been in the room i looked sidelong at meto who peeked back at me from behind the door i pulled back the coverlet on my bed the ugly little figurine was gone in its place was a piece of parchment with a message in red letters consult the sibyl at cumae go quickly well eco this changes our plans no swimming this morning someone has arranged for us to receive a message directly from the gods eco looked at the scrap of parchment then handed it back to me he seemed not to notice as i had that wherever the letter a occurred it was given an eccentric flourish with the crossbar tilted sharply down to the right xi when i asked meto if he could show us the way to the sibyls cave or at least to cumae he stepped back shaking his head when i pressed him his face turned pale not me he whispered im afraid of the sibyl but i know who could show you yes olympias goes to cumae every day at about this time to fetch things from iaias house and to look after the place how convenient for us i said does a wagon take her or does olympias prefer the luxury of a litter oh no she rides a horse as well as any man shes probably in the stable now if you hurry come along eco i started to say but he was already out the door ahead of me i half expected to find olympias waiting for us but she seemed genuinely surprised when i called to her from the courtyard she was already setting out from the stable mounted on a small white horse she had changed her long shapeless painters gown for a short stola that allowed her to sit astride the horse the garment left her legs completely naked from the knees down eco pretended to study the horse with admiration while darting glances at the perfect curvature of the girls tawny calves pressed against the animals flanks olympias agreed to accompany us to cumae but only after some hesitation when i told her that we were seeking the sibyl she looked alarmed at first then sceptical her confusion surprised me i had thought she must have some part in this shadowy plan to lure me to cumae yet she seemed to resent the imposition she waited while eco and i borrowed horses from the stable keeper and then the three of us set out together the boy meto says you make this journey every day isnt it a long ride there and back i know a shortcut she said we passed between the bullheaded pylons and onto the public road then turned right as mummius and i had done the day before when the slave showed us where the bloody tunic had been found we quickly passed that place and proceeded north the hills on our left were covered with orchards of olive trees their branches heavy with an early crop there were no slaves to be seen after the orchards there came a vineyard then scattered patches of cultivated farmland then a patch of woodland the land all around the cup is remarkable for its fertility i said and for stranger things olympias remarked the road began to wind downwards through the trees i saw ahead what had to be lake lucrinus a long lagoon separated from the bay by a narrow stretch of beach thats where sergius orata made his fortune i said to eco farming oysters and selling them to the rich if only he were here with us im sure hed want to treat you to an extensive tour and lecture eco rolled his eyes and made an exaggerated shudder the prospect widened and ahead i was able to see the course of the road as it followed the strand between the lake and the bay and then curved away toward the east where it passed through a series of low hills before descending again into the town of puteoli i saw many docks there but as faustus fabius had said few big ships olympias looked over her shoulder if we were to take the road all the way wed pass lake lucrinus and go halfway to puteoli before turning back toward cumae but thats for wagons and litters and others who need a paved road this is the way i go she turned off the road onto a narrow path that cut through low bushes we passed through a stand of trees onto a bald ridge following a narrow track that looked like a goat path there were rolling hills on our left but on our right towards lake lucrinus the land fell steeply away far below us on the broad low plain surrounding the lake the private army of crassus was encamped tents had been pitched all about the shore little plumes of smoke rose from cooking fires mounted horsemen cantered on the plain throwing up clouds of dust soldiers drilled in marching formation or practised swordplay in groups of two the sound of swords banging shields echoed up from the valley along with a deep bellowing voice that was too indistinct to understand but impossible not to recognize marcus mummius was shouting instructions at a group of soldiers who stood in rigid formation nearby before the largest of the tents stood faustus fabius recognizable from his mane of red hair he was leaning over and speaking to crassus who sat in a backless folding chair he was dressed in full military regalia his silver accoutrements glinting in the sun his great red cape as vivid as a drop of blood on the dusty landscape they say hes getting ready to press for the command against spartacus said olympias gazing down at the spectacle with a moody look on her face the senate has its own armies of course but the ranks have been devastated by the defeats of the spring and summer so crassus is raising his own army fabius tells me there are six hundred men at lake lucrinus crassus has already raised five times that many at a camp outside rome and can raise many more once the senate approves crassus says no man can really call himself rich unless he can afford his own army while we watched a cymbal was beaten and the soldiers began to congregate for their midday meal slaves hurried to and fro among the boiling pots do you recognize the tunics those kitchen slaves are from gelinas house olympias said scurrying to feed the same men who in two days time will be cutting their throats eco touched my arm and pointed to the far side of the plain where bare earth gave way to woods a great swathe of felled trees had been cleared from the forest and a team of soldiers was building a temporary arena from the raw wood a deep bowl had been dug in the earth and stamped flat and around it the soldiers were constructing a high wall surrounded by tiers of seats i squinted and was barely able to make out the groups of helmeted men within the ring who practised mock combat with swords tridents and nets for the funeral games i muttered the gladiators must have already arrived thats where theyll fight on the day after tomorrow in honour of lucius licinius that must also be where yes said olympias where the slaves will be put to death her face became hard crassuss men shouldnt have used those trees they belong to the forest of lake avernus farther north no man owns them the avernine wood is a holy wood to have cut down even a few of them for any purpose is a great impiety to have cut down so many to satisfy his own ambitious schemes is a terrible act of hubris for marcus crassus no good will come of it youll see if you dont believe me ask the sibyl when you see her we continued in silence along the ridge then entered the forest again and began a gradual descent the woods became thicker the trees themselves changed character their leaves were no longer green but almost black great shaggy trees loomed all about fingering the air with convoluted branches the understorey grew dense with thorny bushes and hanging tufts of mossy lichen mushrooms sprouted underfoot the goat path disappeared and it seemed to me that olympias was finding her way by instinct through the woods a heavy silence enfolded us broken only by the footfall of our horses and the faraway cry of a strange bird you travel this route alone i said such a lonely place i should think you would feel unsafe what could harm me in these woods bandits brigands runaway slaves olympias looked straight ahead so that i could not see her face these woods are consecrated to the goddess diana these woods have been dianas for a thousand years before even the greeks came diana carries a great bow with which to guard her domain when she takes aim no beating heart can escape her arrow i feel no more fear here than if i were a doe or a hawk only the man who enters these woods with evil intent faces any danger outlaws know this in their hearts and do not enter do you feel fear gordianus a cloud obscured the sun the patches of sunlight faded and a grey chill spread through the forest a strange illusion gripped me night reigned within the woods the hidden sun was replaced by the moon and darkness seeped out of the hollow bowls of dying trees and from the deep shadows under fallen branches all was silent except for the footfall of the horses even that seemed muffled as if the moist earth swallowed the sound of each step an odd drowsiness descended on me not as if i fell asleep but as if i slowly wakened into a realm where all my senses were slightly askew do you feel fear gordianus i stared at the back of her head at the soft golden mane of her hair i imagined the strangest thing that if she were to turn suddenly i would see not her own beautiful face but a visage too terrible to look at a harsh grinning mask with cruel eyes the face of an angry goddess no i feel no fear i whispered hoarsely good then you have a right to be here and you will be safe she turned and it was only the harmless smiling face of olympias that looked back at me i sighed with relief the woods grew darker a heavy clinging mist spread through the forest the smell of sea spray mingled with the dank odours of rotting leaves and mouldering bark then another smell assaulted us the stench of boiling sulphur olympias pointed to a clearing on our right we rode onto a lip of bare rock above us loomed the tattered edge of a fog bank rolling in from the sea below us opened a great gulf of space a vast bowl of vapour swirled below ringed by dark brooding trees through the vapours i could barely discern the surface of a great roiling cesspit that bubbled and seethed and spat the jaws of hades i whispered olympias nodded some say that it was here that pluto pulled proserpina into the underworld they say that beneath this pool of sputtering sulphurous mud deep in the restless bowels of the earth there run a host of subterranean rivers that separate the realm of the living from the realm of the dead there is acheron the river of woe and cocytus the river of lamentation there is phlegethon the river of fire and lethe the river of forgetfulness together they converge into the great river styx across which the ferryman charon carries the spirits of the dead to the bleak wastelands of tartarus they say that plutos watchdog cerberus escapes his bonds every so often and flees to the upper world i spoke once to a farmer in cumae who had heard the monster in the avernine woods all three heads howling together under the light of the full moon on the other nights the dreaded lemures escape from lake avernus malicious spirits of the dead who haunt the woods and inhabit the bodies of wolves still pluto always draws them back by morning no one escapes his realm for long she turned her face from the ghastly vista below to glance at eco who stared back at her wideeyed strange isnt it she said to think that all this exists so near to the civility and comfort of baiae and its villas at gelinas house the world seems to be a place made of sunlight dancing on water and fresh salty air its easy to forget the gods who live under dank stones and the lemures that dwell beneath the sulphurous pits lake avernus was here before the romans before the greeks these woods were here and so were all the steaming fumaroles and the boiling pits filled with stench that circle the cup this is the place where the underworld comes closest to the world of the living all the beautiful houses and bright lights that ring the cup are like a mask a charade as insubstantial as the skin of a bubble beneath them the sulphur rumbles and boils as it has forever long after the pretty houses rot and the lights grow dim the belching jaws of hades will still be gaping open to receive the shades of the dead i looked at her in wonder bewildered that such words could come from the lips of a creature so young and full of life she met my eyes for an instant and smiled her cryptic smile then spun her horse around its not good to look too long at the face of avernus or to breath the fumes our course began gradually to descend at length we left the woods for a grassy landscape of low hills pierced by jagged white rocks the hills became more and more windswept and barren as we neared the sea the fog lifted and hung above our heads in tatters the rocks grew as big as houses and lay scattered about us like the broken and weathered bones of giants they took on fantastic shapes bristling with sharp edges and shot through with swirling tunnels and wormholes we passed through the maze of rocks for a time until we came to a hidden hollow set into a steep hillside like the crook of an elbow the narrow defile was strewn with tumbled rocks and trees weirdly sculpted by the wind this is where i leave you said olympias find a place to tie your hone and wait the priestess will come for you but where is the temple the priestess will take you to the temple but i thought there was a great temple to mark the site of the sibyls shrine olympias nodded you mean the temple that daedalus built when he came to earth on this spot after his long flight daedalus built it in honour of apollo and decorated it with panels all in hammered gold and covered it with a golden roof so they say in the village of cumae but the golden temple is only a legend or else the earth swallowed it up long ago that happens here sometimes the earth gapes open and devours whole houses nowadays the temple is in a hidden rocky place near the mouth of the sibyls cave dont worry the priestess will come you brought a token gift of gold or silver i brought the few coins i had with me in my room it will be enough now i leave you she tugged impatiently at the reins of her horse but wait how shall we find you again why must you find me at all there was an unpleasant edge in her voice i brought you here as you asked cant you find your own way back i looked at the maze of rocks the descending fog swirled overhead and a low wind moaned amid the stones i shrugged uncertainly very well she said when the sibyl is done with you ride on a short distance towards the sea over the crest of a grassy hill youll come upon the village of cumae iaias house is at the far end of the village one of the slaves will let you in if she paused uncertainly if im not there wait for me and where else would you be she rode away without answering and quickly vanished amid the boulders what vital business draws her to cumae every day i said to myself and why is she so eager to be rid of us well eco what do you think of this place eco clutched himself and shivered not from the cold i agree there is something here that sets my teeth on edge i looked at the maze of rocks all around us the wind moaned and whistled through the wormholes you cant see farther than a few feet in any direction thanks to all these jagged boulders a whole army could be hidden out of sight an assassin behind every rock we dismounted and led the horses deeper into the crook of the hill a bald band had been worn into a twisted branch showing where many others before us had tethered their horses i secured the beasts then felt eco tugging urgently at my sleeve yes what do you i stopped short from nowhere it seemed a figure passed between two nearby stones following the same path that olympias had taken the descending fog swallowed all noise of his horses footfalls so that the figure passed by as silently as a phantom he was visible for only an instant draped in a dark hooded cloak what do you make of that i whispered eco leaped to the tallest of the nearby rocks and scrambled atop it finding holds for his fingers amid the wormholes he peered into the middle distance for an instant his face lit up and then darkened again he waved to me but kept his eyes on the maze of rocks by way of signal he pinched his chin and drew his fingers away to a point a long beard i said eco nodded do you mean the rider is dionysius the philosopher he nodded again how peculiar can you still see him eco frowned and shook his head then he brightened again he pointed his finger as the arrow flies in an arc that ascended and then fell indicating something farther afield he made his sign for olympiass tresses you can see the girl he nodded yes then no as she passed from sight and does it seem that the philosopher follows her eco watched for a moment longer then looked down at me with an expression of grave concern and slowly nodded how odd how very odd if you can see no more come down eco watched for a moment longer then sat on the rock and pushed himself off landing with a grunt he hurried to the horses and indicated the knotted tethers ride after them dont be ridiculous theres no reason to assume that dionysius means her any harm perhaps he isnt following her at all eco put his hands on his hips and looked at me the way that bethesda so often does as if i were a foolish child very well ill admit its odd that he should pass by on the same obscure path only moments behind us unless he has some secret reason perhaps it was us he was following and not olympias in which case weve given him the slip eco was not satisfied he crossed his arms and fretted no i said firmly we are not going after them and no you are not going off on your own by now olympias is probably already in cumae besides i doubt that a young woman as strong and capable as olympias is in need of protection from an old greybeard like dionysius eco wrinkled his brow and kicked at a stone with his arms still crossed he began to walk toward the tall rock as if he meant to climb it again an instant later he froze and spun around as did i the voice was strange and unnerving gruff wheezing barely recognizable as that of a woman its owner wore a bloodred hooded cloak and stood with her hands joined within the voluminous sleeves so that no part of her body was visible from the deep shadow that hid her face the voice issued like the moaning of a phantom from the jaws of hades come back young man the girl is safe you on the other hand are an intruder here and in constant danger until the god sees your naked face and judges whether to blast you with lightning or open your ears to the voice of the sibyl both of you gather your courage and follow me now xii very long ago there was a king of the romans called tarquinius the proud one day a sorceress came up to rome from her cave at cumae and offered to tarquinius nine books of occult knowledge these books were made of palm leaves and were not bound as a scroll so that the pages could be put in any order this tarquinius found very strange they were also written in greek not latin but the sorceress claimed that the books foretold the entire future of rome those who studied them she said would comprehend all those strange phenomena by which the gods make known their will on earth as when geese are seen flying north in winter or water ignites into flame or cocks are heard crowing at noon tarquinius considered her offer but the sum of gold she demanded was too great he sent her away saying that king numa a hundred years before had established the priesthoods cults and rituals of the romans and these institutions had always sufficed to discern the will of the gods that night three balls of fire were seen hovering above the horizon the people were alarmed tarquinius called upon the priests to explain the phenomenon but to their great chagrin no explanation could be found the next day the sorceress visited tarquinius again saying she had six books of knowledge for sale she asked the same price she had asked for nine books the previous day tarquinius demanded to know what had become of the other three books and the witch said she had burned them during the night tarquinius insulted that the sorceress demanded for six books what he had refused to pay for nine sent her away that night three convoluted columns of smoke rose above the horizon blown by the wind and illuminated by the moon so that they took on a grotesque and foreboding aspect again the people were alarmed thinking it must be a sign from an angry god tarquinius summoned the priests again they were baffled the next day the sorceress came to visit the king again she had burned three more books the night before she said and now offered him the remaining three for the same price she had originally asked for all nine though it vexed him greatly tarquinius paid the woman the sum she demanded and so because tarquinius hesitated the sibylline books were received in only fragmentary fashion the future of rome could be discerned only imperfectly and the reading of auspices and auguries was not always precise tarquinius was both revered for obtaining the sacred texts and derided for not acquiring them all the sibyl of cumae gained a legendary reputation for her wisdom she was respected both as a great sorceress and a shrewd bargainer having obtained the price of nine books for only three the sibylline books became objects of awesome veneration they outlasted the kings of rome and became the most sacred property of the roman people the senate decreed that they should be kept in a stone chest deep underground in the temple of jupiter on the capitoline hill above the forum the books were consulted in times of great calamities or when inexplicable omens appeared those priests who were specially charged to study the books were constrained under penalty of death to keep their contents secret even from the senate one curious fact about the verses became commonly known however they were written in acrostic together the initial letters of each line spelled out the subject of each verse such cleverness as would have driven a mortal to distraction must have been childs play for the divine will because the books remained so mysterious very few persons know exactly what was lost when ten years ago in the final convulsions of the civil wars a great fire swept the capitoline and consumed the temple of jupiter penetrating the stone chest and reducing the sibylline books to ash sulla blamed his enemies for the fire his enemies blamed sulla in any case it was not an auspicious beginning for the dictators threeyear reign without the sibylline books to foretell it did rome have a future the senate sent special envoys all over greece and asia to search for sacred texts to replace the lost sibylline books officially this has been done to the full satisfaction of the priesthood and the senate for those respectful of divine will but sceptical of human institutions the opportunities for fraud and bamboozlement offered by such a scavenger hunt are too staggering to contemplate it is no small indication of the depths to which the sibyl of cumae has fallen in public esteem at least in rome that no envoy was sent to her when the original books were lost surely it would make sense to go back to the source in order to replace the arcane books or did the senate balk at the prospect of losing face in a second bargain with the sibyl of cumae around the cup the sibyl is still venerated especially by denizens of the old greek towns where the chlamys is worn instead of the toga and greek is spoken more often than latin not only in the markets but in the temples and law courts as well the sibyl is an oracle in the eastern sense she or more precisely it is a mediating force between the human and divine able to touch both worlds when the sibyl enters one of her priestesses that priestess is able to speak with the voice of apollo himself such oracles have existed since the dawn of time from persia to greece and in the farflung greek colonies of old like cumae but they have never been wholly embraced by the romans who prefer that inspired individuals should interpret the will of the gods by watching puffs of smoke or rattling beans in a gourd rather than uttering the divine message directly the sibyl of cumae is still venerated by the local villagers who bring her gifts of livestock and coins but she is not favoured by the fashionable elite of rome who inhabit the great seaside villas they prefer to seek wisdom from visiting philosophers and to bestow their patronage on the respectable temples of jupiter and fortune in the forums of puteoli neapolis and pompeii i was not surprised to find the temple of apollo attached to the sibyls shrine to be in a state of some decay it had never been a grandiose structure notwithstanding tales of daedalus and his golden embellishments it was not even built of stone but of wood with a bronze statue of apollo upon a marble pedestal at the centre painted columns of red green and saffron were surmounted by a circular roof the underside of which was segmented into triangles and painted with images of apollo overseeing various acts in the tale of theseus the lusting of pasiphae for a bull and the birth of the minotaur of crete the casting of lots for the yearly sacrifice of seven athenian sons to the beast the construction of the great maze by daedalus the sorrow of ariadne the slaying of the monster by theseus the winged flight of daedalus and his doomed son icarus some of the paintings looked very old and were so faded that they could hardly be discerned others had been recendy repainted and glowed with vivid colour a restoration was in progress and i suspected that i knew the woman responsible the temple was situated in a nook of land hemmed in on three sides by walls of jagged stone it was the only flat surface on the steep hillside which otherwise was strewn with boulders the great stones seemed to have frozen in midavalanche and were overgrown with twisted trees that looked as if their nailing limbs were outstretched to save themselves from falling the priestess walked ahead of us with a serene and unfailing sense of balance never setting a foot wrong while eco and i followed slipping and sliding after her sending bits of gravel flying down the hill as we grabbed branches for support the spot was secluded from sight and protected from the wind a quiet hush reigned over us above our heads the fog struggled to push itself over the hilltop and emerged in tatters casting the place into a weird dappled mixture of darkness and sunlight within the temple the priestess turned to face us beneath her hood her features remained hidden in darkness her voice emerged as strange as before the way that aesop says that animals would speak if they could forcing their inhuman throats to make human noises obviously she said you didnt bring a cow no nor a goat no only your horses which are not a suitable sacrifice to the god you have money then to purchase a beast for sacrifice yes she named a sum that did not seem outrageous the sibyl of cumae was apparently not the hard bargainer she once had been i pulled the money from my purse and wondered if crassus would accept the expense as an addendum to my fee i saw her right hand for just an instant as she accepted the coins from me it was an old womans hand as i would have expected with prominent bones and patches of discoloured flesh no rings adorned her fingers and there was no bracelet on her wrist there was however a smudge of bluegreen paint on her thumb just such a hue as iaia might have been using that morning to touch up a bit of her mosaic perhaps she saw the smudge of paint herself either that or she was eager for the money for she clutched the coins and snatched her hand away hiding it again within the sleeves of her robe i noticed also that the hems of her sleeves were a darker red than the rest of her garment stained by blood damon she called fetch a lamb from nowhere a child appeared a little boy who thrust his head from between two columns and then as quickly vanished a few moments later he reappeared carrying a bleating lamb over his shoulders the beast was not farm stock but a pampered temple animal fattened for ritual sacrifice kept clean and carefully groomed and brushed the boy swung it over his shoulders onto a short altar before the statue of apollo the creature bleated at the touch of cold marble but the boy managed to calm it with soft strokes and whispers in its ear even as he deftly trussed its legs he ran swiftly away and then returned bearing in his outstretched hands a long silver blade with a handle encrusted with lapis and garnets the priestess took it from him and stood over the lamb with her back towards us holding the blade aloft and muttering incantations i expected a longer ceremony and perhaps a series of questions as many oracles required from their supplicants and so i was a little startled when the blade suddenlyflashed and descended the priestess possessed skill and more strength than i would have thought the blade must have gone straight to the heart of the beast killing it instantly there were a few convulsions and a spattering of blood but not a sound not even the least whimper of protest as it gave up its life to the god would the slaves down in baiae die as easily in that moment a chill descended upon the place though the air was still eco felt it as well for i saw him shiver beside me the priestess slit open the lambs underside from its breast to its belly then reached inside i saw how the hems of her sleeves had become so dark with bloodstains she searched for a moment then found what she was seeking she turned toward us bearing in her hands the lambs quivering heart and a portion of its entrails we followed her a short distance to the side of the temple where a rude brazier had been hewn from the stone wall the boy had already prepared the fire the priestess cast the organs upon the hot stone there was a loud sizzling and a small explosion of steam the vapour issued outward and then was sucked back toward the rock wall drawn into fissures in the stone like smoke pulled into a flue the priestess stirred the hissing entrails with a stick the smell of seared flesh reminded me that we had neglected to eat at midday my stomach growled she cast a handful of something onto the heated stone producing another cloud of smoke a strange aromatic scent like burning hemp filled the air making me dizzy beside me eco swayed so violently that i reached to hold him up but when i gripped his shoulder he looked at me oddly as if it were i who had stumbled i saw a movement from the corner of my eye and looked at the great wall of stone above and before us where peculiar faces had begun to appear amid the fissures and shadows such apparitions are not unknown at sacred shrines i had witnessed them before still there is always a sudden stirring of dread and doubt in that instant when the world changes and the powers of the unseen begin to manifest themselves though i could not see her shadowed face i knew that the priestess was watching me she saw that i was ready again we followed her up a steep stony path that traversed the slope then descended into a dark ever deepening ravine the way seemed very far the path was so difficult that i found myself stooped over scrambling on my hands and feet i glanced behind to see that eco did the same strangely the priestess was able to walk upright striding forward with perfectly measured steps we came to the mouth of a cave as we stepped inside a cold clammy wind rushed over my face carrying a strange smell like the breath of many flowers in decay i looked up to see that the cave was not a tunnel but a high airy chamber pierced all about by tiny holes and jagged fissures these openings admitted a twilight glimmer and the rush of the wind sighing through them created an ever changing cacophony that was sometimes like music sometimes like a great chorus of moaning sometimes a singular sound would rise above all the others and then fade away a trilling of notes like a satyr playing his pipes or the bellowing voice of a famous actor i heard once as a boy or the sigh that bethesda makes before she wakes in the morning we descended deeper into the cave to a place where the walls narrowed the darkness deepened and the chorus of voices receded the priestess raised her arm to signal that we should stop in the dimness her bloodred robe had become jet black so dark that it seemed to be a gaping hole that moved about in the grey gloom she stepped onto a low shelf of stone like a stage and for a moment i thought that she danced the black robe spun and twisted and seemed to fold in on itself there was a long wailing shriek that made my hair stand on end the contortions were not a dance but the convulsions of the priestess as her body was possessed by the sibyl the black robe fluttered to the ground becoming nothing more than a great lump of cloth eco stepped forward to touch it but i restrained him in the next instant the robe began to fill again and rise up before our eyes the sibyl of cumae began to take shape she seemed taller than the priestess larger than life she lifted her hands and pushed the cowl from her head her face was barely discernible in the darkness and yet it seemed that i could make out her features with a kind of supernatural clarity i chided myself for ever imagining that the priestess was iaia this was the face of an old woman to be sure and in some superficial regards it resembled iaia the mouth might have been the same and the high gaunt cheekbones and the proud forehead but no mortal voice ever uttered such noises and no mortal woman ever possessed such eyes flashing as brightly as the light through the fissures in the cave she began to speak then clutched herself her breast heaved and a rattling sound issued from her throat as the god began to breathe through her a sudden wind blew up from behind us and scattered her hair like flailing tendrils she struggled not yet submissive to the god and trying to shake him from her brain like a horse trying to unseat its rider her mouth foamed noises came from her throat like wind in a cavern and then like the gurgling of water in a pipe little by little the god mastered her and then calmed her she hid her face in her hands then slowly drew herself erect the god is with me she said in a voice that was neither male nor female the sibyl seemed merely to mouth words that issued from some other source i glanced at eco his forehead was beaded with sweat his eyes were wide open his nostrils were dilated i clutched his hand to give him strength in the darkness why do you come the sibyl asked i started to speak but my throat was too thick i swallowed and tried again we were told to come even my own voice sounded unnatural to my ears what do you seek we come seeking knowledge of certain events in baiae she nodded you come from the house of the dead man lucius licinius yes you seek the answer to a riddle we seek to know how he died and by whose hand not by the hand of those who stand accused said the sibyl emphatically and yet i have no proof of that unless i can show who murdered licinius every slave in the household will be put to death the man who seeks to do this thinks only of his own advancement not of justice it will be a cruel tragedy can you tell me the name of the man who killed licinius the sibyl was silent can you show me his face in a dream the sibyl set her eyes upon me an icy shiver ran through my bones she shook her head but this is what i must know i protested this is the knowledge i seek again the sibyl shook her head if a general came to me and asked me to strike his enemies dead would i not refuse if a physician came and asked me to heal his patient would i not send him away the oracle does not exist to do the work of men for them yet if these men came to me seeking only knowledge i would give it if it were the will of the god i would tell the general where his hidden enemy lurked and i would tell the doctor where he might find the herb that could save his patient the rest would be up to them what shall i do with you then gordianus of rome to find knowledge is your work but i will not do your work for you if i give you the answer you seek i will rob you of the very means by which you may achieve your end if you go to crassus with nothing but a name he will merely laugh at you or punish you for false accusations unless you acquire it on your own using your skills the knowledge you seek will be meaningless that which you assert you must be able to prove it is the will of the god that i assist you but i will not do your work for you i shook my head of what use was the sibyl if she refused to utter a simple name could it be that she did not know i cringed at playing host to such impious thoughts but at the same time it seemed that a veil was being slowly lifted from my eyes and the sibyl once more began to look suspiciously like iaia eco touched my sleeve demanding my attention with one hand he held up two fingers and with the other hand turned two fingers down his sign for a man two men he wrapped one hand around the wrist of the other symbolizing a shackle his sign for a slave two slaves i turned back to the sibyl the two missing slaves zeno and alexandros are they living or dead where can i find them the sibyl nodded in stern approval you ask wisely i will tell you that one of them is hidden and the other is in plain sight yes i will tell you that after they fled from baiae this was their first destination here they came to your cave they came to seek the guidance of the sibyl they came to me as innocent men not guilty ones where can i find them now the one who is hidden you may find in time as for the one in plain sight you will find him on your way back to baiae in the woods not in the woods then where there is a stone shelf that overlooks lake avemus olympias showed us the place on the left side of the precipice there is a narrow path that leads down to the lake cover your mouth and nose with your sleeve and descend to the very mouth of the pit he will await you there what the shade of a dead man escaping from tartarus you will know him when you see him he will greet you with open eyes it would be a clever place to hide granted but what sort of man could pitch his camp on the very shores of avernus amid the sulphur and steam and the reeking phantoms of the dead the stone shelf was as near as i had cared to venture to the place to descend to its edge sent a shiver through me i could tell from the way he clutched my arm that eco disliked the idea as much as i did the boy said the sibyl crisply why does he not speak for himself he is unable to speak you lie no he cannot speak was he born dumb no when he was very small he was stricken by a fever the same fever killed his father from that day eco never spoke again so his mother told me before she abandoned him he could speak now if he tried how could she say such a thing i began to object but she interrupted let him try say your name boy eco looked at her fearfully and then with an odd glimmer of hope in his eyes it was another strange moment in a day of strange moments and i almost believed that the impossible would come to pass there in the sibyls cave eco must have believed as well he opened his mouth his throat quivered and his cheeks grew taut say your name the sibyl demanded eco strained his face darkened his lips trembled say it eco tried but the sound that came from his throat was not human speech it was a stifled distorted noise ugly and grating i closed my eyes in shame for him then felt him against my breast shivering and weeping i held him tighdy and wondered why the sibyl should demand such a cruel price an innocent boys humiliation in return for so little i drew a deep breath and filled my lungs with the scent of decaying flowers i summoned my courage and opened my eyes determined to reprimand her vessel of the god or not but the sibyl was nowhere to be seen we left the sibyls cave the cavern of echoes and voices no longer seemed quite so mysterious a curious enclosure to be sure but not the aweinspiring place it had been when we entered the way back to the temple was strenuous and rocky but it hardly required that we crawl nor was it as long on the way back as it had been on the way to the sibyls cave the whole world seemed to have awakened from a strange dream even the fitful fog had receded and the hillside was bright with afternoon sunshine the fire had died in the brazier the blackened entrails still sputtered and popped occasionally on the hot stone startling the swarm of flies that circled overhead the sight was unpleasant but the smell of charred flesh reminded me again that we had not eaten in hours in a small recess behind the temple the boy damon had strung up and skinned the carcass of the lamb and was carving it with surprising expertise we scrambled down the ravine and untethered our horses bright sunshine reflected off the maze of rocks making it as baffling a place as before if not quite so menacing we made our way towards the coast at the crest of a small rise a glittering expanse opened before us not the circumscribed sweep of the cup but the true sea an unobstructed body of water extending all the way to sardinia and beyond to the pillars of hercules in the west the ancient village of cumae was at our feet we rode in silence on our journeys i usually kept up a running conversation even if eco could not answer with his own voice now i could think of nothing to say the silence between us was heavy with an unspoken melancholy a wagon driver pointed us to the house of iaia which stood perched on a cliff at the far end of the village overlooking the sea it was not impressive as villas go but it was probably the largest house in the village with modest wings extending to the north and south and what appeared to be another storey stepping down towards the sea on the west the wash of colours that decorated the facade was subtly original a blending of saffron and ochre together with highlights of blue and green the house at once stood out boldly against the backdrop of the sea and yet seemed an essential part of the view the hand and eye of iaia turned everything to art the door slave informed us that olympias had gone out but would return and had left word that our needs should be attended to he led us to a small terrace with a view of the sea and brought food and drink presented with a bowl of steaming porridge eco began to seem more himself he ate with relish and i was heartened to see him shake off his sadness after eating we rested reclining on couches on the terrace and gazing at the sea but i soon grew restless and began to question the slaves about olympiass whereabouts if they knew where she was they would not tell i left eco dozing on his couch and wandered through the house iaia had collected many beautiful things in the course of her career finely crafted tables and chairs small sculptures so delicately moulded and painted they seemed almost to breathe precious objects made of glass ivory figurines and the paintings of other artists as well as her own these things were displayed about the house with a great sense of harmony and an unfailing eye for beauty no wonder she had been so disparaging of lucius liciniuss taste in paintings and statues it was my nose that led me to the room where iaia and olympias created their pigments i followed a strange medley of odours down a hallway until i came to a chamber cluttered with pots braziers mortars and pestles stacked all about the room were dozens of clay jars some large some small all labelled in the same hand that had signed the portrait of gelina i opened the lids and examined the various dried plants and powdered minerals some of them i recognized brownred sinopis made from rusted sinopean iron spanish cinnabar the colour of blood dark purple sand from puteoli blue indigo made from a powder scraped off egyptian reeds other jars seemed to contain not pigments but medicinal herbs black and white hellebore ground to a powder poisonous but having many uses the holosteon or allbone plant perversely named by the greeks because it is entirely soft just as they call gall sweet with its slender hairlike roots good for closing wounds and healing sprains white lathyris seeds good for curing dropsy and drawing away bile i was just replacing the lid on a tiny jar full of aconitum also called panthersdeath when someone cleared his throat behind me the door slave watched me disapprovingly from the hallway you should be careful before you stick your nose in the jars he said some of the things inside can be very poisonous yes i agreed like this stuff aconitum they say it sprang from the mouth foam of cerberus when hercules pulled him up from the underworld thats why it grows near openings to the underworld like the jaws of hades good for killing panthers im told or people i wonder why your mistress keeps it scorpion stings the slave answered curtly you mix it with wine to make a poultice ah your mistress must be very wise about such things the slave crossed his arms and stared at me like a basilisk i slowly replaced the jar on the shelf and left the room i decided to take a walk along the cliffs beyond the village the afternoon sun was warm the sky was crystal a progression of clouds scudded along the blue horizon and overhead gulls circled and shrieked the fog that had blanketed the coast an hour before had vanished the sibyl of cumae began to seem unreal like the vapours that rose from lake avernus as if all that had happened since we left baiae that morning were a waking dream i breathed deeply of the sea air and was suddenly weary of the villa in baiae and its mysteries i longed to be in rome again walking through the crowded streets of the subura watching the gangs of boys who play trigon in the squares i longed for the secluded quiet of my own garden the comfort of my own bed and the smell of bethesdas cooking then i saw olympias climbing up a narrow trail from the beach in one hand she carried a small basket she was still quite distant but i could see that she was smiling not the ambiguous smile that she wore in gelinas villa but a true smile radiant and content i also saw that the hem of her short riding stola was dark as if she had been wading in water up to her knees i looked beyond her and tried to imagine where she had come from the trail she was taking vanished from sight among a tumble of rocks and i could see no beach at all at the waters edge if she wanted to gather shells or sea creatures there must surely be better and safer places in the vicinity of cumae as she drew nearer i hid behind a stone i circled behind it trying to find a way to watch her without being seen and noticed a movement from the corner of my eye a hundred paces away i saw what might have been my mirror image had i been wearing a dark hooded cloak and worn a long pointed beard the philosopher dionysius stood just as i did poised behind a rock on the edge of the cliff furtively watching olympias climb up the hillside he did not see me i moved slowly around the stone concealing myself from olympias and dionysius both and then scurried away from the cliff until i was out of sight i hurried back to iaias house and rejoined eco on the terrace olympias arrived a few moments later the door slave spoke to her in a hushed tone olympias stepped into another room when she reappeared some moments later she had changed into a dry stola and no longer carried her basket was your visit to the sibyl fruitful she asked smiling pleasantly eco frowned and averted his eyes perhaps i said well find out on the way back to baiae olympias looked puzzled but nothing could dampen her buoyant mood she walked about the terrace caressing the flowers that bloomed in their pots shall we go back soon she asked i think so eco and i still have work to do and gelinas house will no doubt be in much confusion such as always occurs on the day before a great funeral ah yes the funeral olympias whispered gravely she nodded thoughtfully and the smile almost faded from her lovely lips as she bowed her head to smell the flowers the sea air agrees with you i said she looked more beautiful than ever with her eyes shining brighdy and her golden hair swept back by the wind did you take a walk along the beach a short walk yes she said averting her eyes when you came in the door a moment ago i thought i saw you carrying a basket gathering sea urchins no shells she looked uneasy actually i didnt go to the beach the sparkle in her eyes became opaque i walked along the ridge instead i gathered some pretty stones if you must know iaia uses them to decorate the garden i see we left shortly thereafter as we walked through the foyer towards the door i saw that olympias had not bothered to conceal her basket when she entered but had left it in plain sight in the corner opposite the door slaves stool while olympias stepped through the door into the sunlight i lingered behind i stepped towards the basket and lifted the cover with my foot there were no stones within except for a small knife and a few crusts of bread the basket was empty the passage through the stone maze and across the bald windy hills seemed quite different in the bright sunshine but when we began to enter the woods around lake avernus i sensed the same atmosphere of uncanny seclusion that i had felt before i looked back occasionally but if dionysius followed he kept himself out of sight it was not until we came to the precipice that i told olympias i wanted to stop but i showed you the view already she protested you cant want to see it again think what a beautiful day it must be down in baiae but i do want to see it i insisted while eco found a place to tether the horses i located the beginning of the path on the left side of the slab just as the sibyl had described the opening was obscured by overgrown brush and old branches and the path itself was faint and disused there was no sign of fresh footsteps in the fogdampened earth not even the mark of a deer i pushed through the brush with eco behind me olympias protested but followed the path descended in sharp switchbacks over barren rocky ground the odour of sulphur grew ever stronger borne on a wave of hot rising air until we were compelled to cover our faces with our sleeves at last we found ourselves on a wide shallow beach of yellow mud the lake was not a uniform liquid surface as it appeared from above but a series of interconnected pools of sulphur overhung by clouds of vapour and separated by bridges of rock that might have been used to traverse to the other side if a man cared to take the risk and could survive the heat and the smell the stench of the bubbling pits was almost overpowering but i thought i detected an even more unwelcome odour borne on the reek i looked up we stood almost directly below the shelf of rock from which we had descended in the face of the cliff i could see no cave or any other sign of shelter i shook my head more dubious than ever of the sibyls word how can anyone possibly meet us here i grumbled to eco id sooner expect to see the minotaur come strolling up this beach than one of gelinas escaped slaves eco gazed up and down the beach as far as the obscuring mists allowed then he raised his eyebrows and pointed at something at the waters edge only a few feet away i had seen the thing already and had taken no notice of it thinking it was only a piece of driftwood or some natural detritus thrown up by the lake now i looked at it more closely and realized with a shock what it must be eco and i stepped cautiously towards it with olympias following at one time most of the thing had been submerged in the pit where the greater part of it had been eaten away by the boiling caustic sludge the remains were drained of colour spattered with mud and rapidly beginning to decay we looked at what was left of a human head attached to shoulders still covered by bits of discoloured cloth the face was turned downward into the mud on the back of the corpses head a ring of grey hair swirled around a bald spot eco stepped back in fright and stared into the lake beyond as if he thought the thing had emerged from the pit rather than fallen into it i found a stick and prodded at the shoulders to turn the thing over at the same time keeping my nose covered it was not easy the flesh of the face seemed to have become melted somehow into the mud when at last i succeeded the sight was hard to bear but enough of the features remained for olympias to recognize him she drew in a shuddering breath and wailed into her sleeve zeno before i could think of what to do with the thing olympias decided for me with a piercing shriek she stooped picked up the head by its remaining hair and cast it into the lake it flew through the mists causing them to furl and flutter in its wake and landed not with a splash but with a slap for an eerie moment time stopped and the head remained afloat on the bubbling cauldron a hissing vent of steam opened beneath it through the vapour i thought i saw the eyes of the thing open and peer back at us like a drowning man looking desperately to those on shore then it sank beneath the mud and vanished altogether now the jaws of hades claims him for good i whispered to no one for olympias was mnning headlong back to the path tripping and weeping and eco was on his knees vomiting on the beach part three death in a cup xiv will this day never end i peered at the ceiling above my bed and rubbed my face with both hands my backside will ache tomorrow from all this riding up hill and down through the woods and across the wastes i babbled the way that weary men do when given a chance to rest in the course of a long day and they find themselves too overwrought to relax it might have helped if i closed my eyes but whenever i did i saw the horribly decayed face of zeno staring at me from a gaping mouth of flame eco could you pour me a cup of water from that ewer on the windowsill water i slapped my forehead we still have to find someone who can dive down into the shallows around the boathouse to see what was dropped from the pier last night i sat up to accept the cup from eco and peered past his shoulder through the window the sun was still up but not for long by the time i found meto assuming he was fit for the task and trundled down to the waters edge the shadows would be growing longer and the evening chill would have begun to settle we needed bright sunlight piercing the water if we were to find something amid the rocks on the bottom the task would have to wait i groaned and rubbed my eyes then quickly snatched my hands away when the face of zeno loomed up before me not enough time eco not enough time whats the point of all this scurrying about when we can never hope to get to the bottom of things before crassus has his way if only olympias hadnt cast the head into the lake and then raced back to the villa alone we would at least have had something to show crassus proof that we had found one of the slaves but what would that have served crassus would see it as just another proof of zenos guilt what better way for the gods to show their fury at a murderous slave than for pluto himself to swallow the miscreant feet first for all our work all we have are questions eco who attacked me on the pier last night what was olympias up to today and why was dionysius following her and what part does iaia play in all this she seems to have some agenda of her own but towards what end and why does she play her part behind a veil of secrecy and magic i stretched my arms and legs and suddenly felt as heavy as lead eco dropped onto his bed his face turned toward the wall we shouldnt he here any longer i murmured we have so little time i still havent spoken to sergius orata the businessman or dionysius for that matter if i could catch the philosopher off his guard i closed my eyes for just an instant i thought around me it seemed that the room itself sighed wearily perched atop the villa with an eastfacing terrace it captured the heat of the morning and stored it all through the day but now the walls began to give up their warmth a coolness seeped in from the window and pervaded the air the back of my body pressed into the bed felt deliciously warm while my hands and feet were slighdy chilled i could have used a light blanket but i was too tired to bother i lay on the bed exhausted alert to every sensation and yet beginning to doze the dream began in the bed on which i lay except that i seemed to be at my house in rome for i lay on my side with bethesda pressed against me face to face with my eyes closed i ran my hands over her warm thighs and up her belly amazed that her flesh was still as firm and supple as when i first bought her in alexandria she purred catlike at my touch her body writhed against mine and i felt myself grow achingly stiff between the legs i moved to enter her but she stiffened and pushed me away i opened my eyes and saw not bethesda but olympias looking back at me with aloof disdain what do you think i am she whispered haughtily a slave that you could ever use me so she pushed herself up from the bed and stood naked bathed in the soft glowing light from the terrace her hair was a golden aureole about her face the full sleek curves and the subtle hollows of her body formed a beauty that was almost unbearable to look at i reached for her and she started back i thought she mocked me but suddenly she covered her face with her hands and ran weeping from the room slamming the door behind her i rose from the bed and followed i opened the door with a sudden foreboding and felt a breath of hot air on my face the door opened not into a hallway but onto the shelf of rock above lake avernus i could not tell whether it was day or night everything was lit with a harsh bloodred glow on the edge of the rock a man sat in a low chair draped in a crimson military cape he leaned forward his chin on his hand and his elbow on his knee as if he watched the progress of a battle far below i looked over his shoulder and saw that the whole of the lake was a vast pool of belching flames filled from shore to shore with the writhing bodies of men women and children trapped waistdeep in the burning mud their mouths were wrenched open in agony but the distance muffled their screaming so that it was like the roar of the sea or the sound of a crowd in an amphitheatre they were too far away for their faces to be distinct and yet among them i recognized the slave boy meto and the young apollonius crassus looked over his shoulder roman justice he said with grim satisfaction and there is nothing you can do about it he looked at me oddly and i realized i was naked i turned about to return to my room but i could not find the door in confusion i stepped too close to the edge part of the rock began to crumble and give way crassus seemed not to notice as i fell backward desperately trying to scramble onto the rock even as it fell with me plummeting into the empty void i woke in a cold sweat to see the boy meto standing over me with a look of grave concern on his face from across the room i heard the gentle sawing of ecos snore i blinked and wiped my hand across my forehead surprised to find it beaded with sweat the sky beyond the terrace was dark blue alive with the first stars of evening the room was lit by a lamp which meto carried in his small hand theyre waiting for you he finally said raising his eyebrows uncertainly who for what i blinked in confusion and watched the lamplight flicker across the ceiling everyone is there but you he said where in the dining room theyre waiting for you to begin the dinner though why theyre in such a hurry i dont know he went on as i shook my head to clear it and struggled to rise from the bed why do you say that because its a dinner hardly fit for slaves a great gloom seemed to have settled over the dining room partly it came from the gravity of the occasion for this was the last meal before the funeral throughout the night and all the next day until the funeral feast that would follow lucius liciniuss cremation and interment everyone in the household would fast tradition prescribed a meal of rigorous simplicity common bread and bowls of plain lentils watered wine and a grain porridge as an innovation gelinas cook had included a few delicacies all black in colour black roe served on crusts of black bread pickled eggs stained black black olives and fish poached in octopus ink it was not a repast to spark clever conversation even from metrobius across the room sergius orata surveyed the prospect with a glum eye and filled himself up with pickled eggs popping them whole into his mouth the gloominess had another source which emanated from the couch beside gelina tonight marcus crassus was in attendance and his presence seemed to swallow up all spontaneity his lieutenants mummius and fabius reclining next to each other at his right hand seemed unable to shake their taciturn military bearing while from their shifty glances and grim faces it was evident that neither metrobius nor iaia felt at ease in the great mans presence olympias was understandably distracted considering the shock she had received at lake avernus i was surprised to see her in attendance she dabbed at her food bit her lips and kept her eyes lowered she wore a haunted expression that only enhanced her beauty by the muted glow of the lamps eco i noticed could not take his eyes from her gelina was in a state of fretful agitation she could not be still and was constantly waving at the slaves and then when they scurried to her side could not remember why she called them her expression shifted from haggard despair to a timorous smile for no apparent reason and far from averting her eyes she looked from face to face around the room fixing each of us with an intense inscrutable gaze that was unnerving even metrobius could not cope with her he occasionally took her hand to squeeze it reassuringly but avoided looking at her his wit seemed to have run dry crassus himself was preoccupied and aloof most of his conversation was reserved for mummius and fabius with whom he exchanged curt observations on the state of his troops and the progress made towards completing the wooden amphitheatre by lake lucrinus otherwise he might have been dining alone for all the attention he paid to his guests he ate heartily but was pensive and withdrawn only the philosopher dionysius appeared to be in good spirits his cheeks had a ruddy glow and his eyes sparkled the ride to cumae and back had invigorated him i thought or else he was very pleased with whatever result he had obtained by spying on olympias that afternoon it suddenly occurred to me that perhaps he was as stricken by her beauty as everyone else and his purpose for following her was simply prurient i remembered seeing him on the cliff furtively watching olympias from the hidden folds of his cloak and with a shudder i imagined him secretly fondling himself if the smile on his face that night was the afterglow of satisfying his peculiar sexual appetite then the gods were granting me a far more intimate look into the mans soul than i cared to see yet for a man obsessed dionysius seemed quite capable of ignoring olympias and her distress even though she reclined at his right hand instead he focused his attentions on crassus as on the night before it was dionysius who finally picked up the reins of desultory conversation and sought to entertain us or at least to impress us with his erudition last night we talked a little about the history of slave revolts marcus crassus i was sorry you were not here perhaps some of my research would have been new to you crassus took his time to finish chewing a crust of bread before replying i seriously doubt it dionysius ive been doing my own research into the subject during the last few months chiefly into the mistakes made by unsuccessful roman commanders when confronting such large but undisciplined forces ah dionysius nodded the wise man takes an interest not only in his enemy but in shall we say the heritage of his enemy and the historical powers at his enemys disposal no matter how seamy or disreputable what on earth are you talking about said crassus hardly looking up i mean that spartacus did not exactly arise from nowhere i have a theory that among these slaves there are whispered legends about the slave revolts of the past stories built about the likes of the doomed slavewizard eunus and embellished with all sorts of mockheroic details and wishful thinking nonsense said faustus fabius pushing back a lock of unruly red hair slaves do not have legends or heroes any more than they have wives or mothers or children they can call their own slaves have duties and masters that is the way of the world as the gods have designed it there was a general murmur of agreement around the room but the way of the world can be disrupted said dionysius as we have seen all too clearly for the last two years with spartacus and his rabble cavorting up and down the length of italy wreaking havoc and inciting more and more slaves to join them such men thumb their noses at the natural order of things and so the time has come for a strong roman to reassert that order boomed mummius but surely it would be helpful dionysius pressed on to understand the motivations and the aspirations of these rebellious slaves all the more surely to defeat them fabius curled his hp derisively and bit into an olive their motivation is to escape the life of service and labour that fortune has allotted them their aspiration is to be free men though for that they lack the requisite moral character especially those who were bom slaves and those who were reduced to slavery because they were captured in war or made destitute the question came from olympias who blushed as she asked it can a man degraded to slavery ever become wholly a man again even if his master should see fit to free him fabius cocked his head once fortune has turned a man into property it is impossible for him ever to recover his dignity he may redeem the body but not the spirit and yet by law olympias began the laws vary fabius tossed an olive pit onto the little table before him it bounced off the silver tray and onto the floor where a slave hurried to retrieve it yes a slave may purchase his freedom but only if his master allows him to do so the very act of allowing a slave to accumulate his own price in silver is a legal fiction since a slave can truly own nothing anything he may possess belongs to his master even after emancipation a freedman can be reduced to slavery again if he shows impertinence to his former master he is politically restricted socially retarded and barred by good taste from marriage into any respectable family a freedman may be a citizen but he is never truly a man gelina glanced over her shoulder at the slave who had retrieved the olive pit and who now was retreating with a tray towards the kitchens do you think its wise to carry on such discussions considering crassus snorted and leaned back on his couch really gelina if a roman cannot discuss the nature of property in the presence of property then we have come to a sad pass everything fabius says is true as for dionysius and his notion about some sort of vague continuity between slave revolts the idea is absurd slaves have no link with the past how can they when they dont even know the names of their ancestors theyre like mushrooms they spring from the earth in vast numbers at the whim of the gods what is their purpose to serve as the tools of men greater than themselves so that those men can realize their greater ambitions slaves are the human implements given to us by that divine will which inspires great men and enriches a great republic like our own they have no past and the past does not concern them nor do slaves have a sense of the future otherwise spartacus and his ilk would know that they are doomed to a fate far worse than the one they thought they were escaping when they turned on their masters hear hear said mummius tipsily banging his cup on the table metrobius shot him a withering glance and started to speak then thought better of it the common slave who labours in the fields lives from day to day crassus continued conscious of very little beyond his immediate needs and the necessity of satisfying his master contentment or at least resignation is the natural condition of slavery for such men to rise up and kill their betters is in fact unnatural or else it would happen all the time and slavery could not exist which means that civilization could not exist the revolt of spartacus like that of the wizard eunus and a handful of others is an aberration a perversion a rent in the fabric of the cosmos woven by the fates dionysius leaned forward gazing at crassus with cloying admiration you are truly the man of the hour marcus crassus not only a statesman and a general but a philosopher as well there are those who would say however perversely that spartacus is the man of the hour that he dictates the agenda of our hopes and fears but i think that rome will soon forget about him in the splendour of your victory law and order will be restored and all will be as if spartacus never existed hear hear said mummius dionysius leaned back and smiled coyly i wonder where the wretch spartacus is at diis very moment holed up near thurii said mummius yes but what is he doing even as we speak does he gorge himself on stolen victuals gloating to his men about stolen victories or has he retired to bed already after all what kind of conversation can uneducated slaves enjoy to keep them up past dark i imagine him lying awake in the darkness restless and far from sleep vaguely troubled by an intuition of what fortune and marcus crassus have in store for him does he he within a tent that reeks of his own foul smell or upon hard stones beneath a starry sky no surely not for then he would be naked to the sight of the gods who despise him i think such a man must sleep in a cave burrowed into the dank earth like the wild beast he is mummius laughed curtly theres nothing so awful about sleeping in caves not from the stories ive heard about a certain great man in his younger days he cast a shrewd eye at crassus who grudgingly smiled dionysius pursed his lips to suppress his own smile of triumph at this turn in the conversation which he had obviously intended and in which mummius was his unwitting accomplice he leaned back and nodded ah yes how could i have forgotten such a charming tale it was in the bad old days before sulla when the tyrants cinna and marius enemies of all die licinii spread terror through the republic they drove crassuss father to suicide and killed his brother and young marcus you must have been no more than twentyfive was forced to flee to spain for his life really dionysius i think that everyone here has heard the story too many times already crassus tried to sound bored and disapproving but the smile at the corners of his lips betrayed him it seemed to me that he was as aware as i that dionysius had contrived to bring up the subject to make his own as yet unspoken point but the memory of the story clearly pleased crassus too much for him to resist having it told again dionysius pressed on surely not everyone has heard the tale gordianus for one and his son eco the tale of the cave he explained looking at me it sounds vaguely familiar i admitted some bit of gossip overheard in the forum perhaps and iaia and her young protegee surely the story of crassus in the sea cave would be new to them dionysius turned toward the women with a look that was strangely like a leer their reaction was equally strange olympias blushed a deeper red while iaia blanched and drew herself up stiffly i know the story quite well she protested well then for gordianuss sake it should be told when the young crassus arrived in spain a fugitive from the depredations of marius and cinna he might have expected to be warmly greeted his family had old connections his father had served as praetor in spain and marcus had spent time there as a youth instead he found the roman colonists and their subjects overawed by their fear of marius no one would speak to him much less help him and indeed there was considerable danger that someone would betray him and deliver his head to the partisans of marius so he fled the town but not alone you had arrived with some companions had you not three friends and ten slaves said crassus yes so he fled the town with his three friends and ten slaves and journeyed down the coast until he came to the property of an old acquaintance of his fathers the name eludes me vibius paciacus said crassus with a wistful smile ah yes vibius now there happened to be a large cave on the property right on the seashore which crassus remembered from his boyhood he decided to hide there with his company for a while without telling vibius seeing no reason to endanger his old friend but eventually their provisions ran out so crassus sent a slave to vibius to sound him out the old man was delighted to learn that crassus had escaped and was safe he inquired after the size of the company and though he did not go himself he ordered his bailiff to have food prepared each day and to deliver it to a secluded spot on the cliffs vibius threatened the bailiff with death if he poked his nose any further into the business or started spreading rumours and promised him freedom if he carried out his orders faithfully in time the man also brought books leather balls for playing trigon and other diversions never seeing the fugitives or where they were hidden the cave itself oh that cave interrupted crassus i had played there as a boy when it seemed as mysterious and haunting as the cave of the sibyl its very near the sea but safely high above the beach surrounded by steep cliffs the path that leads down to its mouth is steep and narrow hard to find inside it opens to an amazing height with chambers off to each side a clear spring emerges from the base of the cliffs so theres plenty of water fissures pierce the rock so theres plenty of daylight but also protection from wind and rain not at all a damp or dank place thanks to the thickness of the stone walls the air was quite dry and pure i felt like a child again free from all the cares of the world safely hidden the months before had been a terrifying ordeal with the death of my father and my brother and the panic in rome there were melancholy days in the cave but there was also a feeling that time had stopped that for the moment nothing was wanted of me neither grief nor revenge nor struggling for a place in the world i think my friends grew quite bored and restive and there was hardly enough for the slaves to do but for me it was a time of rest and seclusion sorely needed and eventually so the tale goes every need was met said dionysius alethea and diona said crassus smiling at the memory one morning the slave who had been sent to fetch our daily provisions came running back flustered and tonguetied saying that two goddesses one blonde and one brunette had emerged from the sea and were strolling towards us down the beach i crept down the path and had a look at them from behind some rocks if they had emerged from the sea they were curiously dry from head to toe and if they were goddesses it was a strange thing that they should be dressed in common gowns much less beautiful than they were themselves i let them see me and they came forward without hesitation the blonde stepped forward and announced that she was alethea a slave and asked if i was her master i realized then that vibius had sent them knowing that i had not been with a woman since leaving rome and wanting to be the best host he could to a young man of twentyfive alethea and diona made the rest of those eight months far more pleasurable how did your sojourn end i asked word came that cinna had been killed and marius was vulnerable at last i gathered up all the supporters i could find and went to join sulla and the slave girls asked fabius crassus smiled some years later i bought them from vibius their beauty had not yet faded nor had my youth we had a most amusing reunion i found a place for them at my house in rome and they have served me there ever since i have made sure they are well provided for a charming episode in such a turbulent and fascinating life said dionysius clapping his hands together how that story has always fascinated me especially in recent days there is something so lovely and elusive about its incongruous elements the idea of a cave on the sea used for a hiding place the image of a beautiful girl bringing sustenance to the fugitive the beguiling improbability of it all its almost too much like a fable to have actually happened do you imagine that such a thing could ever take place again that such a strange circumstance could be twisted a bit askew and occur in another place another time dionysius was quite full of himself purring like a cat in the delight of his own rhetoric but i found myself looking instead at olympias who was visibly trembling and at iaia who reached for her protegees hand and squeezed it not too gently to judge by the way the girls flesh turned white in her grip are you posing some sort of conundrum asked crassus growing bored again perhaps said dionysius or perhaps not there are many peculiar things afoot in the world today the alarming sorts of things that happen when the will of the gods is distorted and the line between slave and free becomes blurred amid such chaos unnatural alliances are forged and wicked betrayals flourish thus we come to have a man like gordianus in our midst is he not here to uncover truth and melt away our distrust tell me gordianus would you object if i decided to pose as your rival in this quest for knowledge the philosopher versus the finder what would you say to that crassus crassus looked at him darkly trying as i was to fathom his purpose if you mean that you can solve the mystery surrounding the murder of my cousin lucius that is exactly what i mean along with gordianus parallel with him you might say i have been conducting my own investigation though along somewhat different lines of inquiry i have nothing to reveal at this moment but i think that very soon i shall be able to answer all the questions that have arisen from this tragic event i consider it my duty as a philosopher and as your friend marcus crassus he set his jaw in a rigid mirthless smile and looked from face to face around the room ah but the meal must now be over for my concoction has arrived dionysius took the cup from the slave who stood silently waiting beside his couch he sipped at the green froth beside him olympias and iaia squirmed as if their couches had been stuffed with tiny nettles they were trying very hard i thought to conceal the quiet panic that had slowly crept over them and they were failing miserably xv not another bite until tomorrow evening imagine that sergius orata stood alone on the terrace outside the dining room he looked over his shoulder at my arrival then gazed wistfully toward the lights of puteoli as if he could smell the aroma of a late dinner being served across the bay fasting is bad enough but to do it after such a dreary meal my stomach will be growling all through the funeral orations lucius licinius wouldnt have wanted it that way with lucius here every night was a feast around us the treetops soughed in the breeze within the house the slaves were quietly gathering up the remains of the evenings repast with a muffled clatter of knives and spoons fitting the solemnity of the occasion there had been no entertainment following the meal as soon as marcus crassus had risen and excused himself the other guests had dispersed like anxious children dismissed by their tutor eco hardly able to keep his eyes open had gone straight to bed only orata and i remained i imagined that he lingered close by the ghost of the dinner as a frustrated lover might linger about his beloveds empty bed brooding over the smell and the memory of what he craved but could not have was lucius licinius so extravagant i asked extravagant lucius orata shrugged his round shoulders not by baian standards by roman standards i suppose he might be the sort against whom the senate is always threatening to pass some punitive sumptuary law let us say he spent his money with relish or spent crassuss money orata wrinkled his brow stricdy speaking and yet i stood beside him and leaned against the stone railing after the first chill of evening the air seemed to have calmed and grown slightly warmer as sometimes happens on the cup i studied the line of lights as tiny as stars that ringed the coastline areas of darkness alternated with clusters of muted fire where the towns sparkled like jewels in the crystalline air you were here the night lucius was murdered werent you i said quiedy it must have been a considerable shock to awaken the next morning and find a shock indeed and when i learned of the name scrawled at his feet and the fact that his slaves were responsible imagine they might have murdered us all in our sleep such a thing actually happened only a few weeks ago down in lucania when spartacus was fighting his way to thurii a wealthy family was massacred in the night along with all their house guests the women were raped the children were made to watch their fathers beheaded it makes the blood run cold i nodded your visit here it was strictly for pleasure orata smiled faintly i seldom do anything strictly for pleasure even eating serves a vital purpose does it not i do a great deal of visiting around the cup at all seasons of the year i enjoy it immensely but theres always time for business to be utterly idle and to pursue pleasure for its own end is decadent i must always be striving towards some object i was born in puteoli but i think i follow the roman virtues then you had business with lucius licinius there were plans afoot you had already rebuilt his baths a stunning piece of work he smiled at the compliment what more was there to do build a fish pond to start with i was joking do not joke about fish ponds here in baiae here great men weep tears of grief when their mullets die and tears of joy when they spawn in rome they say that the baians have developed a positive mania for pisciculture theyve turned it into a vice orata confided with a laugh the way the parthians are said to turn simple horse racing into a vice but it brings a tidy profit for the man who knows the secrets of the trade its an expensive hobby it can be and lucius was prepared to indulge in it i dont understand was he wealthy or not if he had so much money why did he not own his own home actually orata paused and his face lengthened you must understand gordianus that after my ancestors and the gods there is nothing i respect so much as the confidentiality of another mans private finances im not the sort to gossip about the source or extent of someone elses wealth but since lucius is dead yes may his shade forgive me if i tell you that there was more than met the eye when it came to luciuss finances i dont follow you lucius had all sorts of improvements in mind for this villa expensive renovations and additions that was why he asked me to the house for a few days to discuss the feasibility and expense of some projects he had in mind but why would he spend so much to improve a house in which he was only a tenant because he was planning to buy the house from crassus very soon did crassus know this i think not lucius told me he would be approaching crassus with an offer within a month or so and he seemed quite confident that crassus would accept do you have any idea what a villa like this costs especially when you consider the expenses of running the place orata lowered his voice he told me very confidentially that his chance to break away from crassus had come at last he suggested that he and i should launch a partnership my business expertise matched with his capital he said he came up with some good ideas i must admit but you were wary the word partnership always makes me wary i learned early on always to make my own way but if lucius was offering the money thats just it where did he get it when i rebuilt the baths here it was crassus who signed the final contract and crassus always saw that i received my payments on time but occasionally there were incidental expenses little things about which lucius hated to bother crassus so lucius would pay for them himself he always acted as if it were a great sacrifice just to come up with a few sesterces to buy a wagonload of lime orata wrinkled his plump brow i told you earlier that lucius always served sumptuous dinners but that was only in the last year or two before that he always pretended to be better off than he was you could see the brass beneath the gold so to speak the oysters might be fresh but you could see that the slaves kept washing the same silver spoons to serve each new course because there werent enough silver spoons to go around a subtle point surely in my line of work one learns to observe the fine distinctions between true wealth and pretence i hate being left with a bill i cant collect and in the last year or so lucius had managed to buy all the silver spoons he needed exactly and he seemed to be in the market for more i suppose he must have been saving his stipend from crassus for a long time orata shook his head glumly then what did he have some other source of income none that i know of and there is very little that transpires on the cup that i dont know about very little of a legitimate legal nature that is do you mean i only mean that luciuss sudden wealth was an enigma to me and to crassus i dont think crassus knew about it but what could lucius have done without crassuss even knowing are you suggesting some clandestine i suggest nothing orata blandly insisted he turned from the view of the bay and looked into the house the last traces of the dinner had vanished even the serving tables had been taken away he sighed and suddenly seemed to lose all interest in our conversation i think i shall go to my room now but sergius orata surely you have some ideas some suspicions he shrugged quite extravagandy a wellpractised gesture good for escaping unwanted investors and clients too small to bother with i only know that one of marcus crassuss reasons for coming here was to have a careful look at luciuss financial records so that crassus might assess his own resources on the cup if he looks long and hard enough i suspect that crassus may uncover some very unpleasant surprises on my way to the library i avoided walking through the atrium where the remains oflucius licinius were displayed if a part of my mission now included uncovering some embarrassing transactions or even criminal activity on his part i did not care to encounter his shade in the middle of the night i took a lamp to find my way through the unfamiliar halls but hardly needed it moonlight poured like liquid silver through the windows and skylights flooding the halls and open spaces with a cold luminescence i hoped to find the library empty but when i turned the corner i saw the same bodyguard who had attended the door the previous night at my approach he turned his head with military precision and fixed me with a piercing gaze his stare softened when he recognized me the frigid mask of his face loosened indeed the closer i came the more chagrined he looked when i was close enough to hear the voices from within i understood his embarrassment they must have been speaking quite loudly for the sound to pass through the heavy oak door crassuss voice with its oratorical training penetrated more clearly the other voice had a lower rumbling timbre that was less easy to distinguish but the bombastic tone unmistakably belonged to marcus mummius for the last time there will be no exceptions this came from crassus a rumbling retort from mummius followed too muffled for me to catch more than a few words how many times always loyal even when you owe me this favour no marcus not even as a favour crassus shouted stop dredging up the dead past this is a matter of policy theres nothing personal in it if i allow even a single sentimental exception there will be no end to it gelina will have me save them all how do you think that would look in rome no i wont be made a fool of because you lack the good sense to avoid this kind of petty attachment this evoked angry shouting from mummius i was unable to make out the words but there was no mistaking the note of anguish amid the fury an instant later the door abruptly opened so violently that the bodyguard started back and drew his sword mummius emerged redfaced his eyes bulging his jaw set hard enough to grind stones he turned back towards the room and clenched his fists at his sides making the veins in his thick forearms writhe like the one that pulsed across his forehead if you and lucius had allowed me to buy him for myself this wouldnt be happening you wouldnt be able to touch the boy if jupiter himself tried to harm a hair on his head i would he made a choking noise and began to shake unable to go on for the first time he seemed to notice that someone else was in the hall he turned to look blankly first at the guard and then at me his furious expression never changed but his eyes began to glisten hotly as they filled with tears farther down the hall toward the atrium a door opened gelina her hair awry her makeup smeared peered toward us with a look of confusion lucius she whispered hoarsely even from such a distance i could smell the wine from her pores crassus emerged from the library there was a moment of strained silence gelina go back to your bed crassus said sternly she drew her eyebrows together and meekly obeyed crassus dilated his nostrils with a deep breath and lifted his chin for a long moment mummius returned his stare then spun around and hurried down the hallway without a word the young guard silently sheathed his sword clenched his jaw and stared straight ahead i opened my mouth searching for some way to explain my presence but crassus relieved me of the obligation dont stand there gaping in the hall come inside with the typical good manners of the nobility crassus said nothing at all about the argument i had just witnessed except for a slight flush across his forehead and a sigh that escaped his lips as he shut the door behind us it might never have happened as on the night before he wore a greek chlamys rather than a cloak to ward off the chill apparently the altercation had warmed him enough for he stripped off the garment and tossed it onto the centaur statue wine he offered taking a cup from the shelf i noticed there were two cups already on the table one for himself and another for mummius both were empty are we not fasting crassus raised an eyebrow i have it on good authority that one need not abstain from wine while fasting for the dead the custom can be bent either way i am told and in my experience it is always best to bend custom to present need on good authority you say i accepted the chair that crassus offered while he turned his around and leaned against the table which was littered with documents crassus smiled and sipped his wine he shut his eyes and ran his fingers through his thinning hair he suddenly looked very weary good authority indeed dionysius tells me that wine is the metaphysical equivalent of blood and so should not be denied to a fasting man any more than the air he breathes i suspect that dionysius is ready to tell you anything he thinks you might want to hear crassus nodded exactly a hopeless sycophant and sycophants are not what i need at the moment what was all that nonsense this evening about his being your rival have you offended him ive hardly spoken to him ah then hes concocted this scheme to solve luciuss murder on his own thinking he can use it to impress me you see whats happening dont you with lucius gone and the household about to dissolve one way or another hell be needing a new patron and a new residence and he would like to attach himself to you crassus laughed mirthlessly and drank more wine i suppose i should be flattered clearly he thinks im on my way up spartacus has only humiliated two roman consuls and defeated every army thats been sent to destroy him what do i have to worry about this note of selfdoubt was so unexpected that for a moment i missed it entirely is it so certain then that youll be given the command against spartacus who else would take it every politician in rome with military experience is quaking with fear they want spartacus to be someone elses problem what about dont even say his name if i never heard it again i could die happily crassus slumped against the table his expression softened actually i dont hate pompey we were good comrades under sulla no one can say that his glory is unearned the man is brilliant a great tactician a splendid leader a superb politician handsome as a demigod too he really does look like a bust of alexander or used to and rich people say that im rich but they forget that pompeys as wealthy as i am if not wealthier pompey they say is brilliant pompey is handsome but rich is something they say only about me crassus crassus rich as croesus he reached for the wine and poured himself another cup he offered more to me but i showed him that my cup was still half full besides pompey has his hands full in spain mopping up that rebel sertorius he cant possibly get back in time to put an end to spartacus actually he could but he wont because ill have done the job already what do you know about spartacus anyway no more than the merchants down at the subura markets know when they tell me their prices have tripled because of someone called spartacus it all comes down to that doesnt it they can burn a whole town in the countryside and hang the city fathers by their ankles but the real rub comes when spartacus and his nasty little revolt start making life uneasy for the rabble in rome the situation is so absurd that no one could have invented it its like a nightmare that wont go away do you know where it started capua wasnt it crassus nodded just a short ride from here up the via consularis from puteoli a fool named batiatus ran a gladiator farm on the edge of town bought his slaves wholesale weeded out the weak trained the strong ones and sold them to clients all over italy he came into a number of thracians good fighters but notoriously temperamental batiatus decided to put them in their place from the very start so he kept them in cages like beasts and fed them nothing but thin gruel and water letting them out only for their exercises and training the idiot why is it that men who would never think of beating a horse or salting a patch of good earth can be so reckless with their human property especially a piece of property that knows how to carry a weapon and kill a slave is a tool use it wisely and you profit use it foolishly and your efforts are wasted but i was talking about spartacus in the normal course of things these thracians would have been broken to batiatuss will one way or another or they might have revolted against him and been killed on the spot putting a sorry end to a sorry episode but among their number was a man called spartacus it happens sometimes that even among slaves youll find a man of forceful character a brute with a way of making other brutes gather around him to do his will theres nothing mystical about it i suppose dionysius has babbled on to you about his history of the supposed magician eunus and the slave revolt in sicily sixty years ago a thoroughly disgusting episode at least it was contained on an island theyre already saying the same sort of rubbish about spartacus that before he was sold into slavery he was seen sleeping with snakes coiled around his head and the slave he calls his wife is some sort of prophetess who goes into convulsions and speaks for the god bacchus so they say down in the subura markets i admitted crassus wrinkled his nose why anyone would live in the subura when there are so many decent neighbourhoods in rome my father left me a house up on the esquiline i explained take my advice and sell whatever sort of rattrap youve got on the esquiline and buy a newer place outside the city walls out on the campus martius beyond the forum holitorium theres a lot of new building going on by the old naval yards close by the river clean air good values more wine i accepted crassus rubbed his eyes but from the way he ground his jaw i could see he was not sleepy but we were talking about spartacus he said in the beginning there were only seventy of them can you imagine just seventy miserable thracian gladiators who decided to escape from their master they didnt even have a plan they were going to bide their time and look for an opportunity but then one of their number betrayed them slaves always betray one another and they acted on impulse using axes and spits from the cookhouse for weapons the goddess fortune must have looked down and been amused because on their way out of town they came upon a driver with a cart full of real weapons headed for batiatuss gladiator farm from then on it seemed that nothing could stop them to be sure the threat was badly gauged at the start no one in rome could take a revolt of gladiators seriously so they sent out clodius with a half legion of irregulars thinking that would be the end of it ha it was merely the end of clodiuss career in politics victory feeds on victory every time he triumphed over roman arms spartacus found it easier to incite more slaves to join him they say he now commands a movable nation of over a hundred thousand men women and children and not only slaves even freeborn herdsmen and shepherds have cast their lot with him for one thing they say he hands out the booty with no regard for rank or station his foot soldiers get as great a share as his generals crassus curled his lip as if his wine had gone sour the whole affair is perverse to think it should come to this that i should be scrambling for glory by pitting myself against a slave a gladiator the senate wont even allow me a triumph in rome if i win never mind that spartacus is a greater threat to the republic than mithridates or jugurtha ever were ill be lucky if they give me a garland and if i should lose a shadow crossed his face he muttered a prayer of supplication dabbed his fingers in his wine cup and tossed the drops over his shoulder it seemed a good time to change the subject was it true the story that dionysius told this evening about the sea cave crassus smiled as he had at dinner every word oh i suppose its become a bit embellished in the retelling over the years given a nostalgic polish in many ways those were terrible times for me miserable months of anxious waiting and grief he swirled his cup and studied its depths it is a hard thing for a young man to lose his father especially to suicide his enemies drove him to it and an older brother assassinated only because cinna and marius were bent on destroying the best families in rome they would have wiped out the nobility altogether if they could have thank the gods and especially fortune that sulla rose up to save us he sighed do you know stuck in that miserable cave day after day month after month i made a vow to myself every morning they wont get me i said they struck down my father they struck down my brother but i will not be struck down and so far i havent been he swirled his cup and blinked squeezing his eyes shut and opening them wide looking weary but far from sleep i did the right thing you know the pious thing i honoured the gods and the shades of the dead i paid my fathers debts though it left me with nothing and i took up his cause and when the times became more settled i married my brothers widow i married tertulla for piety not love even so i have never regretted the choice not all of us can indulge ourselves in cheap sentiment like lucius licinius or mummius he snorted now lucius is dead and i i am either the man of the hour as dionysius will gladly tell you or else a man who is marching steadily and without the slightest hesitation towards his utter ruination at the hands of a slave i would rather see my wealth vanish than to hear them whisper behind my back in the forum he was brought low by a mere gladiator while i shifted uneasily in my chair he paused to sip from his cup you think i should spare the slaves dont you gordianus if i can prove to you that they should not die he shook his head sadly all men are fated to die gordianus why does the idea fill them with such abhorrence wealth and possessions joy and pain even the body especially the body all these vanish in the well of time only honour matters in the end honour is what men remember or dishonour such a way of thinking sums up the difference between nobles and ordinary men i thought it excuses the most horrifying atrocities and lets go the simplest opportunities for charity and mercy but you must have come here for a reason said crassus unless you were merely eavesdropping do you have something to report gordianus only that we found the body of one of the missing slaves yes he raised an eyebrow which one the old secretary zeno where was he my men supposedly searched every possible hiding place within a days ride he was in plain sight or at least what was left of him somehow he ended up in lake avernus we found his remains on the shoreline most of his body had been eaten away fortunately enough remained of his face for olympias to recognize him avernus i know for a fact that before he left for rome mummius assigned a group of men to search the whole area around the lake including the shore how long had zeno been there for days at least then somehow they missed finding him probably one of them saw a bit of mist in the shape of his dead wife or the lake spat like a baby with colic and the whole lot of them turned and ran then they lied when they reported there was nothing to find they will have to be disciplined the time to make ones authority clear is long before the fighting starts just another of the endless details i shall have to attend to tomorrow he turned wearily toward the table and rifled among the documents until he found a wax tablet and stylus he scribbled a note and tossed the tablet back onto the table where is the body of zeno now or what remains of it there was very little of him left as i said unfortunately my son eco slipped in the mud while he was carrying the head along the shore it fell into a boiling pool of water i shrugged i was uncertain why i lied except that i wanted to avoid calling attention to olympias you mean you have nothing to show me crassus suddenly seemed to have reached the end of his patience this whole business is absurd between you and gelina and mummius really its been a very long day gordianus and tomorrow will be even longer i think you may go now of course i stood and began to turn then stopped one other thing if i may impose on your patience for another moment marcus crassus i see that youve been looking over lucius liciniuss documents yes i wonder if youve come across anything untoward what do you mean im not sure sometimes a mans records can reveal unexpected things there might be something among all those documents that might have a bearing on my own work i cant imagine how the truth is lucius usually kept impeccable records i required him to do so when i was here in the spring i looked over his ledgers and found everything accounted for using the methods i had prescribed now its all a puzzle in what way expenses have been entered with no explanation there are contradictory indications of how often he used the fury and on what errands stranger still it seems to me that some documents must be missing altogether i thought at first that i could reconstruct and make sense of them by myself but i think i shall be unable to id have brought along my chief accountant from rome if id known the state of things but i had no idea that luciuss affairs were in such chaos and do you find any of this suggestive suggestive of what he looked at me quizzically then snorted with you everything comes back to the murder yes it suggests something to me namely that the old secretary zeno had made such a muddle of things that lucius decided to give him a sound beating whereupon the hotheaded young stableman alexandros exploded in a thracian rage and killed his master where upon the two slaves fled into the night only to find themselves swallowed up by the jaws of hades there ive done your work for you gordianus now you can go to bed content from the tone of his voice i knew that crassus insisted on having the final word i was at the door reaching to open it when my hand froze something had been not quite right from the moment i entered the room i had felt an apprehension so vague that i had dismissed it as one blinks away a mote of dust at that instant i knew what it was and that i had seen it not once but over and over as i had sat listening to crassus and letting my eyes wander about the room i turned and walked to the little statue of hercules in his lion hood marcus crassus was there a guard on this room during the day of course not my bodyguards go where i go the room was empty so far as i know no one has legitimate business to come into this room except me but someone might have entered i suppose why do you ask marcus crassus you mentioned the blood on this statue to no one not even to morpheus he said wearily with whom i have a meeting long overdue and yet someone else in the house knew of it because since last we spoke someone has done a thorough job of removing the dried blood from the lions mane what see here where last night there was plentiful evidence of blood trapped in the sculpted furrows someone has since then deliberately and carefully scraped them clean you can even see where the metal has been newly scratched he pursed his lips what of it the rest of the room isnt freshly cleaned i see dust on the shelves and a circle from a wine cup on the table it seems unlikely that a slave would have given such a thorough cleaning to this particular object in this particular room with so much other work to do in preparation for the funeral besides any domestic slave fit for this house would have known how to clean a statue without scarring the metal no i think this was done hurriedly by someone who didnt know that the blood had already been noticed and hoped to prevent us from seeing it that someone was not alexandros and it surely was not zeno whereby it follows that the murderer of lucius licinius or someone who knows something about die murder is here among us actively concealing evidence possibly crassus admitted sounding weary and cross its getting chilly he complained plucking his chlamys from the centaur statue and wrapping it across his shoulders marcus crassus i think it might be a good idea to place a guard inside this room at all times to make sure that nothing else is taken or altered without our knowledge if you wish now is there anything else nothing marcus crassus i said quietly as i left the room walking backwards and nodding my head in deference xvi why you asked eco signing sceptically the next morning when i told him of my midnight conversation with crassus i took the question to mean why should such a great man confide so much to a man like you why not i said splashing my face with cold water whom else can he talk to in this house eco squared his shoulders and mimed a beard on his face yes marcus mummius is his old friend and confidant but at the moment theyre feuding about the fate of the slave apollonius eco stuck his nose in the air and painted tendrils of hair swept back from his forehead yes theres faustus fabius but i cant imagine crassus showing weakness to a patrician especially a patrician who happens to be his subordinate eco circled his arms in a hoop before him and puffed his cheeks i shook my head sergius orata no crassus would be even less likely to show weakness to a business associate a philosopher would be a natural choice but if crassus has one hes left him behind in rome and he despises dionysius yet crassus desperately needs someone anyone to listen to him here and now because the gods are too far away he faces a great crisis he is full of doubt doubt hounds him from hour to hour moment to moment and not just about his decision to take on spartacus i think he secretly doubts even his decision to massacre gelinas slaves hes a man used to absolute control and clearcut decisions counting up tangible profits and losses the past haunts him bloody chaos and the death of those he loved most now hes about to step into a dark and uncertain future a terrible gamble but one worth taking because if he succeeds he may at last become so powerful that no power on earth can ever harm him again i shrugged so why not tell everything to gordianus the finder from whom no one can keep a secret anyway as for confidentiality im famous for it almost as well known for keeping my mouth shut as you are eco splashed me with a handful of water stop that besides theres something about me that compels others to empty their hearts i said it jokingly but it was true there are those to whom others quite naturally confide their deepest secrets and i have always been one of them i looked at myself in the mirror if the power to pull the truth from others resided somewhere in my face i couldnt see it it was a common face i thought with a nose that looked as if it had been broken though it had not common brown eyes and common black curls streaked with more and more strands of silver every year with the passing of time it had come to remind me of my fathers face as best as i could recall it my mother i barely remembered but if my father told the truth when he insisted she had been beautiful then i had not inherited her looks it was also a face that badly needed a shave if i was to put in a decent appearance at the funeral of lucius licinius come eco surely out of ninetynine slaves gelina has one whos a decent barber you shall have a shave as well i said it just to please him but when i glanced at his smiling face in the morning sunlight i saw that there actually was a faint shadow across his jaw yesterday you were a boy i whispered under my breath ironic as it sounds there is nothing quite so alive as a roman household on the day of a funeral the villa was full of guests who thronged the atrium and the hallways and spilled over into the baths while eco and i reclined on couches submitting our jaws to be shaved naked strangers loitered about the pools refreshing themselves after hard morning rides from points as distant as capua and the tar side of vesuvius others had arrived by boat ferried across the bay from surrentum stabiae and pompeii after my ablutions i stood on die terrace of the baths and looked down on the boathouse where the short pier was too small for all the arrivals skiffs and barges were lashed to one another so that the later arrivals had to walk to the pier over a small floating city of boats metrobius draped in a voluminous towel joined me on the balcony lucius licinius must have been a popular man i said he snorted dont imagine theyve all come just to see poor lucius go up in smoke no all these wealthy merchants and landowners and vacationing nobility are here for quite a different reason they want to impress youknowwho he glanced over his shoulder toward the heated pool where the slave apollonius was helping an old man emerge from the water i had to push and shove all through the house to get here the atrium is already so crowded i could hardly cross it i havent seen so much black in one place since sulla died over in puteoli though i noticed he said wrinkling his nose that most of the visitors were giving the corpse a wide berth he laughed softly and theyre already whispering jokes usually that doesnt start until after the ceremony when the eating begins jokes you know stepping up to the bier peering into the corpses mouth then sighing the coin is still there imagine that with crassus in the house and dont you dare repeat that to crassus he quickly added or at least dont tell him that you heard it from me he stepped away with a dry smile apparently he had forgotten that he had told me the same joke the day before i peered over the balcony again wondering how i would ever manage to discover what had been dumped off the pier with so many vessels moored there many of the rowers were still in their boats or loitered about the boathouse waiting for their masters to return eventually i found eco who had disappeared into one of the cubicles for a cool bath to follow his hot one we dressed in the sombre black garments that had been laid out for us that morning the slave apollonius assisted us with the various tucks and folds his bearing was grave as suited the occasion but his eyes were a clear and dazzling blue unclouded by the fear that haunted the eyes of the other slaves was it possible that mummius had somehow kept him from knowing what the next day might bring more likely i thought mummius had secredy assured him that he himself would be spared did he know that mummius had failed to sway crassus as he dressed me i took the opportunity to study him more closely that he was beautiful was obvious at a glance and yet the closer and longer i looked the more beautiful he seemed his perfection was almost unreal like the famous discus thrower of myron come to life as he moved the shifting planes of light across his face highlighted a succession of cameos each more striking than the last where many youths of his age have a stumbling gait he moved like an athlete or a dancer without any trace of artifice his hands were nimble infusing every movement with an innate and unassuming grace when he stood close to me i felt the heat of his hands and smelled the warm sweetness of his breath there are rare moments when one senses not the surface of other men and women but the very life force which animates their being and by extension all life i have glimpsed it in moments of passion with bethesda and on a few other occasions in the presence of men or women in great extremity in the throes of orgasm or close to death or otherwise reduced by crisis to their very essence it is a frightening and an awesome thing to see beyond the veils of the flesh into the soul somehow the force of life in apollonius was so great that it rent through those veils or else suffused them with the perfect physical embodiment of itself it was hard to look at him and imagine that something so alive so perfect could ever grow old and die much less be snuffed out in an instant merely for the aggrandizement of a politicians career i suddenly felt a great pity for marcus mummius on the journey from rome aboard the fury i had callously remarked that he had no poetry in his soul i had spoken rashly and in ignorance mummius had touched the face of eros and been stricken no wonder he was so desperate to save the boy from a senseless death at the hands of crassus little by little the guests emptied the house and lined the road that led away from the villa those who had been closest to gelina or lucius congregated in the courtyard to become part of the procession the designator a small wizened man whom crassus had hired and brought over from puteoli set about arranging the participants in their places eco and i having no place in the procession walked on ahead to find a sunny spot on the crowded treelined road at length we heard the strains of mournful music the sound grew louder as the procession came into view the musicians led the way blowing on horns and flutes and shaking bronze rattles in rome deference to public opinion and the ancient law of the twelve tables might have restricted the number of musicians to ten but crassus had hired at least twice that number clearly he meant to impress next came the hired mourners a coterie of women who walked with a shuffling gait wore their hair undressed and chanted a refrain that paraphrased the playwright naeviuss famous epitaph if the death of any mortal saddens hearts immortal the gods above must this mans death bemoanthey stared straight ahead oblivious of the crowd they shivered and wept until great torrents of tears streamed down their cheeks there was a small gap in the procession just long enough for the plaintive song of the mourners to recede before the buffoons and mummers arrived eco brightened at their approach but i inwardly groaned there is nothing quite so embarrassing as a funeral procession marred by incompetent clowns these however were quite good even at the end of the holiday season there is no lack of firstrate entertainers on the cup and the designator had hired the best while some of them resorted to crude but effective slapstick drawing polite laughter from the crowd there was one among them with a stirring voice who recited snatches of tragic poetry most of the standard passages used in funeral processions are familiar to me but these words were from some fresh and unfamiliar poet of the epicurean school what has death to frighten man if souls can die as bodies can when mortal frame shall be disbanded this lump of flesh from life unhanded from grief and pain we shall be free we shall not feel for we shall not be but suppose that after meeting fate the soul still feels in its divided state whats that to us for we are only we while body and soul in one frame agree and if our atoms should revolve by chance and our castoff matter rejoin the dance what gain to us would all this bring this newmade man would be a newmade thing we dead and gone would play no part in all the pleasures nor feel the smart which to that new man shall accrue whom of our matter time moulds anew take heart then listen and hear what is there left in death to fear after the pause of life has come between alls just the same had we never been the reciter was abruptly interrupted by one of the buffoons who shook a finger in his face what a lot of nonsense my body my soul my body my soul the buffoon parroted rocking his head back and forth what a lot of epicurean nonsense i had an epicurean philosopher in my house once but i kicked him out give me a dullasdishwater stoic like that clown dionysius any day there were some warm chuckles of recognition among the crowd i gathered this must be the arch mime employed by the designator to present a fond parody of the deceased and dont think for an instant that ill pay you even half a copper for such pathetic poetry either he went on still wagging his finger nor for any of this socalled entertainment i expect true value for my money do you understand true value money doesnt fall from the sky you know at least not into my hands into the hands of my cousin crassus maybe but not mine he abruptly pursed his lips and turned on his heel clasped his hands behind his back and began to pace i overheard the man next to me whisper hes got licinius down to perfection uncanny the mans wife agreed but dont think that just because i wont pay you its because i cant pay you piped the arch mime i could i would only i owe debts to seven shops in puteoli and six in neapolis and five in surrentum and four in pompeii and three in misenum and two in herculaneum the arch mime gasped and took a deep breath plus a longstanding debt to a little grandmother who sells apples by the side of the road right here in baiae once i have them all paid off come back and try another poem you epicurean fool and perhaps ill sing another tune another tune hooted the man beside me sing another tune said his wife nodding and laughing appreciatively apparently the arch mime had delivered one of lucius liciniuss pet phrases oh i know he went on crossing his arms petulantly you all think im made of money because i live like a king but it just isnt so at least not yet he bobbed his eyebrows up and down but just you wait because i do have a plan oh yes a plan a plan a plan for making more money than you baian big boys could swallow with a serving spoon a plan a plan make way for the man with a plan he bleated breaking character and running to catch up with the other buffoons a plan the man next to me murmured just as lucius was always saying smiled his wife always going to get rich tomorrow she sighed only this happened instead the will of the gods and the ways of fortune the man concluded i remembered sergius oratas hints of shady dealings a disquieting suspicion began to form in my head then unravelled and vanished with the arrival of the waxen masks luciuss branch of the licinii family had not been without its distinguished ancestors their lifelike images in wax normally displayed within his foyer were now paraded before his funeral bier worn by persons especially hired for the task by the designator and dressed in the authentic costumes of the offices they had held in service to the state such a presentation is part of the funeral procession of every roman noble the masked actors walk solemnly slowly turning their heads from side to side so that all may see their expressionless faces looking like the dead come to life thus even in death do the noble distinguish themselves from the ignoble the known from the unknown proudly flaunting their lineage to those of us in the crowd who have no ancestors only parents and forgotten forebears next came lucius licinius himself reposed upon his ivory couch and framed by freshly cut blossoms and boughs redolent with powerful perfumes that could not quite conceal the scent of putrefaction crassus was foremost among the bearers his face set in a stern impassive stare the family followed not many licinii of luciuss branch had survived the civil wars and most of them were of an older generation gelina led the group attended by metrobius i have often seen women in funeral processions on the streets of rome who stagger in a paroxysm of grief tearing their cheeks in defiance of the laws of the twelve tables but gelina did not weep she moved in a stupor staring at her feet conspicuously absent from the procession were the slaves of the dead mans household after the family passed the onlookers who lined the road closed in behind them and joined the retinue at length we came to an open spot beside the road where a break in the trees afforded a glimpse of the bay nearby stood a stone sepulchre as tall as a man it was newly built the slabs were smooth and unweathered and the earth surrounding it was worn by footsteps and dusted with chiselled stone there was only one decoration a simple basrelief of a horses head the ancient symbol of death and departure in the centre of the clearing a funeral pyre had been erected of dried wood piled in the form of a square altar normally the ivory couch bearing the corpse might have been tilted against it as such couches are tilted against the rostra in the forum at rome so that the spectators may look upon the dead man while the oration is delivered but luciuss corpse was placed directly upon the pyre out of sight no doubt in deference to the disfiguring wound on his head slaves came forward with folding chairs for the family as the crowd setded marcus crassus stepped in front of the pyre a hush fell over the gathering overhead a sea gull screamed a slight breeze stirred the treetops crassus began his speech in his voice there was no hint of the indecision and uncertainty he had shown to me the night before his was a trained orators voice skilled at all the techniques of volume tonality and rhythm he began in a quiet deferential tone that gradually grew more forceful gelina devoted wife of my beloved cousin lucius licinius family members who have come from places far and near shades of his ancestors represented here by their cherished images friends and members of his household acquaintances and people of baiae and all the nearby towns of campania and the cup we have come to entomb lucius licinius what a simple thing that seems a man has died and so we consume his body with flames and entomb his ashes it is a common event even the fact that he died by violence does not distinguish it nowadays such violence has become commonplace certainly in our family there has been so much grief and loss imposed by violence that we have become brittle and numb to the vagaries of fortune and yet the presence of so many of you here today is proof that the death of lucius licinius was no small thing just as his life was no small thing he had many dealings with many men and who among you can say that he was ever less than honest he was a roman and an embodiment of roman virtues he was a fine husband that the gods had not blessed his marriage with offspring that he leaves behind no son to carry on his name and blood to revere him as he revered his ancestors that is one of the accomplishments left unfulfilled by the untimely and bitter tragedy of his death with no son to look after his grieving widow or to avenge his senseless murder those duties have fallen to another to a man tied to lucius by bonds of blood and long years of mutual respect those duties fall to me word has already spread among you concerning the manner in which lucius met his death have no doubt that he faced it bravely he was not a man to flinch in the face of any adversary perhaps his only fault was that he placed his trust in those who did not deserve it but what man can foresee the moment when a trusty blade long used will suddenly break or a loyal dog will turn vicious without warning the fate of lucius licinius is far from unique indeed in some ways he is the paradigm of the good citizen and of the state itself for does not rome suddenly find herself imperilled by a whole nation of trusted mastiffs gone mad with a lust for blood and thievery lucius was another victim of that pestilence which threatens to overturn the order of nature to wipe out tradition and honour to pervert the normal intercourse of affairs between men that pestilence has a name i will not whisper it for i do not fear it spartacus that pestilence entered even into the household of lucius licinius it dissolved the bonds of obligation and loyalty it twisted the hands of slaves against their master what happened in his house cannot be forgotten or forgiven the shade of lucius licinius is restless it hovers near us even now strengthened by the shades of his ancestors who all together clamour that we the living must set this wickedness aright i looked about me at the faces of the funeral guests they watched crassus with mingled admiration and sorrow open to whatever pronouncement he was preparing i felt a pang of dread there are those who might say that lucius licinius was beyond all doubt a good man but not a great one that he did not rise in his lifetime to high office did not accomplish wondrous things that is the tragic truth i fear he was slain before his prime and his life was smaller than it should have been but his death was not a small death if there can be a great death then the death of lucius was that something terrible awful profoundly wrong an offence to god and man alike such a death demands more than sorrow and pity more than words of praise or vows of vengeance it demands that we all take action if not as the vessels of vengeance then as its witnesses crassus lifted his arm on either side of him the designator and one of his men set about igniting their torches which burst into flame long ago our ancestors founded the tradition of holding gladiatorial contests in honour of the dead normally this glorious tradition is reserved for the death of the great and powerful but i think that the gods will not begrudge our paying honour to the shade of lucius licinius with a day of games these will begin tomorrow upon the plain beside lake lucrinus there are those who whimper that we should suspend the use of gladiators saying that spartacus was a gladiator and that no slave should bear arms so long as spartacus runs loose but i say it is better to honour the traditions of our ancestors than to fear a slave i say also that the occasions of these games will give us not only the opportunity to pay our last respects to the shade of lucius licinius but to begin the task of avenging his death crassus stepped aside he took one of the torches and touched it to the pyre while opposite him the designator did the same the dry wood ignited and crackled shooting up tongues of flame and fingers of grey smoke in time the pyre would be consumed the embers would be soaked with wine and the bones and ashes of lucius licinius would be gathered up by crassus and gelina who would sprinkle them with perfumes and place them in an alabaster urn a priest would purify the crowd moving among them and sprinkling them with water from an olive branch the remains of lucius would be sealed into his sepulchre and together the crowd would murmur farewell farewell farewell but i left before these things were done i was not purified i did not say farewell instead i slipped quietly away and returned to the house taking eco with me so little time remained before the slaughter would begin xvii where will we find the boy meto i wondered aloud the atrium which that morning had been thronged with funeral guests and their attendant slaves was deserted our footsteps echoed hollowly in the empty space the incense and the flowers were gone but their odour like that of the decaying corpse of lucius licinius lingered behind i followed my nose to the kitchens long before i found them i heard the din of activity there was much preparation still to be done for the funeral feast we stepped through a great wooden door and found ourselves swallowed up by noise and heat their tunics spotted with stains and soot the kitchen slaves scurried about hoarse voices cried back and forth heavy knives chopped against blocks of wood kettles boiled and hissed eco covered his ears to protest the din then pointed at a figure across the room little meto standing on a stool was reaching into a deep clay pot atop a table he looked around to see that no one was watching then pulled out a handful of something and stuck it into his mouth i walked across the room dodging to avoid the hurrying slaves and grabbed the neck of his tunic he gave a squawk and looked over his shoulder at me his mouth covered with a paste of honey millet and crushed nuts opened in a cry of distress then turned abruptly into a grin when he saw my face and as abruptly twisted into a howl of pain when a wooden spoon came down on his head with a crack out of the kitchen out out screamed an old slave whose superior dress and manner marked him as the chief cook he seemed ready to strike me as well then saw the iron ring i wore forgive me citizen but between meto pilfering sweets and the slaves of all these guests sneaking in to steal food we can hardly do our work could you please find an errand for the little pest precisely what i came for i said i gave meto a sharp slap on the rump as he hopped off the stool and scurried across the crowded room licking the honey from his fingers and tripping cooks and helpers in his wake eco caught him at the door and held him for me meto i cried catching up and closing the door behind us just the man i was looking for are you a swimmer meto he looked up at me gravely licking the sweet mash from the corners of his mouth he slowly shook his head no no sir you dont swim at all not a stroke he assured me i shook my head vexed you disappoint me meto though its no fault of your own i had convinced myself that you must be the offspring of a faun and a river nymph he was perplexed for a moment then laughed out loud at my foolishness but i know who swims better than anybody he offered yes who would that be come with me ill show you hes with the others in the stables he began to run down the hall until eco caught up with him and grabbed the neck of his tunic like a leash we followed his lead to the centre of the house through the atrium and out into the courtyard he broke from ecos grasp and hurried towards the stables we came to the open doors where the cooler air from within carried the mingled scents of hay and dung meto hurried on wait you said you were leading us to the stables i protested not those stables he called over his shoulder he pointed ahead and ran around the corner of the building i thought he must be playing a game with us until i turned the corner and saw the long low wooden annexe attached to the stone stables is there no end to this villa i muttered to eco then i saw the soldiers who guarded the doorway to the annexe the six of them sat crosslegged in a small clearing beneath the evergreens they failed to see us until a shrill whisde pierced the air i looked up and saw a seventh guard atop the red tile roof of the annexe his spear in the crook of his arm and his fingers in his mouth the six were on their feet immediately their swords drawn and their dice abandoned in the dust their chief officer or at least the one with the most insignia stepped towards me brandishing his sword and scowling through his greystreaked beard who are you and what do you want he asked gruffly he ignored meto who stepped past him and hurried to the annexe door i gathered that meto was already known to the guards one of them even reached down and ruffled his hair affectionately i held my hands at my sides a bit away from my body in clear sight eco glanced at me nervously and did the same my name is gordianus im a guest of gelina and of your general marcus crassus this is my son eco the soldier narrowed his eyes suspiciously then put his sword away its all right men he called over his shoulder hes the one marcus mummius told us about calls himself the finder and what do you expect to find here he no longer seemed like a fierce warrior ready to kill but instead appeared quite affable and polite more than anything else he looked like an extremely bored man glad for any interruption to break the monotony the slave boy led us here i explained i had forgotten that the stables had an annexe yes the stables hide it from the courtyard you cant see it at all from the house im told not even from the upper storey which makes it the perfect place to hide them all nicely out of sight hide whom i said forgetting what gelina had told me regarding the whereabouts of most of the slaves see for yourself it looks like little meto is quite eager for you to follow him its all right fronto he called to the guard who had ruffled metos hair you can open the door the guard produced a large brass key and fitted it into a lock which hung on a chain the lock opened and the door swung outward the guards stood at a distance their hands on their hilts and their eyes alert meto ran inside waving for us to follow the smell that came from within was quite different from that which came from the stables there was the sweet smell of straw to be sure but the odour of urine and waste came not from animals but from men the stench of human sweat was heavy in the air as well along with the smell of women in period and the mingled odours of rotting food and vomit it reminded me of the smell below the deck of the fury not as acrid with the stench of men on the verge of collapse but not relieved by fresh salt breezes either it had the foul closed musty stench of the slaughterhouse rather than the slave galley eco balked at stepping within but i took his arm the door closed behind us bang on the door and call out when youre ready to leave yelled the guard through the wood the chain rattled and the lock snapped shut it took my eyes a moment to adjust to the dimness there were only a few barred windows near the roof admitting beams of sunlight thick with dust what is this place i whispered i didnt expect an answer but the boy meto was nearby the master used it to store all sorts of things he said pitching his voice low to match mine old bits and saddles and blankets and broken chariot wheels and ox carts sometimes even swords and spears and shields and helmets but it was almost empty when master lucius died when master crassus came the next day this is where he put the slaves all but a few of us the place had fallen silent when we entered but now voices began to murmur in the darkness meto i heard an old woman call out meto come here and give us a hug the boy disappeared into the shadows as the room lightened i saw the woman who embraced him she sat on the strawlittered floor her white hair knotted in a bun her long pale hands trembling in the dim light as she fondled the boys hair everywhere i looked i saw more and more of them men women and children all the slaves who had been gathered up from the fields or released from unnecessary tasks in the house and locked away to await the judgment of crassus they sat huddled against the walls i passed between them walking the length of the long narrow room eco followed behind me gazing wideeyed from face to face and tripping against the uneven floor the smell of urine and waste grew stronger at the farther end of the room the slaves forced to sit nearby huddled as far as they could from the stench exposed to it day after day they must have grown used to it enough to bear it i covered my face with a fold of my heavy funeral garb and still i could hardly breathe i felt a tug at my knee meto gazed up at me gravely the best swimmer there ever was he assured me with a whisper better than leander and he could swim across the hellespont better than glaucus when he swam after scylla and glaucus was half fish no good it will do us if hes locked away here i thought then i saw the young man at whom meto pointed the youth knelt on the straw holding an old mans hands in his own and speaking in a low voice the pale light gave his face a marmoreal smoothness so that he looked more than ever like a statue come to life or a living youth turned to stone apollonius i said surprised to see him here he gave the old mans hands a final clasp then stood and brushed the straw from his knees the simple motion was as elegant as a poem there is the haughty manmade aristocracy of patricians like faustus fabius i thought and then there is the natural aristocracy of specimens such as this which proceeds from the gods without regard to earthly status why are you here i asked thinking crassus must have banished him from the house simply to spite mummius but his explanation was simple most of the slaves have been locked away here since the day the master was found dead a few of us have been allowed to stay at our posts sleeping in our usual quarters between the stables and the house like meto i come here as often as i can to see the others the guards know me and let me pass is he your father i said looking down at the old man apollonius smiled but his eyes looked sad i never had a father soterus knows herbs and poultices he tends the other slaves when theyre sick but now hes sick himself he craves water but cant drink and his bowels are loose look i think hes sleeping now once when i had a bad fever he tended to me night and day he saved my life that summer and all for nothing i could discern no bitterness in his voice no emotion at all it was like the voice of his namesake dispassionate and mysterious i held the cloth to my face and tried to catch a breath can you swim i asked remembering why i had come apollonius smiled a genuine smile like a dolphin he said there was a path which started just south of the annexe and led down to the boathouse switching back and forth down the steep hill below the southern wing and the baths the path was largely invisible from the house hidden by high foliage and the steep angle of the hillside it was a cruder path than the one i had taken down from the terrace at the north wing but it was welltrampled and in most places wide enough for two to walk abreast the boy meto led the way leaping over tree roots and scrambling down rock shelves eco and i descended at a more careful pace while apollonius followed deferentially behind us it was the warmest sleepiest hour of the day as we neared the boathouse i gazed up toward the hills thinking of the funeral congregation forced to stand for hours while the flames slowly disintegrated all that remained of lucius licinius i could see the tiny column of smoke rising above the treetops thick and white but quickly blown into tattered streamers by the sea breeze vanishing altogether as it dispersed into the blue above the little navy of boats moored at the pier knocked quietly against one another as we stepped onto the pier i noticed only a few dozing figures lounging in the boats their feet dangling in the water and their faces covered by broadbrimmed sailors hats most of the ferrymen and slaves had gone off scavenging for food following the scent of roasting meats from the kitchens above or else had slipped off to nap between the trees on the shady hillside what did you lose asked apollonius peering down into the clear water in the open space between two of the boats its not exactly that ive lost something but what am i to look for i dont really know something heavy enough to make a loud splash perhaps several such objects he looked at me dubiously then shrugged the water could be clearer but i suppose most of the silt stirred up by all these boats arriving will have settled by now and i could use more sunlight all these boats together cast a great shadow over the bottom but if i see anything that shouldnt be there ill bring it up to you he unbelted and stripped off his tunic then pulled his undertunic over his head and stood naked his tousled hair glinting blueblack in the sunlight while lozenges of light reflected off the water danced across the sleek muscles of his chest and legs eco looked at him with a mixture of curiosity and envy from beneath a broadbrimmed hat one of the sailors made a crude but appreciative whistle apollonius lifted an eyebrow but otherwise he ignored die sound long ago he must have grown used to having others take note of his appearance he squared his shoulders and drew several deep breaths then found a spot with room enough to dive into the water between two boats the surface barely rippled behind him i strode up and down the jetty peering into the green depths and catching glimpses of his naked whiteness as he darted amid the mossy stones and the wooden beams in the water he propelled himself as gracefully as he moved on land kicking with both legs in unison and using his arms as if they were wings a gull flew overhead the column of smoke from the faraway funeral pyre continued to rise above the trees still apollonius remained beneath the water at last i saw his face gazing up at me from the murky bottom then grow larger and larger as he propelled himself upward and at last broke through the surface i began to ask him what he had seen but he gasped and held up his hand he needed to breathe not speak gradually his breathing grew slower and more regular finally he opened his mouth to speak i thought but instead he sucked in a deep breath bent his body double and plunged beneath the surface again his kicking feet left a spume of tiny bubbles behind he dived straight down disappearing into the darkness i walked up and down the pier gazing over the edge the gull circled the smoke rose a cloud rolled across the sun by now the dozing figures in the boats had all awakened and were curiously watching us from beneath their hats hes been under a long time one of them finally said very long said another even for such a bigchestedboy ah its nothing said a third my brother dives for pearls and he can stay down twice as long as this ones been under even so i looked between the boats trying to see if he had come up in a hidden spot wondering if he had struck his head it had been a bad time to demand this task of him with so many boats moored at the dock apollonius himself had complained of the dark shadow covering the bottom even dolphins must need light to swim by no matter what the pearl divers brother might claim it hardly seemed possible that a man could stay underwater as long as apollonius had been gone i began to fret eco was no swimmer and neither was the boy meto by his own admission the idea of plunging into the water myself made me think of my ordeal of the other night i tasted seawater in my throat and felt it burn my nostrils and experienced a tremor of panic i looked at the scattered chorus of sailors hats and the shadowy faces beneath them you men i said at last there must be a good swimmer among you ill pay any one of you five sesterces to take a look under the pier and tell me whats happened to the slave there was a commotion among the scattered hats feet were drawn from the water faces appeared hands sought for balance hurry i shouted looking into the bottomless green darkness and feeling a cold fear grip my throat hurry dive from where you are ten sesterces but at that instant i was silenced by the bizarre apparition that emerged from the water at the end of the pier the ferrymen froze in their places and stared as a long gleaming blade soared straight upwards into the air wrapped in seaweed the sword glittered silver and green beneath the sun a long white muscular arm followed it and then the broad shoulders and gasping face of apollonius smiling in triumph xviii apollonius had compared himself to a dolphin and indeed lying naked on the pier with one arm slung over his face his broad clefted chest heaving for breath his pale flesh wet and glistening he looked to me like a young ocean god pulled from the deep the planks all around him were dark with water forming a rough outline of his body steam rose from his taut flesh and rainbowcoloured beads glinted amid the ridges of his belly meto fetched his undertunic which apollonius dropped casually onto his lap beside him the sword shone in the sunlight i knelt and plucked away the strands of seaweed it had not been underwater for long there were no traces of rust about the hilt i knew little enough about the workmanship of such weapons but from the decoration on the handle it appeared to be of roman manufacture apollonius sat up crossed his legs and leaned back against his arms he brushed one hand through his scalp and sent a spray of water through the air a few drops caught eco in the eye he wiped his face and looked at apollonius with an odd sullen fascination then averted his gaze they were about the same age i could imagine how intimidated eco must feel in the presence of another male of such superb appearance who could display his naked perfection without the least hint of awkwardness this is not the only one i said picking up the sword for a closer look far from it there are whole bundles of them lashed together with leather straps i tried to bring up a bundle but it was too heavy the straps are all knotted and bloated with water impossible to undo i finally managed to rub one of the straps against a blade and cut through it are swords all you saw he shook his head spears too bundled the same way and sacks full of something else they were tied shut so that i couldnt see inside and they were too heavy to lift i wonder what could be in those sacks i said and felt a glimmer of intuition how soon can you go down again apollonius shrugged a gesture which upset the pools of water nestled in his collarbone and sent them streaming like quicksilver over his chest ive caught my breath but i could use a knife this time the curious ferrymen kept their distance but had gathered close enough to overhear one of them offered his knife a strong blade fit for cutting leather straps and apollonius disappeared again beneath the water he was not gone long this time he resurfaced headfirst and when he pulled himself onto the pier it appeared that the knife was the only thing he carried he stuck in into the wood took his undertunic from meto then hurried towards the boathouse without a word meto ran after him eco and i followed apolloniuss left hand i noticed was clenched tightly shut he walked around the boathouse and leaned against the wall out of the ferrymens sight i approached him tilting my head quizzically cup your hands together he whispered like a bowl he extended his arm and opened his fist the wet coins slithered into my hands like a school of tiny silver fish the same coins having dried in the meantime made a higher more tinkling sound when i poured them onto the table in the library crassus had just returned from the funeral ceremony still garbed in his black vestments and smelling of wood smoke he raised a startled eyebrow you found them where in the shallows just off the pier the first night i arrived i saw someone dumping something from the dock whoever it was knocked me into the water and tried to drown me he very nearly succeeded it wasnt until today that i managed to send someone scavenging in the water the slave apollonius yes mummiuss favourite this is what he found sacks and sacks full of silver he says and not just coins there appear to be sacks full of gold and silver jewellery and trinkets as well and weapons weapons bundles of swords and spears not gladiatorial or ceremonial weapons but true soldiers weapons i brought one of the swords to show you but your guard confiscated it at the door and speaking of guards id suggest that you post several at the boathouse immediately i left eco and apollonius to keep an eye on the ferrymen but an armed guard will need to be set night and day until you can recover the whole cache crassus called to the guard outside the door and issued instructions then had him bring in the sword that apollonius had retrieved from the open door came the noise of the funeral guests in the atrium crassus waited for the door to shut before he spoke curious he said this was made at one of my own foundries here in campania from ore that came from one of my mines in spain you can see by this stamp on the pommel how did it come to be here more to the point i said where was it supposed to end up what do you mean if we assume that these things were being stored in the boathouse and had been put there by lucius licinius then what need did he have for so many weapons none had he gathered them for your use if i had wanted lucius to divert weapons from one of my foundries and to bring them here i would have told him so said crassus curdy then perhaps these weapons were being stored here for someone else who could possibly have a need for so many spears and swords crassus looked at me sternly comprehending but unwilling to say the name aloud consider the valuables i went on the coins and jewellery and metalwork all hoarded together in sacks like a pirates booty assuming that lucius didnt somehow steal it all then perhaps it was delivered to him as payment payment for what for something he himself didnt need but could obtain weapons crassus looked at me ashenfaced you dare to suggest that my cousin lucius was smuggling weapons to an enemy of rome what else is a reasonable man to assume when he comes upon a hoard of weapons and valuables all lumped together in a hidden place and the boathouse may not have been the only place where such things were stored in transit the slave boy meto mentioned to me that he sometimes saw swords and spears stored in the annexe behind the stables the place where the slaves are now imprisoned that annexe may have been empty of such wares when you arrived here but that doesnt mean that it hasnt housed shipments of weapons in the past and not only weapons meto also mentioned seeing stacks of shields and helmets i hear that some of the spartacans are reduced to wearing dried melon husks for helmets spartacus has a desperate need for wellmade armour crassus glared at me and took a deep breath but did not speak i also hear that spartacus has forbidden the use of money among his men theyre a nation without currency the necessities of life they take from the land and the people on it but they have no use for luxuries everything is shared spartacus believes that money will only corrupt his warriors to what better use could he put all the pretty coins and trinkets hes accumulated than to smuggle them outside his zone of influence in return for things that he and his warriors truly need things like swords shields helmets and spears crassus considered for a long moment but it couldnt have been lucius who dumped these things off the pier he objected youve just told me that you heard them being dropped into the water on the night you arrived you said that whoever was doing it then attacked and tried to drown you it certainly wasnt lucius unless you believe that his shade was stalking you on the pier that night no not his shade but perhaps his partner a partner in such a disgusting enterprise perhaps not perhaps lucius was innocent of the affair and the whole business was being conducted right under his nose without his knowledge perhaps he found out and thats why he was killed my cousins nose cast a considerable shadow but not long enough to hide a business like this and why do you insist on linking this discovery to his death you know as well as i that he was murdered by those escaped slaves zeno and alexandros do you honestly believe that marcus crassus did you ever believe it or is it simply so convenient to your own schemes that you refuse to see any other possibility the words came out in a rush louder and harsher than i intended crassus drew back the door opened and the guard looked inside i stepped back from crassus biting my tongue crassus dismissed the guard with a wave of his hand he crossed his arms and paced the room at length he stopped before one of the shelves and stared at a stack of scrolls there are more than a few documents missing from luciuss record he said in a slow cautious voice the log which should account for all the trips taken by the fury this summer the inventories of her cargo then summon the ships captain or one of her crew lucius dismissed the captain and the crew only a few days before i arrived why do you think i manned the vessel with mummius and my own men to fetch you ive sent messengers to look for the captain in puteoli and neapolis but without success even so theres evidence that lucius sent the vessel on a number of trips which are not accounted for what other documents are missing records to account for all sorts of expenses without knowing what was here before its impossible to know whats missing now then what i say is possible isnt it lucius licinius could have been transacting clandestine business without your knowledge treasonable business crassus was silent for a long moment yes and someone knows of this besides ourselves because someone was trying to conceal the evidence by hiding the weapons and booty underwater just as someone cleaned the blood from the statue that killed lucius the same person who must have pilfered the incriminating records isnt it far more likely that this person was responsible for luciuss death rather than two harmless slaves who suddenly decided to run off and join spartacus prove it said crassus turning his back to me and if i cant you still have a day and a night in which to do your work what if i fail justice will be done retribution will be swift and terrible i announced my pledge at the funeral and i intend to fulfil it but marcus crassus the death of ninetynine innocent slaves to no purpose everything i do he said slowly emphasizing each word has a purpose yes i know i bowed my head in defeat i tried to think of some final argument crassus walked to one of the windows and gazed out at the funeral guests who milled about in the courtyard the little slave boy meto you call him is running about announcing to the guests that the banquet is about to begin he said quietly its time to trade our black garments for white youll excuse me while i go to my room and change gordianus one last word marcus crassus if it comes to the crisis if what you have determined comes to pass i ask that you consider the honesty of the slave apollonius he might have kept his discovery of the silver a secret why when hes scheduled to die tomorrow the silver is of no value to him still if you could see your way to pardon him and perhaps the boy meto neither of these slaves has done anything of extraordinary merit but if you could show mercy rome is in no mood for mercy i think you will leave me now gordianus while i left the room he stood stockstill his arms crossed his shoulders stiff staring through the window at nothing just before i stepped through the door i saw him turn and gaze at the little pile of silver coins i had left on the table his eye glimmered and i watched the comer of his mouth quiver and bend into what might have been a smile the atrium was once again crowded with guests some still in black some already changed into white for the banquet i made my way through the crush ascended the steps and walked towards my room the little hallway was deserted and quiet the door to my room was slightly ajar as i drew close i heard strange noises from within i paused trying to make sense of them it might have been the sound of a small animal in pain or the nonsensical babbling of an idiot with his tongue cut out my first thought was that iaia had committed some further sorcery in my room and i approached cautiously i looked through the narrow opening and saw eco seated before the mirror contorting his face and emitting a series of uncouth noises he stopped scrutinized himself in the mirror and tried again he was trying to speak i drew back i took a deep breath i walked halfway up the hall then banged my elbow against the wall to make a noise so that he would hear i walked back to the room i found eco inside no longer before the mirror but sitting stiffly on his bed he looked up at me as i stepped inside and smiled crookedly then frowned and quickly looked out of the window i saw him swallow and reach up to touch his throat as if it hurt did crassuss guards come to take your place at the boathouse i said he nodded good look here on my bed our white garments for the banquet neatly laid out for us it should be a sumptuous feast eco nodded he looked out the window again his eyes were hot and shiny he bit his lip blinked and drew in a shallow breath something glistened wetly on his cheek but he quickly brushed it away xix the banquet was held in three large connected rooms along the eastern side of the house each with a view of the bay the guests flowed in like a ride of white sea foam the murmur of the crowd hummed in the highceilinged rooms like a faint ocean roar as his final duty the designator assigned the seating and saw that a slave showed each guest to his place crassus resplendent in white and gold held court in the northernmost room where he was joined by fabius mummius orata and the more important businessmen and politicians from the various towns around the cup gelina presided over the central room with metrobius at her side surrounded by iaia and olympias and the more prominent female guests to the third room the biggest and the farthest from the kitchens belonged those of us who belonged nowhere else the junior partners and second sons the leftovers and hangerson i was amused to see dionysius assigned to our company he balked when the slave showed him to his couch quietly demanded to see the designator and was then summarily sent back to his place across the room from eco and me stuck away in a corner not even beside a window in any normal circumstance the households resident philosopher would have been seated close to the master or mistress i suspected it was crassus who had instructed the designator to stick dionysius away in a dark corner as a deliberate snub he truly despised the philosopher since the time was as near to midday as evening dionysius elected to have his green potion before rather than after the meal to assuage his dignity he made quite a show of demanding it immediately and was unnecessarily rude to the young slave girl who ran to the kitchens to fetch it for him a few moments later she returned with trembling hands and set the cup on the little table in front of him i looked around the room at the various couches clustered about the little tables i saw no one i knew eco was pensive and withdrawn and had no appetite i was content to nibble at the delicacies placed before me and contemplate my course of action over the remaining hours from where i lay i could see straight into the farther rooms if i rose onto my elbow i could glimpse crassus sipping his wine and conferring with sergius orata it was orata who had first told me that lucius licinius had come into unexplained wealth did he know more than he had told me could he indeed have been the shadowy partner involved in luciuss smuggling scheme with his round blandly selfsatisfied face he hardly looked capable of murder but i have often found that rich men are capable of anything marcus mummius reclining close to crassus looked nervous and unhappy and why not considering that all his pleas for the salvation of apollonius had been rebuffed by crassus it struck me as unlikely that mummius could have been luciuss shadow partner given the bad blood between them over the matter of apollonius yet it occurred to me that mummius could have ridden up from the camp at lake lucrinus and back again on the night of the murder what if he had done so to give himself a chance to approach lucius again about buying the slave if lucius was half as stubborn as his cousin he would have refused once more to sell the slave could that have sent mummius into a murderous rage if so then by killing lucius mummius would have inadvertently set in motion the destruction of the very person he desired the young apollonius and the only way to save the boy would be to admit his own guilt what a pit of misery that would plunge him into my eye fell on crassuss left arm faustus fabius of the haughty jaw and the flaming hair he had met lucius licinius on the same occasions as mummius and thus had had the opportunity and the connections to have become luciuss shadow partner and to embark on what must have been a fabulously lucrative if extraordinarily dangerous enterprise mummius had told me that fabius came from a patrician family of limited means but of his character i knew very little such men face the world wearing masks more rigid than the waxen masks of their dead ancestors the fabii had been present at the birth of the republic they had been among the first elected consuls the first to wear the toga trimmed with purple and to sit in the ivory chair of state wrested from the kings it seemed presumptuous even to suspect a man of such high birth of treachery and murder but then such traits must run in the blood of patricians or else how did their ancestors pull down the kings stamp down their fellow romans and become patricians in the first place nearer at hand in the middle room my eyes fell on gelina she seemed the least likely candidate of all everything indicated that her love for her husband had been genuine and that her grief was deep iaia however low her opinion of lucius also seemed unlikely besides she and olympias had been in cumae on the night of the murder or so i had been told would any of the women in the house even olympias have had the strength to smash luciuss skull with the heavy statuette and then to drag his body into the atrium or to carry the bundles of weapons from the boathouse to the pier and to knock me into the water the same might be asked of metrobius given his age but he bore watching he had been a part of sullas inner circle and thus could possess few scruples even about murder he was a man who held long and festering grudges as i knew from his tirade against mummius retired from the stage bereft of his lifelong benefactor deprived by the passing years of his legendary beauty in what secret pursuits did he invest his restless energies he was devoted to gelina and had despised lucius could he have used gelinas misery as an excuse to kill her husband was he the shadow partner his hatred for lucius wouldnt necessarily have kept him from investing a part of his accumulated fortune in luciuss schemes it was even possible i thought that he might have foreseen crassuss decision to annihilate the slaves including apollonius as a consequence of the murder thus by killing lucius and letting events take their course he could wreak a terrible revenge on mummius but was even his subtle and conniving mind capable of such a vicious and convoluted plot of course despite my discoveries at the boathouse and all evidence to the contrary it could still be that it was the slaves who did it knocked off half of luciuss head and then ran off to spartacus for an instant i thought it was a god who spoke reprimanding me for my lurid speculations and reminding me of the one possibility i refused to consider then i recognized the voice which came from the couch behind me it was the man i had overheard gossiping with his wife at the funeral they were gossiping again but remember crassuss oration the slaves wont go unpunished and a good thing said the woman smacking her lips one has to draw a line slaves of the lower sort can never be relied upon to know their place let them witness an atrocity such as this one in their own household and theyre spoiled forever no use to anyone for anything once theyve seen another of their kind get away with murder from that point on you can never turn your back on them best to put them out of their misery i say and if you can turn that to setting a good example for other slaves then all the better that marcus crassus knows the right way to do things well he certainly knows how to run his own affairs the man agreed his wealth speaks for that they say he wants the command against spartacus and i hope those fools in the senate for once have the wisdom to give the right job to the right man hes a tough nut no doubt about that it takes a hard man to put a household of his own slaves to death and thats just the sort we need right now a stem hand to deal with the thracian monster my dear could you pass me one of those green olives and perhaps a spoonful more of the apple sauce for my calf s brains delicious alas that crassus should have to put such splendid cooks to death as well but hes going to do it even so thats what ive heard and poor pitiful gelina shaking her head the whole time and wishing it wasnt so shes always had a soft heart just like lucius had a soft head and you see whats come of that but not marcus crassus hard head and an even harder heart he allows not a single exception to roman justice and thats as it should be you cant make exceptions in times like these no you certainly cant but a man would have to be as unflinching as cato to put to death a cook who can create a dish as exquisite as this the man smacked his lips shhh dont speak the word what word death cant you see the serving girl is just over there so its bad luck to say the word out loud where a doomed slave can hear they were quiet for a moment then the woman spoke again draughty in here isnt it now woman dont start the food gets cold having to come so far from the kitchens i think youre eating fast enough that you neednt worry about that well even so that selfsatisfied designator might have put us in one of the better rooms if youd had the nerve to ask as i told you to my dear dont start on that again the foods the same im sure and you cant complain about that the food maybe but you cant say the same for the company youre twice as rich as anybody in this room we really should have been put closer to crassus or at least in the middle room with gelina there are only so many rooms and so many couches sighed the man and there are more people here than ive seen at a funeral banquet in many a year still you have a point about the people in this room not exactly the cream are they look over there at that philosopher fellow who lives here dionysius i think hes called yes like half the greek philosophers in italy the woman grunted this ones not particularly distinguished from what i hear strictly secondrate they say i cant imagine why lucius kept him on i suppose gelina picked him out and theres no accounting for her taste except in the matter of cooks with lucius gone hell be hardpressed to find a situation as comfortable as this one who needs a secondrate philosopher about the house especially a stoic when there are so many good epicureans to choose from especially here on the cup a disagreeable fellow and rather uncouth as well just look at him making faces and sticking out his tongue like that really youd think he was only halfcivilized yes i see what you mean hes making quite a spectacle of himself isnt he more like a buffoon than a polymath dionysius hardly seemed the type to display bad table manners even if he was piqued at his placement i turned my head to have a look for myself he did indeed appear to be making faces wrinkling his nose and pushing his tongue in and out of his mouth but he does look funny the woman admitted like one of those hideous masks in a comedy she started to laugh and her husband joined her but dionysius was not striving for comic effect he clutched at his throat and pitched forward on his couch with a spastic jerk he sucked in a wheezing breath and then with his tongue half out of his mouth tried to speak the garbled words were barely audible from where i sat my tongue he gasped on fire and then air air by now others had begun to notice him the slaves stopped serving and the guests turned their heads to watch as dionysius went into convulsions he drew his arms stiffly to his chest as if trying to control the spasms and kept pushing out his tongue as if he could not bear to have it in his mouth is he choking asked the woman i dont think so said her husband who then snorted in disapproval really this is too much he protested as dionysius bent forward and began to vomit onto the little table set before his couch a number of guests sprang to their feet the commotion spread gradually into the middle room like a ripple passing through a pond gelina frowned anxiously and turned her head a moment later the whispers spread to the far room where crassus laughing at one of oratas jokes turned and peered quizzically through the doorways i caught his eye and waved at him urgently gelina rose to her feet she hurried towards me crassus followed with measured steps they both arrived in time to witness the philosopher disgorge another spume of greenish bile onto a tray of what had been calf s brains with apple sauce while a semicircle of alarmed guests looked on i pushed my way through the crowd just as i stepped next to crassus the guests wrinkled their noses in unison and stepped back a pace the philosopher had soiled himself crassus made a face at the smell gelina hovered at the philosophers side trying to help but afraid to touch him dionysius suddenly convulsed and catapulted forward from his couch falling against the little table of delicacies the crowd drew back to avoid the flying calf s brains and bile the cup that had held dionysiuss herbal concoction tumbled through the air and landed at my feet with a clang i knelt picked it up and peered inside there was nothing to see but a few green drops dionysius had drained it dry crassus clutched my arm with a bruising grip what in hades is happening he demanded clenching his teeth murder i think perhaps zeno and alexandros strike again crassus was not amused part four funeral games xx one disaster follows another crassus stopped pacing long enough to stare at me with one eyebrow raised as if holding me responsible for complicating his life for once i think i shall actually be glad to get back to the relative calm and security of rome this place is accursed i agree marcus crassus but cursed by whom i glanced at the corpse of dionysius which lay sprawled on the library floor where crassus had ordered his men to put it for want of a better place simply to get it out of sight of the dinner guests eco stood peering down at the dead mans contorted face apparently fascinated by the way that dionysiuss tongue refused to recede into his mouth crassus pinched his nose and made a wave of dismissal take it away he shouted to one of his bodyguards but where shall we put him marcus crassus anywhere find mummius and ask him what to do just get the body out of here now that i no longer have to listen to the fool i certainly dont intend to put up with his stench he fixed his stare on me poison gordianus an obvious deduction given the symptoms and circumstances yet the rooms were full of other people eating no one else was affected because no one else drank from dionysiuss cup he had a peculiar habit of drinking some herbal concoction before his midday meal and again with his dinner crassus blinked and shrugged yes i remember hearing him extol the virtues of rue and silphium at other meals another of his irritating affectations and an ideal opportunity for anyone who might wish to poison him a drink which he alone ingests and always at a prescribed time and place you must agree now marcus crassus that there is a murderer at large here in this house quite likely its the same person who murdered lucius since only last night dionysius publicly pledged to expose that person this could hardly have been the work of alexandros or zeno and why not zeno may be dead but we still dont know where alexandros is or with whom he might be in contact no doubt he has confederates in the household among the kitchen slaves yes perhaps he does have friends in this house i said but i was not thinking of slaves obviously it was a mistake for me to allow any of the slaves to go on serving gelina as soon as the dinner is finished and the overnight guests are seen to their quarters i shall have every slave rounded up and locked into the annexe it would have to be done in the morning anyway fabius he called to faustus fabius who had been waiting in the hall and issued instructions fabius nodded coolly and left the room without even looking at me i shook my head wearily why do you think it was one of the slaves who poisoned dionysius marcus crassus who else had access to the kitchens where no one would notice i suppose thats where dionysius kept his herbs all sorts of people have been in and out of the kitchens all day people were halfstarved from waiting for dinner guests dropped by to filch food or sent slaves to do it for them long before the meal began the kitchen slaves were rushing about and could hardly be expected to take note of everyone who stepped in their way and youre mistaken crassus dionysius gathered his herbs himself and kept them in his room he sent fresh batches down to the kitchens to be prepared each day he usually bundled them up first thing in the morning and gave them to a kitchen slave but today he didnt deliver them until after the funeral that means the herbs could have been tampered with in dionysiuss room this morning while everyone was busy preparing for the funeral how do you know all this because while you and your men were gathering up dionysiuss body and bringing it here i asked a few questions of the serving girl who brought him the drink tonight she says that he brought the herbs to the kitchen after returning from the funeral as usual they were already mixed and crushed and gathered up in a scrap of cloth apparently dionysius made quite a ritual of measuring and preparing them in advance she herself added the watercress and grape leaves then boiled and strained the concoction just before the meal she could have added the poison as well crassus insisted you must know something of poisons gordianus what do you think it was i would guess aconitum panthersdeath some people call it that its said to be palatable so he might not have noticed it in his concoction its the fastest of poisons the symptoms match a burning in the tongue choking convulsions vomiting loosening of the bowels death but who i wondered aloud would have known enough of such things to have obtained the poison and administered a proper dose i glanced at eco who pursed his lips he had napped while i browsed through the various herbs and extracts in the house of iaia at cumae but i had told him about them later crassus stretched his shoulders and grimaced i hate funerals even worse than funerals are funeral games at least this will all be over tomorrow if only dionysius had been able to tell us what he knew about the murder of lucius i said if indeed he knew anything at all i should like to have a look in his rooms certainly crassus shrugged his mind had already wandered to other matters i found the boy meto in the atrium and instructed him to show us to the philosophers chambers we passed the dining rooms the meal had abruptly ended with the death of dionysius and the withdrawal of the host and hostess but many of the guests still lingered among the tables and couches i paused and searched the crowd who are you looking for asked meto iaia and her assistant olympias the painter lady left already he said right after the philosopher started having his fit left the room left the house for her own house at cumae i know because she sent me to the stables to see that their horses were ready too bad i said i should very much like to talk with her meto led us farther up the hall and around a corner here it is he said indicating the door to dionysiuss rooms the apartment consisted of two small rooms separated by a hanging curtain in the outer room a round table was surrounded by chairs set beside a window that faced the low wooded hills on the west a clay urn was set atop a small table in one corner when i lifted the lid i smelled the mingled scents of rue silphium and garlic dionysiuss concoction poisoned or not it should all be burned or emptied into the bay to be sure it harms no one else the inner room furnished with a stoics austerity contained only a sleeping couch a hanging lamp and a large trunk not much to see i remarked to eco unless something has been hidden out of sight i started to open the trunk and found that it was clasped shut with a lock that required a key we could break it open i suppose i doubt that crassus would object and we can ask the shade of dionysius to forgive us indeed it looks to me as if someone has already tried to force it open and failed see the scratches and this scarred strip of metal eco we shall need a strong slender bar of steel to pry it open why not use the key suggested meto because we dont have it i said meto smiled mischievously then flattened himself on the floor wriggled under the couch and emerged clutching a simple brass key in his tiny fist i threw up my hands meto you are invaluable every household needs a slave like you he grinned and hovered over me as i stopped to fit the key into the lock indeed meto i think you will grow up to be like those slaves in plautuss plays the ones who always know whats going on when their masters are too stupid or lovestruck to see the truth whoever had tried to force the lid had jammed the lock as well so that i had to jiggle the key plautuss clever slaves always come in for a chiding from their jealous masters but the world could never manage without them ah there its open what treasures did the philosopher find so valuable that he locked them safely away i wonder i pushed the lid up eco sucked in a breath meto started back blood he whispered yes i agreed most assuredly blood atop the other scrolls that had been unrolled and laid flat within the trunk was a strip of parchment covered with tiny crabbed writing over which had been cast a great spattered stain of blood the missing documents i asked back in the library crassus pored over the flattened sheets one by one finally he nodded yes there are the records i was searching for together with others i had no idea existed full of all sorts of irregularities and cryptic references expenditures and amounts received itemized in some sort of secret code i shall have to take them back to rome with me after the funeral games theres no way to make sense of it all without considerable time and study perhaps my chief accountant can decode them i saw that the notation a friend recurs several times always connected to a sum of money often a rather large sum you dont suppose that could be a record of investments and disbursements relating to luciuss silent partner crassus gave me a disgrunded look what i really want to know is what these documents were doing in dionysiuss room i have a theory i said im sure you do we know that dionysius wanted to solve luciuss murder if only to impress you with his cleverness suppose he was ahead of us when it came to noticing the bloodstains on the statue that was used to kill lucius and had already concluded even before i arrived that lucius was murdered in this room suppose also that he had some inkling of luciuss shady dealings after all he lived in the house and might very well have noticed the flow of silver and arms no matter how secretive lucius might have been crassus nodded go on knowing these things he must have purloined these documents himself before you had a chance to find them taking them from this room to his own where he could peruse them in secret and search for clues to the murderers identity perhaps but how do you account for this he pointed to the bloodstained scroll lucius must have been looking at it when he was killed it must have been open here on this table and the murderer who was so careful to drag luciuss body into the atrium left this document for dionysius to find the next time he came into the library it seems to me that the killer would have destroyed it rather than leave it for dionysius to ferret away this would indicate that the document has nothing to do with the murder crassus stared at me grimly then slowly smiled when he saw that i had no answer he shook his head and laughed softly i will say this gordianus you are tenacious if it makes you feel better ill admit that i myself am not entirely satisfied with what we know of the circumstances surrounding luciuss death it does appear from the evidence you found in the water and from these documents that my dear foolish accursed cousin was involved in smuggling weapons to someone yes perhaps even to spartacus but that only weakens your case and strengthens mine i dont see it that way marcus crassus dont you when word arrived that i was coming on short notice lucius panicked and tried to sever his contacts with the representatives of spartacus the customers who bought his stockpile of weapons seeing they would get no more out of lucius they set about taking their revenge on him who could these criminals these agents of spartacus have been who else but zeno and the thracian alexandros who were nothing less than spartacan spies in this household yes i see it quite clearly now hear me out gordianus they confronted lucius here in the library in the dead of night zeno who helped keep his masters books produced these various documents exposing luciuss perfidy and threatened to betray him to me if he didnt continue to smuggle arms to spartacus but even blackmail would not sway lucius he had decided to sever his ties with the spartacans and he would not be intimidated so zeno and alexandros murdered him using the statue just as you said to make his death more public they dragged his body into the atrium and began to scrape out the name of their master spartacus ah but dionysius was up late that night mulling over whatever it is that secondrate philosophers mull over in the middle of the night there was some scroll or other that he needed to fetch from luciuss library he must have made a noise which disturbed the assassins and sent them flying before they could finish carving the full name of their master dionysius enters the library and sees the bloody scroll he goes into the atrium and finds the body but instead of raising an alarm he concocts a scheme to further his own career he knows that ill be arriving the next day without lucius he has no patron but if he could somehow attach himself to me all would be to his benefit he thinks he can impress me by providing a solution to the murder he studies the bloodstained document comprehends its import and looks through the other scrolls for similarly incriminating evidence he takes them all back to his room to decipher and piece together at his leisure but why didnt he tell you these things sooner i protested perhaps he planned to reveal all he knew at the funeral games tomorrow thinking his eloquence could compete with the blood and drama in the arena or perhaps he was dissatisfied because there were still some scraps of evidence he couldnt quite piece together after all he wanted his presentation to me to be as impressive as possible or crassuss eyes lit up yes he cried dionysius was on the trail of alexandros and wanted to deliver the slave to me in person yes that solves everything after all who else would have poisoned him expect alexandros or another of the slaves acting to protect alexandros dionysius must have discovered alexandross hiding place and intended to deliver him publicly to me for the execution tomorrow together with all the evidence he had uncovered crassus shook his head ruefully ill admit it would have been quite a coup for the old buzzard a chance for him to show off in front of everyone gathered for the games id have had a hard time begrudging him a place in my retinue after that so the buzzard turned out to be a fox a dead fox i said dully yes and silent forever too bad he cant tell me where to find alexandros i should dearly love to have that scoundrel in my hands tomorrow id lash him to a cross and burn him alive for the crowds amusement his eyes glinted cruelly and he was suddenly angry do you see now gordianus how youve wasted my time and your own chasing after this illusion that the slaves were innocent you should have been setting your cleverness to catching alexandros for me and bringing him to justice but instead youve let the fiend commit another murder in front of your very eyes he began to pace furiously youre a sentimental fool gordianus ive met your type before always trying to intercede between a slave and his just deserts turning squeamish at the ugliness thats sometimes required to maintain roman law and order well youve done your best to stand in the way of justice in this case and by jupiter youve failed call yourself the finder indeed he began to shout we have your ineptitude to thank for dionysiuss death and for the fact that the murderer alexandros is still at large get out i have no use for such incompetence when i get back to rome i shall make you the laughing stock of the city see if anyone ever comes seeking the services of the socalled finder again marcus crassus out in his fury he seized the documents that littered the table crushed them in his fists and threw them at me they missed but one of them struck eco in the face and dont show yourself to me again unless you can bring me the slave alexandros in chains ready to be crucified for his crimes the man is more unsure of himself than ever i whispered to eco as we walked towards our room the strain of the funeral the bloodshed that looms tomorrow hes become overwrought suddenly i realized that my face was hot and my heart was beating fast my mouth was so dry i could hardly swallow was it marcus crassus i was talking about or was it myself i took a few steps and stopped eco looked up at me quizzically and touched my sleeve asking what we should do next i bit my hp suddenly confused and disoriented eco drew his brows together in an expression of concern i couldnt meet his eyes what was there left to do i had been in constant motion for days always able to glimpse the next step and now i suddenly found myself adrift perhaps crassus was right and my defence of the slaves had been a sentimental folly all along even if he was wrong my time was almost up and i had nothing to offer him except for the fact that i knew or thought i knew who had poisoned dionysius just as i thought i knew where the slave alexandros was hiding if i could do nothing else at least i might discover the truth for my own satisfaction in our room i produced the two daggers i had brought from rome and handed one to eco he looked at me wideeyed things may come to a crisis very suddenly i said i think it best that we arm ourselves the time has come to confront certain persons with this i pulled out the bloodstained cloak from where i had hidden it among our things i rolled it up tightly and tucked it under my arm we should bring cloaks for ourselves as well the night is likely to be chilly now to the stables we walked quickly down the hall down the stairway and through the atrium we stepped through the front doorway into the courtyard the sun had just begun to sink behind the low hills to the west we found meto in the stables attending to the horses for the night i told him to prepare mounts for eco and me but its getting dark he protested it will get even darker before i find my way back we were mounted and ready to begin pausing in front of the stables when faustus fabius and an armed cordon of guards passed through the courtyard between the ranks of soldiers in single file walked the last of the household slaves on their way to the annexe they walked silently meekly some had their heads bowed weeping others looked about with wide frightened eyes among them i saw apollonius who walked with his eyes straight ahead his jaw tightly clenched it seemed to me that the villa was being drained of its lifeblood all those who gave the great house its animation who kept it in motion from dawn to dusk were being emptied from its corridors the barbers and cooks the stokers of fires and openers of doors the servitors and attendants you there boy yelled fabius meto shrank back against my mount clutching at my leg his hands trembled my mouth went dry the boy is with me faustus fabius im on an errand for crassus and i need him faustus fabius waved for the contingent to continue to the annexe and stepped towards us i hardly think thats the case gordianus he gave me one of his aloof patrician smiles the story i hear is that you and marcus have parted ways for good and hed just as soon see your head on a platter as on your shoulders i doubt you should even be allowed to take his horses from the stables where are you headed anyway just in case crassus should ask cumae is it as bad as that gordianus that you need to ask the sibyl for help and with night falling or does your son want a last look at the beautiful olympias when i made no answer he shrugged an odd expression crossed his face and i realized that a bit of the bloodstained cloak folded and concealed beneath my own cloak had slipped into view i moved to cover it with my elbow at any rate the boy comes with me fabius said he grabbed metos shoulder but the child refused to let go of my leg fabius pulled harder and meto began to squeal slaves and guards turned their faces towards us eco grew agitated his mount began to neigh and stamp i whispered through my teeth have mercy on the boy faustus fabius let him come with me ill leave him with iaia in cumae crassus will never know fabius relaxed his grip meto shivering released my leg and reached up to wipe his eyes fabius smiled thinly the gods will thank you faustus fabius i whispered i reached down to scoop the child onto the horses back but fabius swiftly pulled him away and stepped back gripping him tightly fabius shook his head the slave belongs to crassus he said he turned and pushed meto stumbling and looking desperately back over his shoulder toward the other slaves i watched dumbly until the last guard disappeared around the corner of the stables twilight covered the earth and the first stars glimmered above at last i spurred my mount and set out to any god who might happen to be listening i said a prayer that morning would never come xxi we would have been wiser i chided myself afterwards to have taken the road to cumae rather than the shortcut through the hills that olympias had shown us it was on such nights i imagine that lemures escape from hades rise like vapour from lake avemus and go walking through the fog spreading the chill of death through the forest and across the barren hills the presence of the walking dead is attenuated and weak when compared to the vivid bloodrich fecundity of living matter like the paleness of a candle when seen beside the sun but in certain rimes and places as on battlefieids or around the entrances to the underworld the spirits of the dead are so concentrated that they can become as palpable as living flesh or so the phenomenon has been explained by those wiser than myself in such matters i only know that death stalked the way to cumae that night and that those it claimed would not have far to go to be sucked into the mouth of hades it was not hard to find our way at first we had no difficulty reaching the main road from the villa and ecos sharp eyes spotted the narrow trail that branched towards the west even in twilight the way looked familiar we passed through the stand of trees onto the bald ridge off to the north i saw the camp fires of crassuss soldiers clustered around lake lucrinus faint sounds of singing rose from the valley below beneath the rising moonlight i could make out the hulking mass of the arena its high wooden walls shone dully like the hide of a slumbering behemoth tomorrow it would awaken and devour its prey it was after we entered the woods and darkness fell that i became less certain of our way i had forgotten how faint the path became and how quickly without sunlight there was no way to be certain of the direction the full moon was still low in the sky and the blue glow it cast through the woods created a strange confused jumble of light and shadow wisps of fog coiled around us whether sea fog or vapours rising from the damp earth i could not tell perhaps the wisps were not fog at all but the wavering halfglimpsed spirits of the uneasy dead the stench of sulphur grew heavy on the dank air far away a wolf howled another joined it and then a third so near us that i gave a start three voices howling like the three heads of cerberus the night was colder than i had expected i pulled my cloak more tightly around my shoulders i thought of the cloak i carried under my arm and worried that the wolves could smell the blood that stained it and that it drew them nearer for a brief moment i thought i heard horses behind us then decided it was only our echo i pressed on less and less certain that i knew the way at last we came to a vaguely familiar spot where the sky opened above and the horses hooves clacked against hard stone my horse hesitated but i urged him on he hesitated again then eco grabbed my arm from behind and made a gulping noise of distress i let out a gasp we stood on the verge of the precipice overlooking lake avemus a gust of sulphurous heat blew against my face like the foul breath of pluto himself in the stillness i heard the wheezing and belching of the fumaroles and in my minds eye i saw the hapless dead struggling like drowning men amid the scalding muck far below the moon rose above the treetops and cast a sickly blue light across the waste in that illusory glow i saw the pocked scarred face of a monster too huge to comprehend and then as the light shifted imperceptibly and the fumaroles opened and closed i saw a vast bowl teeming with maggots the size of men from the distant woods across the lake visible only in jagged silhouette i heard the barking of three dogs together cerberus is loose tonight i whispered anything might happen eco made an odd stifled noise i bit my tongue cursing myself for frightening him i took a deep breath despite the stench of sulphur and turned towards him the blow descended and sent me flying head first from my hone ecos stifled noise had been a warning the blow came from behind and landed square between my shoulder blades even as i fell i wondered why the assassin chose to cudgel rather than stab me and i could only conclude that eco had somehow managed to deflect his blow perhaps it was an elbow that struck me or the pommel of a sword the palms of my hands struck the hard rock and went scraping over it some other part of me struck next probably my hip to judge from the bruises i noticed later i scrambled forward to the very brink of the precipice a hard kick landed against my ribs and sent me lurching halfway over the stone lip then i knew why i hadnt been stabbed as i could have been so easily caught unawares why leave evidence of murder when you can simply throw a man over a cliff to his death or perhaps it didnt matter how they killed me if they intended to dispose of me afterwards by casting my body into the fiery lake i would be swallowed whole by pluto bones and all i felt the breath of pluto hot on my face and reared back from the precipice i was kicked square on the buttocks i held my ground and was kicked again from somewhere behind me came a noise like the bleating of a slaughtered sheep eco crying out to me i rolled to the left not knowing whether the shelf ended there or not and steeling myself to plunge into empty space instead i rolled onto hard stone and scrambled to my feet spinning toward the assassin steel glinted in the moonlight and i dipped my head just in time the blade whooshed above me and the wake of its passing blew through my hair i reached for the assassins arm and caught him offbalance i never saw a face or even a body only the forearm i gripped with both hands and twisted at a cruel angle he gasped and cursed he reached with his other arm to take the blade from his useless hand i kneed him in the groin his free hand flailed aimlessly clutching at the sudden pain and i felt him weaken there was no way for me to take his knife or to reach for my own i lurched backwards pulling him with me and when i sensed that i had reached the edge of the cliff i spun about with all my strength forcing him to spin with me like an acrobat swinging his partner there was a sound of feet scuffling against bare rock and then his forearm was jerked from my grip as if something incredibly strong grabbed his feet and pulled him straight down i held him almost too long and felt myself jerked downward with him the blade in his fist whipped by and cut my hand i cried out and then staggered for a long dizzy moment on the verge i held out my arms like those of a crucified man reaching for balance my knees turned to water at that moment the barest shove would have sent me flying over the cliff or the barest backward tug on my cloak could have pulled me to safety where was eco i wheeled my arms wildly in the air and finally folded backwards landing with a grunt on my backside i twisted onto my hands and knees and sprang to my feet my horse stood a little to one side having backed away from the precipice but eco and his mount were nowhere to be seen nor was there any sign of another assassin the night fog had grown thick diffusing the growing moonlight and obscuring everything i stared into the gloom and whispered eco i said his name louder and then shouted eco but there was no answer neither the pitiful halfhuman murmur i had heard him make in our room nor the stifled strangling sound he had made to warn me there was only silence broken by the soughing of the wind in the treetops eco i shouted heedless of alerting whatever other assassins might be lurking in the darkness eco i thought i heard noises from far away or else from nearby but muffled by fog and dense foliage the clang of metal on metal a shout the snorting of a horse i ran to my horse and mounted him i felt abruptly dizzy so dizzy that i almost fell my head throbbed i reached up to press my temple and felt a slick wetness even in the thickening gloom i could see that the stuff on my fingers was blood from the cut on my hand i thought and then realized that the blade had cut my other hand somehow i had struck my head without feeling it or else the assassins blade had swung closer to my scalp than i had realized blood made me remember the cloak i had dropped it when i fell i looked about the bare stone and saw it nowhere there were more noises from the forest a whinnying horse a man shouting i was confused and unable to think i rode into the woods towards the distant noises but all i could hear was a rushing in my head louder than the wind in the trees the fog closed around me like gauze draped over my face eco i shouted suddenly fearful of the silence the world seemed vast and empty around me i rode forward for all my watching and listening i was as helpless as a man without sight or hearing the rushing in my head became a roar the moonlight grew dimmer pierced by bright vaporous phantoms that darted in and out of the darkness death comes as the end i thought remembering an old egyptian saying bethesda had taught me death came for lucius licinius and for dionysius as it came for the beloved father and brother of marcus crassus as it had come for all the victims of sulla and the victims of sullas enemies as it had come for sulla himself and for the wizard eunus both eaten alive by worms and would come for metrobius and marcus crassus for mummius and even for haughty faustus fabius death would come for beautiful apollonius even as it had come for old zeno who ended up a halfeaten corpse on the shores of lake avernus death would come for little meto who had hardly lived if not tomorrow then another day i found a curious cold comfort in these thoughts death comes as the end then i remembered eco i could not see or hear i was blind and deaf or else the night had turned black and the wind was howling but i was not mute i cried out his name eco eco if he answered i did not hear but how could he answer when he was mute something trickled down my cheeks not blood but tears i fell forward and clutched my horse he stopped his pacing and stood very still the howling of the wind died down but the world was still dark for i held my eyes tightly shut at some point everything turned upside down and i found myself lying on the ground amid the drifted leaves and twigs some passing god had heard my prayer after all this night would be unending and morning would never come xxii i opened my eyes to a world that was neither dark nor light above me in the gentle predawn breeze branches creaked and groaned or was it my own head cracking open i slowly pulled myself upright and sat against the trunk of a tree my horse was nearby casually nuzzling among the leaves in search of something to eat my stomach growled i groaned at the flashes of pain in my head i reached up and touched dried blood enough to make me queasy but not enough to alarm me plenty more where that came from my father used to say when i was a boy and came home bleeding he was neither stoic nor stern but knew how to put an injury in its place i stood shakily and took a deep breath grateful and not a little surprised simply to be alive i called ecos name loud enough for the hills to call it back to me shouting sent a thunderclap of pain through my skull eco did not appear the world began to grow lighter i could search the woods for him i could return to the villa i decided instead to press on to cumae without eco without the bloodstained cloak the funeral games would begin in a matter of hours there was still a slender hope that i might be able to squeeze the truth from those who knew it the forest seemed to dwindle and contract in the growing daylight from where i stood i could see the precipice where the assassin had attacked me in the opposite direction i could see beyond the trees into the rocky region that surrounded the sibyls cave and even glimpse a bit of the sea and yet it had been so easy to lose my way the night before night and darkness rob men not just of their sight but of their senses a blow to the head doesnt help i found the path quickly enough after a few minutes i left the woods for the rocky maze darting uneasy glances left and right more afraid now of finding eco than of not finding him again and again i saw the stump of a tree or a grey clump of rock and imagined it was his body no one was yet stirring on the little road that ran through the village of cumae but plumes of smoke rose from the houses of the early risers i came to iaias house at the far edge of the village no smoke rose from the ovens within no sound or light issued from the windows i tethered my horse and walked on i found the narrow path that led down to the sea the same trail from which olympias had emerged on the afternoon of our visit to the sibyl i followed the way downwards through the low brush it switched back and forth along a steep slope hemmed in by sheer stone walls the path grew faint in places and disappeared altogether where it was interrupted by outcrops of weathered stone a few times i slipped on loose rocks and had to struggle for balance it was not a trail that anyone was likely to take purely for pleasure or by accident it would have been more suitable for an adventurous goat than a man or perhaps for a nimble young woman who had a good reason for taking it the trail came to an end amid a jumble of boulders at the waters edge closely hemmed in by the sheer stone walls that towered above the waves pounded the rocks and receded leaving only a narrow strip of black sand for a momentary beach i looked about and saw no sign of a cave or fissure the stain of saltwater and the strange creatures that clung to the stones indicated that the tide could rise considerably higher swallowing the boulders and leaving no beach at all if the water now was at only mid tide then at low tide the waves might ebb enough to uncover a beach a man could properly walk on at least for a little way beyond the boulders as it was i saw no indication of a hidden way into the sheer walls i had come to a dead end and yet i had seen olympias come up from this trail carrying a basket that was empty except for a knife and some crusts of bread and the hem of her riding stola had been wet i had seen how she blanched when dionysius insisted on telling the tale of crassuss weeks of hiding in the sea cave i steeled myself for the cold and stepped over the boulders onto the narrow beach a moment later the waves came splashing at my feet and swallowed me to the knees then withdrew tugging at my ankles i shivered at the cold and clutched at the stones behind me to keep my balance the waves receded and then splashed again higher this time wetting me to the thighs i hissed at the cold forced my fingers to let go of the rock and stepped forward onto the shifting sand i waded out until the water came to my waist the ebb and flow of the waves pulled at me strongly and the sand gave way beneath my feet as quickly as i could regain my balance in such a narrow place i thought a man could easily be seized by an undertow and pulled out to deep water in the blink of an eye disappearing beneath the surface never to see daylight again what was i hoping to find a miraculous cave that would open in the rock at my whim there were no secrets here nothing to see but stone and water i took another step the waves rose to my ribs the water lapped against a slab of stone that peaked from the foam like a turtles head then splashed into my face sputtering and clutching myself against the cold i took another step the water rose to my chest and then ebbed with a powerful force that threatened to suck me into the depths i grabbed the stone for balance and felt my feet pulled from beneath me i clung to the rock as a leaf clings to a branch in a strong wind the cold took my breath away for a moment i saw spots before my eyes then the spots vanished and i saw the cave it was visible only when the waves receded and then only for a moment i saw a jagged black opening cut into the jagged black rock like the gaping maw of a toothless beast foam eddied and poured from the lips then the waves filled it up again until the tide had ebbed substantially it would be impossible to enter that hole any reasonable man could see as much but a reasonable man would not be immersed to his neck in cold water clinging to a slippery stone for dear life in the pale light of early morning i managed to release the rock and push myself towards the fissure and then grabbed hold of the foaming lips and pulled myself inside the waves came rushing in from behind and i was trapped unable to go either forward or back while the spray surged around me whipping seaweed against my face and filling my nose with saltwater when the waves receded i scrambled forward and hit my head against the low ceiling or rock that must have been when the wound on my head started bleeding again darkness surrounded me my strength suddenly vanished sucked out to sea with the tide i steeled myself for the next wave which came surging around me like a blast from neptunes nostrils my nose was flooded with saltwater and i tasted blood on my tongue the water ebbed i thought it would surely pull me with it but somehow i held on i opened my eyes blinking at the burning salt the wave had pushed me deep into the fissure i looked up and saw a ray of sunlight from a hole high above i was within the cave it was not merely surprising that i should have managed such a thing it was impossible the stunned looks on their faces told me as much even in the dim light i recognized olympias i had dreamed of seeing her naked now i saw her flesh was smooth and unblemished covered with a sheen of sweat that made the paler parts of her glow like alabaster in the sepulchral light her arms and legs were darker than the rest of her burned by the sun to pale gold she was slender but hardly frail and looked even more vital and robust naked than clothed her breasts were full and round with large nipples that were surprisingly dark considering her golden mane and the patch of gold between her sleek thighs sadly i was in no condition to appreciate the sight her companion appeared to appreciate it very much just how appreciative was evident when they sprang apart and i saw the proof of his arousal he scrambled to his feet bumped his head against a shelf of rock and cursed olympias meanwhile rolled onto her side and searched among the cushions and coverlets on the stone floor she found what she was seeking a shiny dagger with a blade as long as a mans forearm and swung it upward in a great arc i suppose she meant to hand it to her defender but in her haste and confusion she very nearly cut his arousal short they both gasped loudly at the near miss alexandros staggered back struck his head again and cursed i might have laughed had i not been in so much misery from the cold and wet and the throbbing in my head he was a physical match for olympias as i would have expected it was unlikely that a beautiful young woman of her talent and discernment would have fallen in love with a thracian stable slave who was anything less than impressively broadshouldered and handsome his shaggy mane of hair glinted chestnut in the dim light his chest and limbs were dusted with a covering of the same soft stuff his features were starkly moulded with generous lips and bushy eyebrows that converged in a single line above his fiery eyes his sparse beard only a few days old accentuated his high cheekbones and thrusting jaw his arousal even in its rapidly fading state looked substantial he was not beautiful as apollonius was beautiful but i could see why olympias had chosen him apparently he had a brain as well as brawn since zeno had used him to help keep accounts but at the moment he looked rather dull and bovine as he rubbed his head and fumbled to take the dagger from olympias put the weapon away i said wearily i havent come to hurt you they stared at me wideeyed and dubious there was a softening in olympiass eyes only in that instant did she finally recognize me what must i have looked like rising up from the spuming tunnel wrapped in tendrils of seaweed with blood trickling down my face alexandros stared at me as if i were a sea monster and perhaps he thought i was wait olympias whispered she laid her hand on alexandross arm i know him yes who is he he spoke with a heavy thracian accent and there was a wild desperate note in his voice that caused me to slide my hand nearer to where my own dagger was sheathed beneath my tunic the finder she said from rome the man i told you about then hes found me at last he pulled his arm free the long blade sliced through a pale shaft of sunlight and glimmered like quicksilver he drew back against the cave wall and stared at me like a trapped animal is that whats happened gordianus olympias looked at me suspiciously youve come to take him to crassus put the knife away i whispered i began to shiver uncontrollably i clenched my teeth to stop them from chattering can you make a fire i suddenly feel very cold and a little faint olympias studied me for a moment then made up her mind she reached for a woollen gown and pulled it over her head then stepped towards me and reached for the hem of my tunic out of this first or else youll die from the cold more surely than you will from a dagger no fire im afraid we cant have anyone seeing the smoke but we can wrap you in something warm alexandros youre shivering as well put that knife away and cover yourself the cave when i had first glimpsed it had seemed enormous stretching away like the sibyls cave into unknown space it was not as large as that but it did rise to a considerable height and was cut into the stone at an angle that slanted sharply away from the sea so that the floor was stepped in a number of rocky terraces stowed here and there in small nooks were alexandross comforts dirty coverlets bits of food utensils jugs of fresh water and a plump wineskin olympias took me to one of the higher terraces and wrapped me in a wool blanket when my shivering subsided she offered me some crusts of bread and cheese and even a few delicacies that i recognized from the funeral banquet she must have pilfered them from the table and brought them as a treat for alexandros i protested that i wasnt hungry but once i began i could hardly stop eating soon i felt better though bolts of pain still shot through my head when i moved it too sharply how soon will the opening of the cave be passable without serious risk of drowning i mean alexandros glanced at the mouth of the cave where already the foaming tide seemed to have ebbed not long now there wont be clear beach beneath the opening for another few hours but already you could make your way into the water and up to the path without danger good whatever else happens i must be there at the arena no matter how terrible and i must find eco the boy said olympias apparently she had never cared enough to catch his name yes the boy my son the one who casts such longing looks in your direction olympias alexandros wrinkled his brow disapprovingly the mute boy olympias explained to him i told you about him remember but gordianus what do you mean when you say you must find him where is he last night when we set out for cumae we followed the route we took with you we were attacked on the precipice that overlooks lake avernus by lemures whispered alexandros no by something worse living men two i think but i cant be certain in the confusion eco disappeared afterwards i went searching for him but my head i touched the tender spot and winced the bleeding had stopped olympias studied the wound iaia will know what to do for this she said but what about eco lost i never found him and then i lost consciousness when i awoke i came here if hes gone back to gelinas villa he may end up at the funeral games by himself hes seen gladiators fight to the death before but the massacre whatever else happens i must get back before it starts i dont want eco to see it alone the old slaves and apollonius and little meto what are you talking about alexandros looked at me puzzled olympias what does he mean by a massacre she bit her lip and looked at me ruefully you havent told him i said olympias gritted her teeth alexandros was alarmed what do you mean by a massacre what are you saying about meto doomed i answered all of them doomed to die every slave from the fields and the stables and the kitchens will be publicly slain to satisfy the good people of the cup politics alexandros dont ask me to explain roman politics to a thracian slave just take my word for it for the crime of the true killer whom he cannot find crassus intends to have every slave in the household put to death even meto today after the gladiator contests crassuss men have erected a wooden arena in the flatlands by lake lucrinus it should be quite an event the kind of thing people will talk about from here to rome for a long time to come even after crassus defeats spartacus and finally gets himself elected consul and after that who knows perhaps hell manage to make himself dictator like his mentor sulla and people will still talk about the day he put the slaves of baiae in their place alexandros leaned back aghast olympias you never told me what would have been the point you would only have fretted and brooded and perhaps he would have made some grand gesture by returning to baiae to face crassuss judgment himself i suggested is that why you didnt tell him olympias instead you let him think that he merely had to stay in hiding long enough for crassus to leave and then he might escape and you never whispered a word about all the slaves fated to die in his place not in his place but alongside him said olympias angrily do you think it makes any difference to crassus whether he finds alexandros or not he wants to put the slaves to death you said so yourself just now for politics to put on a show better for crassus if he never finds alexandros that way he can keep scaring people with stories of the murdering thracian monster who ran off to join spartacus what you say may be true now olympias but was it so at the beginning when alexandros first fled to iaias house what if you had turned him over to crassus then would crassus ever have concocted his scheme to avenge lucius licinius in such a terrible way do you feel no guilt for what youve done hiding your lover and letting all the other slaves be slain the old men and women the children but alexandros is innocent he never murdered anyone so you say so he tells you perhaps but how do you know olympias what do you know she drew back and sucked in a breath the lovers exchanged an odd glance you know as well as i that it makes no difference whether alexandros is innocent or not she said guilty or innocent crassus will crucify him if hes caught not if i could prove him innocent if i could discover who did kill lucius licinius if i could prove it then most especially then would crassus be certain to put alexandros to death and you as well i shook my head and grimaced at the flash of pain across my forehead you talk in riddles like the sibyl olympias looked at the mouth of the cave where flashes of light were reflected from the churning water beyond the tide has ebbed enough she said its time for us all to go up to the house to see iaia xxiii iaia made a great fuss over the wound on my head she insisted on brewing a compound of foulsmelling herbs which she slathered onto the cut then wrapped a long strip of linen around my head she also gave me an ambercoloured infusion to drink which i put to my lips with some trepidation thinking of dionysius you seem to know a great deal about herbs and their uses i said sniffing at the steam that rose from the cup yes i do she said over the years learning to make my own paints to harvest and prepare the proper plants at the proper time of year i came to know quite a lot about such things not only which root might provide a splendid blue pigment but which one might cure a wart or kill a man i ventured she smiled thinly perhaps the brew youre sipping now could possibly kill a man but not in the concentration ive given you she added its mostly an extract of willow bark mixed with just a touch of the stuff homer called nepenthes made from the egyptian poppy it will ease the pain in your head drink up the poet says nepenthes brings surcease to sorrow i gazed into the cup searching for a glimpse of death in the swirling steam iaia nodded which is why the queen of egypt gave it to helen to cure her melancholy homer says also that it brings forgetfulness iaia and what i have seen and learned i do not choose to forget the amount ive given you will not set you to dreaming only ease the throbbing when i still hesitated she frowned and shook her head in disappointment really gordianus if we had wanted to do you harm i imagine alexandros could have done away with you down in the sea cave or on the steep hillside even now i imagine we could somehow manage to send you plummeting from this terrace onto the rocks below if we were determined to do so you would be swept out to sea and vanish forever she gazed at me intendy ive come to trust you gordianus i didnt trust you at first ill admit but i do now wont you trust me i looked into her eyes she sat stiffly upright in a backless chair dressed in a voluminous yellow stola the sun had not yet risen above the roof of the house and the terrace was in shadow far below us beyond the terrace wall the sea pounded against the rocky coast olympias and alexandros sat nearby watching the two of us as if we were gladiators engaged in a duel i lifted the cup to my lips again but set it down untouched iaia sighed if you would only drink the pain would vanish youll thank me for the gift dionysius is beyond all pain but i dont think he would be thankful if he could be here with us now her brow darkened what do you insinuate gordianus you say you trust me iaia then at least admit to me what i already know on the day when i came to see the sibyl i saw dionysius following olympias in secret i think he knew about the sea cave and who was hidden there or at least he guessed that was why he insisted on telling the tale of crassus hiding in the cave in spain i saw how you and olympias reacted that night dionysius was very near to giving away your secret the very next day at the funeral feast dionysius was given poison in a cup tell me iaia was it aconitum you used that was my guess she shrugged what were the precise symptoms his tongue was aflame he began to choke and convulse then to vomit his bowels were loosened it all happened very fast she nodded i would say that you made an excellent guess but i cannot say for sure i did not poison the cup and neither did olympias who did how can i say i am not the sibyl only the vessel and the voice of the sibyl she pursed her lips and sucked at her teeth her face became gaunt and she looked as old as her years sometimes gordianus sometimes do you really want to know the secrets behind the sibyl it is dangerous for any man to know them think of foolish pentheus torn apart by the bacchae certain mysteries can be truly comprehended only by women to a man such knowledge is often quite useless and it can be very dangerous would it be any less dangerous if i didnt know unless some god decides to intervene i begin to wonder if i shall ever get back to rome alive stubborn said iaia slowly shaking her head very stubborn i see that you will not be satisfied until you know everything it is my nature iaia it is how the gods made me so i see where shall we begin with a simple question are you the sibyl she made a pained expression i will try to answer though i doubt youll understand no i am not the sibyl no woman is but there are those of us in whom the sibyl sometimes manifests herself just as the god manifests himself through the sibyl we are a circle of initiates we maintain the temple keep the hearth burning explore the mysteries pass on the secrets gelina is one of us she is more dear to me than you can know but she is too delicate a vessel to be used directly by the sibyl she has other duties olympias is also an initiate she is as yet too young and inexperienced for the sibyl to speak through her but it will come to pass there are others besides myself who act as vessels some live here in cumae others come from as far as puteoli and neapolis and the far side of the cup most are descendants of the greek families who settled here even before aeneas came their understanding of these matters is passed on in the blood iaia i cannot deny that an interview with the sibyl is a most wondrous thing no matter whose form she takes i wonder for example what it was that you burned on the fire before you took us into the sibyls cave could it be that the smoke had some effect on my senses iaia smiled faintly you miss very little gordianus true certain herbs and roots used in certain ways are conducive to a full apprehension of the sibyls presence the use of those substances is a part of the discipline which we learn and pass on in my own travels ive encountered such herbs or heard of them ophiusa thalassaegle theangelis gelotophyllis mesa she shook her head and grimaced ophiusa comes from distant ethiopia where they call it the snake plant it is said to be as horrible to look at as the visions it conjures up the sibyl has no use for such horrors thalassaegle is likewise exotic and harsh i hear it grows only along the river indus alexanders men called it seaglimmer and found that it caused them to rave and suffer blinding visions theangelis i know of it grows in the high places of syria and crete and in persia the magi call it the gods messenger and drink it to divine the future gelotophyllis grows in bacteria where the locals call it laughterleaves it merely intoxicates and brings no wisdom believe me it was none of these that you inhaled what about the other i named mesa a kind of hemp i understand with a strong aroma you exasperate me gordianus will you waste time and breath merely to satisfy your idle curiosity youre right iaia then perhaps you can tell me why you placed that ugly statuette in my bed on my first night in the villa she lowered her eyes it was a test only an initiate could understand but whatever the test was i passed it yes and then you left another message advising me to consult the sibyl yes but why the sibyl was ready to guide you to zenos body because the sibyl thought i might assume that the same fate that befell zeno had befallen alexandros as well and that his body had been consumed in the lake that possibility did cross my mind after all two horses returned riderless to the stable i might have returned and told crassus as much advising him to call off his search for alexandros and why didnt you because i had seen dionysius following olympias and i had seen olympias bringing an empty basket up from the sea cave it occurred to me then that alexandros was hidden here in cumae but tell me iaia did you lead me to zenos body to throw me off the scent iaia spread her hands one cannot always discern the sibyls methods even when the god grants a supplicants desires he doesnt always use the means expected to accomplish his end you might have assumed alexandros was dead and proceeded from that assumption instead here you sit in the same house with alexandros who can say this is not what the sibyl intended even if it is not what i expected i nodded you knew then of zenos fate and where he could be found did olympias know yes and yet olympias seemed genuinely shocked when we discovered zenos remains olympias knew of zenos fate but she had not seen his body as i had i never intended for her to see it i intended for you to visit lake avernus without her instead she went with you and in horror she cast his remains into the pit i have no doubt that this too was the will of the god and i suppose it was the will of the god that brought alexandros to your door in the first place on the night of the murder perhaps we should let alexandros speak for himself said iaia who cast a sidelong look at the young thracian tell gordianus what transpired on the night of your masters murder alexandros reddened either because he was unused to speaking to strangers or because of the memory of that night olympias drew closer to him and laid her hand on his forearm i wondered at the casual way she displayed her intimacy with a slave in the presence of a roman citizen in the sea cave i had caught them unaware in the middle of coitus and she had been unembarrassed but fear and surprise had ruled her then and might have overridden her normal judgment i was more impressed by the public affection and tenderness she willingly gave alexandros before iaia and myself i marvelled at her devotion and at the same time despaired for her how could such an illbegotten love end in anything but misery that night alexandros began his harsh thracian accent overshadowed by the intensity with which he spoke we knew that crassus was on his way i had never seen him i was new in the household but i had heard much of him of course old zeno told me that the visit was unexpected and had come about on very short notice and that the master was unprepared very nervous and very unhappy did you know why lucius was unhappy some irregularity in the accounts i didnt really understand even though you helped zeno sometimes with the ledgers he shrugged i can add figures and make the proper marks but i seldom knew what it was that i was adding but zeno knew or thought he did he said that the master had been busy with some very secret business something very bad zeno said the master had done things behind crassuss back and that crassus would be angry that afternoon we were all three busy in the library going through the accounts at last the master sent me from the room i could tell he wanted to say things to zeno that i shouldnt overhear later he sent zeno away as well in the stables i asked zeno what was happening but he only brooded and wouldnt talk it began to grow dark i ate and helped the other stablemen to look after the horses finally i went to sleep in the stables yes was that where you normally slept olympias cleared her throat alexandros usually slept in my room she said next to iaias in the house but that night iaia and i were here in cumae i see go on alexandros you were sleeping in the stables yes and then zeno came to wake me he carried a lamp and poked at my nose i told him it couldnt be morning yet he said it was the middle of the night i asked him what he wanted he said that a man had ridden up from nowhere and tethered his horse by the front door then had gone in to see the master he said they were both in the library talking in low voices with the door shut yes and who was this visitor alexandros hesitated i never saw him myself not really you see thats the strange part but zeno said poor zeno he furrowed his thick eyebrows and stared intently into space caught up in the remembrance yes i said go on what did zeno tell you why did you flee the house zeno said he had gone into the library he had rapped gently on the door and thought he heard his name spoken so he stepped inside maybe he didnt hear his name at all or maybe the master was telling him to go away zeno was like that he had a habit of stepping in when he wasnt wanted just to have a sniff at what was happening he said the master spun around in his chair and told him to get out yelled at first then lowered his voice very quickly and cursed him in a whisper and the visitor he was standing by the shelves looking through some scrolls with his back to the door zeno didnt really see him but he saw that he was dressed in military garb and he saw the mans cloak thrown over one of the chairs the cloak i said yes just a simple dark cloak but one corner had an emblem on it a seal pinned to the cloth like a brooch zeno had seen it plenty of times before he said hed know it anywhere yes it was the seal of crassus no i said shaking my head a throb of pain passed through my skull with such power that i finally reached for the cup of willow bark and nepenthes and drank it down no that makes no sense at all even so alexandros insisted zeno said it was crassus in the library with the master and the masters face was as white as a senators toga zeno began to pace up and down in the stables shaking his head with worry i told him there was nothing we could do if the master had got himself into trouble that was his problem but zeno said we should go and stand outside the library door and listen i told him he was mad and rolled over to go back to sleep but he wouldnt leave me alone until i got up from the straw and put on my cloak and stepped into the courtyard with him it was a clear night but very windy the trees thrashed overhead like spirits shaking their heads whispering no no i should have known then that something terrible was afoot zeno ran ahead to the door and opened it i followed him alexandros wrinkled his brow i have a hard time remembering all that happened next it happened so fast we were in the little hallway that leads to the atrium suddenly zeno backed against me so hard he almost knocked me down he sucked in a breath and started blubbering over his shoulder i saw a man dressed like a soldier down on his knees holding a lamp and beside him was the body of the master his head all crushed and bloody and this man was crassus i said disbelieving he shrugged i only glimpsed his face for an instant or perhaps i didnt see his face at all the lamp cast strange shadows and he was mostly in darkness i think even if i had seen him clearly i wouldnt have recognized him i told you i had never seen crassus what i remember looking at was the master his lifeless body his broken bleeding face then the man put down his lamp and sprang to his feet and i saw his sword leaping like a flame in the lamplight he spoke in a low voice not frightened not angry but cold very cold he accused us of killing the master youll pay for this he was saying i shall see both of you nailed to a tree zeno grabbed me and pulled me out the door across the courtyard into the stable horses he was saying flee flee i did what he said we mounted and were out the door of the stables before the man could follow even so zeno rode like a madman where can we go he kept saying shaking his head and weeping like a slave about to be whipped where can we go the poor master is dead and we shall be blamed i thought about olympias and remembered iaias house in cumae id been here a few times before carrying supplies back and forth i thought i could find the way in the dark but it wasnt as easy as i thought so i myself discovered i said we were going too fast and the wind kept getting stronger so that we couldnt hear each other shouting and the fog closed in zeno was in a mad panic then we took a wrong turn and came to the cliff that overhangs lake avernus my mount knew me she warned me in time and even so i almost went tumbling over but zeno knew very little about horses when the beast tried to stop he must have kicked her and she threw him i saw him disappear flying head over heels into the fog the mist swallowed him up then silence then i heard a faint distant splash like a man falling into shallow water and mud he screamed then his voice rose up from the darkness a long terrifying scream then silence again i tried to find a way down to the shore in the darkness but the trees and fog and shadows baffled me i called his name but he never answered not even a moan have i said something wrong what the look on your face gordianus so strange as if you had been there yourself i was only remembering last night i thought of eco and felt a pang of dread go on what happened next finally i found the way to cumae i entered the house without waking the slaves found olympias and told her what had happened it was iaias idea to hide me in the cave cumae is a tiny village they could never have hidden me in the house even so you discovered us dionysius discovered you first you should thank the gods that he didnt tell crassus or perhaps you can thank someone else i looked sidelong at iaia again you insinuate iaia gripped the arms of her chair credit me with having eyes and a nose iaia this house is full of strange roots and herbs and i happen to know that aconitum is among them on the day we consulted the sibyl i saw it in a jar in the room where you make your paints i imagine you might also have strychnos hyoscyamus limeum some of these i keep yes but not for murder the same substances that kill can also cure if used with proper knowledge do you insist on an oath gordianus very well i swear to you by the holiness of the sibyls shrine by the god who speaks through the sibyls lips that no one in this house committed the murder of dionysius in the vehemence of her oath she rose halfway to her feet as she slowly settled into her chair again the terrace became preternaturally quiet even the crashing of the waves below was hushed the sun had at last risen above the roof of the house tracing the terrace wall with a fringe of yellow light a lonely cloud crossed the sun and threw all into shadow again then the cloud passed and the heat reflected from the dazzling white stones was warm against my face i noticed in passing that the pain in my head had vanished and in its place i felt a pleasant lightness very well i said quiedy that much is setded then you didnt kill dionysius who did i wonder who do you think said iaia the same man who killed lucius licinius crassus but for what reason i cant say but now i think it is time for you to tell me what you know gordianus for example yesterday you sent the slave apollonius diving off the pier below gelinas house i understand you made some startling discoveries who told you meto perhaps no secrets iaia very well then yes meto told me i wonder if we came to the same conclusion gordianus that lucius was trading arms to the rebel slaves in return for plundered silver and jewels exactly i think dionysius may have also suspected some such scandal that was why he hesitated to reveal alexandross hiding place because he knew that there was a greater secret to uncover meto also told me that you discovered certain documents in dionysiuss room incriminating documents regarding luciuss criminal schemes perhaps crassus himself couldnt fully decipher them oh couldnt he a faint tracing of pain flickered through my skull iaia do you seriously suggest she shrugged why not speak the unspeakable yes crassus himself must have been involved in the enterprise crassus smuggling arms to spartacus impossible no quite disgustingly possible for a man as vain and greedy as marcus crassus so greedy that he couldnt resist the opportunity to reap a huge profit by dealing with spartacus surreptitiously of course using poor frightened lucius as his gobetween and so vain that he thought it would ultimately make no difference to his cause when he gains the command against the slaves he thinks himself such a brilliant strategist that it wont matter that he has armed his own enemy with roman steel then you say he poisoned dionysius because the philosopher was close to exposing him perhaps more likely dionysius had begun to insinuate blackmail subtle blackmail merely asking for a handsome stipend and a place in crassuss retinue but men like crassus will not put up with subordinates who hold a secret over them dionysius was too stupid to see that there was no profit in the knowledge he was seeking to exploit he should have kept his secrets to himself then he might have lived but why did crassus kill lucius iaia looked down at her feet where the sunlight had crept close enough to warm her toes who knows crassus came that night in secret to discuss their secret affairs perhaps lucius had begun to balk at the tasks to which crassus set him and threatened to expose them both it would be like lucius to panic perhaps crassus had discovered that lucius was cheating him for whatever reason crassus struck him with the statue and killed him then saw a way to turn even that moment of madness to his advantage by making it look as if a follower of spartacus had committed the crime i stared out at the unending progression of waves that proceeded from the horizon i shook my head such supreme hypocrisy its almost too monstrous to be believed but why then did crassus send for me because gelina and mummius insisted he could hardly refuse to allow an honest investigation of his cousins death and how did dionysius come to have the documents that we cant be sure of the only thing we know for certain is that we shall never have an explanation from dionysiuss lips i thought of crassuss dark moods his unspoken doubts his long nights of searching through the documents in luciuss library if all was as iaia had concluded then crassus was killer eulogist judge and avenger combined beyond the power of any of us to punish i see you are not entirely satisfied iaia said satisfied i am most dissatisfied what a waste what futility to have put myself in such danger and not only myself eco all for a bag of silver crassus solves all his problems with silver and why not when men like me will settle for mere coins he might as well have sent me the money and allowed me to stay in rome instead of dragging me here to take part in his hideous deception i meant said iaia that you might not be satisfied with my explanation of events there are certain other circumstances of which you know nothing which might grant you a little more insight into the workings of crassuss mind these matters are so delicate so personal that i hesitate even now to discuss them with you but i think gelina would understand you know that she and lucius were childless yes and yet gelina very much wanted a child she thought the problem might lie with her and she sought my help i did what i could with my knowledge of medicines but to no avail i began to think the problem rested with lucius i brewed remedies which gelina administered to him in secret but that was of no use either instead priapus eventually withdrew his favour from lucius entirely he became crippled in his sex powerless just as he was powerless to control his own life and destiny imagine being crassuss creature compelled to fawn over his greatness reduced to tawdry schemes of escaping his domination which crassus would never allow because it gave him a perverse pleasure to keep his cousin pressed beneath his foot and yet gelina still wanted a baby she wouldnt be denied youve seen her you know that she could hardly be called demanding or domineering in many ways shes more retiring and acquiescent than befits a woman of her station but in this one thing she would have her way and so against all my advice but with the full knowledge of her husband she asked crassus to give her a child when was this during crassuss last visit in the spring why did lucius allow it dont many husbands quiedy allow themselves to be cuckolded because to protest would only aggravate their humiliation and shame beyond that lucius had a perverse penchant for making choices that would harm him and gelina appealed to his family pride crassus would at least give them an heir with the blood of a licinius but no child resulted the only result was the coolness that developed between lucius and gelina she had done exactly the wrong thing of course had she approached any man but crassus lucius might have kept a shred of dignity but for his allpowerful cousin to be invited into his wifes bed for crassus to be asked to bring a child into the household he already dominated these humiliations preyed on his soul you see then that there was more than financial deception and fraud to spark a murder between the two cousins crassus can be quite cold and brutal luciuss shame pricked at him like a crown of thorns who knows what whispered words passed between them that night in the library before it was over one of them was dead i looked heavenward and now a whole household of slaves will die roman justice no alexandros jumped to his feet there must be something we can do nothing whispered olympias reaching for his arm and grasping at thin air when he drew away perhaps i squinted at the edge of sunlight that blazed along the scalloped tile roof time was fleeting the games might already have begun if i could confront crassus directly with gelina as witness if alexandros could see him and identify him for certain no olympias interposed herself between us alexandros cannot leave cumae if only we had the cloak the bloodstained cloak from which crassus tore his seal before he discarded it along the road if only i hadnt lost it to the assassins last night the assassins oh eco and then the cloak appeared wafting out of the dark shadows of the house into the bright sunshine held aloft by the outstretched arms of eco himself who smiled and blinked the sleep from his eyes xxiv but i thought you knew iaia kept saying i thought that olympias must have already told you she was forgetting that on the night before before eco had come breathlessly beating on her door olympias had already slipped down to sleep with alexandros in the sea cave and so had no way of knowing as i had no way of knowing that all the while we debated and deduced on the terrace eco was fast asleep within the house clutching the filthy bloodstained cloak he had saved from the assassins how foolish i feel gordianus here ive sat trying to impress you with my deductions when all along i should have been telling you what you most wanted to know that your son was safe and sound here under my roof the important thing is that hes here i said swallowing to clear the sudden hoarseness in my voice and blinking back the tears that made ecos beaming dirtsmudged face swim before my eyes i squeezed him tightly in my arms and then stepped back sighing from a sudden shortness of breath when he came to me last night i could see that he was frightened and exhausted but not hurt said iaia he was frantically trying to tell me something i had no way of understanding i gave him a special brew to calm him at last he mimed using a wax tablet and stylus i went to fetch them but when i came back he was fast asleep i roused two of the slaves to carry him to bed i looked in on him once or twice he slept like a stone through the night eco looked up at me he gingerly touched the bandage around my head this nothing at all a little bump to remind me to be more careful in the woods the smile abruptly faded from his lips he averted his eyes and looked deeply troubled i could guess the root of his shame he had failed to warn me of the assassins approach failed to rescue me last night and instead of sending aid to me in the forest he had fallen asleep against his will i fell asleep myself i whispered to him he shook his head gloomily angry not at me but at himself he grimaced and pointed to his mouth his eyes brimmed with tears i understood as clearly as if he had spoken if only i could speak as others can i could have shouted a warning to you on the precipice i could have told iaia that you were hurt and alone in the woods i could say all that i need to say at this moment i put my arms around him to hide him from the others he shivered against me i looked over his shoulder and saw that olympias and alexandros were smiling warmly seeing only the joy of our reunion iaia smiled but her eyes were sad i released him and while eco turned towards the empty sea to compose his face i pulled the bloodstained cloak from his trembling fingers the important thing now is that we have the cloak that changes nothing protested olympias tell him iaia iaia looked at me sidelong and pursed her lips im not sure alexandros stepped forward if there is any way to stop crassus from killing the slaves maybe i said trying to think maybe i would never have stayed in the cave all this time had i known what was happening alexandros said you shouldnt have deceived me olympias even to save me olympias looked from his face to mine and back again at first desperately and then shrewdly you wont leave me behind she quietly insisted i shall go with you whatever happens i must be there alexandros moved to embrace her but now it was she who shrank back if its to be done we should move now she said the sun is getting higher the games will have already begun the slave who fetched our horses gave me an odd look puzzled at the bandage around my head when he saw alexandros he let out a gasp and turned pale iaia and olympias had managed to deceive even their household slaves iaia did not bother to bind the man to secrecy soon all the cup would know that the escaped thracian was still among them iaia are you coming olympias asked too old too slow iaia insisted i shall go on to the villa at my own pace and wait there for news she stepped beside me and gestured for me to bend down from my mount then spoke softly into my ear are you sure of yourself gordianus to challenge crassus like this to box the lions ears in his own den i think i have no choice iaia it is how the gods made me she nodded yes the gods give us gifts whether we ask for them or not and then they give us no choice but to use them we can blame the gods for many things she lowered her voice but i think you should know that the gods did not make your son a mute i frowned at her puzzled last night i looked in on him a number of times to see that he slept soundly he kept calling for you what calling in words as clearly as i speak to you now she whispered he said papa papa i sat upright and looked down at her baffled she had no reason to deceive me or to delude herself and yet how could such a thing be i turned and glanced at eco who looked gloomily back at me what are we waiting for said olympias having made up her mind she was determined to begin alexandros on the other hand seemed to be having second thoughts a shadow of doubt crossed his face then his features resolved themselves into a mask of perfect acquiescence to the will of the gods such as any stoic would have envied with a last wave to iaia the four of us set off from the avernine woods we emerged onto the high windy ridge overlooking lake lucrinus and crassuss camp the plain was dotted with great plumes of smoke that rose from spitfires and ovens a crowd must eat through the haze i saw the great bowl of the wooden arena filled with spectators who had come to gawk and thrill at the funeral games no faces were discernible at such a distance only the mottled colours of the spectators dressed in their brightest clothing to enjoy the holiday and the perfect weather of a crisp autumn day i heard the clash of swords against shields the vague general murmur of the crowd rose to roaring shouts that must have been heard across the water in puteoli the gladiators must still be fighting i said squinting and trying to make out what was happening within the ring alexandros has strong eyes said olympias what do you see yes gladiators he said shielding his brow from the sun there must have already been several matches i see pools of blood on the sand now three matches are being staged at once three thracians against three gauls how can you tell asked olympias by their arms the gauls carry long curved shields and short swords they wear torques about their necks and plumed helmets the thracians fight with round shields and long curved daggers and wear round helmets with no visor spartacus is a thracian i said crassus no doubt chose thracians so the crowd could vent its anger against them they can expect no mercy from the spectators if they fall a gaul is down alexandros said yes i see i squinted through the haze hes thrown his blade aside and lifts his forefinger asking for mercy he must have fought well the spectators grant it see how they pull out their handkerchiefs the arena was like a bowl filled with fluttering doves as the crowd waved their white handkerchiefs the thracian helped the gaul to his feet and they walked towards the exit together now one of the thracians falls see the wound in his leg how it pours blood onto the sand he stabs the ground with his dagger and holds up his forefinger a resounding chorus of catcalls and boos rose from the arena a noise so full of hatred and blood lust that it caused hackles to rise on my neck instead of waving handkerchiefs the crowd pointed upwards with clenched fists the defeated thracian leaned back on his elbows exposing his naked chest the gaul dropped to one knee gripped his short sword with both hands and plunged it into the thracians heart olympias turned her face away eco watched in glum fascination alexandros still wore the look of stern resolution with which he had departed cumae the triumphant gaul walked once around the perimeter of the ring holding his sword aloft and receiving the accolades of the crowd while his opponents body was dragged to the exit leaving a long smear of blood across the sand the remaining thracian suddenly bolted and began to run from his opponent the crowd laughed and jeered the gaul chased after him but the thracian outdistanced him refusing to fight there was a commotion in the stands then a dozen or more attendants entered the ring some carrying whips and others wielding long smouldering irons so hot that i could see the glow at their tips and the little plumes of smoke that trailed after them they poked at the thracian searing his arms and legs making him jerk and clutch himself with pain they lashed him with the whips driving him back toward his opponent olympias gripped alexandross bare arm sinking her nails into the flesh this was a mistake she hissed these people are mad all of them theres nothing we can do alexandros wavered he stared down at the sickening spectacle his jaw clenched he gripped the reins so tightly that his arms began to tremble in the arena the thracian finally began to fight again running towards the gaul with a high mad scream that rose above the murmur of the crowd the gaul was taken unawares and retreated tripping over his own feet and falling on his backside he recovered enough to protect himself with his shield but the thracian was relentless banging his shield against the others and stabbing again and again with his curved blade the gaul was wounded he threw his blade aside and frantically waved his forefinger in the air signalling for mercy handkerchiefs and clenched fists filled the air together with a thunderous roar at last the fists began to outnumber the handkerchiefs and the crowd began to stamp and chant kill him kill him kill him instead the thracian threw down his dagger and shield the attendants came after him again with their whips and irons lashing and poking him from all directions compelling him to perform a hideous spastic dance at last he picked up his dagger they drove him back toward the gaul who was already covered with blood from the wounds on his arms the gaul rolled onto his stomach and pressed his hands to his visor steeling himself the thracian dropped to his knees and drove the dagger into the gauls back again and again in time with the chanting of the crowd kill him kill him kill him the thracian stood and held his bloody dagger aloft he began to perform a strange parody of a victory strut lifting his knees comically and rolling his head on his shoulders mocking the crowd a great chorus of hissing catcalls booing and raucous laughter echoed up from the arena within the walls the noise must have been deafening the attendants came after the thracian with their whips and pokers but he seemed not to feel the pain and only grudgingly allowed them to drive him toward the exit and out of sight do you need to see more alexandros whispered olympias hoarsely these people will tear you apart before you can utter a word crassus is giving them exactly what they want there is nothing you can do nothing gordianus or anyone can do to stop it come back with me to cumae i saw the fear in his eyes i cursed my own vanity why drag him before crassus when it could only result in another needless death what sort of fool was i to imagine that the proof of his own guilt could humble marcus crassus or that mere truth could sway him from giving the crowd the bloody entertainment they craved i was ready to send alexandros and olympias fleeing back to the sea cave when the trumpets began to blare from the arena below a gate beneath the stands opened the slaves trudged into the arena in their hands they carried objects made of wood what is it i said squinting what is it they carry in their hands little swords alexandros whispered short wooden swords such as gladiators use to practise training swords toys the crowd was quiet there were no boos or hissing they watched with hushed curiosity wondering why such a sorry rabble was being paraded before them and curious to see what sort of spectacle crassus had devised gathered outside the eastern rim of the arena where the crowd could not yet see them a contingent of soldiers had gathered their armour glinted in the sun among them i saw trumpeters and standard bearers they began to gather into ranks preparing for an entrance into the arena i suddenly understood and felt sick at heart little meto i whispered little meto with only a toy sword to defend himself my eyes met those of alexandros were too late i said to take the path to the road and the road down into the valley i shook my head it will take too long he bit his lip straight down the slope then too steep protested olympias the horses will stumble and break their necks but alexandros and i were already ready bounding over the edge and racing down the steep hillside with eco a heartbeat behind i held on for dear life once we were over the crest my mount locked her forelegs and slid down the slope her shoulders as rigid as stone while her hind legs kicked and stamped against the furrowed earth she shook her head and whinnied like a warrior screaming to his gods to steel himself for battle the desperate descent uprooted bushes and set off avalanches of pebbles and sand suddenly a halfburied boulder loomed directly below me for an instant i saw the features of pluto himself in its weathered face grinning at me horribly we would collide with the stone and be shattered to bits closer and closer we came to it and then my mount gave a great leap and bounded over it she landed with a jolt that nearly snapped my neck there was no more sliding with locked forelegs she had no choice but to gallop full speed down the steep face of the hill i fell forward clutched her neck and dug my heels into her hide sky became wind the earth became a cloud of dirt the whole world was a ball rumbling through space all balance was gone i shut my eyes clutched the beast as tightly as i could and sucked in the odour of torn earth horse sweat and blind panic suddenly the plummet became a gradual curve little by little the earth became flat again we raced with the accumulated speed of the descent but no longer out of control the world righted itself sky was sky and earth was earth i squinted into the wind and slowly asserted control reining the beast in i half expected her to throw me out of anger and distrust but she seemed glad for the reassurance of my hands on the reins she shook her head and whinnied again and it sounded as if she were laughing she submitted and slowed to a trot flinging spumes of sweat from her mane alexandros was far ahead of me i turned and caught a glimpse of eco close behind i sped onward toward the arena we raced between the tents soldiers in tunics satin circles gambling or played trigon stripped to the waist enjoying their holiday they scattered before us and shook their fists in alarm we raced past the spits and ovens with their plumes of white smoke kicking dust into the flames the cooks chased after us screaming curses alexandros waited for me outside the arena his face confused and uncertain i pointed to the north where i had seen the red canopy and the pennants that decorated crassuss private box we set off at a gallop eco had fallen far behind i waved to him to follow us the periphery of the arena was mostly deserted except for a few patrons who had left the stands to relieve themselves against the wooden wall entrances opened onto steps that led upward to the seats but i gestured to alexandros that we should ride on until we found the steps that would take us directly to crassuss box at the northernmost end of the circle we came to an opening smaller than the others and flanked by red pennants that bore in gold the seal of crassus alexandros reined his beast and looked at me quizzically i nodded he leaped from his horse i rode a few paces farther and peered as best i could around the edge of the arena outside the eastern rim the soldiers were still forming ranks and had not yet entered i rode back to alexandros above us on the rim of the arena a movement caught my eye i looked up but saw only a face that quickly disappeared i dismounted and almost fell to my knees in the mad descent down the hill and the race through the camp i had felt no pain or dizziness but as soon as my feet touched the earth my knees went weak and the throbbing returned to my temples i staggered and steadied myself against my hone alexandros already bounding up the steps turned and ran back to me i reached up to my forehead touched the bandage and felt a spot of warm wetness i pulled my hand away and saw something red and viscous on my fingers i was bleeding again from somewhere behind me between the pounding drumbeats in my head i thought i heard a boy calling papa papa alexandros clutched my arm are you all right just a little dizzy a little nauseous again i heard an unfamiliar voice calling papa papa louder and closer than before i turned my head thinking i must be in a dream and saw eco riding toward us pointing to the sky there he screamed above the trampling hooves of his mount a man a spear watch out i looked upward over my shoulder alexandros did the same an instant later he tackled me and we tumbled onto the ground i was amazed at his strength alarmed at the jolt of pain that ricocheted through my head and only vaguely aware of what i had glimpsed above us a man with a spear leaning over the arena wall in the next instant the spear came plummeting down with a whistling noise and planted itself in the earth missing my horse by less than a hands width had alexandros not pulled me to safety the spear would have entered the back of my neck and exited somewhere below my navel it took only a moment to vomit the yellow bile left a bitter taste in my mouth and a mess all over the front of my tunic but i felt vaguely better afterwards alexandros impatiently grabbed one shoulder while eco grabbed the other together they pulled me to my feet eco i whispered but how he looked at me but did not answer his eyes were glassy and feverish had i only imagined it then they were pulling me up the steps we came to a landing and doubled back came to another landing and doubled back again we stepped onto thick red carpeting and emerged into bright sunlight filtered through a red canopy i saw crassus and gelina seated side by side flanked by sergius orata and metrobius i heard the slithering noise of steel unsheathed as mummius stepped from behind crassus and bellowed what in jupiters name gelina gasped metrobius grasped her arm orata gave a start faustus fabius standing behind gelinas chair gritted his teeth and stared down at us with flaring nostrils he lifted his right hand and the rank of armed soldiers at the back of the canopy took up their spears crassus looking at once unpleasantly surprised and resigned to unpleasant surprises scowled at me and lifted a hand to keep everyone in place i looked dizzily around trying to orient myself red draperies hung from the canopy overhead hiding us from the spectators immediately on either side but beyond the edge of the draperies i could see the great circling bowel of the arena jammed with people from top to bottom nobles sat in the lower tiers while the common people were crowded into the seats higher up to separate them a long white rope circled the arena running from one side of crassuss box back around to the other directly before the canopied box down in the arena huddled on the sand amid pools of blood were the slaves some were in filthy rags others the last to have been taken from the household still wore tunics of clean white linen they were male and female old and young some stood as still as statues while others listlessly turned and turned looking about in fear and confusion each held a blunt wooden sword how must the world have looked from where they stood bloodsoaked sand beneath their feet a high wall surrounding them a circle of leering laughing hateful faces staring down at them they say a man cannot see the gods from the floor of an arena he looks up and sees only the empty blue sky i saw apollonius among them his right arm encircling the old man he had comforted in the annexe i searched the crowd for meto and did not see him my heart skipped a beat and for an instant i thought he must somehow have escaped then he stepped into an open space near apollonius ran to him and hugged his leg what is the meaning of this said crassus dryly no marcus crassus i shouted and pointed into the arena what is the meaning of this crassus glared at me as heavylidded as a lizard but his voice was steady you look quite terrible gordianus does he not look terrible gelina like something spat up half chewed by the jaws of hades youve hurt your head i see from banging it against a wall i imagine is that vomit on your tunic i might have answered but my heart was beating too fast in my chest and the throbbing in my head was like thunder crassus pressed his fingers together you ask me what is the meaning of this i take it you mean what is happening here i will tell you since you seem to have arrived late the gladiators have already fought some have lived some have died the shade of lucius is well pleased and so is the crowd now the slaves have been ushered into the arena armed as you can see like the ragtag army they are in a moment i shall step out onto that little platform behind you so that the crowd can see and hear me and i shall announce a most splendid and sublime amusement a public enactment of roman justice and a living parable of divine will the slaves of my household here in baiae have been polluted by the seditious blasphemies of spartacus and his kind they are complicit in the murder of their master so all the evidence indicates and so you have been unable to disprove they are useless now except to serve as an example to others in the spectacle i have planned they shall represent they shall embody that which the crowd most fears and despises spartacus and his rebels thus i have armed them as you see why dont you give them real weapons i said weapons like the swords and spears i found in the water off the boathouse crassus pursed his lips but otherwise ignored me a few of my soldiers shall represent the power and glory of rome ever vigilant and ever conquering under the leadership of marcus licinius crassus my soldiers are readying themselves and as soon as i have made my announcement they shall enter through that gate opposite with blaring of trumpets and banging of drums a farce i hissed useless and monstrously cruel a bloody slaughter of course a slaughter crassuss voice took on an edge like flint cutting and brittle what else could transpire when the soldiers of crassus meet a band of rebellious slaves this is only a foretaste of the glorious battles to come when rome grants me supreme command of her legions and i march against the rebel slaves its an embarrassment muttered mummius in disgust his face was ashen a disgrace roman soldiers against old men and women and children with wooden toys there is no honour in it no glory the men are not proud believe me and neither am i yes mummius i know your sentiments crassuss voice burned like acid you allow yourself to be blinded by carnal lust by decadent greek sentimentality you know nothing of true beauty true poetry the harsh austere unforgiving poetry of rome you understand even less about politics do you think there is no honour in avenging the death of lucius licinius a roman killed by slaves yes there is honour in it and a kind of merciless beauty and there shall be political profit for me both here and in the forum at rome asforyou gordianusyou have arrived just in time i certainly hadnt intended to seat you in my private box but im sure we can find room for you and for the boy is eco too unwell he sways on his feet and i seem to see a feverish glimmer in his eyes and this other person a friend of yours gordianus the slave alexandros i said as you must already know alexandros put his mouth to my ear him he whispered between the drumbeats in my head im certain of it i must have seen his face more clearly than i thought i recognize him now that i see him again the man who killed the master alexandros said crassus raising an eyebrow taller than i expected but the thracians are a tall people he certainly looks strong enough to crack a mans skull with a heavy statue good for you gordianus it was wise of you to bring him directly to me even at the last possible moment i will announce his capture and send him down to die with the others or shall i save him for a special crucifixion to climax the games kill him crassus and i will scream at the top of my lungs the name of the man who really murdered lucius licinius i produced the bloodstained cloak i threw it at his feet gelina lurched forward clutching the arms of her chair mummius turned pale and fabius looked at me in alarm orata squinted down at the lump of cloth metrobius bit his lips and put a protective arm around gelinas shoulder only crassus seemed unperturbed he shook his head as if he were a pedagogue and i a pupil who could not keep my grammar straight no matter how many times he corrected me on the night of the murder before he fled for his own life alexandros saw everything i said everything the corpse of lucius licinius the murderer who knelt beside the body scraping the name of spartacus in the stone to deflect suspicion from himself the murderers face that man was not a slave oh no marcus crassus the man who killed lucius licinius had no other motive than devouring greed he traded arms for gold with spartacus he poisoned dionysius when dionysius came too close to the truth he threw me off the pier and tried to drown me on my first night in baiae he dispatched assassins to kill me in the woods last night that man is not a slave but a roman citizen and a murderer and there is no law on earth or in the heavens that can justify the wholesale slaughter of innocent slaves for his crimes and who would this man be crassus asked mildly he poked his toe at the crumpled bloodstained tunic he wrinkled his nose then frowned with dawning recognition i opened my mouth to speak but alexandros was quicker it was him he shouted and raised his arm he pointed but not at crassus murnmius bared his teeth and grunted gelina cried out metrobius held her tighdy orata looked slighdy queasy crassus clenched his jaw and made a face like thunder all eyes turned toward faustus fabius he blanched and took a step backwards for just an instant his imperturbable patrician mask slipped to reveal an expression of pure desperation then just as quickly he recovered his composure and stared catlike at the finger pointing towards him beside me eco swayed and crumpled onto the red carpet xxv eco fell unconscious into a burning fever as soon as i could i took him to the villa where iaia was already anxiously waiting for news she took the matter into her hands and insisted that eco be brought to her room where she brooded over him sending olympias to the house in cumae to fetch unguents and herbs the air in the room was quickly filled with smoke from braziers and vapour from tiny boiling pots she roused eco from his uneasy sleep to pour her strange concoctions between his lips and rubbed a foul smelling salve behind his ears and around his lips for me she prescribed a strong dose of nepenthes for a few hours at least it will take you far away from this place which is what you need but i refused to drink it day turned to night without formalities to mark the hours dinner was never served people slipped into the kitchens to pick at leftover portions from the previous days feast or nibbled at delicacies brought back from the games without slaves to tend to the beds and light the lamps to indicate the hours with the unending cycle of their labour time seemed to stop yet darkness still descended that night morpheus passed over the villa at baiae his spell covered all the rest of the world but he overlooked the inhabitants of that house there was no sleep for anyone only the darkness and stillness of the long night with iaia and gelina i kept a vigil in ecos room listening in amazement as he muttered a fitful stream of names and incoherent phrases what he said made no sense and the sounds were often crude and slurred but there was no denying that he spoke i asked iaia if she had put a spell on him but she claimed no credit i sat and fretted in the dim light of iaias room my head spinning at all the terrible and wonderful things that could happen in a single day at last i wrapped a cloak around my shoulders lit a small lamp and wandered through the quiet house the empty hallways were dark illuminated only here and there where cold white moonlight poured through a window done with her errands for iaia olympias had retired to her own room but not to sleep through her door i heard soft murmurings and sighs and the low hearty laugh of a young man released after long days and nights of exile in a cave luxuriating amid soft pillows and the caresses of warm familiar flesh i smiled wishing i had some excuse to stumble in on their coupling now that the throbbing in my head had finally ceased and i could truly appreciate the sight i continued to wander until i made my way to the mens baths and stood beside the great pool the waters of the mineral spring seethed and gurgled the rising steam danced and vanished in the glow of my little lamp i looked toward the terrace and saw two naked figures standing side by side leaning against the balustrade and each other they gazed out at the reflection of the moon on the shimmering bay pools of water marked the path of their footsteps from the bath to the balustrade and great clouds of steam rose from their heated flesh the moonlight shone like a fuzzy halo on mummiuss great hairy shoulders and buttocks the same light shone on apollonius and seemed to turn him into quicksilver and polished marble i covered my lamp with my hand silent and unseen i found a way down from the terrace onto the path that led to the pier i turned toward the annexe instead and ascended the hill i came to the long low building where the captives had been held its door was pressed back against the wall and opened onto utter blackness i paused for a moment and stepped inside then recoiled at the shock of the smell the place was filled with the odour of human misery but tonight it was empty and silent from the stables farther ahead i heard the sounds of quiet conversation and laughter i followed the path around the corner of the building to the open courtyard three guards were posted outside the stables wrapped in cloaks and gathered around the warmth of an open fire one of them recognized me and nodded behind them the door to the stables stood ajar and within i saw the slaves huddled in groups around tiny lamps above the low murmur of conversation i heard someone snap get out of there you pest and i knew that meto must be among them i turned toward the villa and took a long deep breath of cold air there was no wind the tall trees that surrounded the villa stood upright and silent all the world seemed strangely alert and bemused by moonlight i walked across the courtyard hearing the soft crunch of gravel beneath my feet on the doorstep i hesitated instead of entering the villa i lingered beneath the portico then walked along the outer wall until i came to one of the windows that looked into the library the draperies were only partly shut the room was brightly lit within i saw marcus crassus wrapped in his chlamys toiling over a stack of opened scrolls with a cup of wine in his left hand he never appeared to look up but after a long moment he spoke you need not skulk outside gordianus your spying is done come inside not through the window this is a roman house not a hovel i returned to the front door and passed through the entry hall in the darkness the waxen faces of lucius liciniuss ancestors gazed down on me looking grim but satisfied i walked through the atrium where the odour of incense had at last covered the lingering smell of putrefaction moonlight poured through the open roof like a great column of liquid opal holding my lamp aloft i studied the letters sparta on the floor under the wavering lamplight and moonlight the crude scratches shone gold and silver as if some passing god and not a mere murderous mortal had drawn them with his fingertip there was no guard outside the library the door stood open crassus did not turn or look up when i entered but indicated that i should sit in the chair to his left after a moment he pushed the scrolls away pinched the bridge of his nose and produced a second silver cup which he filled to the brim from a clay bottle im not thirsty thank you marcus crassus drink he said in a tone that allowed no rebuttal i obediendy put the cup to my lips the wine was dark and rich and spread a warm glow through my chest falernian said crassus from the last year of sullas dictatorship an exceptional vintage it was luciuss favourite there was only one bottle left in the cellar now there are none he filled his own cup again then poured the last drops into mine i sipped breathing in the bouquet the wine was as bemusing as the moonlight no one sleeps tonight i said quietly time seems to have stopped altogether time never stops said crassus with a bitter edge to his voice you are not pleased with me marcus crassus and yet i only did what i was hired to do anything less would have shown contempt for the generous fee you promised me he looked at me sidelong his expression was unreadable dont worry he said at last youll get your fee i didnt become the richest man in rome by swindling petty hirelings i nodded and sipped the falernian do you know said crassus for a moment out there in the arena today when you were rolling your eyes and making your passionate speech i actually thought can you believe it i thought that you were going to accuse me of killing lucius imagine that i said yes if you had dared such impudence i think i might have ordered one of the guards to put a spear through your heart then and there no one would have questioned such an act i would have called it selfdefence you had a knife concealed on your person you looked like a madman and you were ranting like cicero on a bad day you would never have done such a thing marcus crassus had you killed me immediately after i made such a public accusation you would only have planted a seed of doubt in everyone who was there you think so gordianus i shrugged besides the point is hypothetical i never made such an accusation and you never intended to i sipped the falernian it seems useless to dwell on such a question since what you describe never occurred and the true murderer was identified just in time to avoid a terrible miscarriage of justice i might add though i know you find that to be a minor point crassus made a low noise in his throat rather like a growl it had not been easy for him to cancel the slaughter after arousing the curiosity and whetting the blood lust of the crowd even after the revelation of fabiuss guilt he might have gone on with the massacre had it not been for the intervention of gelina meek mild gelina had at last put her foot down armed with the truth she was transformed before our eyes her jaw set her eyes hard and glittering like glass she had demanded that crassus cancel his farce mummius blustering and outraged had joined her assaulted from both sides crassus had acquiesced he had ordered his guards to escort fabius and himself back to the villa currty charged mummius with closing the games and then had made an abrupt and unceremonious exit did you stay for the end of the games crassus asked no i left only moments after you did why bother to explain that alexandros and i had carried eco back to the villa fearing for his life crassus had hardly noticed ecos collapse and probably did not even remember it mummius tells me that all went smoothly but hes lying of course i must be the laughing stock of the whole cup tonight i seriously doubt that marcus crassus you are not the sort of man at whom people would ever dare to laugh even behind your back still to have the slaves rounded up and herded from the ring as unceremoniously as they were herded into it with no explanation i could hear the murmurs of disappointment and confusion even from outside the arena walls for a climax mummius tells me he hastily assembled all the surviving gladiators and forced them to fight again in simultaneous matches not exactly an original idea was it imagine what a farce that became with the gladiators already weary and some of them wounded hacking away at each other like clumsy amateurs when i pressed him about it mummius admitted that the lower tiers quickly emptied out the connoisseurs know a bad spectacle when they see it and the status seekers saw no point in remaining when i was no longer there to smile back at them we sat in silence for a moment sipping the wine where is faustus fabius tonight i asked here in the villa as before except that tonight ive placed guards outside his room and had him stripped of any weapons poisons or potions lest he do some harm to himself before i decide what i shall do with him will you bring charges against him will there be a trial in rome crassus again put on the face of a disappointed tutor what go to so much trouble on account of the murder of a nobody like lucius alienate the fabii expose an unspeakable scandal in which my own cousin was involved embarrass myself in the process they were using my ship and my resources to carry out their schemes after all do all this on the eve of the great crisis when i stand ready to take the command against spartacus and begin my campaign for the consulship next year no gordianus there will be no public accusation there will be no trial then faustus fabius will go unpunished i never said that there are many ways for a man to die during wartime gordianus even a highranking officer can be struck down by a spear accidentally cast from behind him or receive a fatal blow which cannot afterwards be accounted for and i never said that either did he confess everything to you everything it was just as you thought he and lucius had hatched their smuggling scheme together during my visit to baiae last spring faustus comes from a very old very distinguished patrician family his branch of the fabii retain a vestige of their old prestige but they lost their fortune long ago such a man can become very bitter especially when he serves under another man of a lower social rank whose wealth and power tar exceed his own and always will still to have betrayed rome for the sake ofhis own aggrandizement to have sacrificed the honour of the fabii to have given succour to an army of murderous slaves these crimes are unforgivable and beneath contempt crassus sighed the crimes of my cousin lucius are even more painful to me he was a weak man too weak to make his own way in the world neither wise enough nor patient enough to trust my generosity i consider it a personal affront that he should have used my own organization and embezzled my own funds to engage in such a disgusting criminal enterprise i always gave him more than he deserved and this was how he repaid me im only sorry that he died as quickly and painlessly as he did he deserved an even crueller death why did fabius kill him my visit was unscheduled and unexpected lucius had only a few days notice before my arrival he panicked there are dozens of improprieties in his records there were swords and spears hidden down in the boathouse awaiting shipment the night before we arrived fabius stole away from the camp at lake lucrinus after dark and came to confer with lucius to confuse anyone who might see him and without my knowledge he took my own cloak before he rode off it was suitably dark all the better to hide himself he didnt foresee the use to which he would put it and the fact that he would have to dispose of it altogether once it was ruined with blood he could neither leave it at the scene of the crime nor return it to me he tore the seal from the cloak and threw both into the bay the seal being heavier must have reached the water the cloak caught on the branches i missed my cloak the next day and wondered where it had gone i mentioned it to fabius himself and he never batted an eyelash why do you think ive been wearing this old chlamys of luciuss every night not to conform to the baian taste for greek fashion but because the cloak i brought from rome was missing i stared at him suddenly suspicious but on the same night that i suggested lucius had been killed here in the library you asked me where the blood had gone do you remember marcus crassus perfectly well and i told you then that a bloodstained cloak had been found discarded by the road you must have suspected that it was your cloak he shook his head no gordianus you told me that you had discovered a cloth not a cloak you never called it a cloak i remember your words exactly he breathed through his nostrils sipped his wine and looked at me shrewdly very well i admit that at that moment i experienced an odd quiver of apprehension perhaps a part of me glimpsed a path that might lead to the truth perhaps a passing god whispered in my ear that this cloth might be my missing cloak in which case there was far more to luciuss murder than i had previously suspected but one hears such vague whisperings all the time no and even the wisest man never knows if the gods whisper true wisdom in his ear or cruel folly still why did fabius murder lucius fabius left rome prepared to kill lucius but the actual murder was spontaneous lucius became hysterical what if i found him out as i surely would if i made more than a cursory inspection of his records or located the captain of the fury he saw his own destruction loom before him fabius urged him to keep a cool head together he argued they could keep me busy with other matters and deflect me from ever suspecting their enterprise who knows they might have succeeded but lucius lost his wits began to weep and insisted that a full confession was their only recourse he intended to tell me everything and throw himself on my mercy exposing fabius along with himself fabius reached for the statue and silenced his babbling for ever it was a stroke of genius to incriminate the slaves dont you think that kind of quickwitted coldblooded reaction is exactly the quality i need in my officers what a waste when zeno and alexandros walked in on him all the better fabius scared them off and sent them fleeing into the night to become his scapegoats he was lucky that zeno died because zeno almost certainly had recognized him but alexandros had never seen him before and so couldnt tell iaia and olympias whom he had seen that was why fabius left the name spartacus unfinished because the slaves disturbed him no he had already cleaned the visible blood in the library and wiped it from the floor of the hallway but he had not yet gathered up the incriminating scrolls that lucius had been poring over some of them had been open on the table when he killed lucius and were spattered with blood fabius had simply rolled them up to get them out of the way and put them on the floor he intended to finish scrawling the name rearrange the corpse in a more convincing manner and then go back to the library to gather up the incriminating documents so that he could toss them into the sea along with the cloak or perhaps burn them then he heard a voice from the hallway someone in the house had apparently heard him working or had been awakened by the clatter of the slaves departing and had got up to investigate the voice called again closer to the atrium fabius knew he would have to flee immediately or else commit a second murder i dont know why he lost his nerve of course he had no way of telling if the newcomer was armed or not alone or with others at any rate he grabbed the cloak and fled but no one in the house admitted to hearing anything that night oh crassus said sardonically then someone lied to you imagine who might that have been dionysius crassus nodded the old scoundrel walked into the atrium to find his patron lying dead on the floor instead of raising an alarm he took his time to evaluate the situation and consider how he might profit from it he headed for the library to do some quick snooping he found the incriminating documents why they were incriminating he had no way of knowing but the blood on the parchment spoke for itself he took them up to his room and hid them away then presumably pored over them at his leisure trying to connect them with the murder imagine fabiuss panic when he arrived at the villa with me the next day and sneaking off to the library at his first opportunity found that the documents had vanished and yet he gave no outward sign of his agitation what a cool calculating countenance what an officer rome has lost it wasnt until the night you arrived that he was able to slip down to the boathouse to throw the weapons into the water he had attempted to do so on previous nights but there was always some interruption or else he was seen and couldnt risk going through with it actually i think he was being overhesitant your arrival spurred him to take the risk and then you came upon him in the middle of the act stabbing you would have looked too much like a second murder so he tried to drown you instead he failed yes from that moment fabius told me he knew you were the arm of nemesis nemesis has many arms i said thinking of all those who had played a part in exposing faustus fabius mummius and gelina iaia and olympians alexandros and apollonius eco and meto loosetongued sergjus orata and the dead dionysius and even crassus himself so it was fabius who later slipped into the library and cleaned the blood from the statues head crassus nodded but why did he wait so long was it a detail he had simply overlooked until then no he had wanted to do a more thorough cleaning of the library before but i was always here working or he was busy attending to duties or else there was someone who might see him in the hallway but your arrival set him in furious motion to cover all his tracks my arrival i said and dionysiuss vanity exactly when the old windbag bragged at dinner about beating you to the solution he sealed his own fate whether he actually suspected fabius is doubtful but fabius had no way of knowing what the philosopher had deduced the next morning amid the confusion of the funeral arrangements he slipped into dionysiuss room and added poison to his herbal concoction you were correct by the way he used aconitum while he was in the room he also attempted to pry open dionysiuss trunk suspecting the missing scrolls might be hidden there the lock proved too strong and he finally fled the room fearing that dionysius or a slave would walk in on him where did he obtain the poison in rome he purchased the aconitum from some vendor in the subura the night before we set out even then he realized he might have to kill lucius and he hoped to be able to do it in a more subtle more secretive fashion than bashing in his skull the poison was brought for lucius but it was used to silence dionysius i found more of the stuff in fabiuss room and confiscated it to keep him from using it on himself i dont intend to let him off that easily and last night on my way to cumae fabius attempted to murder me not fabius but his agents during your altercation in front of the stables he glimpsed the bloodstained cloak hidden under your own he thought he had tossed it into the sea on the night of the murder that was the first time he knew that the cloak had been found yes i said i remember the odd look on his face had you bothered to show the cloak to me had you trusted me from the outset with all the evidence gordianus i would have recognized it immediately and all manner of wheels would have begun to turn but alas fabius could only hope that you had withheld it from me either on purpose or through neglect and that i hadnt yet seen it as was the case he had no choice but to kill you and recover the cloak and destroy it as quickly as possible it was fabius whom i had charged to obtain gladiators and organize the funeral games usually i would have assigned mummius but given his weakness for the greek slave and his distaste for the spectacle i was planning he was unreliable fabius had already determined to eliminate you one way or another he had brought two gladiators up from the camp at lake lucrinus just in case he needed them and so had them ready to send after you immediately when you departed for cumae fabius asked you where you were headed do you remember you made the grave error of telling him fabius sent the gladiators to follow you and the boy assassinate you both and bring him the cloak i nodded and when our bodies were found the murders would have been blamed again on alexandros hiding in the woods exactly but you would have been no safer here at the villa his other plan had you spent the night here was to steal into your room and pour a draft of hyoscyamus oil into your ear do you know its effects a chill crept up my spine pigbean oil ive heard of it it was another poison he had purchased and brought from rome another option for eliminating lucius short of murdering him given its effects it would have taken care of you quite nicely they say that if one pours an adequate dose into the ear of a sleeping man he will wake up the next morning raving and incoherent completely deranged you see gordianus had you spent last night here in your room you might be a babbling idiot now and had eco not shouted a warning outside the arena today a spear would have pierced me from neck to navel another gift from fabius when only one of his assassins returned to him last night with news that you had escaped with the cloak he ordered the gladiator to act as his private watchman to hide above the entrance to my box and watch for your arrival without my knowledge fabius discharged the guards who should have been standing before the entrance so there would be no witnesses it was his last desperate gambit had the assassin succeeded in spearing you he would have informed fabius and you would have been carted off to rot with the dead gladiators an anonymous and unlamented corpse and tonight faustus fabius would be free of all suspicion yes crassus sighed and the people of the cup would be spreading tales of the unique and glorious spectacle staged by marcus licinius crassus stories that would reverberate all the way up to rome and down to spartacuss camp at thurii and ninetynine innocent slaves would be dead crassus looked at me in silence then smiled thinly but instead the opposite of each of these things has happened i think gordianus that you are indeed an arm of nemesis your work here has merely fulfilled the will of the gods how else could it be except as a jest of the gods that tonight i should be sitting here drinking the last of my cousins excellent falernian wine with the only man in the world who thinks the lives of ninetynine slaves are more important than the ambitions of the richest man in rome what will you do with them with whom the one hundred he swirled the last of the wine in his cup and stared into the red vortex theyre useless to me now certainly they cant be returned to this house or to any of my properties i could never trust any of them again after whats happened i considered selling them here at puteoli but i dont care to have them spreading their story all over the cup i shall ship them off to the markets at alexandria the thracian slave alexandros iaia has already approached me asking to buy him as a gift for olympias he sipped his wine completely out of the question of course but why because it is just possible that someone might decide to bring a murder charge against faustus fabius and force a trial ive told you that i have no desire for such a public spectacle any prosecutor would of course call on alexandros to testify but a slave cannot testify without his masters permission now so long as i own alexandros i will never allow him to speak of the matter again he must be put out of reach hes young and strong probably i shall make him a galley slave or a mine worker or send him to a slave market so far away that he will quietly vanish forever but why not let olympias have him because if murder charges are ever brought against faustus fabius she might allow him to testify a slave cant testify except under torture olympias would never permit that she might manumit him in fact she probably would and a freedman can testify to his hearts content and to my eternal embarrassment you could extract a pledge no i cannot permit the slave to stay anywhere in the region of the cup dont you see so long as hes about people will keep talking about the affair of lucius licinius and wasnt alexandros the slave everyone accused of the murder and didnt it actually turn out that some patrician did it or so the gossips say you see he simply has to vanish from the cup one way or another my way is more merciful than simply killing him dont you see i clenched my jaw the wine was suddenly bitter and the slave apollonius mummius wants to buy him as you must already know again out of the question but apollonius knows nothing nonsense you yourself sent him diving for the weapons that faustus fabius tossed into the water even so and his presence among the other ninetynine this afternoon ruins him for any further service in any proximity to me mummius is my righthand man i cant have a slave i almost put to death living in mummiuss home serving me wine when i come to visit and turning down my bed for me at night slipping an asp between the coverlets no like alexandros apollonius must vanish i expect it wont be difficult to find a buyer for him considering his beauty and his talents there are agents in alexandria who buy slaves for rich parthians that would be best to sell him to a rich master beyond the edge of the world youll make an enemy of marcus mummius dont be absurd mummius is a soldier not a sensualist hes a roman his ties to me and his sense of honour far outweigh any fleeting attraction he may feel for a pretty youth i think youre wrong crassus shrugged behind the mask of hard logic on his face i saw his smug satisfaction how could such a great and powerful man take pleasure in exacting such petty revenge on those who had foiled him i closed my weary eyes for a moment you said earlier that i would be paid the fee i was promised marcus crassus as part of my fee as a favour there is a boy among the slaves a mere child called meto crassus shook his head grimly his mouth was a straight line his narrow eyes glinted in the lamplight ask me for no more favours concerning the slaves gordianus they are alive and for that you may credit your own tenacity and gelinas insistence but your fee will be paid in silver not in flesh and not one of the slaves will receive special treatment not one they shall be dispersed beyond the reach of anyone in this house sold to new masters and put to good use doing their small share to build the prosperity and maintain the eternal power of rome crassus and his retinue made ready to leave for rome the next morning the slaves with apollonius alexandros and meto among them were herded from the stables down to the camp by lake lucrinus and then to the docks at puteoli olympias weeping and refusing to be comforted shut herself away in her room mummius watched the slaves depart with a grim jaw and an ashen face iaias household slaves were summoned from cumae to tend to necessities at the villa ecos fever broke but he did not awaken that night a dinner in crassuss honour was held at one of oratas villas in puteoli where crassus and his retinue spent the night gelina attended but i was not invited iaia stayed with me to watch over eco crassus departed the cup the next morning gelina made ready to vacate the villa to spend the winter at crassuss house in rome eco awoke the next day he was weak but his appetite was strong and the fever did not return i half expected that his newly restored power of speech would vanish with his illness if as crassus had said my work in baiae had merely been to fulfil the will of the gods then it was reasonable to assume that the gods had granted eco the ability to cry out merely for the purpose of saving my life outside the arena and that now they would reclaim the gift but when he opened his eyes that morning and looked up at me he whispered in a hoarse childlike voice papa where are we papa i wept and did not stop weeping for a long time iaia even with her access to apollos mysteries could not explain what had transpired as soon as he was well enough eco and i began the journey back to rome by land rather than sea mummius had left horses for our use and soldiers to act as our bodyguards on the road i appreciated his concern especially since i was carrying a rather substantial amount of silver on my person my fee for finding the murderer of lucius licinius we took the via consularis to capua where spartacus had trained to be a gladiator and had revolted against his master then we took the via appia northwards drinking in the splendid autumnal scenery never imagining that in the spring its broad paved width would be lined for mile after mile all the way to rome with six thousand crucified bodies unlucky survivors of the annihilated army of spartacus nailed on crosses and publicly displayed for the moral edification of slaves and masters alike epilogue youll never believe whos come to see us said eco his voice was a bit deep and hoarse for such a young man but to me it was more beautiful than any orators oh i might i said just to hear him speak even two years after the events at baiae was enough to make me believe almost anything i had learned not to question the whims of the gods or to take them for granted i set down the scroll i had been perusing and took a sip of cool wine it was a midsummers day the sun was hot but a cool breeze fluttered about the flowers in my garden causing the asters to bob their heads and the sunflowers to dance could it be marcus mummius i said eco looked at me from beneath beetling brows for a while after he regained his speech he had become a child again always questioning always curious but speech had also made him whole and had quickened his manhood his fathers amazing deductions could no longer impress him as easily as in the old days you heard his voice from the foyer he said accusingly i laughed no i heard his voice from all the way outside the house i couldnt place that loud bellowing at first but then i remembered show him in mummius had come alone which surprised me given his important new rank in the city i stood to greet him citizen to citizen and offered him a chair eco joined us i sent one of the slave girls for more wine he looked different somehow i studied him for a moment perplexed youve shaved your beard marcus mummius yes he reached up and tugged selfconsciously at his naked chin they tell me a beard is too oldfashioned for a politician or too radical i cant remember which anyway i shaved it off during the electioneering last autumn it flatters you no really it does it shows off your strong jaw and that handsome scar on your chin from the battle of the colline gate ha a fresh one from fighting the spartacans i laughed youve prospered marcus mummius and set your foot on a new career he shrugged and looked about the peristyle the place was less of a mess than usual which was as it should be given the new slaves that bethesda had insisted i purchase youve prospered too gordianus in my way but to be elected praetor urbanus such an honour what are your reflections midway through your term of office he suppressed a foolishlooking grin its all right i suppose pretty boring really sitting in courts all day believe me falling asleep standing upright is a small trick compared to staying awake on a hot afternoon listening to those advocates bicker and drone about some tedious lawsuit thank jupiter its only for a year although i will admit that organizing the apollinarian games this summer was amusing enough you were there i shook my head no but im told that the circus maximus was filled to overflowing and the spectacles were unforgettable well as long as the god apollo was pleased the slave girl arrived with wine we sipped in silence your son has become quite a man mummius smiled at eco yes he brings greater joy to his father every year but tell me marcus mummius have you simply come to visit an acquaintance you havent seen in two years or does the praetor urbanus of rome have business with gordianus the finder business no actually ive been meaning to visit you for some time but my duties are quite demanding i dont imagine youve had much contact with crassus since baiae none at all except for seeing his election graffiti everywhere last autumn and hearing him speak in the forum from time to time im a busy man myself marcus mummius and my duties dont seem to bring me in contact with the great consul of the roman republic he nodded yes crassus got everything he wanted didnt he well not quite everything and not exactly as he wished you went to the ovation they gave him last december for defeating spartacus i shook my head no but you attended the great feast he gave this month in honour of hercules i shook my head again but how could you have missed it they set up ten thousand tables in the streets and the thing lasted for three days i should know it was part of my job to keep the peace surely you collected the three months worth of grain that crassus distributed to every citizen i shook my head would you believe marcus mummius that i made a point of being at a friends house up in etruria during that time it occurred to me that eco might enjoy walking in the hills and fishing in a stream and rome does become so hot and crowded in midsummer he pursed his lips my own relations with marcus crassus are not exactly warm oh theyre strained actually i suppose you know all about the slave war the decimation all that not from your point of view marcus mummius he sighed and folded his hands clearly he had come to unburden himself i had said before that there is something in me that compels others to bare their secrets i took a stiff draught of wine and tilted my chair so i could lean back against a pillar it happened early in the campaign he began crassus had his six legions raised with his own money he assigned the senates two legions to my command the ones that had already encountered spartacus and been defeated i thought i could whip them into shape but they were already badly demoralized and there wasnt much time the spartacans were bearing down on picentia from the south heading for the cup crassus sent me to observe and report back on their movements its true he ordered me not to engage them not even to skirmish with them but a lieutenant in the field has to use his judgment a group of spartacans became separated from their fellows in a narrow valley no reasonable military man would have failed to attack them in the midst of the battle word spread that spartacus had set an ambush for us and that his whole army was closing in it was a false rumour but panic spread through the ranks my men bolted and fled many were killed many were captured and tortured to death many threw down their weapons and ran crassus was furious he berated me in front of his other lieutenants he decided to make an example of my men so i heard i sighed but mummius was determined to tell the story anyway they call it decimation the removal of one in ten its an old roman tradition though no one i know can remember it ever happening before in his lifetime crassus is a keen one for reviving grand old traditions as you know he ordered me to identify the first five hundred who had fled not an easy task among twelve thousand soldiers those five hundred he divided into fifty units of ten men each the men drew lots one man in ten drew the black bean thats fifty men in all who were chosen to die the units were formed into circles each victim was stripped naked his hands bound behind his back and his mouth gagged the other nine in each unit were given clubs at crassuss signal a drumbeat commenced it was done without honour without glory with no dignity at all there are those who say that crassus did the right thing there certainly are i said remembering the grunts and grave nods of approval when the story had been told in the marketplaces of rome but youd be hardpressed to find a soldier who believes that discipline had to be maintained certainly but its no way for a roman warrior to die clubbed to death by his fellows he bit his lips and shook his head but im not telling you this story simply to brood over my own bitterness i thought you deserved to know what became of faustus fabius what do you mean did you ever hear of his fate i know that he never came back from the war i kept my ears open in the forum for news about him i heard he died in combat against the spartacans mummius shook his head no crassus somehow arranged to have fabius inserted among the men chosen for the decimation naked bound and gagged there was nothing to identify his rank or station when the clubbing began i forced myself to watch along with crassus and the other lieutenants they were my men after all i couldnt turn my back on them among the victims there was one who managed to spit out his gag he kept screaming that a mistake had been made no one else paid any attention but i ran over to take a closer look a moment later and i would never have recognized him not after the clubs struck his face but i saw him clearly enough it was faustus fabius the look in his eyes he recognized me he called my name then they knocked him to the ground they crushed his skull and beat him to a bloody pulp until you could hardly tell he was a man at all what a horrible way to die no more horrible than the deaths of lucius licinius or dionysius certainly no more horrible than the fate that crassus had in mind for the slaves even so for a roman patrician and officer to die such a shameful death i stared at crassus in horror he wouldnt look back at me but i saw a smile on his lips yes i know that smile here drink more wine marcus mummius your voice grows hoarse he swallowed the wine like water and wiped his lips the war didnt last long six months and it was over we trapped them like rats at the southern tip of italy and destroyed them crassus had the six thousand survivors nailed to crosses along the via appia so i heard mummius smiled faintly fortune nodded to marcus crassus but she smirked as well a small band of the spartacans escaped and made their way north just in time to meet pompeys army returning at last from spain pompey crushed them like ants beneath his heel and then sent a letter to the senate claiming that while crassus had done a worthy job it was he pompey who had finally put an end to the slave revolt he laughed and some of the colour returned to his cheeks why mummius you sound as if youd changed camps and become a partisan of pompey im no mans partisan now im a war hero didnt you know at least thats what my family and friends told me when i came back to rome theyre the ones who made me stand for praetor urbanus id rather be in a tent under the stars eating out of a wooden pot im sure you would anyway pompey and crassus have made peace with each other for the moment after all there are two consuls every year so each of them gets to be consul of course pompey received a full triumph for defeating sertorius in spain and the senate would only allow crassus an ovation for defeating spartacus there can be only so much glory for beating a slave so while pompey entered the city with trumpets and a chariot crassus followed behind on horseback to the sound of flutes but he did manage to talk the senate into letting him wear a laurel crown not just a myrtle wreath and the great feast he hosted this month in honour of hercules why not since pompey dedicated a temple and held games in honour of hercules at the same time they go back and forth stealing one anothers thunder still pompey cant claim to have sacrificed a tenth of his wealth to hercules and the people of rome as crassus did it takes a very rich man to be a successful politician these days i looked at him sceptically somehow marcus mummius i dont think that you came to visit me after all this time just to gossip about politics or even to tell me the fate of faustus fabius he looked back at me with equal shrewdness youre right gordianus i cant fool you for long though i will say that youre one of the few men in rome with whom it would be worth sharing gossip i feel i can speak to you honestly no i came with other news and to offer you a gift a gift at that moment one of the slave girls caught my eye more visitors she announced mummius was smiling from ear to ear yes i said two slaves master they say they belong to your guest then show them in a moment later two figures appeared in the peristyle it was apollonius who caught my eye first he was as striking as ever from behind him a smaller figure came racing headlong into the garden and was upon me before i could steady myself in my chair meto wrapped his arms around my neck and sent me tumbling backwards eco laughed out loud mummius rose and extended his hand apollonius stepped forward walking with a slight limp together they pulled me to my feet meto stood grinning at me and shuffling from foot to foot suddenly shy he had grown considerably since i had seen him but was still a boy marcus mummius i dont understand crassus told me yes that he would disperse the slaves to the ends of the earth beyond recall but marcus crassus isnt the cleverest roman you know just the richest my agent found apollonius in alexandria his new owner was a cruel man and not disposed to part with him i travelled there last summer after the war was over and before the election campaign began in the autumn to loosen the mans grasp i had to resort to roman persuasion a little silver a little steel such as a sword pulled halfway from its scabbard and just the right tone of voice to set a fat egyptian quivering apollonius was weak from mistreatment and fell sick on the journey to rome he was ill all through the autumn and winter but hes recovered now mummius scratched his bare chin and a glimmer lit his eye he says i look better without my beard and you do said apollonius smiling affectionately i suppose ill eventually get used to it does crassus know i said about my beard ha no you mean about apollonius maybe maybe not i dont see crassus very often nowadays except when duty demands it he isnt likely to encounter my household slaves in the normal course of events and if he does i shall say to him why else did romans fight and die against spartacus marcus crassus except to protect the right of a citizen to own slaves as he chooses i dont fear crassus i think hes much too busy matching strokes with pompey to fret over an old spite against me he reached out to tousle metos hair it took me longer to track down this one though he was only down in sicily quite a few of the other house slaves ended up there sold as a lot the stupid farmer who bought him ignored his training and put him to work in the fields isnt that right meto he made me play scarecrow in the orchards i had to stand out in the hot sun all day to scare them off and he wrapped my hands up in rags so that i couldnt eat the fruit off the trees imagine that i said swallowing to clear a sudden lump in my throat what about alexandros the thracian mummiuss face darkened crassus sent him to work in one of his silver mines in spain slaves usually dont live long in the mines even strong young slaves i sent an agent to try to buy him anonymously but the foreman wouldnt budge word must have got back to crassus alexandros was transferred from the mines to a galley the fury in fact even so i still hoped to save him then only a few days ago on the very day that meto arrived in rome i learned that the fury had been raided and burned by pirates off the coast of sardinia a few sailors escaped to tell the story and alexandros the fury was sunk with the slaves still chained to their posts i sighed and gritted my teeth i threw back my head to empty my cup and stared at the sunflowers that nodded in the breeze a death more terrible than that of faustus fabius i should think he might have saved himself if he had stayed hidden in that cave if he hadnt come forward to identify fabius but then apollonius and meto would not be alive today what a remarkable people these thracians are does olympias know he shook his head i had hoped to surprise her with good news now i think i shall never tell her perhaps we should otherwise she may hope and hope to no end iaia is wise enough to find a way to tell her perhaps for a long moment there was silence in the garden except the rustling of a cat among the asters mummius smiled you see i waited to call on you until i had a surprise for you meto is my gift to you you told crassus that you wanted to buy the boy didnt you its the least i can do to thank you for saving apollonius and the others but i wished to buy him only to save him from crassus then take him now please if only to spite crassus you know that the boy is clever and honest hell be a credit to your household i looked at meto who smiled at me hopefully i thought of him with his hands wrapped in rags hungry and hot chasing after crows in a dusty orchard very well i said i accept your gift marcus mummius thank you mummius grinned broadly then an odd look passed over his face and he rose hurriedly to his feet i turned and saw that bethesda had entered the peristyle from the direction of the kitchen i took her hand in mine mummius made a funny bashful face and shifted about nervously as men often do in the presence of a very pregnant woman my wife i said gordiana bethesda mummius nodded dumbly behind him apollonius smiled little meto looked up at bethesdas looming belly with parted lips clearly in awe of his new mistress i cant stay long in the garden bethesda said its much too hot i was on my way to he down for a while but i thought i heard voices here in the peristyle so you are marcus mummius gordianus has spoken of you often welcome to our home mummius only swallowed and nodded bethesda smiled and withdrew oh eco she called over her shoulder come along and help me for a moment eco nodded to our guests and followed after her mummius cocked an eyebrow but i thought yes bethesda was my slave and for years i was very careful to avoid producing another slave by her i wanted no children of my own blood certainly not slave children but your son eco came into my life unannounced i thank the gods every day that i had the wisdom to adopt him but i saw no reason to bring a new life into such a world i shrugged after baiae something stirred in me bethesda is now a freedwoman and my wife mummius grinned and now i see what you were busy doing nine months ago last december instead of going out to watch crassuss ovation i laughed and leaned toward him do you know mummius i believe it did occur on that very night eco suddenly appeared at the far end of the peristyle the two slave girls flanked him all three wore expressions of shock dismay confusion and joy eco opened his mouth for a long moment he seemed to be mute again then the words tumbled out bethesda says shes ready she says its beginning mummius turned pale apollonius smiled serenely meto whirled and clapped his hands i rolled my eyes heavenwards another crisis arrives i whispered feeling suddenly fearful and then impossibly elated another story begins authors note although he attained fabulous wealth and shared in the first triumvirate with caesar and pompey marcus licinius crassus is universally regarded as one of historys biggest losers his crucial mistake was getting killed in his illconceived campaign against the parthians in bc at the height of his power and prestige decapitation has a way of making even the richest man in the world irrelevant there are two biographies of crassus in english allen mason wards invaluable marcus crassus and the late roman republic university of missouri press is meticulously researched and argued fe adcocks marcus crassus millionaire w heffer amp sons ltd cambridge is essentially a long elegant essay ward is sometimes forgiving to a fault as when he writes of crassuss decimation of his own soldiers times were desperate and desperate measures were needed it would not be fair to criticize crassuss behavior as unnaturally vicious adcock on the other hand may be too glib when he writes of the young crassus he did not wear his heart upon his sleeve and it might be doubted whether he had a heart to wear our chief sources for the spartacan revolt are appians history and plutarchs life of crassus original source material on other slave uprisings and on roman slavery in general can be found in thomas wiedemanns greek and roman slavery roudedge london the most comprehensive guide to roman painting potions and poisons is plinys natural history which also supplies our scant knowledge of iaia and olympias those interested in the mythic properties of the sibyl of cumae may consult virgils aeneid references to food are scattered through many sources the pythagorean comment on beans in chapter for example comes from ciceros on divination but the richest larder of information is apicius adventurous cooks and armchair gourmets may consult the roman cookery of apicius hartley amp marks inc translated by john edwards with recipes adapted for the modern kitchen every now and then a researcher discovers a previously unknown volume that fits his needs with uncanny precision so it was when i discovered romans on the bay of naples a social and cultural history of the villas and their owners from bc to ad harvard university press by john h d arms it was a book i longed to read even before i knew it existed for small details and matters of nomenclature i consulted on an almost daily basis a massive musty page edition of william smiths unsurpassed dictionary of greek and roman antiquities james walton london second edition and to a lesser extent everyday life of the greeks and romans by guhl and koner another nineteenthcentury reference work crescent books reprinted my adaptation of lucretiuss why fear death following drydens translation for the funeral in chapter is arguably anachronistic given that lucretiuss on the nature of the universe was not published until around bc however i like to imagine and it is possible that in bc lucretius still in his twenties might already have been working on early drafts of his great poem bits of which might have circulated among the philosophers poets and performers who lived on the cup i want to say thank you to some people whose personal interest in my work and professional support of my career have been unflagging to my editor michael denneny and his assistant keith kahla to terri odom and the odom clan to john w rowberry and john preston to my sister gwyn keeper of the disks and of course to rick solomon a library figures prominently in this novel the library of lucius licinius is the scene of the murder in the here and now it is libraries which are being killed cut back shut down dismantled and dispersed book by book and dollar by dollar yet without them i could hardly have done my research i especially appreciate the san francisco public library severely shaken but not shut down by the earthquake of the interlibrary loan system which allows access to volumes from collections all over the country the perrycastaneda library on the campus of the university of texas at austin where ive spent whole days among the stacks in a kind of information ecstasy uncovering material for both arms of nemesis and its sequel catalinas riddle and the jennie trent dew memorial library in goldthwaite texas where in a sense all my historical research began some thirty years ago
