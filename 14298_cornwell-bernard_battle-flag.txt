battle flag by bernard cornwell the nathaniel starbuck chronicles book three battle flag is for my father with love part one captain nathaniel starbuck first saw his new commanding general when the faulconer legion forded the rapidan thomas jackson was on the rivers northern bank where he appeared to be in a trance for he was motionless in his saddle with his left hand held high in the air while his eyes blue and resentful stared into the rivers vacant and murky depths his glum stillness was so uncanny that the marching column edged to the far margin of the ford rather than pass near a man whose stance so presaged death the generals physical appearance was equally disturbing jackson had a ragged beard a plain coat and a dirty cap while his horse looked as if it should have been taken to a slaughterhouse long before it was hard to credit that this was the souths most controversial general the man who gave the north sleepless nights and nervous days but lieutenant franklin coffman sixteen years old and newly arrived in the faulconer legion asserted that the oddlooking figure was indeed the famous stonewall jackson coffman had once been taught by professor thomas jackson mind you lieutenant coffman confided in starbuck i dont believe generals make any real difference to battles such wisdom in one so young said starbuck who was twentytwo years old its the men who win battles not generals coffman said ignoring his captains sarcasm lieutenant coffman had received one years schooling at the virginia military institute where thomas jackson had ineffectively lectured him in artillery drill and natural philosophy now coffman looked at the rigid figure sitting motionless in the shabby saddle i cant imagine old square box as a general coffman said scornfully he couldnt keep a schoolroom in order let alone an army square box starbuck asked general jackson had many nicknames the newspapers called him stonewall his soldiers called him old jack or even old mad jack while many of old jacks former students liked to refer to him as tom fool jack but square box was a name new to starbuck hes got the biggest feet in the world coffman explained really huge and the only shoes that ever fitted him were like boxes what a fount of useful information you are lieutenant starbuck said casually the legion was still too far from the river for starbuck to see the generals feet but he made a mental note to look at these prodigies when he did finally reach the rapidan the legion was presently not moving at all its progress halted by the reluctance of the men ahead to march straight through the ford without first removing their tattered boots mad jack stonewall square box jackson was reputed to detest such delays but he seemed oblivious to this holdup instead he just sat hand in the air and eyes on the river while right in front of him the column bunched and halted the men behind the obstruction were grateful for the enforced halt for the day was blistering hot the air motionless and the heat as damp as steam you were remarking coffman on the ineffectiveness of generals starbuck prompted his new junior officer if you think about it sir coffman said with a youthful passion we havent got any real generals not like the yankees but we still win battles i reckon thats because the southerner is unbeatable what about robert lee starbuck asked isnt he a real general lees old hes antediluvian coffman said shocked that starbuck should even have suggested the name of the new commander of the army of northern virginia he must be fiftyfive at least jacksons not old starbuck pointed out he isnt even forty yet but hes mad sir honest we used to call him tom fool he must be mad then starbuck teased coffman so why do we win battles despite having mad generals ancient generals or no generals at all because fighting is in the southern blood sir it really is coffman was an eager young man who was determined to be a hero his father had died of consumption leaving his mother with four young sons and two small daughters his fathers death had forced coffman to leave the virginia military institute after his first year but that one years military schooling had equipped him with a wealth of martial theories northerners he now explained to starbuck have diluted blood there are too many immigrants in the north sir but the south has pure blood sir real american blood you mean the yankees are an inferior race its an acknowledged fact sir theyve lost the thoroughbred strain sir you do know im a yankee coffman dont you starbuck asked coffman immediately looked confused though before he could frame any response he was interrupted by colonel thaddeus bird the faulconer legions commanding officer who came striding longlegged from the rear of the stalled column is that really jackson bird asked gazing across the river lieutenant coffman informs me that the generals real name is old mad tom fool square box jackson and that is indeed the man himself starbuck answered ah coffman bird said peering down at the small lieutenant as though coffman was some curious specimen of scientific interest i remember when you were nothing but a chirruping infant imbibing the lesser jewels of my glittering wisdom bird before he became a soldier had been the schoolmaster in faulconer court house where coffmans family lived lieutenant coffman has not ceased to imbibe wisdom starbuck solemnly informed colonel bird nor indeed to impart it for he has just informed me that we yankees are an inferior breed our blood being soured tainted and thinned by the immigrant strain quite right too bird said energetically then the colonel draped a thin arm around the diminutive coffmans shoulders i could a tale unfold young coffman whose lightest word would harrow up thy soul freeze thy young blood and make thy two eyes like stars start from their spheres he spoke even more closely into the ear of the astonished lieutenant did you know coffman that the very moment an immigrant boat docks in boston all the beacon hill families send their wives down to the harbor to be impregnated is that not the undeniable truth starbuck indeed it is sir and they send their daughters as well if the boat arrives on the sabbath boston is a libidinous town coffman bird said very sternly as he stepped away from the wideeyed lieutenant and if i am to give you just one piece of advice in this sad bad world then let it be to avoid the place shun it coffman regard boston as you might regard sodom or gomorrah remove it from your catalog of destinations do you understand me coffman yes sir coffman said very seriously starbuck laughed at the look on his lieutenants face coffman had arrived the day before with a draft of conscripted men to replace the casualties of games mill and malvern hill the conscripts had mostly been culled from the alleys of richmond and to starbuck appeared to be a scrawny unhealthy and shiftylooking crew of dubious reliability but franklin coffman like the original members of the legion was a volunteer from faulconer county and full of enthusiasm for the southern cause colonel bird now abandoned his teasing of the lieutenant and plucked at starbucks sleeve nate he said a word the two men walked away from the road crossing a shallow ditch into a meadow that was wan and brown from the summers heat wave starbuck limped not because he was wounded but because the sole of his right boot was becoming detached from its uppers is it me bird asked as the two men paced across the dry grass am i getting wiser or is it that the young are becoming progressively more stupid and young coffman believe it if you will was brighter than most of the infants it was my misfortune to teach i remember he mastered the theory of gerunds in a single morning im not sure i ever mastered gerunds starbuck said hardly difficult bird said so long as you remember that they are nouns which provide and im not sure i ever want to master the damn things starbuck interrupted wallow in your ignorance then bird said grandly but youre also to look after young coffman i couldnt bear to write to his mother and tell her hes dead and i have a horrid feeling that hes likely to prove stupidly brave hes like a puppy tail up nose wet and cant wait to play battles with yankees ill look after him pecker but youre also to look after yourself bird said meaningfully he stopped and looked into starbucks eyes theres a rumor only a rumor and god knows i do not like passing on rumors but this one has an unpleasant ring to it swynyard was heard to say that you wont survive the next battle starbuck dismissed the prediction with a grin swynyards a drunk not a prophet nevertheless he felt a shudder of fear he had been a soldier long enough to become inordinately superstitious and no man liked to hear a presentiment of his own death suppose bird said taking two cigars from inside his hatband that swynyard has decided to arrange it starbuck stared incredulously at his colonel arrange my death he finally asked bird scratched a lucifer match alight and stooped over its flame colonel swynyard he announced dramatically when his cigar was drawing properly is a drunken swine a beast a creamfaced loon a slave of nature and a son of hell but he is also nate a most cunning rogue and when he is not in his cups he must realize that he is losing the confidence of our great and revered leader which is why he must now try to do something which will please our esteemed lord and master get rid of you the last four words were delivered brutally starbuck laughed them off you think swynyard will shoot me in the back bird gave starbuck the lit cigar i dont know how hell kill you all i know is that hed like to kill you and that faulconer would like him to kill you and for all i know our esteemed general is prepared to award swynyard a healthy cash bonus if he succeeds in killing you so be careful nate or else join another regiment no starbuck said immediately the faulconer legion was his home he was a bostonian a northerner a stranger in a strange land who had found in the legion a refuge from his exile the legion provided starbuck with casual kindnesses and a hive of friends and those bonds of affection were far stronger than the distant enmity of washington faulconer that enmity had grown worse when faulconers son adam had deserted from the southern army to fight for the yankees a defection for which brigadier general faulconer blamed captain starbuck but not even the disparity in their ranks could persuade starbuck to abandon his fight against the man who had founded the legion and who now commanded the five regiments including the legion that made up the faulconer brigade ive got no need to run away he now told bird faulconer wont last any longer than swynyard faulconers a coward and swynyards a drunk and before this summers out pecker youll be brigade commander and ill be in command of the legion bird hooted with delight you are incorrigibly conceited nate you commanding the legion i imagine major hinton and the dozen other men senior to you might have a different opinion they might be senior but im the best ah you still suffer from the delusion that merit is rewarded in this world i suppose you contracted that opinion with all the other nonsense they crammed into you when yale was failing to give you mastery of the gerund bird achieving this lick at starbucks alma mater laughed gleefully his head jerked back and forth as he laughed the odd jerking motion explaining his nickname pecker starbuck joined in the laughter for he like just about everyone else in the legion liked bird enormously the schoolmaster was eccentric opinionated contrary and one of the kindest men alive he had also proved to possess an unexpected talent for soldiering we move at last bird now said gesturing at the stalled column that had begun edging toward the ford where the solitary strange figure of jackson waited motionless on his mangy horse you owe me two dollars bird suddenly remarked as he led starbuck back to the road two dollars major hintons fiftieth birthday approaches lieutenant pine assures me he can procure a ham and i shall prevail on our beloved leader for some wine we are paying for a feast is hinton really that old starbuck asked he is indeed and if you live that long we shall doubtless give you a drunken dinner as a reward have you got two bucks i havent got two cents starbuck said he had some money in richmond but that money represented his cushion against disaster and was not for frittering away on ham and wine i shall lend you the money bird said with a rather despairing sigh most of the legions officers had private means but colonel bird like starbuck was forced to live on the small wages of a confederate officer the men of company h stood as starbuck and bird approached the road though one of the newly arrived conscripts stayed prone on the grass verge and complained he could not march another step his reward was a kick in the ribs from sergeant truslow you cant do that to me the man protested scrabbling sideways to escape the sergeant truslow grabbed the mans jacket and pulled his face close in to his own listen you son of a poxed bitch i can slit your slumbelly guts wide open and sell them to the yankees for hog food if i want and not because im a sergeant and youre a private but because im a mean son of a bitch and youre a lilylivered louse now get the hell up and march what comfortable words the good sergeant speaks bird said as he jumped back across the dry ditch he drew on his cigar so i cant persuade you to join another regiment nate no sir pecker bird shook his head ruefully i think youre a fool nate but for gods sake be a careful fool for some odd reason id be sorry to lose you fall in truslow shouted ill take care starbuck promised as he rejoined his company his thirtysix veterans were lean tanned and ragged their boots were falling to pieces their gray jackets were patched with common brown cloth and their worldly possessions reduced to what a man could carry suspended from his rope belt or sling in a rolled blanket across his shoulder the twenty conscripts made an awkward contrast in their new uniforms clumsy leather brogans and stiff knapsacks their faces were pale and their rifle muzzles unblackened by firing they knew this northward march through the central counties of virginia probably meant an imminent battle but what that battle would bring was a mystery while the veterans knew only too well that a fight would mean screaming and blood and hurt and pain and thirst but maybe too a cache of plundered yankee dollars or a bag of real coffee taken from a festering maggotriddled northern corpse march on starbuck shouted and fell in beside lieutenant franklin coffman at the head of the company you see if im not right sir coffman said old mad jacks got feet bigger than a plowhorse as starbuck marched into the ford he looked at the generals feet they were indeed enormous so were jacksons hands but what was most extraordinary of all was why the general still held his left hand in midair like a child begging permission to leave a schoolroom starbuck was about to ask coffman for an explanation when astonishingly the general stirred he looked up from the water and his gaze focused on starbucks company coffman he called in an abrupt highpitched voice come here boy coffman stumbled out of the ford and half ran to the generals side sir the raggedbearded jackson frowned down from his saddle do you remember me coffman yes sir of course i do sir jackson lowered his left hand very gently as though he feared he might damage the arm if he moved it fast i was sorry you had to leave the institute early coffman it was after your plebe year was it not yes sir it was sir because your father died yes sir and your mother coffman shes well indeed sir yes sir thank you sir bereavement is a terrible affliction coffman the general observed then slowly unbent his rigid posture to lean toward the slim fairhaired lieutenant especially for those who are not in a state of grace are you in a state of grace coffman coffman blushed frowned then managed to nod yes sir i think i am sir jackson straightened again into his pokerbacked stance and as slowly as he had lowered his left hand raised it once more into midair he lifted his eyes from coffman to stare into the heathazed distance you will find it a very hard thing to meet your maker if you are unsure of his grace the general said in a kindly voice so study your scriptures and recite your prayers boy yes sir i will sir coffman said he stood awkward and uncertain waiting for the general to speak further but jackson seemed in his trance once again and so the lieutenant turned and walked back to starbucks side the legion marched on and the lieutenant remained silent as the road climbed between small pastures and straggling woods and beside modest farms it was a good two miles before coffman at last broke his silence hes a great man the lieutenant said isnt he sir isnt he a great man tom fool starbuck teased coffman a great man sir coffman chided starbuck if you say so starbuck said though all he knew about jackson was that old mad jack had a great reputation for marching and that when old mad jack went marching men died and they were marching now marching north and going north meant one thing only yankees ahead which meant there would be a battle soon and a field of graves after the battle and this time if pecker was right starbucks enemies would not just be in front of him but behind as well starbuck marched on a fool going to battle the midday train stopped at manassas junction amidst a clash of cars the hissing of steam and the clangor of the locomotives bell sergeants voices rose over the mechanical din urging troops out of the cars and onto the strip of dirt that lay between the rails and the warehouses the soldiers jumped down glad to be free of the cramped cars and excited to be in virginia manassas junction might not be the fighting front but it was still a part of a rebel state and so they peered about themselves as though the landscape was as wondrous and strange as the misty hills of mysterious japan or far cathay the arriving troops were mostly seventeen and eighteenyearold boys come from new jersey and wisconsin from maine and illinois from rhode island and vermont they were volunteers newly uniformed and eager to join this latest assault on the confederacy they boasted of hanging jeff davis from an apple tree and bragged of how they would march through richmond and roust the rebels out of their nests like rats from a granary they were young and indestructible full of confidence but also awed by the savagery of this strange destination for manassas junction was not an inviting place it had been sacked once by northern troops destroyed again by retreating confederates then hastily rebuilt by northern contractors so that now there were acres of gaunt rawtimbered warehouses standing between rail sidings and weedfilled meadows that were crammed with guns and limbers and caissons and portable forges and ambulances and wagons more stores and weapons arrived every hour for this was the supply depot that would fuel the summer campaign of that would end the rebellion and so restore a united states of america the great spread of buildings was shadowed by an everpresent pall of greasy smoke that came from blacksmiths shops and locomotive repair sheds and the fireboxes of the locomotives that dragged in their goods wagons and passenger cars two cavalry officers waited at the depot they had clearly gone to some considerable effort to make themselves presentable for their uniform coats were brushed spotless their spurred boots were shining and their leather belts polished the older man was middleaged and balding with a pleasant face and thick muttonchop whiskers his name was major joseph galloway and he clutched a plumed hat in his nervous hands his companion was a much younger man handsome and fairhaired with a square beard and wide shoulders and an open face that inspired trust his coat showed a captains bars both men were virginians yet both fought for the north joseph galloway owned property just outside manassas itself and that farm was now the depot for a regiment of northern cavalry exclusively recruited from southerners loyal to the government in washington most of the troopers for galloways horse were volunteers from the border states the disputed lands of maryland and the western counties of virginia but a good number were refugees from the confederate states themselves galloway had no doubt that some of his men were fugitives from southern justice but the majority were idealists who fought to preserve the union and it had been major galloways notion to recruit such men for reconnaissance work deep behind the rebel lines northern horsemen were solid and brave but they rode the virginian countryside as strangers and in consequence they were timid compared to the rakehell southerners who knew that every virginian village and hamlet contained sympathizers prepared to hide and feed them it had been galloways inspiration to raise a regiment that could ride the rebel states like native southerners yet the idea had received only lukewarm support from washington raise the regiment the governments bureaucrats had told major galloway and we might deign to employ it but only if it came properly equipped with weapons horses and uniforms which was why major galloway and captain adam faulconer now waited for a passenger who was supposed to have arrived on the midday train that had just steamed into manassas the two cavalry officers worked their way against the flood of excited soldiers toward the trains last car which had been reserved for passengers more exalted than mere cannon fodder a porter lowered the carriage steps and two ladies their hooped skirts scarce able to squeeze through the cars narrow doorway were handed down after the ladies came a group of senior officers their mustaches trimmed their uniforms brushed and their faces flush from the days heat and from their consumption of the railroads whiskey one officer younger than the rest broke away and shouted at some orderlies to bring horses chop chop now horses for the general the aide shouted the ladies twin parasols bobbed white and lacy through the mist of tobacco smoke and the crush of dark military hats the last man to alight from the passenger car was a thin tall and elderly civilian with white hair and beard fierce eyes and a gaunt stern face he had sunken cheeks a roman nose as imperious as his gaze a black frock coat a top hat and despite the heat a highbuttoned vest over which a pair of starched geneva bands hung white he carried a dark maroon carpetbag and an ebony stick that he used to push aside a black servant who was lifting the ladies cabin trunks onto a handcart the gesture was peremptory and unthinking the act of a man accustomed to authority thats him adam said recognizing the minister whom he had heard preach in boston just before the war began major galloway pushed through the crowd toward the whitehaired man sir he called to the newly arrived preacher doctor starbuck sir the reverend elial joseph starbuck doctor of divinity pamphleteer and the most famous of all the norths abolitionist preachers scowled at his welcomers you must be galloway and youre faulconer good my bag he thrust the carpetbag into adams hand which had been stretched out for a handshake you had a pleasant journey i trust sir major galloway inquired as he ushered his guest toward the roadway it became successively less pleasant galloway as i journeyed south i am forced to conclude that engineering has reached its apotheosis in new england and that the further one journeys from boston the less comfortable the conveyance the reverend starbuck delivered these judgments in a voice trained to reach the deepest recesses of the largest churches and lecture halls in america the southern rails i must say are distinctly lumpy the degraded product no doubt of a slavocracy am i expected to walk to my destination the reverend starbuck demanded suddenly stopping dead in his tracks no sir i have a buggy galloway was about to request that adam go fetch the carriage then realized adam was too encumbered with the preachers heavy carpetbag ill fetch it directly sir it isnt far the reverend starbuck waved galloway on his way then peered with a fierce inquisitiveness at a group of civilians waiting for the mail to be unloaded from the newly arrived caboose have you read spurzheim on phrenology he demanded of adam no sir adam responded surprised by the fiercely abrupt question science has much to teach us the reverend doctor starbuck declaimed so long as we remember that its conclusions are ever subject to the approval and emendations of almighty god but i am interested to observe these proofs of spurzheims treatise he waved his stick toward the waiting civilians the new englander generally possesses a noble brow shape he displays cranial contours that denote intelligence benevolence wisdom and adhesiveness but even in these upper regions of the south i notice how the shape of mens skulls betrays depravity combativeness destructiveness and a distinct tendency toward cretinism adams torturing conscience like his ingrained patriotism might have driven him to fight against his fathers land yet he was still a native son of virginia and the northern preachers criticism made him bridle was not george washington a southerner sir he demanded stiffly but the reverend starbuck was too old a controversialist to be trapped into recantation george washington young man like yourself was a product of the gentry my observations are confined solely to the common ruck of people the general there you see him the peremptory stick narrowly missing an artillery sergeant pointed at a plump officer who had shared the passenger car with the reverend starbuck i see him sir adam said wondering what characteristics the generals skull shape revealed but the reverend starbuck had abandoned the subject of phrenology that is pope the preacher announced he was good enough to pay me his respects during the journey a finelooking man indeed adam looked with interest at this new commander of the norths army of virginia general john pope was a highcolored and confidentlooking man with intelligent eyes and a bushy beard if phrenology did provide an accurate guide to a mans character then popes broad forehead and solid square appearance suggested that he might indeed be the savior that the north had been seeking ever since the wars sad beginning john pope had distinguished himself in the fighting on the mississippi and had now been brought east to work his magic in the intransigent virginian countryside where northern general after northern general had first been bamboozled and then beaten by the ragged rebel armies pope has the right ideas the reverend starbuck went on enthusiastically its no good being kind to rebels disobedience calls for punishment and defiance demands retribution the slavocracy must be smitten faulconer and its lands laid waste pope wont stay his hand he assures me of that he is a man for the lords work and indeed general pope almost as soon as he had been appointed commander of the army of virginia had declared that the old policy of treating southern civilians with respect was finished northern soldiers would henceforth take what they needed from the southern population and any southerner who resisted such depredations would be punished the reverend elial starbuck applauded popes zeal the southerner the preacher now lectured adam understands only one language brute force it is the language he has used to oppress the negro and it is the language that must now be used to oppress him you agree i think sir adam said tactfully that the north must gain victory very soon quite so quite so the reverend starbuck said not certain whether he had received agreement or not he certainly deserved agreement for it was upon the reverend starbucks generosity that both the future of adam and of galloways horse depended adam had been penniless when he deserted the south but it had been his good fortune to know major james starbuck the preachers eldest son and it had been james who had informed adam about galloways horse and who had suggested that his famous father might be able to provide adam with the necessary funds to join the regiment the reverend doctor starbuck had proved more than willing to advance the money too old to fight yet too passionate to abstain from fighting he had watched impotent as the north suffered defeat after defeat in virginia the defeats had stirred the reverend starbuck into contributing his own and his churchs money to the raising and equipping of massachusetts regiments only to see those regiments led to disaster other men lesser men might have abandoned their efforts but the disasters only fed the preachers zeal which was why given the chance to contribute to the establishment of galloways horse the reverend starbuck had been quick to agree he was not only supporting adam but donating fifteen thousand dollars worth of weaponry and ammunition to galloways regiment the money was not the reverend starbucks own but had been raised by godfearing new england abolitionists in the past he told galloway and adam as they journeyed westward from manassas in the buggy we used such charitable donations for our work in the south distributing tracts establishing sabbath schools for blacks and of course conducting investigations into the evils of the slavocracy but now cut off from those activities our charities need other outlets for their expenditure theres surely much to be spent on the welfare of escaped slaves adam asked hoping at the same time that he was not talking galloway and himself out of their funding the contrabands are amply provided for amply the reverend starbucks disapproving tone suggested that those slaves who had managed to escape to the north were living in pampered luxury rather than struggling for insanitary survival in makeshift camps we need to strike a blow at the root of slavery not pluck a few diseased leaves from its topmost branches adam hearing the anger behind the preachers words suspected that the reverend elial starbuck was much keener to punish the slaveholders than actually free the slaves the buggy climbed the shallow hill from new market passed between deep woods then plunged downhill toward the warrenton turnpike as major galloway drove he pointed out landmarks made famous in the battle that had been fought the previous summer across this same ground there were the ruins of the house where surgeon henrys widow had died in the shell fire and there the matthews house which had been used as a hospital as the buggy rattled down the sudley road north of the turnpike galloway pointed to where the northern flank attack had come from the rivers far side but as he talked he became aware that the boston preacher was hardly enthusiastic in his responses the reverend doctor starbuck did not want a guided tour of the place where the north had met its first defeat he only wanted to hear promises of victory and so the conversation died away as galloway steered the buggy onto the track leading to the farm he had inherited from his father major galloway a kindly man was nervous around the famous abolitionist and relieved when the reverend starbuck announced that he had no intention of staying overnight at the comfortable farm but instead intended to take the evening train south to culpeper court house my friend banks did the courtesy of inviting me the preacher said referring to general nathaniel banks who had once been governor of massachusetts and was now a union general who believed that a visit from his old friend would serve to encourage his troops flagging spirits the invitation had certainly done wonders for the preachers spirits he had been chafing in boston taking his war news from newspapers and letters but now he could learn for himself exactly what was happening in virginia to which end he had arranged to be absent from his pulpit for the whole month of august he was fervently praying that a month would be long enough to allow him to be the first northern minister to preach the gospel from a richmond pulpit but before joining banks the preacher had agreed to this meeting with major galloway and his men he spoke to galloways regiment in the meadow behind the house where he encouraged them to fight the good fight but his brusque manner made it plain that he was in a hurry to conclude the days business and continue his journey major galloway tactfully abandoned the planned display of saber fighting and instead conducted his guest toward the farmhouse which was an impressive building shaded by great oaks and lapped by wide lawns my father prospered in the law galloway said explaining the luxurious house a slave owner too the preacher demanded fiercely pointing with his ebony cane at the small cabins that lay to the north of the house i freed all the people galloway said hastily if id sold them sir he went on i wouldnt be needing to beg money for the regiment i mortgaged the farm to raise funds sir and used all the money to buy the horses and weapons youve just seen but frankly sir ive no resources left ive made myself penniless in the cause of liberty in which cause we must all be prepared to suffer galloway the reverend starbuck exclaimed as he followed the major up the veranda steps and into the hallway the house echoed like an empty building which it very nearly was for with the exception of a few essential pieces of furniture galloway had sent all his books and pictures and drapes and ornaments north into storage so that his rebellious neighbors could not take revenge on his allegiance by stealing his valuables and if his neighbors did not steal the goods he explained his own brother would my brother fights for the south alas major galloway told the preacher and hed like nothing more than to take the house and its contents from me he paused for an instant theres nothing sadder sir is there than family members fighting on opposite sides the reverend starbuck offered a belligerent grunt as answer and that illtempered noise should have warned major galloway against proceeding further with the conversation but the major was a guileless man am i right sir galloway asked in believing you have a son who fights with the rebels i know of no such person the preacher said stiffening perceptibly but nate surely adam began only to be fiercely interrupted i have no son called nathaniel the preacher snapped i recognize no person called nathaniel starbuck he is doomed he is cast out not only from my family but also from the loving congregation of christ he is a reprobate this last condemnation was trumpeted in a voice that might have carried a halfmile into a mighty wind galloway realized he had been tactless and so hurried on talking inconsequentially about the house and its amenities until he reached the doors of the library where a tall heavyset captain waited the captain had a ready smile and a quick friendly manner may i introduce my secondincommand galloway said to the preacher captain william blythe sure glad to meet you reverend blythe extended a hand captain blythe was a horse trader before the war galloway said you should never have told the minister that joe blythe said with a smile everyone knows that us horse traders are the crookedest folks this side of tarnation but god bless me sirhe had turned back to the preacheri tried to be as honest a trader as a christian man could im glad to hear it the reverend starbuck said stiffly a hundred cents to an honest dollar sir that was always my way blythe said cheerfully and if i ever rooked a man sir why it was never on purpose and ill tell you another thing sir blythe dropped his voice confidingly if ever a man of the cloth wanted a horse why sir i swallowed the profit and sometimes a good bit more besides i confess i was never a churchgoing man myself sir to my regret but my pa always contended that a bucketful of prayer never hurt no one and my dear ma god bless her dear soul fair wore out her knees on the church planking and she sure would have liked to hear you speaking sir for they all say you do a mighty sermon the reverend starbuck seemed pleased by blythes forthright and friendly manner so pleased that he did not even show a sign of distaste when the tall captain draped an arm around his shoulders to conduct him into the bareshelved library you say youre not a churchgoing man the preacher inquired but i trust you are saved captain blythe released his grip so that he could turn an astonished face to the reverend starbuck washed white in the blood of the lamb reverend blythe said in a voice that suggested shock that anyone might have taken him for a heathen in fact im fair swilled in that precious blood sir my dear ma made sure of that before she died praise the lord and god rest her dear soul and your mother captain would approve of your allegiance in this war the reverend starbuck asked captain william blythe frowned to show his sincerity my dear mother god bless her simple soul sir always said that in the eyes of god a nigras soul was the same as any white mans so long as that nigras a christian of course then come heaven time she said wed all be white as snow even the blackest nigra praise the lord for his goodness blythe raised his eyes to the ceiling then over the unsuspecting preachers head offered major galloway an outrageous wink galloway cut short his secondincommands blarney by seating his guest at the librarys large table which was heaped with account books galloway adam and blythe sat opposite the preacher and the major described his ambitions for his regiment of cavalry how they would ride the southern paths with a confidence and local knowledge that no northern horseman could hope to match the major spoke modestly stressing the armys need for good reconnaissance and his own ambitions for a tightly disciplined regiment of horsemen yet his words were plainly disappointing the boston preacher the reverend starbuck wanted swift results and dramatic victories and it was the bombastic william blythe who first sensed that desire blythe intervened with a chuckle you have to forgive the major reverend he said for not talking us up overmuch but the real truth is were going to twist jeff daviss tail then were going to scald the skin straight off that tail and dang me if we wont then cut the thing clean off i promise you reverend that were going to make the rebels squeal and youll hear that squeal all the way to boston common aint that so major galloway merely looked surprised while adam stared at the tables scarred top but the reverend starbuck was delighted by the implications of blythes promise you have specific plans he asked eagerly blythe looked momentarily shocked we couldnt say a danged thing about specifics sir it would be downright unsoldierlike of us but i do promise you reverend that in the weeks to come it wont be jeb stuart youll be reading about in the boston newspapers no sir itll be major joseph galloway and his gallant regiment of troopers aint that a fact joe galloway taken aback nodded we shall do our best certainly but there aint nothing we can do sirblythe leaned forward with an earnest expressionif we dont have the guns the sabers and the horses as my sainted mother always said sir promises fill no bellies you have to add a lick of hard work and a peck of money if you want to fill a southern boys belly and sir believe me sir it hurts me it hurts me hard to see these fine southern patriots standing idle for want of a dollar or two but what will you do with the money the reverend starbuck asked what cant we do blythe demanded with god on our side reverend we can turn the south upside down and inside out why sir i shouldnt say it to you but i guess youre a closemouthed man so ill take the risk but theres a map of richmond up in my sleeping room and why would a man like me need a map of richmond well i aint going to tell you sir only because it would be downright unsoldierly of me to tell you but i guess a clever man like you can work out which end of a snake has the bite adam looked up astonished at this implication that the regiment was planning to raid the rebel capital and galloway seemed about to make a firm demurral but the reverend starbuck was gripped by blythes promised coup youll go to richmond he asked blythe the very city sir that den of evil and lair of the serpent i wish i could tell you how i loathe the place sir but with gods help well scour it and burn it and cleanse it anew the horse trader was now speaking a language the reverend starbuck longed to hear the boston preacher wanted promises of rebel humiliation and of dazzling union victories of exploits to rival the insolent achievements of the rebel jeb stuart he did not want to hear of patient reconnaissance duties faithfully performed but wild promises of northern victories and no amount of caution from major galloway would convince the preacher that blythes promises were exaggerated the reverend starbuck heard what he longed to hear and to make it a reality he drew from his frock coats inner pocket a check he borrowed a pen and an inkwell from the major and then signed the check with a due solemnity praise the lord william blythe said when the check was signed praise him indeed the preacher echoed piously thrusting the check across the table toward galloway that money comes major from a consortium of new england abolitionist churches it represents the hardearned dollars of simple honest working folk given gladly in a sacred cause use it well we shall do our utmost sir galloway said then fell momentarily silent as he saw the check was not for the fifteen thousand dollars he had expected but for twenty thousand blythes oratory had worked a small miracle and thank you sir galloway managed to say and i ask only one thing in return the preacher said anything sir blythe said spreading his big hands as though to encompass the whole wide world anything at all the preacher glanced at the wall over the wide garden doors where a polished staff tipped with a lance head and a faded cavalry guidon was the rooms sole remaining decoration a flag the preacher said is important to a soldier is it not it is sir galloway answered the small guidon over the door had been the banner he had carried in the mexican war sacred you might say blythe added then i should esteem it an honor if you would provide me with a rebel banner the preacher said that i can display in boston as proof that our donations are doing gods work you shall have your flag sir blythe promised swiftly ill make it my business to see you have one when are you returning to boston sir at months end captain youll not go emptyhanded sir not if my names billy blythe i promise you on my dear mothers grave sir that youll have your rebel battle flag galloway shook his head but the preacher did not see the gesture he only saw a hated enemy battle flag hanging in the chancel of his church as an object of derision the reverend starbuck pushed back his chair and consulted his fob watch i must be returning to the depot he said adam will drive you sir major galloway said the major waited until the preacher was gone then shook his head sadly you made a deal of promises billy and there was a deal of money at stake blythe said carelessly and hell i never did mind making promises galloway crossed to the open garden door where he stared out at the sunbleached lawn i dont mind a man making promises billy but i sure mind that he keeps them i always keep my promises sure i do i keep em in mind while im working out how to break them blythe laughed now are you going to give me aggravation for having fetched you your money hell joe i get enough piety from young faulconer adams a good man i never said he werent a good man i just said hes a pious son of a righteous bitch and god only knows why you appointed him captain because hes a good man galloway said firmly and because his family is famous in virginia and because i like him and i like you too billy but not if youre going to argue with adam all the time now why dont you go and get busy youve got a flag to capture blythe scorned such a duty have i hell theres plenty enough red white and blue cloth about so well just have your house niggers run up a quick rebel flag galloway sighed theyre my servants billy servants still niggers aint they and the girl can use a needle cant she and the reverendll never know the difference she can make us a flag and ill tear it and dirty it a bit and that old fool will think we snatched it clean out of jeff daviss own hands blythe grinned at the idea then picked up the check he whistled appreciatively reckon i talked us into a tidy profit joe i reckon you did too so now youll go and spend it billy galloway needed to equip adams troop with horses and most of his men with sabers and firearms but now thanks to the generosity of the reverend starbucks abolitionists the galloway horse would be as well equipped and mounted as any other cavalry regiment in the northern army spend half on horses and half on weapons and saddlery galloway suggested horses are expensive joe blythe warned the wars made them scarce youre a horse dealer billy so go and work some horsedealing magic unless youd rather i let adam go he wants to buy his own horses never let a boy do a mans work joe blythe said he touched the preachers check to his lips and gave it an exaggerated kiss praise the lord billy blythe said just praise his holy name amen the faulconer legion made camp just a few miles north of the river where they had first glimpsed the baleful figure of their new commanding general no one in the legion knew where they were or where they were going or why they were marching there but a passing artillery major who was a veteran of jacksons campaigns said that was the usual way of old jack youll know youve arrived just as soon as the enemy does and no sooner the major said then begged a bucket of water for his horse the brigade headquarters erected tents but none of the regiments bothered with such luxuries the faulconer legion had started the war with three wagonloads of tents but now had only two tents left both reserved for doctor danson the men had become adept at manufacturing shelters from branches and sod though on this warm evening no one needed protection from the weather work parties fetched wood for campfires while others carried water from a stream a mile away some of the men sat with their bare feet dangling in the stream trying to wash away the blisters and blood of the days march the four men on the legions punishment detail watered the draft horses that hauled the ammunition wagons then paraded round the campsite with newly felled logs on their shoulders the men staggered under the weight as they made the ten circuits of the legions lines that constituted their nightly punishment what have they done lieutenant coffman asked starbuck starbuck glanced up at the miserable procession lem pierce got drunk matthews sold cartridges for a pint of whiskey and evans threatened to hit captain medlicott pity he didnt sergeant truslow interjected daniel medlicott had been the miller at faulconer court house where he had earned a reputation as a hard man with money though in the spring elections for field officers he had distributed enough promises and whiskey to have himself promoted from sergeant to captain and i dont know what trent did starbuck finished abram trents just a poxed son of a whore truslow said to coffman he stole some food from sergeant major tolliver but that aint why hes being punished hes being punished lad because he got caught you are listening to the gospel according to sergeant thomas truslow starbuck told the lieutenant thou shalt steal all thou can but thou shalt not get caught starbuck grinned then hissed with pain as he jabbed his thumb with a needle he was struggling to sew the sole of his right boot back onto its uppers for which task he had borrowed one of the three precious needles possessed by the company sergeant truslow sitting on the far side of the fire from the two officers mocked his captains efforts youre a lousy cobbler i never pretended to be otherwise youll break the goddamn needle pushing like that you want to do it starbuck asked offering the halffinished work to the sergeant hell no i aint paid to patch your boots then shut the hell up starbuck said trying to work the needle through one of the old stitching holes in the sole itll only break first thing in the morning truslow said after a moments silence not if i do it properly no chance of that truslow said he broke off a piece of tobacco and put it in his cheek youve got to protect the thread see so it dont chafe on the road thats what im doing no you aint youre just lashing the boot together there are blind men without fingers who could make a better job than you lieutenant coffman listened nervously to the conversation he had been told that the captain and sergeant were friendsindeed that they had been friends ever since the yankee starbuck had been sent to persuade the yankeehating truslow to leave his highmountain farm and join faulconers legionbut to coffman it seemed an odd sort of friendship if it was expressed with such mutual scorn now the intimidating sergeant turned to the nervous lieutenant a proper officer truslow confided to coffman would have a darkie to do his sewing a proper officer starbuck said would kick your rotten teeth down your gullet anytime captain truslow said laughing starbuck tied off the thread and peered critically at his handiwork it aint perfect he allowed but itll do itll do truslow agreed so long as you dont walk on it starbuck laughed hell well be fighting a battle in a day or two then ill get myself a pair of brandnew yankee boots he gingerly pulled the repaired boot onto his foot and was pleasantly surprised that the sole did not immediately peel away good as new he said then flinched not because of the boot but because a sudden scream sounded across the campsite the scream was cut abruptly short there was a pause then a sad wailing sound sobbed briefly coffman looked aghast for the noise had sounded like it came from a creature being tortured which indeed it had colonel swynyard sergeant truslow explained to the new lieutenant is beating one of his niggers the colonel drinks starbuck added the colonel is a drunk truslow amended and its anyones guess whether the liquor will kill him before one of his slaves does starbuck said or one of us for that matter he spat into the fire id kill the bastard willingly enough welcome to the faulconer brigade truslow said to coffman the lieutenant did not know how to respond to such cynicism so he just sat looking troubled and nervous then flinched as a thought crossed his mind will we really be fighting in a day or two he asked probably tomorrow truslow jerked his head toward the northern sky which was being reddened by the reflected glow of an armys fires its what youre paid to do son truslow added when he saw coffmans nervousness im not paid coffman said and immediately blushed for the admission truslow and starbuck were both silent for a few seconds then starbuck frowned what the hell do you mean he asked well i do get paid coffman said but i dont get the money see no i dont see the lieutenant was embarrassed its my mother she gets the money you mean starbuck asked she owes general faulconer money coffman explained because we rent one of his houses on the rosskill road and mother fell behind with the rent so faulconer keeps my salary there was another long pause christ on his cross truslows blasphemy broke the silence you mean that miserable rich bastard is taking your three lousy bucks a week for his own its only fair isnt it coffman asked no it damn well aint starbuck said if you want to send your mother the money thats fair but it aint fair for you to fight for nothing shit he swore angrily i dont really need any money coffman nervously defended the arrangement course you do boy truslow said how else are you going to buy whores and whiskey have you talked to pecker about this starbuck demanded coffman shook his head no hell then i will starbuck said aint going to have you being shot at for free he climbed to his feet ill be back in a half hour oh shit this last imprecation was not in anger for washington faulconers greed but because his right sole had come loose on his first proper step goddamn shit he said angrily then stalked off to find colonel bird truslow grinned at starbucks inept cobbling then spat tobacco juice into the fires margin hell get your cash son he said he will faulconers scared of starbuck scared the generals scared of the captain coffman found that hard to believe starbucks a proper soldier hes a fighter while faulconers just a pretty uniform on an expensive horse in the long run son the fighter will always win truslow picked a shred of tobacco from between his teeth unless hes killed of course killed youre going to meet the yankees tomorrow son truslow said and some of us are going to get killed but ill do my best to keep you from getting slaughtered starting now he leaned over and ripped the bars off the lieutenants collar then tossed the cloth scraps into the fire sharpshooters put telescopes on their rifles son just looking for officers to kill and the yankees dont care that youre not fullgrown see a pair of bars like that they shoot and youre two feet underground with a shovelful of dirt in your eyes truslow spat more tobacco juice or worse he added darkly worse coffman asked nervously you could be wounded boy and screaming like a stuck pig while a halfdrunken doctor rummages through your innards or sobbing like a baby while you lie out in the field with your guts being eaten by rodents and no one knowing where the hell you are it aint pretty and theres only one way to keep it from being even uglier and thats to hurt the bastards before they hurt you he looked at coffman recognizing how the boy was trying to hide his fear youll be all right truslow said the worst bit is the waiting now sleep boy youve got a mans job to do tomorrow high overhead a shooting star whipped white fire across the darkening sky somewhere a man sang of a love left behind while another played a sad tune on a violin colonel swynyards flogged slave tried to keep from whimpering truslow snored and coffman shivered thinking of the morrow the yankee cavalry patrol reached general bankss headquarters late at night the patrol had come under fire at the rapidan river and the loss of one of their horses had slowed their journey back to culpeper court house as had the necessity to look after two wounded men a new hampshire corporal had been struck by a bullet in his lower belly and would surely die while the patrols commander a captain had suffered a glancing hit on the ribs the captains wound was hardly serious but he had scratched and prodded at the graze until a satisfactory amount of blood heroically stained his shirt major general nathaniel banks commander of general popes second corps was smoking a last cigar on the veranda of his commandeered house when he heard that the patrol had returned with ominous news of enemy forces crossing the rapidan lets have the man here lets hear him lively now banks was a fussy man who despite all the contrary evidence was convinced of his own military genius he certainly looked the part of a successful soldier for there were few men who wore the uniform of the united states with more assurance he was trim brusque and confident yet until the war began he had never been a soldier merely a politician he had risen to be speaker of the house of representatives though it had taken ballots to achieve that honor and afterward governor of massachusetts a state so rich in men willing to be taxed that the federal government had deemed it necessary to offer its governor the chance of immortal martial glory as a token of its thanks governor banks who was as passionate in his love for his country as in his hatred of the slave trade had leaped at the chance now he waited ramrod straight as the cavalry captain wearing his jacket like a cloak so that his bloody shirt showed clearly climbed the veranda steps and offered a salute which he dramatically cut short with a wince as though the pain in his chest had suddenly struck hard your name banks demanded peremptorily thompson general john hannibal thompson from ithaca new york reckon you might have met my uncle michael fane thompson when you were a congressman he sat for new york back in you found the enemy thompson banks asked in a very icy voice thompson offended at being so rudely cut off shrugged we sure found someone hostile general who damned if i know we got shot at thompson touched the crusted blood on his shirt which looked brown rather than red in the lamplight you shot back banks asked hell general no one shoots at me without getting retaliation and i reckon me and my boys laid a few of the bastards low where was this the aide accompanying general banks asked captain thompson crossed to a wicker table on which the aide had spread a map of northern virginia illuminated by two flickering candlelanterns moths beat frantically around the three mens heads as they leaned over the map thompson used one of the lanterns to light himself a cigar then tapped a finger on the map it was a ford just around there general he had tapped the map well west of the main road that led due south from culpeper court house to gordonsville you crossed to the south bank of the river banks asked couldnt rightly do that general on account of there being a pack of rebs already occupying the ford theres no ford marked there the aide interjected sweat dripped from his face to stain the blue ridge mountains which lay well to the west of the rivers the night had brought no relief from the sweltering heat a local nigger guided us thompson explained he said the ford werent well known being nothing but a summer back road to a gristmill and some of us reckoned he just might be lying to us but there sure was a ford after all seems the nigger was truthful the word thompson is negro banks said very coldly then looked down at the map again other patrols had spoken of rebel infantry marching north on the gordonsville road and this new report suggested that the confederates were advancing on a broad front and in considerable strength what were they doing a reconnaissance in force or a fullscale attack aimed at destroying his corps so how many men fired at you banks resumed his questioning of the flippant thompson wasnt exactly counting the minny balls general on account of being too busy firing back but i reckon there was at least one regiment north of the river and more of the devils coming on banks stared at the cavalryman wondering just why responsibility always seemed to devolve onto fools did you try to take a prisoner i guess i was too busy making sure i didnt end up six feet underground general thompson laughed hell there were only a dozen of us and more than a thousand of them maybe two thousand did you ascertain the identity of the regiment which fired on you banks asked with an icy pedantry i sure ascertained that it was a rebel regiment general thompson answered they were carrying that new flag the one with the cross on it banks shuddered at the mans obtuse stupidity and wondered why the norths horsemen were so inept at gathering intelligence probably he thought because they had none themselves so who were these rebels marching north there was a rumor that stonewall jackson had come to gordonsville and banks winced at the thought of that bearded ragged man whose troops marched at the speed of wildfire and fought like fiends banks dismissed the cavalryman useless he said as the man paced off down culpeper court houses main street where sentries stood guard on the taverns in the towns small wooden houses yellow lights burned behind the muslin curtains used as insect screens an undertakers wagon its shafts tilted up to the sky stood outside a church where banks remembered the famous boston preacher elial starbuck was due to speak on sunday morning the towns population was not anticipating the abolitionists sermon with any pleasure but banks an old friend of the preacher was looking forward to starbucks peroration and had demanded that as many of his officers as possible should be present nathaniel banks had a noble vision of god and country marching hand in hand to victory now with a frown on his face banks looked back to the map on which his sweat dripped monotonously suppose the enemy move was a bluff suppose that a handful of rebels were merely trying to frighten him the rebels had surely guessed that he had his eyes on gordonsville because if he captured that town then he would cut the railroad that connected richmond with the rich farmland in the shenandoah valley sever those rails and the enemys armies would starve and that thought reignited the glimmer of promised martial glory in nathaniel bankss mind he saw a statue in boston envisaged streets and towns all across new england named after him and even dreamed that a whole new state might be fashioned from the savage western territories and given his name banks street banksville the state of banks those inspired visions were fed by more than mere ambition they were fed by a burning need for revenge earlier in the year nathaniel banks had led a fine army down the shenandoah valley where he had been tricked and trounced by thomas jackson even the northern newspapers had admitted that jackson had cut banks to pieces indeed the rebels had taken so many guns and supplies from banks that they had nicknamed him commissary banks they had mocked him ridiculed him and their scorn still hurt nathaniel banks he wanted revenge the prudent course sir would be a withdrawal behind the rappahannock the aide murmured the aide was a graduate of west point and supposed to provide the politiciangeneral with sound military advice it may be nothing but a reconnaissance banks said thinking of vengeance maybe so sir the aide said suavely but what do we gain by fighting why hold ground we can easily retake in a weeks time why not just let the enemy wear himself out by marching banks brushed cigar ash off the map retreat now in a week when bostons most famous preacher was coming to visit the army what would massachusetts say if they heard that commissary banks had run away from a few rebels we stay banks said he stabbed his finger down at the contours of a ridge that barred the road just south of the culpeper court house if jackson was marching north in the hope of resupplying his army at the expense of commissary banks then he would have to cross that ridge that lay behind the small protection of a stream the stream was called cedar run and it lay at the foot of cedar mountain well meet him there banks said and beat him there the aide said nothing he was a handsome clever young man who thought he deserved better than to be harnessed to this stubborn bantamcock the aide was trying to frame a response some persuasive words that would deflect banks from rashness but the words would not come instead from the lamplit street there sounded mens voices singing about loved ones left behind of sweethearts waiting of home well meet him there banks said again ramming his finger onto the sweatstained map and beat him there at cedar mountain the legion did not march far on the day they crossed the rapidan there was a curious lack of urgency about the expedition almost as though they were merely changing base rather than advancing on the northerners who had invaded virginia and next morning though they were woken long before dawn and were ready to march even before the sun had risen above the tall eastern trees they still waited three hours while a succession of other regiments trailed slowly by on the dusty road a battery of small sixpounders and shortbarreled howitzers was dragged past followed by a column of virginia infantry who goodnaturedly jeered the faulconer legion for its pretentious name the day was hot and promised to get hotter still yet still they waited as the sun climbed higher more troops passed until just short of midday the legion at last led the faulconer brigade out onto the dusty road just moments later the guns started to sound the noise came from far ahead a grumble that could have been mistaken for thunder if the sky had not been cloudless the air was sullen moist and windless and the faces of starbucks men were pale with road dust through which their sweat ran in dark lines soon starbuck thought some of those rivulets would be blood red flycoated and twitching and that premonition of battle turned his belly sour and caused the muscles in his right thigh to tremble he tried to anticipate the sound of bullets as he coached himself to display courage and not the fear that was liquefying his bowels and all the while the distant cannons hammered their flat soulless noise across the land goddamned artillery truslow said in a sour tone some poor bastards are catching hell lieutenant coffman seemed about to say something then decided to keep quiet one of the conscripts broke ranks to pull down his pants and squat beside the road normally he would have been goodnaturedly jeered but the muffled thump of the guns made every man nervous in the early afternoon the legion halted in a shallow valley the road ahead was blocked by a georgia battalion beyond which lay a ridgeline crested by dark trees beneath a sky whitened by gunsmoke some of the georgians lay asleep on the road looking like corpses others were penciling their names and hometowns on scraps of paper that they either pinned to their coats or stuck into buttonholes so that should they die their bodies would be recognized and their families informed some of starbucks men began to take the same gloomy precaution using the blank end pages of bibles as their labels culpeper court house george finney announced suddenly starbuck sitting beside the road glanced at him waiting billy sutton says this is the road to culpeper court house george finney explained says his daddy brought him on this road two years back we came to bury my grandmother captain billy sutton intervened sutton was a corporal in g company he had once been in j company but a year of battles had shrunk the faulconer legion from ten to eight companies and even those companies were now understrength at the wars beginning the legion had marched to battle as one of the biggest regiments in the rebel army but after a year of battle it would scarcely have filled the pews of a backcountry church three horsemen galloped southward through the brittle stubble of a harvested cornfield their horses hooves kicking up puffs of dust from the parched dirt starbuck guessed they were staff officers bringing orders truslow glanced at the three men then shook his head goddam yankees in culpeper court house truslow said affronted got no damned business in culpeper court house if it is culpeper court house starbuck said dubiously culpeper county had to be at least sixty miles from the legions home in faulconer county and few of the men in the legion had traveled more than twenty miles from home in all their lives or not until this war had marched them up to manassas and across to richmond to kill yankees they had become good at that they had become good at dying too the gunfire suddenly swelled into one of those frenetic passages when for no apparent reason every cannon on a battlefield spoke at once starbuck cocked an ear listening for the slighter crackle of musketry but he could hear nothing except the unending thunder of artillery poor bastards he said our turn soon truslow answered unhelpfully this rate theyll run out of ammunition starbuck said hopefully truslow spat in comment on his captains optimism then turned as hoofbeats sounded god damn swynyard he said tonelessly every man in the company now either feigned sleep or kept his eyes fixed on the dusty road colonel griffin swynyard was a professional soldier whose talents had long been dissolved by alcohol but whose career had been rescued by general washington faulconer swynyards cousin edited richmonds most influential newspaper and washington faulconer well aware that reputation was more easily bought than won was paying for the support of the richmond examiner by employing swynyard for a second starbuck wondered if swynyard was coming to see him but the colonel closely followed by captain moxey galloped past h company and on up the slope toward the sound of battle starbucks heart gave an acid beat as he guessed swynyard was going to mark the place where the legion would deploy which meant that at any second the orders would come to advance into the guns ahead where the road vanished across the shallow ridge the georgian troops were already struggling to their feet and pulling on bedrolls and weapons the cannon fire had momentarily abated but the snapping sound of rifle cartridges now crackled across the dry landscape the sound increased starbucks nervousness it had been a month since the legion last fought but a single month was not nearly long enough to allay the terrors of the battlefield starbuck had been secretly hoping that the legion might sit this skirmish out but the georgia battalion was already trudging north to leave a haze of dust over the road up nate captain murphy relayed birds orders to starbuck truslow bellowed at h company to stand up the men hitched their bedrolls over their shoulders and dusted off their rifles behind h company the men of captain medlicotts g company stood slowly their lapels and belt loops dotted with the scraps of white paper on which they had written their names look for swynyard on the road captain murphy told starbuck starbuck wondered where washington faulconer was then assumed the general would be leading his brigade from behind swynyard whatever his other faults was no coward forward starbuck shouted then rifle and bedroll slung he took his place at the head of the column dust thrown up by the boots of the georgians stung his throat and eyes the road was daubed with dark stains of tobacco juice that looked uncannily like blood spattered from wounds the sound of rifle fire was more intense that sound swelled even further as starbuck led the legion through the woods at the crest of the ridge that had served to disguise and diminish the sound of fighting which now spread across starbucks front in a furious cacophony for a mile beyond the trees there was nothing but gunsmoke flame and chaos the fields to the left of the road were filled with wounded men and surgeons hacking at broken flesh to the right was a hill rimmed with artillery smoke while ahead lay a second belt of woodland that concealed the actual fighting but could not hide the pall of smoke that boiled up either side of the road nor disguise the sound of the guns by golly coffman said he was excited and nervous stay near truslow starbuck warned the young lieutenant ill be all right sir every damned man whos died in this war said thatcoffman starbuck reacted angrily and i want you to shave before youre shot so stay close to truslow yes sir coffman said meekly an artillery bolt smacked through pine tops to the right of the road leaving the branches whipping back and forth above the spray of needles that sifted down to the dust wounded men all rebels were lying on both verges some had already died a man staggered back from the fighting he was barechested and his suspenders were hanging loose beside his legs he was clutching his belly trying to keep his guts from spilling into the dust his forearms were soaked in blood oh golly coffman said again and went pale the blood on the dusty road looked blacker than the tobacco stains the sound of rifle fire was splintering the afternoon that smelt of pine resin sulfur and blood the shadows were long long enough to give starbuck an instants wild hope that night might fall before he needed to fight starbuck led the company on across the open land and into the cover of the second belt of timber the leaves here flicked with the strike of bullets and fresh scars of yellow wood showed where artillery bolts had sheared limbs off trees an ammunition wagon with one wheel smashed was canted at the side of the road a black teamster with a bloody scalp sat leaning against the abandoned wagon and watched starbucks men pass the trees ended not far ahead and beyond in the smoky open starbuck knew the battle was waiting for him common sense told him to slow down and thus delay his entry onto that bulletriven stage but pride made him hurry he could see the gunsmoke sifting through the last green branches like a spring fog blowing out of boston harbor he could smell the smokes foul stench and he knew it was almost time for the legion to deploy his mouth was powder dry his heart erratic and his bladder full he passed a man whose body lay splayed open from the strike of an artillery shell he heard coffman retch dryly flies buzzed in the close air one of his men laughed at the eviscerated corpse starbuck unslung his rifle and felt with a finger to check that the percussion cap was in place he was a captain but he bore no signs of rank and carried a rifle just like his men and now like them he pulled his cartridge box around to the front of his rope belt where it would be handy for reloading his broken right boot almost tripped him as he left the shadow of the trees to see ahead a shallow valley scarred and littered by battle the low land was rifted with smoke and loud with gunfire beside the road a horse lay dead in a dry ditch coffman was whitefaced but trying hard to look unconcerned and not to duck whenever a missile howled or whipped overhead bullets were whickering through the humid air there was no sign of any enemyindeed hardly any men were in view except for some rebel gunners and colonel swynyard who with moxey beside him was sitting his horse in a field to the left of the road starbuck colonel swynyard shouted over here starbuck led the company across the brittle corn stubble form there swynyard called pointing to a spot close behind his horse then he turned in his saddle to stare northward through a pair of binoculars captain moxey was fussily ordering h company to align themselves on his marker so starbuck left him to it and walked forward to join swynyard the colonel lowered his glasses to watch the battery of rebel sixpounders that was deployed just a hundred yards ahead the smoke from the small guns was obscuring the fighting beyond but every now and then a yankee shell would explode near the battery making swynyard grin in appreciation oh well done good shooting swynyard called aloud when an enemy shell eviscerated a team horse picketed fifty paces behind the guns the horse screamed as it flailed bloodily on the ground panicking the other tethered horses which reared frantically as they tried to drag their iron picket stakes out of the ground chaos swynyard said happily then glanced down at starbuck yankees are damned lively this afternoon guess they were waiting for us starbuck said knew we were coming guess someone told on us a traitor eh swynyard offered the suggestion slyly the colonel was a man of startling ugliness much of it the result of wounds honorably taken in the service of the old united states but some of it caused by the whiskey that generally left him comatose by early evening he had a coarse black beard streaked with gray and crusted with dried tobacco juice sunken eyes and a tic in his scarred right cheek his left hand was missing three fingers and his mouth was filled with rotting stinking teeth maybe the traitor was a northerner eh swynyard hinted clumsily starbuck smiled more likely to be some poor drunken son of a bitch needing cash for his whiskey he pausedcolonel swynyards only response was his cackling laugh which hinted at madness remarkably despite the lateness of the day he was still sober either because washington faulconer had hidden his whiskey or else because swynyards small remaining shred of selfprotection had convinced him that he had to function efficiently on a day of battle or else lose his job altogether swynyard glanced up at the gunsmoke then looked back to the notebook in which he was writing on his right sleeve he wore a square patch of white cloth embroidered with a red crescent the symbol was from washington faulconers coat of arms and the general had dreamed up the happy idea of issuing the badges to every man in his brigade though the idea had not been wholly successful some men refused to wear the patch and generally it was possible to tell faulconers supporters from his detractors by the badges presence or absence starbuck naturally had never worn the crescent badge though some of his men had patched their pants seats with the convenient square of cloth swynyard tore the page out of his notebook put the book itself away and then drew out his revolver he began slipping percussion caps over the firing nipples of the loaded chambers the barrel of the gun was pointed directly at starbucks chest i could have an accident swynyard said slyly no one could blame me im three fingers short of a hand so no wonder i fumble sometimes one shot starbuck and youd be buzzard meat on the grass i reckon general faulconer would like that swynyard began to thumb the hammer back then a click sounded behind starbuck and the colonels thumb relaxed sergeant truslow lowered the hammer of his rifle i can have an accident too truslow said swynyard said nothing but just grinned and turned away the nearby battery had ceased firing and the gunners were hitching their weapons to limbers the smoke of the battery dissipated slowly in the still air the rebel guns had been fighting a duel with a northern battery a duel that the northerners had won the yankees will be raising their sights swynyard remarked staring through his glasses theyve got fourandahalfinch rifles cant fight fourandahalfinch rifles with sixpounder guns we might as well throw rocks at the bastards starbuck watched the southern guns wheel fast away to the rear and wondered if he was now supposed to fight fourandahalfinch rifled cannon with rifles his heart seemed to be beating too loudly filling his chest with its drumbeats he tried to lick his lips but his mouth was too dry the sound of musketry slackened to be replaced by northern cheers yankee cheering was much deeper in tone than the bloodchilling yelp of attacking rebels the cannon smoke had thinned sufficiently to let starbuck see a belt of woodland a halfmile ahead and then to see a sight he had never dreamed of witnessing on one of thomas jacksons battlefields he saw panic ahead and to the left of starbuck a horde of southern soldiers were pouring out of the woodland and fleeing southward across the shallow valley all discipline was gone shells exploded among the grayjacketed soldiers adding to their desperation a rebel flag went down was snatched up again then disappeared in another flamefilled burst of shell smoke horsemen were galloping through the fleeing mass in an attempt to turn the men around and here and there among the panic a few men did try to form a line but such small groups stood no chance against the flood of fear that swept the majority away swynyard might be a drunkard and a foultempered brute but he had been a professional soldier long enough to recognize disaster he turned to see that captain medlicotts g company had formed alongside starbucks men medlicott swynyard shouted take these two companies forward youre in charge medlicott though much older than starbuck had less seniority as a captain but swynyard had given him the command of the two companies as a way of insulting starbuck see that broken limber the colonel pointed toward a shattered vehicle that lay two hundred paces ahead where a strip of grass marked a divide between a patch of harvested corn and a wider field of wheat form your skirmish line there ill bring the legion up in support swynyard turned back to starbuck take this he said and leaned down from the saddle to hold out a folded scrap of paper starbuck snatched the piece of paper then shouted at his men to advance alongside g company a shell screamed overhead it was odd starbuck thought how the debilitating nervousness that afflicted a man before battle could be banished by the proximity of danger even the days stifling heat seemed bearable now that he was under fire he licked his lips then unfolded the scrap of paper that swynyard had given him he had supposed it would be written orders but instead he saw it was a label for a dead man starbuck the paper read boston massachusetts starbuck threw it angrily away behind where the rest of the legion hurried into ranks swynyard saw the gesture and cackled this is madness truslow protested to starbuck two companies of skirmishers could not stand against the tide of fear that was retreating from the yankee guns the rest of the legion will help starbuck said theyd better truslow said or were vulture meat company g was advancing to starbucks right medlicott seemed unworried by the odds but just stumped ahead of his men with a rifle in his hands or maybe starbuck thought the miller just did not display his fear keep the ranks straight starbuck called to coffman i want them steady he felt in his pocket and found the stub of a cigar he had been saving for battle he borrowed a lit cigar from a man in the ranks lit his own and drew the bitter smoke deep into his lungs lieutenant coffman had drawn ahead of h company and was holding a brasshandled bayonet like a sword get back mr coffman starbuck called but sir your place is behind the company lieutenant go there and throw away that toy sword the first northern soldiers suddenly appeared at the tree line on the valleys far crest which blossomed with the small puffs of white rifle smoke a shell exploded ahead of starbuck and pieces of its casing whipped past him to his left the field had been partly harvested so that some of the wheat was standing but most was drying in stooks small fires flickered where the shell fire had set the dry crops alight there were patches of corn stubble among the wheat and two rows of standing corn where a group of rebel soldiers had taken cover the tasseled corn shivered whenever a bullet or shell whipped through the stalks a northern flag appeared at the far trees the standardbearer was waving it to and fro making the stripes flutter brightly a bugle was sounding and off to the west the rebel infantry was still running rebel officers still galloped among the fugitives trying to stem their flight and turn them round general jackson was among them flailing with his scabbarded saber at the panicked men more northerners were at the tree line some of them directly ahead of starbuck now another shell landed close to company h and starbuck wondered why medlicott did not order the two companies into skirmish order then he decided to hell with military etiquette and shouted the order himself medlicott echoed the order thus shaking the two companies into a loose and scattered formation their job now was to fight the enemy skirmishers who would be advancing ahead of the main yankee attack make sure youre loaded starbuck called the northern line had halted momentarily perhaps to align itself after advancing through the trees the southern fugitives had disappeared behind starbucks left flank and it suddenly seemed very quiet and lonely on the battlefield it also seemed very dangerous captain medlicott crossed to starbuck is this right do you think he asked gesturing at the scatter of isolated skirmishers who were alone in the wide field medlicott had never liked starbuck and the red crescent patch on the shoulder of his uniform coat marked him for a loyal supporter of general faulconer but nervousness now made medlicott seek reassurance from faulconers bitterest enemy close to starbuck could see that medlicott was not hiding his fear at all one cheek was quivering uncontrollably and the sweat was pouring off his face and dripping from his beard he took off his brimmed hat to fan his face and starbuck saw that even the millers smooth bald chalk white pate was beaded with sweat we shouldnt be here medlicott exclaimed petulantly god knows whats happening starbuck said a northern battery had appeared where the road vanished among the farther trees starbuck saw the guns slew round in a shower of dirt in a moment he thought that artillery will have us in their open sights dear god he thought but let it be a clean death quick as a thought with no agonized lingering under a surgeons knife or dying of the sweated fever in some ratinfested hospital he turned to look behind and saw the faulconer brigade streaming off the road and forming into ranks swynyards coming soon he tried to reassure medlicott the northern infantry started forward again a halfdozen flags showed above the dark ranks three of the flags were old glories the others were regimental flags carrying state badges or martial insignias six flags translated into three regiments that were now attacking two light companies captain medlicott went back to his own men and sergeant truslow joined starbuck just us and them he asked nodding at the yankees swynyards bringing the rest of the brigade forward starbuck said shells from the newly deployed battery screeched overhead aimed at the faulconer brigade better them than us eh starbuck said with the callous indifference of a man spared the gunners attentions he saw george finney aim his rifle hold your fire george wait till the bastards are in range the northern skirmishers ran ahead of the attacking line their job was to brush starbucks men aside but soon starbuck thought the rest of the faulconer brigades skirmishers would advance to reinforce him another salvo of shells thundered above him the cracks of their explosions sounding a second after the percussive thump of the guns themselves starbuck began looking for enemy officers among the approaching skirmishers yankee officers seemed more reluctant than southerners to abandon their swords and glinting rank badges and bright epaulettes a second northern battery on the crest opened fire a shell screamed just inches over starbucks head for what we are about to receive he thought may the lord make us truly thankful he could hear the beat of drums sounding from the yankee infantry was this to be the breakthrough battle for the north were they at last to batter the confederacy into surrender most of the rebel forces in virginia were seventy miles away on the far side of richmond with robert lee but it was here that the northerners were attacking and if they broke through here then what was to stop them marching south ever south until richmond was cut off and the whole upper south split from the confederacy hold still now starbuck called to his men as he walked slowly along his scattered skirmish line another minute he thought and the yankee skirmishers would be in range you see that redhaired son of a bitch with the hooked sword will starbuck called to tolby one of the legions finest marksmen hes yours kill the bastard ill take care of him captain tolby eased back the hammer of his rifle starbuck saw the enemy cannons disappear behind a blossom of graywhite smoke and he anticipated another flight of shells overhead but instead the missiles slammed into the field all around starbucks men one of medlicotts sergeants was flung backward his blood momentarily misting the hot air a shell splinter whipped into the broken limber which carried a stenciled legend announcing that the vehicle belonged to the th us artillery evidence that the rebels had pushed the yankees back across the valley before being routed in the far woods or perhaps starbuck thought the limber had been captured earlier in the war for it seemed that at least half of the rebels equipment was of northern origin a solid shot landed close beside starbuck then ricocheted up and back the nearness of the shot made him wonder why the yankee gunners were aiming at a scattered skirmish line when they could be firing at the massed ranks of the faulconer brigade and that curiosity made him turn to look for swynyards promised reinforcements but swynyard had vanished and with him the whole faulconer brigade leaving starbuck and medlicott alone in the field starbuck turned back the northern skirmishers were close now close enough for starbuck to see that their uniforms were smart not patched brown and gray like the rebels the northerners were advancing in good style the sun reflecting off their belt buckles and brass buttons behind the skirmish line a battalion trampled down a row of standing corn there were a halfdozen mounted officers at the rear of the yankee formation evidence that at least one of the attacking regiments was new to the war experienced officers did not invite the attention of sharpshooters by riding high in saddles but nor did two companies of skirmishers stand to fight against a whole yankee brigade fire truslow shouted and the legions skirmishers began their battle the men were in pairs one man would fire then reload while his companion looked for danger the redhaired yankee was already down clutching his chest truslow ran across to starbuck i was never a religious man the sergeant said as he rammed a bullet down his rifles barrel but aint there a story in the bible about some son of a bitch king sending a man to die in battle just so he could riddle the mans wife starbuck peered through the veil of rifle smoke saw a yankee go onto one knee to take aim and fired at the man a northern bullet whipsawed the air a few inches to his left behind their skirmish line the northern brigade advanced stolidly beneath their bright flags he could hear their boots crushing cornstalks and he knew that as soon as the marching line reached the further edge of the wheat field they would stop to take aim and then a killing volley would scream over the field with every bullet aimed at the two stranded companies of the legion there was nothing to check the yankees out here in the open no rebel guns were firing there were no bursting shells or clawing sprays of canister to fleck the wheat field red tom petty an eighteenyearold in starbucks company turned round with his mouth open and his eyes wide he shook his head in disbelief then sank to his knees he saw starbucks eyes on him and forced a brave smile im all right sir just bruised he managed to stand and face the enemy king david starbuck said aloud king david had sent uriah the hittite into the front line of the battle so that bathsheba would become a widow set ye uriah in the forefront of the hottest battlethe verse came back to starbuckand retire ye from him that he may be smitten and die well damn faulconer who had made swynyard set starbuck in the forefront of the hottest battle that he might be smitten and die were getting out of here starbuck shouted across to captain medlicott medlicott though officially in command was grateful for the younger mans leadership back he shouted at g company the yankees cheered and jeered as they saw the handful of skirmishers retreat enjoying your licking boys one northerner shouted keep on running well be right after you called another while a third shouted to give his respects to stonewall jackson and tell him well hang him real gentle now steady now starbuck called to his men he kept his back to the enemy concentrating on his company back to the trees steady dont run no one else from the brigade was in sight swynyard or faulconer must have taken the whole brigade back into the woods abandoning starbuck and medlicott to the enemy but why had bird not protested a shell landed just behind starbuck buffeting him with its hot punch of air he turned and saw the yankee skirmishers running toward him double back to the woods he shouted so releasing his men from their slow steady withdrawal muster them by the road sergeant he called to truslow more northern jeers and a handful of bullets followed the skirmishers hurried retreat the yankees were in high spirits they had waited a long time to give stonewall jackson a whipping and now they were laying the lash on thick and hard back among the trees beside the turnpike starbucks men panted as they crouched and looked nervously at their officer who in turn was watching the shadows lengthen across the wheat field he was also watching the far tree line where still more guns and infantry had appeared the yankees were triumphant and the rebels beaten if we stay heremedlicott had joined starbuck againwell like as not be prisoners swynyard put you in command starbuck said pointedly medlicott hesitated unhappy to take responsibility then diffidently suggested that the two companies should retreat further through the trees to the east of the turnpike a furious artillery battle was deafening the evening air smoke poured off the hillside where rebel guns were emplaced but those cannon were of no use to the beaten men west of the turnpike where the yankee line had crushed the standing corn to drive jacksons infantry back into the timber on the valleys southern crest the northern guns had the range of those trees now and the green summer woods were filled with the whistling menace of shrapnel starbuck wondered where the georgia regiment had gone and where the rest of the brigade was hidden i cant see the brigade medlicott said despairingly a salvo of shells cracked ahead of the skirmishers filling the trees with whistling shards of hot metal the men leading the retreat had followed the twisting path into a small hollow and now they instinctively crouched rather than leave their scanty cover to walk into that zone of fire the perplexed and frightened captain medlicott seemed content to let them rest maybe we should send a patrol to look for the brigade he suggested to starbuck while the rest of us wait here to be captured starbuck asked sarcastically i dont know medlicott said the miller was suddenly bereft of confidence and initiative his doughy face looked hurt like that of a child struck for an offense it had not committed yankees truslow called warningly pointing west to where blue uniforms had appeared in the woods stay still medlicott shouted in sudden panic get down starbuck would have gone on retreating hoping to join up with the rebel reserve but medlicott had been panicked into making a decision and the men crouched gratefully in the shadows two of starbucks company lowered a body they had been carrying shall we bury him one of the two men asked starbuck who is it it was dark under the trees and the evening was drawing in tom petty oh dear god starbuck said he had seen petty wounded but had thought he would live and surely petty had deserved to live for he had been a boy not a man he had used to shave each morning but the blade had made no difference to his cheeks he had only used the razor to explain his lack of beard but he had been a good soldier cheerful and willing starbuck had planned to make him up to corporal but now it would have to be mellors who was not nearly so quick on the uptake scratch him a grave he said and get corporal waggoner to say a prayer for him all around them the shouts of the yankees grew louder the woodland was filled with screaming shells so many that at times the torn leaves looked like a green snow drifting through the warm evening air the trees echoed with the pathetic cries of dying men lieutenant coffman hunkered down beside starbuck his small face showing bewilderment because his beloved southerners were being whipped because the north was winning and because nothing in his world made sense the reverend elial starbuck shared in the joy as the realization of victory dawned on the yankee headquarters and what a victory it was proving prisoners had confirmed that the enemy commander was indeed the notorious stonewall jackson the wretch wont be fetching his supper from my supply wagons tonight general banks exulted it was true that the enemy was still holding firm on the slopes of cedar mountain but bankss staff brought message after message that told how the federal right wing under general crawford was driving the rebels clean across the valley and into the woods beyond now well turn their flank banks exclaimed gesturing extravagantly to show how he meant to hook the right wing of his army around the backside of cedar mountain and thus surround the remnants of the confederate army maybe well have jackson as our supper guest tonight i doubt hell have much appetite after this drubbing an artillery major observed fellows reputed to eat damned strangely anyway an aide responded then blushed for having sworn in front of the reverend starbuck nothing but stale bread and chopped cabbage i hear you and i could chop the rogue some cabbage eh starbuck general banks thus drew his distinguished guest into the jubilant conversation i would make him eat what the slaves eat the reverend starbuck said i think he eats worse than any slave banks jested force a slave to eat what jackson dines on and the whole world would revile our inhumanity maybe we should punish the man by giving him a proper meal oysters and pheasant you think bankss aides laughed and their master turned his gaze back to the battle smoke that was already touched with a faint pink tinge of evening sunlight in the slanting light banks looked quite superb straightbacked sternfaced the very image of a soldier and suddenly after months of disappointment the politician did at last feel like a soldier he had banks modestly admitted to himself grown into the job and was now ready for the battles to come for despite this days splendid victory there would be more battles with stonewall jackson defeated general robert lee who was protecting richmond from mcclellans army would be forced north even if such a move did open the rebel capital to mcclellans forces mcclellan would dutifully overwhelm the richmond defenses pope would crush lee and then bar some mopping up on the mississippi and skullbreaking in the deep south the war would be over better it would be won all that remained was a few battles a rebel surrender a federal victory parade and most important of all the absolute necessity for president lincoln and the dunderheads in the united states congress to realize that it had been nathaniel prentiss banks who had precipitated the whole process my god banks thought but others would try to steal his glory now john pope would doubtless make the attempt and george mcclellan would certainly write to every newspaper editor in creation which made it all the more important for this nights victory dispatch to be written firmly and clearly tonights dispatch banks knew would fashion history books for years to come but more important the words he wrote tonight would garner votes for the remainder of his career federal officers gathered round to offer the general their congratulations the commander of bankss bodyguard a tall pennsylvanian zouave handed the general a silver stirrup cup of brandy a toast to your triumph sir the zouave proclaimed a ragged line of disconsolate prisoners trudged past the group of horsemen one or two of the captured seceshers glanced sullenly at the northern general and one rogue spat in his direction but tonight banks thought he would have the most valuable prisoner as his dinner guest he would treat general jackson with courtesy as a gallant soldier should and the world would wonder at the victors modesty then banks imagined himself at another dinner table a much grander table in washington that would gleam with massive presidential silver and in his minds eye he saw the foreign diplomats and their admiring bejeweled wives bend forward to catch his words president banks and why not george washington might have made this country but it had needed nathaniel premiss banks to save it a mile south of banks in a belt of woodland where fires started by shell fire tortured the wounded men screamed and fought and died the yankee counterattack was being slowed by the undergrowth and by the stubborn defiance of southern riflemen whose muzzle flames stabbed bright in the smoky shadows shells slashed through the treetops thrashing the branches and hammering the sky with their explosions blood and smoke reeked a man called for his mother in the voice of a child another cursed god but still the north pushed on yard by hard yard going through hell in search of peace nothing is served general washington faulconer said icily by breaking the brigade into small detachments we shall go into battle united if theres any battle left swynyard said with a manic glee he seemed to be enjoying the panic that had infected the western side of jacksons battle watch your tongue colonel faulconer snapped he was more than usually displeased with his secondincommand who had already lost a quarter of the legion instead of just starbucks company and what was left of the brigade must be husbanded not frittered away by being committed to the battle in dribs and drabs faulconer edged his horse away from swynyard and gazed at the woods which were filled with smoke and thrashing from the passage of northern shells and bolts god only knew what had happened in the wide valley beyond those woods but even here far behind where the fighting had taken place the evidence of impending disaster was awesome and obvious wounded men staggered back from the trees some of the injured were being helped by friends others crawled or limped painfully back to where the surgeons hacked and sawed and probed many of the fugitives were not wounded at all but were merely frightened men who were trying to escape the yankee advance faulconer had no intention of allowing that advance to enmesh his brigade i want the th on the right faulconer called to swynyard referring to the th virginia which was the second largest regiment after the legion in faulconers brigade the arkansas men in the center and the th florida on the left everyone else in reserve two hundred paces behind that meant that the remaining six companies of the legion who were presently the foremost battalion in the brigade would now become faulconers rearmost line the redeployment was hardly necessary but moving the front line to the rear killed some precious moments while faulconer tried to determine just what disasters were happening beyond the woods and colonel faulconer called after swynyard send bird to reconnoiter the ground tell him to report to me within a half hour colonel birds already gone swynyard said went to fetch his skirmishers back without orders faulconer asked angrily then tell him to explain himself to me the instant he returns now go sir captain thomas pryor one of washington faulconers new aides interjected nervously captain faulconer acknowledged general jacksons orders were explicit sir we should advance quick sir with whatever units are available into the trees sir pryor gestured nervously toward the woods but faulconer had no wish to advance quick the woods seemed to be alive with smoke and flame almost as though the earth itself was heaving in the throes of some mythic struggle rifle fire cracked men screamed and cannons pumped their percussive explosions through the humid air and faulconer had no desire to plunge into that maelstrom he wanted order and sense and a measure of safety general jackson he told pryor is panicking we serve no purpose by committing ourselves piecemeal we shall advance in good order or not at all he turned away from the battle and rode back to where his second line would be formed that reserve line consisted of the six remaining companies of the legion and the whole of the th florida two regiments that faulconer had every intention of holding back until his first line was fully committed to the fight only if the first line broke and ran would the second line fight and then merely to serve as a rear guard for the fugitive first line washington faulconer told himself he was being prudent and that such prudence might well save a defeat from being a rout he wondered where starbuck was and felt the familiar flare of hatred faulconer blamed starbuck for all his ills it was starbuck who had humiliated him at manassas starbuck who had suborned adam and starbuck who had defied him by remaining in the legion faulconer was convinced that if he could just rid himself of starbuck then he could make the brigade into the most efficient unit of the confederate army which was why he had ordered swynyard to place a company of skirmishers far ahead of the brigades position he had trusted swynyard to know precisely which company of skirmishers was to be thus sacrificed but he had hardly expected the drunken fool to throw away both companies yet even that loss might be worthwhile faulconer reflected if starbuck was among the casualties on faulconers left a column of rebel troops advanced at the double while another marching just as quickly headed for the woods to the right of his brigade reinforcements were clearly reaching the fighting which meant faulconer decided that he had no need to hurl his own men forward in a desperate panic slow and steady would win this fight and that natural caution was reinforced by the sight of a riderless horse its flank a sheet of crimson limping southward down the turnpike with its reins trailing in the dust and its stirrups dripping with blood the faulconer brigade laboriously formed its new battle lines in the first rank were the th virginia haxalls men from arkansas and the th florida the three regiments raised their dusty flags the banners bright colors already faded from too much sun and shredded by too many bullets the standards hung limp in the windless air colonel swynyard gave his horse to one of his two cowed slaves then took his place at the center of the forward line where lust at last overcame caution and made him take a flask from a pouch on his belt i see our gallant colonel is inoculating himself against the risks of battle general faulconer remarked sardonically to captain pryor by drinking water sir pryor asked in puzzlement thomas pryor was new to the brigade he was the younger son of a richmond banker who did much business with washington faulconer and the banker had pleaded with faulconer to take on his son thomas is a goodnatured fellow the banker had written too good probably so maybe a season of war will teach him that mankind is not inherently honest a seconds silence greeted pryors naive assumption that swynyard was drinking water then a gale of laughter swept the brigade headquarters swynyards water faulconer informed pryor is the kind that provides the dutch with courage puts men to sleep and wakes them soreheaded the general smiled at his own wit then turned indignantly as a mounted man galloped toward him from the turnpike youre to advance sir the officer shouted the man had a drawn sword in his right hand faulconer did not move instead he waited as the officer curbed his horse the beast tossed its head and stamped nervously it was flecked with sweat and rolling its eyes white you have orders for me faulconer asked the excited officer from general jackson sir youre to advance with the other brigades sir the aide gestured toward the woods but faulconer still made no move other than to hold out a hand the aide gaped at him no one else on this field had demanded written orders for surely no one could doubt the urgency of the cause if the yankees won here then there was nothing to stop them crossing the rapidan and breaking richmonds rail links with the shenandoah valley and nothing indeed to stop them advancing on the rebel capital this was not a time for written orders but for southern men to fight like heroes to protect their country general jacksons compliments sir the aide said in a tone that barely managed to stay on the civil side of insolence and his regrets that he has no time to put his orders into writing but he would be most obliged if you were to advance your brigade into the trees and help dislodge the enemy faulconer looked at the woods fugitives still emerged from the shadows but most were now men wounded by the fighting rather than frightened men seeking safety nearer to the brigade two small guns were being unlimbered by the road but the cannons looked a pitiable force to withstand the noisy northern onslaught that churned among the shadowed woods those shadows were long cast by a sun that reddened in the west flames started by shell fire flickered deep among the trees where rifles snapped angrily am i to tell general jackson that you wont advance sir the mounted officer asked in a voice cracked with near despair he had not given his name nor announced his authority but the urgency in his tone and the drawn sword in his hand were all the authority he needed faulconer drew his sword he did not want to advance but he knew there was no choice now reputation and honor depended on going into the awful woods colonel swynyard he called and the words were hardly more than a croak colonel he shouted again louder this time sir swynyard pushed the flask of whiskey back into his pouch advance the brigade faulconer called swynyard drew his own sword the blade scraping into the days dying light ahead of him fires burned in the wood their flames bright in the dark shadows where men fought and died forward swynyard shouted forward into the maelstrom where the woods burned into battle its gods will banks gods will the reverend elial starbuck was beside himself with joy the smell of battle was in his nostrils and inflaming him like an infusion of the holy spirit the preacher was fiftytwo years old and had never known an exultation quite like this thrill of victory he was witnessing gods hand at work and seeing the triumph of righteousness over the slavocracy on on he shouted encouragingly to a fresh battery of northern artillery that traveled toward the smoke of battle the reverend starbuck had come to culpeper court house to preach to the troops but instead found himself cheering them on to glory the reverend elial starbucks jubilation matched general bankss excitement the politician turned general was realizing he had won he was actually trouncing the wretched and infamous jackson who had given him such misery earlier in the year the bells of boston would ring for this success of a native son and suddenly the realization of the governors most daring ambitions seemed so dazzlingly close nathaniel prentiss banks seventeenth president of the united states of america he said the phrase under his breath relishing it but then the glory of that triumph dizzied banks in his saddle and to steady himself he turned back to the reverend starbuck hows that son of yours starbuck banks asked trying to give the impression of a man humble and confident enough to make small talk at the moment of glory james is well thank you governor the preacher responded hes with mcclellans forces in front of richmond he suffered a touch of fever a month ago but writes to say he is fully recovered i meant the young man you named after me banks said how is he nathaniels well so far as i know the reverend starbuck said curtly then was saved from any further queries about his traitor son by the arrival of an aide on a horse that had a mane paled by dust and flanks foaming with sweat the aide gave banks a swift salute and a note from brigadier general crawford the note had been hastily scribbled in the saddle and banks found it hard to decipher the penciled letters news of victory i hope banks suggested to the newly arrived aide the generals requesting reinforcements sir the aide said respectfully his horse trembled as a rebel shell wailed overhead reinforcements banks asked in the pause after his question the rebel shell exploded harmlessly behind scattering dirt across the road reinforcements banks said again frowning as though he found the word incomprehensible then he straightened his already immaculate uniform reinforcements he asked a third time but i thought he was driving the enemy from the field we need to break them sir the aide sounded enthusiastic one more brigade will rout them utterly i hoped they were finished already banks said crumpling crawfords message in his hand theyre skulking in some woods sir our fellows are pressing hard but theyll need help there isnt any help banks said indignantly as though the aide were spoiling his moment of glory i sent him gordons brigade isnt that enough the aide glanced at the gaudily uniformed pennsylvania zouaves who formed general bankss personal bodyguard maybe we should send every man available sir to destroy them before theyre saved by nightfall he spoke very respectfully as befitted a captain offering tactical advice to a major general we have no reserves captain banks said in a peevish voice we are fully committed so press on press hard tell crawford its his responsibility now i wont have men calling for help not when were on the verge of victory go back and tell him to push on hard you hear me push on hard and no stopping till nightfall the long speech had restored bankss confidence he was winning it was gods will that the vaunted stonewall jackson should be humbled its nervousness plain nervousness banks explained general crawfords request to the men who surrounded him a fellow finds himself on the winning side and cant believe his luck so he asks for help at the last moment i hope youll be kind to crawford in your memoirs sir the zouave commander observed to be sure to be sure banks said who had not considered his memoirs till this moment but now found himself dreaming of a threevolume work provisionally entitled bankss war he decided he would depict his early defeats as necessary deceptions that had lured the cabbageeating jackson on to destruction at cedar mountain i might have been reviledthe general rehearsed a sentence in his headbut i was playing a longer hand than my critics knew especially those journalistic curs who dared to offer me advice even though not one of them could tell a parrott gun from a birds beak the reverend elial starbuck broke this pleasant reverie by begging bankss permission to ride forward so he could observe the pursuit and final humiliation of the enemy your triumph is an answer to my prayers governor the preacher said and i would dearly like to witness its full fruits my dear starbuck of course you must ride forward captain hetherington banks summoned one of his junior aides to accompany the preacher though he also cautioned the aide not to expose the reverend starbuck to any danger the caution was given to make certain that the reverend starbuck survived to preach bankss fame from his influential pulpit a wounded cur can still bite banks warned the preacher so you must stay well clear of the dying beasts jaws god will preserve me governor the reverend starbuck averred he is my strong shield and protector thus guarded the reverend starbuck set off across the fields with hetherington first threading a path between rows of army wagons with white canvas hoods then passing a field hospital where the reverend starbuck paused to inspect the faces of the wounded southern prisoners who lay after surgery on the grass outside the tents some were still comatose from the effects of chloroform a few slept from sheer weariness but the majority lay pale and frightened a few crudely bandaged casualties lay waiting for the surgeons knives and to anyone unaccustomed to battle the sight of such grievously hurt men might have proved more than the strongest stomach could abide but the reverend starbuck seemed positively enlivened by the horrid spectacle indeed he leaned out of his saddle for a closer look at one mans mangled limbs and bloodied scalp you note the low cranial gap and the pronounced teeth he observed to hetherington sir hetherington asked in puzzlement look at his face man look at any of their faces cant you see the pronounced difference between them and the northern visage captain hetherington thought that the southerners did not look very much different from northerners except that they were generally thinner and a good deal more raggedly uniformed but he did not want to contradict the eminent preacher and so he agreed that the captured rebels did indeed display low foreheads and feral teeth such features are the classic symptoms of feeblemindedness and moral degradation the reverend starbuck announced happily then remembered the christian duty that was owed even to such fallen souls as these rebel prisoners though your sins be as scarlet he called down to them yet you may be washed whiter than snow you must repent you must repent he had come equipped with copies of his tract freeing the oppressed which explained why christian men should be prepared to die for the sacred cause of abolishing slavery and now the reverend starbuck dropped a few copies among the wounded men something to read during your imprisonment he told them something to explain your errors he spurred on cheered by this chance to have spread the good word we have been remiss captain the preacher declared to hetherington as the two men left the hospital behind in restricting our mission work to heathen lands and southern slaves we should have sent more good men into the rebellious states to tussle with the demons that dwell in the white mans soul there are plenty of churches are there not in the secessionist states captain hetherington inquired respectfully after leading the preacher around a tangle of telegraph wire that had been dumped beside a ditch there are indeed churches in the south the reverend starbuck said in a tone of distaste and pastors too i dare say yet their existence should not deceive us the scriptures warn us against those false prophets who shall inhabit the latter days and such prophets have no difficulty in persuading the feebleminded to adopt the devils ways but the second epistle of peter promises us that the false prophets shall bring upon themselves a swift destruction i think we are witnessing the beginnings of that providence for this is the lords doing the reverend doctor starbuck declaimed happily gesturing toward two dogs that fought over a dead mans intestines close to a smoking shell crater and we should rejoice and be glad in it a less pious impulse made the reverend wonder whether the money he had just expended on galloways horse was going to be wasted maybe the war would be won without galloways men then he thrust that concern away and let this days good news fill him with joy instead captain hetherington wanted to drive the two dogs away from their offal but the reverend starbuck was spurring ahead and the aides duty was to stay with the preacher so he galloped to catch up are you saying sir hetherington asked respectfully that none of the rebels are christians how can they be the boston preacher responded our faith has never preached rebellion against the lawful and godly authority of the state so at best the south is in grievous error and thus in desperate need of repentance and forgiveness and at worst the reverend starbuck shook his head rather than even consider such a question yet the very asking of it made him think of his second son and how nate was even now irretrievably committed to the fires of hell nate would burn in everlasting flames tormented through all eternity by agonies unimaginable and he deserves it the reverend starbuck protested aloud im sorry sir hetherington asked thinking he had misheard a comment addressed to him nothing captain nothing you are saved yourself indeed sir i came to christ three years ago and have praised god for his mercies ever since praise him indeed the reverend starbuck responded though in truth he was secretly disappointed that his escort should thus prove to be a bornagain christian for there were few things elial starbuck enjoyed so much as having what he called a tussle with a sinner he could boast of having left many a strong man in tears after an hours good argument the two men arrived at a northern battery of twelvepounder napoleons the four guns were silent their shirtsleeved gunners leaning on their weapons wheels and staring across the valley to where a longshadowed stand of trees was crowned with gunsmoke no targets sir the battery commander answered when the reverend starbuck asked why he was not firing our fellows are inside those woods sir or maybe a halfmile beyond which means our jobs done for the day he took a pull of his flask which contained brandy those shell bursts are rebel guns firing long sir he added gesturing at the white explosions that blossomed intermittently on the far crest the sound of each explosion followed a few seconds later like a small rumble of thunder just their rear guard the artilleryman said confidently and we can leave the peasantry to look after them the peasantry the reverend starbuck inquired the infantry sir lowest of the low see what i mean sir the reverend starbuck did not see at all but decided not to make an issue of his puzzlement and the rebels he asked instead where are they the gunner major took note of the older mans geneva bands and straightened himself respectfully you can see some of the dead ones sir excuse my callousness and the rest are probably halfway to richmond by now ive waited over a year to see the rascals skedaddle sir and its a fine sight our young ladies saw them off in fine style the major slapped the still warm barrel of the closest gun which like the rest of the napoleons in the battery had a girls name painted on its trail this gun was maud while its companions were named eliza louise and anna it is the lords doing the lords doing the reverend starbuck murmured happily the seceshers are still lively over there captain hetherington gestured to faroff cedar mountain where gunsmoke still jetted from the rebel batteries but not for long the artillery major spoke confidently well hook behind their rear and take every man jack of them prisoner as long as nightfall doesnt come first he added the sun was very low and the light reddening the reverend starbuck took a small telescope from his pocket and trained it on the woods ahead he could see very little except for smoke leaves and burning shell craters though in the nearer open land he could make out the humped shapes of the dead lying in the remnants of the wheat field we shall go to the woods he announced to his companion im not sure we should sir captain hetherington demurred politely there are still shells falling we shall come to no harm captain though we walk through the valley of the shadow of death we shall fear no evil come in truth the reverend starbuck wanted to ride closer to those bursting shells he had decided that his exhilaration was symptomatic of a natural taste for battle that maybe he was discovering a godgiven talent for warfare and it was suddenly no wonder to him that the lord of hosts had so frequently exhorted israel to the fight this blood and slaughter was the way to see gods work accomplished sermonizing and mission work were all very well and doubtless god listened to the prayers of all those wilting women with faded silk bookmarks in their wellthumbed bibles but this hammer of battle was a more certain method of bringing about his kingdom the sinners were being scourged by the holy flail of sword steel and gunpowder and the reverend doctor starbuck exulted in the process onwards captain he encouraged hetherington the enemy is beaten theres nothing to fear hetherington paused but the artillery major was in full agreement with the preacher theyre well beaten sir and amen the major declared and that encouragement was enough to make the reverend starbuck hand down some copies of freeing the oppressed for the weary gunners then spirits soaring he spurred his horse past the quartet of fanshaped swathes of scorched stubble that marked where eliza louise maud and anna had belched flame and smoke at the enemy captain hetherington followed unhappily we dont know that the rebels are yet cleared from the woods sir then we shall find out captain the reverend starbuck said happily he trotted past the remains of a northerner who had been blown apart by the direct hit of a rebel shell and who was now nothing but a flycrawling mess of jaggedended bones blue guts torn flesh and uniform scraps the reverend felt no anguish at the sight merely the satisfaction that the dead man was a hero who had gone to his maker by virtue of having died for a cause as noble as any that had ever driven man onto the battlefield a few paces beyond the dead federal was the corpse of a southerner his throat cut to the bone by a fragment of shell casing the wretch was dressed in gaping shoes torn pants and a threadbare coat of pale gray patched with brown but the corpses most repellent aspect was the grasping look on his face the preacher reckoned he saw that same depraved physiognomy on most of the rebel dead and on the faces of the rebel wounded who cried for help as the two horsemen rode by these rebels the reverend starbuck decided were demonstrably feebleminded and doubtless morally infantile the doctors in boston were convinced that such mental weaknesses were inherited traits and the more the reverend elial starbuck saw of these southerners the more persuaded he was of that medical truth had there been miscegenation had the white race so disgraced itself with its own slaves that it was now paying the hereditary price that thought so disgusted the reverend that he flinched but then an even more terrible thought occurred to him was his son nathaniels moral degradation inherited the reverend starbuck cast that suspicion out nathaniel was a backslider and so doubly guilty nathaniels sins could not be laid at his parents door but only at his own wicked feet the reverend elial starbuck thus ruminated about heredity slavery and feeblemindedness as he rode across the hot battlefield yet he did not entirely ignore the cries that came from the parched hurting men left helpless by the fighting the wounded rebels were pleading for water for a doctor or for help in reaching the field hospitals and the reverend starbuck offered them what comfort was in his power by assuring them that salvation could be theirs after a true repentance one darkbearded man sheltering under a bulletscarred tree and with his leg half severed and a rifle sling serving as a tourniquet about his thigh cursed the preacher and demanded brandy instead of a sermon but the reverend starbuck merely let a tract fall toward the man and then spurred sadly on once this rebellion is ended captain he observed we shall be faced with a mighty task in the south we shall needs preach the pure gospel to a people led into error by false teachers hetherington was about to agree with that pious observation but was checked from speaking by a sudden sound coming from the west to the reverend starbuck unused to the noise of battle the sound was exactly like gigantic sheets of stiff canvas being ripped across or perhaps like the noise caused by the wretched urchins who liked to run down beacon hill dragging sticks along the iron palings the noise was so sudden and intrusive that he instinctively checked his horse but then assuming that the weird sound presaged the end of rebellion he urged the beast on again and muttered a prayer of thanks for gods providence in giving the north victory captain hetherington less sanguine checked the preachers horse i didnt think the rebs were that far west he said apparently speaking to himself west the preacher asked confused rifle volleys sir hetherington answered explaining the strange noise the captain stared toward the dying sun where a trembling veil of smoke was starting to show above the trees that noise the reverend starbuck exclaimed listen you hear that noise what is it his excitement was caused by a new sound that was suddenly added to the rifle volleys it was a highpitched noise infused with a yelping triumph and thrilled through with a ululating and gleeful quality that suggested that the creatures who made such a sound were come willingly and even gladly to this field of slaughter you know what youre hearing the reverend starbuck asked the question with enthusiasm its the paean i never thought i should live to hear it hetherington glanced at the preacher the peon sir he asked puzzled youve read aristophanes surely the preacher demanded impatiently you remember how he describes the war cry of the greek infantry the paeanmaybe the preacher thought some classically minded officer from yale or harvard had fostered the pleasant fancy of teaching his northern soldiers that ancient war cry listen man he said excitedly its the sound of the phalanx the sound of the spartans the sound of homers heroes captain hetherington could hear the sound only too clearly thats not the paean sir its the rebel yell you mean the reverend starbuck began then fell abruptly silent he had read about the rebel yell in the boston newspapers but now he was hearing it for himself and the sound of it suddenly seemed anything but classical instead it was infused with the purest evil a noise to chill the blood like a scrabble of wild beasts howling or like the baying of a horde of demons begging to be released from the smoking gates of hell why are they yelling the preacher asked because theyre not beaten sir thats why hetherington said and he reached for the preachers reins and pulled his horse around the reverend starbuck protested the about turn for he was already very close to the woods and he wanted to see what lay beyond the trees but the captain could not be persuaded to continue the battles not won sir he said quietly it might even be lost for a rebel yell meant only one thing a rebel attack because the wretches werent beaten at all captain nathaniel starbuck crouched in the woods close by the turnpike heard the screaming of a rebel counterattack about goddamned time he murmured to no one in particular the gunfire in the trees had been sporadic for the last few minutes and starbuck had begun to fear that the legions stranded skirmishers would be trapped far behind a victorious northern army so far the only resistance to the northern attack had seemed haphazard and futile but now the rifle fire swelled into the full intensity of battle to which the screams of the attacking southerners added an unearthly descant the battle was all sound to starbuck for he could see nothing through the smoky deepshadowed undergrowth but the sounds indicated that the attacking northerners were being checked and even counterattacked i reckon we should join in starbuck said to captain medlicott no medlicott said absolutely not the reply was too vehement betraying medlicotts fear the miller turned soldier was as whitefaced as though he had just come from a hard shift at his old grindstones sweat dripped and glistened in his beard while his eyes flicked nervously around the sanctuary his men had fortuitously discovered among the trees the sanctuary was a shallow scrape that would have been flooded by the smallest fall of rain yet was so surrounded by undergrowth that an army could have marched on the road behind and not seen the men hidden just paces away well just wait here till things calm down medlicott insisted starbuck did not like the thought of skulking in the shadows so far the two companies had avoided any northerners but that luck might not last yet medlicott would not listen to the younger mans ideas medlicott had been happy enough to accept starbucks guidance when they were exposed to the enemys fire but now that he was in a seemingly safe refuge medlicott was rediscovering the authority that colonel swynyard had conferred on him we stay here he insisted again and thats an order starbuck starbuck went back to his company he stretched himself at the edge of the shallow hollow and stared through the foliage toward the sounds of battle the branches of the wood made a dark lacework against an evening sky that was layered with redtinted bands of gunsmoke the rebel yell swelled and faded hinting at surges as regiments advanced and went to ground before advancing again volleys crashed among the trees then footsteps trampled the undergrowth close by but the leaves grew so thick that starbuck could see no one nevertheless he feared the sudden irruption of a company of nervous yankees and so he twisted around and hissed at his men to fix their bayonets if the yankees did come then starbuck would be ready for them he pulled out his own blade and slotted it into place squirrels chattered unhappily in the branches overhead and a flash of red feathers showed where a cardinal flew among the trunks behind starbuck beyond the deserted turnpike gunsmoke lay like layers of mist above a patchwork of wheat and cornfields there was no infantry visible there it was almost as if the road divided the battlefield into two discrete halves the one filled with cannon smoke and the other with struggling men truslow his rifle tipped with steel dropped beside starbuck whats wrong with medlicott frightened never was any damned good his father was the same truslow spat a viscous gob of tobacco juice into the leaf mould i once saw old john medlicott run from a pair of horse thieves who werent a day over fifteen were you one of them starbuck asked shrewdly truslow grinned but before he could answer there was a sudden panicked rush of feet and a single northern soldier burst through the bushes ahead the yankee was oblivious of the two rebel companies until he was just paces away then his eyes widened and he slid to a panicked halt his mouth dropped open he turned seemingly to shout a warning to his comrades but starbuck had climbed to his feet and now hammered the side of the northerners skull with the brass butt of his rifle just a split second before truslow pulled the mans feet out from beneath him the yankee fell like a poleaxed steer truslow and starbuck dragged him back to the company and disarmed him shut your goddamned mouth starbuck hissed at the man who had begun to stir im not the officer told you to shut the hell up you son of a whore so shut the hell up or ill rip your damned tongue out truslow growled and the northerner went utterly quiet the buckle on his leather belt showed he was a pennsylvanian a trickle of blood showed among the roots of his fair hair above his ear youll have a peach of a bruise there you bastard truslow said happily he was rifling the mans pockets and pouches he tossed the pennsylvanians rifle cartridges back among the company then found a pale brown package marked with the trademark of john andersons honeydew finecut tobacco of new york it aint virginia but someone will smoke it truslow said pushing it into his pouch leave me some the pennsylvanian pleaded i aint had a smoke in hours then you should have stayed in pennsylvania you son of a whore instead of trampling our corn youre not wanted here if you got what you deserved youd be breathing through a hole in your ribs by now truslow eased a wad of folded northern dollar bills from the mans top pocket lucky at cards are you and with women the pennsylvanian had a snubnosed and cheeky charm lie still and be quiet boy or your luck will end here truslow unlooped the boys canteen and found it still held a halfinch of water which he offered to starbuck starbuck despite his thirst refused so truslow drained the canteen himself starbuck stood to give himself a view over the surrounding brush captain medlicott hissed at him to get his head down but starbuck ignored the miller another burst of screaming announced a renewed rebel charge and this time a group of some two dozen yankees appeared just twenty paces beyond starbucks hiding place a handful of the northerners knelt and fired into the trees before retreating again two of the yankees fell as they went back driven down by rebel bullets and the rest of the men would doubtless have kept on running had not the color party come through the trees to rally them a tall whitehaired officer waved a sword toward the rebels vorwдrts vorwдrts the officer cried and the retreating men turned cheered and delivered a splintering volley toward their pursuers the two flags were bright squares of silk in the smokeriven shadows one was old glory battletorn and stained while the second was a purple flag embroidered with an eagle and a legend starbuck could not decipher vorwдrts the whitehaired officer called again are they goddamned germans truslow asked the sergeant had an irrational dislike of german immigrants blaming them for many of the rules and regulations that had begun to infest his former country americans used to be free men he often declared then the damned prussians came to organize us were pennsylvania deutsch the prisoner answered then youre godforsaken son of a bitch bastards truslow said starbuck could read the gothiclettered legend on the second flag now gott und die vereinigten staaten it said and it struck starbuck that such a flag would make a handsome trophy feuer the whitehaired officer shouted and another northern volley ripped into the attacking rebels the germans cheered sensing that their sudden resistance had taken the attackers by surprise we can take those bastards starbuck said to truslow the sergeant glanced toward captain medlicott not with that yellow bastards help then well do it without the yellow bastards help starbuck said he felt the elation of a soldier given the inestimable advantage of surprise this was a fight he could not lose and so he cocked his rifle and twisted around to look at his company were going to put one volley into those german sons of bitches and then run them off our land hard and fast boys scare the daylights out of the sumbitches ready the men grinned at him letting him know that they were good and ready starbuck grinned back there were times when he wondered if anything ever again in all eternity would ever taste as good as these moments in battle the nervousness of anticipation was utterly gone replaced by a feral excitement he glanced at the prisoner you stay here yankee i wont move an inch the prisoner promised though in truth he intended to run just as soon as he was left unattended stand starbuck shouted the heady mix of fear and excitement swirled through him he understood the temptation of following medlicotts lead and staying hidden and safe yet he also wanted to humiliate medlicott starbuck wanted to show that he was the best man on a battlefield and no one demonstrated such arrogance by cowering in the bushes take aim he called and a handful of the rallying yankees heard the shouted order and looked around fearfully but they were already too late starbucks men were on their feet rifles at their shoulders then it began to go wrong stop medlicott shouted get down i order you down the miller had panicked he was running up the shallow scrape and shouting at starbucks men even thrusting some of them back down to the ground other men crouched and all were confused fire starbuck shouted and a puny scatter of rifle flames studded the shadows down medlicott waved a hand frantically get up and fire starbucks yell was ferocious up fire the men stood again and pulled their triggers so that a stuttering mistimed volley flamed in the dusk charge starbuck shouted drawing the word out like a war cry the whitehaired officer had turned the pennsylvanians to face the unexpected threat to their flank medlicotts interference had bought the yankees a few seconds of precious time long enough for a halfcompany to form a ragged firing line at right angles to the rest of their battalion that halfcompany now faced starbucks confused assault and as he watched the yankees lift their rifles to their shoulders he sensed the disaster that was about to strike even a halfcompany volley at such short distance would tear the heart from his assault panic whipped through him he felt the temptation to break right and dive into the underbrush for cover indeed a temptation to just run away but then salvation arrived as the rebel regiment that was assaulting the pennsylvanians from the south fired an overwhelming volley the hastily formed northern line crumpled the fusillade that should have destroyed starbuck was never fired instead the two union flags faltered and fell as the overpowered yankees began to retreat sheer relief made starbucks war cry into a chilling and incoherent screech as he led his men into the clearing a bluecoated soldier swung a rifle butt at him but starbuck easily parried the wild blow and used his own rifles stock to hammer the man down to the leaf mould a rifle shot half deafened him the northerner who had fired it was retreating backward and tripped on a fallen branch robert decker jumped on the man screaming as loudly as his terrified victim truslow alone advanced without screaming instead he was watching for places where the enemy might recover the initiative he saw one of the legions new conscripts isaiah clarke being beaten to the ground by a huge pennsylvanian truslow had his bowie knife drawn he slashed it twice then kicked the dying pennsylvanian so that his body would not fall across clarke get up boy he told clarke you aint hurt bad nothing that a swallow of whiskey wont cure the pennsylvanians were running now the stripes of old glory had disappeared northward to safety but the blue eagle flag with its ornate german legend was being carried by a limping sergeant starbuck ran for the man shouting at him to surrender a yankee corporal saw starbuck and leveled a revolver that he had plucked from the body of a fallen rebel officer but the chambers were not primed and the revolver just clicked in his hand the corporal swore in german and tried to duck aside but starbucks bayonet took him in the belly then esau washbrooks rifle butt slammed onto his skull and the man went down a great tide of screaming rebels was coming from the south the whitehaired officer snatched the blue eagle flag from the limping sergeant and swung its staff like a clumsy poleax the sergeant fell and covered his head with his hands and the officer shouting defiance in german tripped over the mans prostrate body the fallen officer fumbled at his waist for a holstered revolver but starbuck was astride him now and ramming his bayonet down into the mans ribs starbuck screamed and his scream half relief and half visceral drowned the cry of the dying pennsylvanian starbuck forced the blade down until the steel would go no farther then rested on the guns stock as truslow pulled the eagle flag away from the hooked scrabbling and suddenly enfeebled hands of the dying man whose long white hair was now blood red in the days last light starbuck his instincts as primitive as any savage took the flag from truslow and shook it in the air spraying drops of blood from its fringe we did it he said to truslow we did it just us truslow said meaningfully turning to where medlicott was still hidden im going to kick the belly out of that bastard starbuck said he rolled the bloodied flag around its varnished pole coffman he shouted wanting the lieutenant to take charge of the captured flag coffman where the hell are you coffman here sir the lieutenants voice sounded weakly from behind a fallen tree oh christ starbuck blasphemed coffmans voice had been feeble like that of a man clinging to consciousness starbuck ran over the clearing jumped the tree and found the young lieutenant kneeling wideeyed and palefaced but it was not coffman who was wounded coffman was fine just shocked instead it was thaddeus bird kind colonel bird who lay death white and bleeding beside the fallen trunk oh god nate it hurts bird spoke with difficulty i came to fetch you home but they shot me took my revolver too he tried to smile wasnt even loaded nate i keep forgetting to load it not you sir not you starbuck dropped to his knees the captured flag and medlicotts cowardice both forgotten as his eyes suddenly blurred not you pecker not you because the best man in the brigade was down all across the field from the slopes of cedar mountain to the ragged corn patches west of the turnpike the rebels were advancing by the light of a sinking sun that was now a swollen ball of fading red fire suspended in a skein of shifting cannon smoke a small evening wind had at last sprung up to drift the gunsmoke above the wounded and the dead the four guns named eliza louise maud and anna suddenly found employment again as gray infantry appeared like wolf packs at the timberline the gunners fired over the heads of their own retreating infantry lobbing shells that cracked pale smoke against the darkshadowed woods bring up the limbers jump to it the major who a moment before had been tilting the pages of the batterys muchthumbed copy of reveries of a bachelor to the last rays of sunlight saw that he would have to move his guns smartly northward if the battery were not to be captured bring my horse he shouted the four guns went on firing while the teams were fetched a lieutenant fresh from west point noticed a group of mounted rebel officers at the woods margin slew left he called and his team levered with a handspike to turn elizas whiteoak trail hold there elevate her a turn load shell the powder bag was thrust down the swabbedout barrel and the gunner sergeant rammed a spike down the touchhole to pierce the canvas bag no shell left sir one of the artillerymen called from the pile of ready ammunition load solid shot load anything but for christs sake hurry the lieutenant still watched the tempting target a round of solid shot was rammed down onto the canvas bag the sergeant pushed his friction primer into the touchhole then stood aside with the lanyard in his hand gun ready he shouted elizas limber drawn by six horses galloped up behind to take the gun away fire the lieutenant shouted the sergeant whipped the lanyard toward him thus scraping the friction rod across the primerfilled tube the fire leaped down to the canvas bag the powder exploded and the fourandahalfinch iron ball screamed away across the smokelayered field the gun itself recoiled with the force of a runaway locomotive jarring backward a full ten paces to mangle the legs of the two leading horses of the limber team those lead horses went down screaming the other horses reared and kicked in terror one horse shattered a splinter bar another broke a leg on the limber and suddenly the batterys wellordered retreat had turned into a horror of screaming panicked horses a gunner tried to cut the unwounded horses free but could not get close because the injured horses were thrashing in agony shoot them for christs sake the major shouted from his saddle a rifle bullet whistled overhead the rebel yell sounded unearthly in the lurid evening light the gunner trying to disentangle the horses was kicked in the thigh he screamed and fell his leg broken then a rebel artillery shell thumped into the dirt a few paces away and the broken fragments of its casing whistled into the screaming terrorstricken mass of men and horses the other three guns had already been attached to their limbers go the major said go go go and the blackmuzzled louise maud and anna were dragged quickly away their crews hanging for dear life to the metal handles of the limbers while the drivers cracked whips over the frightened horses the gun called eliza stood smoking and abandoned as a second rebel shell landed plum in the mess of blood broken harness and struggling horses elizas lieutenant vomited at the sudden eruption of blood that gushed outward then began limping north captain hetherington led the reverend doctor starbuck past the abandoned gun and the bloody twitching mess that remained of its team the preacher had lost his top hat and was constantly turning in the saddle to watch the dark gray line of men who advanced beneath their foul banners one of the advancing rebels was wearing the bostonians top hat but it was not that insult that caused the preacher to frown but rather the conundrum of why god had allowed this latest defeat why was a righteous cause fought by gods chosen nation attended by such constant disaster surely if god favored the united states then the country must prosper yet it was palpably not prospering which could only mean that the countrys cause however good was not good enough the nations leaders might be committed to the political cause of preserving the union but they were lukewarm about emancipating the slaves and until that step was taken god would surely punish the nation the cause of abolition was thus made more explicit and urgent than ever thus reassured about the nobility of his mission the reverend starbuck his white hair streaming galloped to safety a mile behind the reverend elial starbuck at the wooded ridge where the norths attack had surged crested and then been repulsed general washington faulconer and his staff sat on their horses and surveyed the battlefield two brigades of yankee infantry were retreating across the wide wheat field their progress hastened by some newly arrived rebel cannon that fired shell and shot into the hurrying ranks only one northern battery was replying to the gunfire no point in making ourselves targets faulconer announced to his aides then trotted back into the trees to hide from the gunners swynyard alone remained in the open he was on foot ready to lead the brigades first line down the long slope other rebel troops were already a quartermile beyond the woods but the faulconer brigade had started its advance late and had yet to clear the trees swynyard saw that faulconer had disappeared into the trees so he pulled out his flask of whiskey and tipped it to his mouth he finished the flask then turned to shout at the advancing line to hurry up but just as he turned so a blow like the beat of a mighty rushing wind bellowed about him the air was sucked clean from his chest he tried to call out but he could not speak let alone cry the whiskey was suddenly sour in his throat as his legs gave way he collapsed a second before something cracked like the awesome clangor of the gates of hell behind him and then it seemed to swynyard that a bright light brighter than a dozen noonday suns was filling and suffusing and drowning his vision he lay on his back unable to move scarce able to breathe and the brilliant light flickered around his vision for a few golden seconds before blessedly his drinkbefuddled brain gave up its attempts to understand what had happened he fell into insensibility and his sword slipped from his nerveless hand the solid shot that had been fired from the doomed eliza had missed his skull by inches and cracked into a live oak growing just behind the trees trunk had been riven by the cannonball splaying outward like a letter y with its inner faces cut as clean and bright as freshminted gold the faulconer brigade advanced past the prostrate colonel no one paused to help him no one even stooped to see if the colonel lived or was dead a few men spat at him and some would have tried to rifle his pockets but the officers kept the lines moving and so the brigade marched on through the wheat field in laggard pursuit of the retreating enemy it was captain starbuck and sergeant truslow who eventually found colonel swynyard they had carried colonel bird to doctor dansons aid post where they had pretended to believe doc billys reassurance that the colonels chest wound might not prove fatal ive seen others live with worse danson said bending in his bloodstiffened apron over the pale shallowbreathing bird and peckers a tough old fowl danson insisted so he stands a good chance for a time starbuck and truslow had waited while danson probed the wound but then realizing there was no help they could offer and that waiting only made their suspense worse they had walked away to follow the footsteps of the advancing brigade thus they came upon the prostrate swynyard the sun had gone down and the whole battlefield was suffused by a pearly evening light dissipated by the smoke that was still suntinged on its upper edges carrion birds raggedwinged and stark black flapped down to the dirt where they ripped at the dead with sharphooked beaks the bastards dead truslow said looking down at swynyard or drunk starbuck said i think hes drunk someone sure gave the bastard a hell of a good kicking truslow observed pointing to a bruise that swelled yellow and brown across the side of the colonels skull are you sure he aint dead starbuck crouched bastards breathing truslow stared out across the field which was pitted with shell craters and littered with the blackhumped shapes of the dead so what are you going to do with him he asked the son of a bitch tried to have us all killed he added just in case starbuck might be moved toward a gesture of mercy starbuck straightened swynyard lay helpless his head back and his beard jutting skyward the beard was crusted with dried tobacco juice and streams of spittle the colonel was breathing slow a slight rattle sounding in his throat with every indrawn sigh starbuck picked up swynyards fallen sword and held its slender tip beneath swynyards beard as though he was about to plunge the steel into the colonels scrawny throat swynyard did not stir at the steels touch starbuck felt the temptation to thrust home then he flicked the sword blade aside hes not worth killing he said and then he rammed the sword down to skewer a pamphlet that had been blown by the small new wind to lodge against the colonels bruised skull let the bastard suffer his headache he said and the two men walked away back on the turnpike the federals made one final effort to save the lost day the retreating infantry were trading volleys with the advancing rebels who were also under the fire of one last stubborn yankee artillery battery that had stayed to cover the norths retreat now it seemed that the guns of that last battery must be captured for the gunners were almost in range of the southern rifles that threatened to kill the team horses before they could be harnessed to the cannons so to save the guns the st pennsylvania cavalry was ordered forward the men rode fresh cornfed horses in three lines fifty troopers to a line a bugle sounded the advance and the horses dipped their heads so that their manes tossed in the evening light as the first rank of horsemen trotted out past the guns the second line advanced then the third each leaving a sufficient space between themselves and the line ahead so that the troopers could swerve around a dead or dying horse sabers scraped out of scabbards and glittered in the blood red light of dying day some men left their sabers sheathed and carried revolvers instead a swallowtailed guidon blue and white was carried on a lance head in the front rank the cannon were hitched to limbers and the gunners paraphernalia was stowed in boxes or hung from the trail hooks the gunners hurried knowing that the cavalry was buying them a few precious moments in which to escape the cavalry horses were going at a fast trot now leaving tiny spurts of dust behind their hooves the three lines stretched onto the fields either side of the turnpike which here ran between open fields that had been harvested of wheat and corn curb chains and scabbard links jingled as the horsemen advanced ahead of the horsemen the confederate infantry halted there was a metallic rattle as ramrods thrust bullets hard down onto powder charges fingers stained black with gunpowder pushed brass percussion caps onto firedarkened cones wait till theyre close boys wait wait an officer shouted aim for the horses lads a sergeant called wait the officer shouted men shuffled into line and more men ran to join the rebel ranks the northern bugle called again this time raggedly and the horses were spurred into a canter the guidon was lowered so that the lance point was aimed straight at the waiting infantry who looked like a ragged grayblack line stretched across the turnpike fires burned on the far ridge their smoke rising slow to make grim palls in the darkening sky where the evening star was already a cold and brilliant point of light above the smokeclad slopes of cedar mountain a waxing moon bright and sharp as a blade rose beyond those smoky southern woods more infantry hurried toward the turnpike to add their fire to the volley that threatened the approaching horsemen the bugle called a last defiant time charge an officer shouted and the troopers screamed their challenge and slashed back their spurs to drive their big horses into a full gallop they were farm boys come from the good lands of pennsylvania their ancestors had ridden horses in the wars of old europe and in the wars to free america and now their descendants lowered their sabers so that the blade points would rip like spears into the ribcages of the rebel line the dry fields on either flank of the turnpike shuddered to the thunder of the pounding hooves charge the cavalry officer shouted again drawing out the word like a war cry into the night fire the rebel cry answered five hundred rifles slashed flame in the dusk horses screamed fell died reload ramrods rattled and scraped in hot rifle barrels unhorsed men staggered away from the carnage on the turnpike not one single trooper in the front rank had stayed in his saddle and not one horse was still on its legs the second line had been hit hard too but enough men survived to gallop on mouths open and sabers bright as they galloped toward the remnants of the first rank where horses screamed hooves thrashed and viscous blood sprayed from the twitching dying beasts a horseman of the second line leaped a bloody mound of writhing bodies only to be hit by two bullets the rebels were screaming their own challenge now as they edged forward loading and firing an unhorsed cavalryman ran back a few paces then doubled over to vomit blood horses screamed pathetically their blood trickling in black rivulets to make thick puddles on the dusty road the third line checked behind the milling remnants of the second line some cavalrymen fired revolvers over the gory barricade which was all that remained of their leading ranks but then another volley flamed and smoked from the advancing rebel ranks and the surviving horsemen pulled their reins hard around and so turned away their retreat brought jeers from their enemy more rifles cracked and more saddles were emptied a horse limped away another fell among the wheat stooks while a third raced riderless toward the west the surviving troopers galloped north in the wake of the rescued guns that were being whipped back toward culpeper court house a hundred and sixtyfour troopers had charged an army seventy returned and now at last under a warm wind reeking of blood night fell in the fields at the foot of cedar mountain the battleground lay dark beneath the banded layers of smoke that shrouded the sky high clouds had spread to hide the moon though still a great wash of eyebright stars arced across the northern portion of the sky the wounded cried and called for water some of the battles survivors searched the woods and cornfields for injured men and gave them what help they could while other men looted the dead and robbed the wounded raccoons foraged among the bodies and a skunk disturbed by a wounded horse blundering through the woods released its stench to add to the already reeking battlefield the new rebel front line was where the yankees had started the day while the yankees themselves had withdrawn northward and made a new defensive line across the road to culpeper court house messengers brought general banks news of more northern troops hurrying south from manassas in case the rebel attack presaged a fullscale thrust northward culpeper court house must be held general pope ordered though that command did not stop some panicked yankees loading wagons with plunder taken from abandoned houses and starting northward in case the feared rebel cavalry was already sweeping east and west of the town to cut off general bankss army other wagons brought the first wounded from the battlefield the towns courthouse a fine arcaded building with a belfry and steeple was turned into a hospital where the surgeons worked all night by the smoky light of candles and oil lamps they knew the morning light would bring them far more broken bodies and maybe it would bring vengeful rebels too the sound of bone saws rasped in the darkness where men gasped and sobbed and prayed general banks wrote his dispatch in a commandeered farmhouse that had been looted by northern soldiers who had taken general popes orders to live off the land as permission to plunder all southern homes banks sat on an empty powder barrel and used two more such barrels as his table he dipped his steel nib into ink and wrote that he had won a victory it was not he allowed privately the great victory that he had hoped for but it was a victory nonetheless and his words described how his small force had faced and fought and checked a mighty rebel thrust northward like a good politician he wrote with one eye on history making of his battle a tale of stubborn defiance fit to stand alongside the spartans who had defended greece against the persian hordes six miles to the south his opponent also claimed victory the battle had decided nothing but jackson had been left master of the field and so the general knelt in prayer to give thanks to almighty god for this new evidence of his mercies when the generals prayers were finished he gave curt orders for the morning the wounded must be collected the dead buried and the battleground searched for weapons that would help the confederate cause and then wrapped in a threadbare blanket jackson slept on the ground beneath the thinning smoke nervous sentries disturbed the sleep of both armies with sporadic outbreaks of rifle fire while every now and then an apprehensive northern gunner sent a shell spinning south toward the smear of fires that marked where the southerners tried to rest amidst the horrors of a field after battle campfires flickered red dying as the night wore on until at last an uneasy peace fell across the wounded fields and in that fretful dark a patrol of soldiers moved quietly the patrol was composed of four men each wearing a white cloth patch embroidered with a red crescent the patrols leader was captain moxey faulconers favorite aide while the men themselves came from captain medlicotts company the one most loyal to faulconer medlicott had gladly loaned the three men though he had not sought the permission of major paul hinton who had taken command of the legion from the wounded thaddeus bird hinton like moxey and medlicott wore the red crescent badge but he was so ambivalent about his loyalty that he had deliberately dirtied and frayed his patch until it could hardly be recognized as the faulconer crest and had hinton known of moxeys mission he would undoubtedly have stopped the nonsense before it began the four men carried rifles none of them loaded the three privates had each been promised a reward of five dollars in coins rather than bills if their mission was successful you might have to break a few heads faulconer had warned moxey but i dont want any bloodshed i dont want any courtsmartial you understand of course sir yet as it turned out the whole mission was ridiculously easy the patrol crept through the legions lines well inside the ring of sentries whose job was to look outward not inward moxey led the way between sleeping bodies skirting the dying fires going to where starbucks company h slept beneath the stars coming close and wary lest one of the companys dogs should wake and start barking moxey held up his hand the problem that had made this mission necessary had begun earlier in the evening when the men of faulconers brigade were making what supper they could from the scraps of food they had either plundered or discovered in their knapsacks captain pryor general washington faulconers new aide had come to starbuck and requested that the captured pennsylvanian flag be handed over why starbuck had asked the general wants it pryor answered innocently thomas pryor was far too new to the brigade to comprehend the full enmity that existed between starbuck and faulconer im to take it to him you mean faulconer wants to claim that he captured it starbuck demanded pryor colored at such an ignoble accusation im sure the general would do no such thing he said starbuck laughed at the aides naпvetй go and tell general faulconer with my compliments that he can come here and ask for the flag himself pryor had wanted to insist but he found nathaniel starbuck a somewhat daunting figure even a frightening figure and so he had carried the unhelpful message back to the general who surprisingly showed no indignation at starbucks insolence pryor ascribed the generals reaction to magnanimity but in truth washington faulconer was furious and merely hiding that fury he wanted the flag and even felt entitled to the flag for had it not been captured by men under his command he thus considered the flag to be his property and he planned to hang the trophy in the hallway of his house just outside faulconer court house which was why at quarter past three in the morning captain moxey and three men were poised just outside the area where starbucks men slept there one of moxeys men whispered and pointed to where lieutenant coffman lay curled under a blanket are you sure hes got it moxey whispered back certain stay here moxey said then tiptoed across the dry grass until he reached the sleeping lieutenant and could see the rolledup flag lying half concealed beneath coffmans blanket moxey stooped and put a hand on coffmans throat the grip woke the boy one word moxey hissed and ill cut your damned throat coffman started up but was thrust hard down by moxeys left hand moxey seized the flag in his other hand and started to edge it free keep quiet he hissed at coffman or ill have your sisters given the pox moxey coffman had grown up in the same town as moxey is that you shut up boy moxey said the flag was at last free and he backed away half regretting his failure to give a sleeping starbuck a beating but also relieved that he would not have to risk waking the northerner starbuck had a belligerent reputation just like his company which was considered the most reckless in the legion but the men of company h had all slept through moxeys raid lets go moxey told his own men and so they slipped safely away the trophy captured coffman shivered in the dark he wondered if he should wake starbuck or truslow but he was scared he did not understand why moxey should need to steal the flag and he could not bear the thought of having let starbuck down it had been captain starbuck who had shamed general washington faulconer into paying his salary and coffman was terrified that starbuck would now be angry with him and so he just lay motionless and frightened as he listened to the faroff whimpers and cries that came from the taperlit tents where the tired doctors sawed at limbs and prised misshapen bullets from bruised and bloodied flesh thaddeus bird was in one of doctor dansons tents still breathing but with a face as pale as the canvas under which he slept the plight of the men still on the battlefield was far worse they drifted in and out of their painful sleep sometimes waking to the voices of other men calling feebly for help or to the sound of wounded horses spending a long night dying the nights small wind blew north to where the frightened yankees waited for another rebel attack every now and then a nervous artilleryman fired a shell from the yankee lines and the round would thump into the trampled corn and explode clods of earth would patter down and a small thick cloud of bitter smoke would drift north as a chorus of frightened voices momentarily sounded loud before fading again here and there a lantern showed where men looked for friends or tried to rescue the wounded but there were too many men lying in blood and not enough men to help and so the abandoned men suffered and died in the small wicked hours colonel griffin swynyard neither died nor called for help instead the colonel lay sleeping and in the dawn when the suns first rays lanced over the crest of cedar mountain to gild the field where the dead lay rotting and the wounded lay whimpering he opened his eyes to brightness thirty miles north where train after train steamed into manassas junction to fill the night with the clash of cars the hiss of valves and the stench of smoke adam faulconer watched the horses purchased with the reverend elial starbucks money come down from the boxcars the beasts were frightened by the noises and the pungent smells of this strange place and so they pricked their ears rolled their eyes white and whinnied pitifully as they were driven between two lines of men into a makeshift corral formed from empty army wagons captain billy blythe who had purchased the horses and shipped them to manassas sat longlegged on a wagon drivers high box and watched to see how adam liked his animals real special horses faulconer blythe called picked em myself i know they dont look much but there aint nothing wrong that a few days in a feedlot wont set straight blythe lit a cigar and waited for adams judgment adam hardly dared say a word in case that word provoked a fight with blythe the horses were dreadful beasts adam had seen better animals penned at slaughter yards tom huxtable was adams troop sergeant he came from louisiana but had chosen to fight for the north rather than strain the loyalty of his new york wife huxtable spat in derision of the newly arrived horses these aint horses sir he said to adam hell these aint no horses brokendown mules is all they is he spat again swaybacked spavined and wormy i reckon blythe just pocketed half the money you say something tom huxtable a grinning billy blythe called from his perch for answer sergeant huxtable just spat again adam curbed his own anger as he inspected the twenty frightened horses and tried to find some redeeming feature among them but in the lanterns meager light the animals did indeed look a sorry bunch they had capped hocks and sloping pasterns swaybacks and most troubling of all too many running noses a horse with bad lungs was a horse that needed to be butchered yet these were the horses being given to the men under adams command adam cursed himself for not buying the horses himself but major galloway had insisted that blythes experience in horse dealing was one of the regiments valuable assets so what do you think faulconer blythe asked mockingly what did you pay for them blythe waved the cigar insouciantly i paid plenty boy just plenty then you were cheated adam could not hide his bitterness there just aint that many horses available boy blythe deliberately taunted adam with the word boy in hopes of provoking a show of temper blythe had been content to be galloways secondincommand and saw no need for the major to have fetched a third officer into the regiment the armys already bought all the decent horses so we latecomers have to make do with the leavings are you telling me you cant manage with those there horses i reckon this gray has distemper corporal kemp said harlan kemp like adam was a virginian who could not shake his loyalty to the united states he and his whole family had abandoned their farm to come north better shoot the beast then blythe said happily not with one of your guns adam snapped back not if theyre as good as your horses blythe laughed pleased at having goaded the display of temper out of adam i got you some right proper guns faulconer colt repeaters brandnew still in their connecticut packing cases the colt repeater was little more than a revolver elongated into a longarm but its revolving cylinder gave a man the chance to fire six shots in the same time an enemy rifleman needed to fire just one the weapon was not famed for its accuracy but major galloway reckoned a small group of horsemen needed volume of fire rather than accuracy and claimed that forty horsemen firing six shots were worth over two hundred men with singleshot rifles it aint a reliable gun sergeant huxtable murmured to adam ive seen the whole cylinder explode and take off a mans hand and its too long in the barrel harlan kemp added real hard to carry on horseback you spoke harlan kemp blythe challenged im saying the colt aint a horse soldiers weapon kemp responded we should have carbines blythe chuckled youre lucky to have any guns at all so far as guns and horses go were on the hindmost teat so youll just have to clamp down and suck hard huxtable ignored blythes crudity what do you reckon sir he asked adam these horses cant be ridden they aint nothing but worm meat adam did not answer and tom huxtable shook his head major galloway wont let us ride on nags like these sir i guess not adam said tonight major galloway was fetching orders from general pope and those orders were supposed to initiate the first offensive patrols of galloways horse but adam knew he could do nothing on these brokenbacked animals so what will we do harlan kemp asked and the other men of adams troop gathered round to hear their captains answer adam looked at the sorry shivering diseased horses their ribs showed and their pelts were mangy for a moment he felt a temptation to give way to despair and he wondered why every human endeavor had to be soured by jealousy and spite but then he glanced up into billy blythes grinning face and adams incipient despair was overtaken by a surge of resolution well exchange the horses adam told his anxious men well take these nags south and well exchange them for the best horses in virginia well change them for horses swift as the wind and strong as the hills he laughed as he saw the incomprehension on blythes face adam would not be beaten for he knew just where to find those horses the best horses and once he had found his horses he would sow havoc among his enemies billy blythe or no adam faulconer would fight saturday morning the day after battle again dawned hot and humid leaden clouds covered the sky and added to the airs oppression which was made even fouler by a miasmic smell that clung to the folds of the battlefield like the morning mist at first light when the troops were stirring reluctantly from their makeshift beds major hinton sought out starbuck im sorry about last night nate hinton said starbuck offered the legions new commanding officer a curt and dismissive judgment of washington faulconers raid to snatch the captured flag the bostonian was stripped to the waist and had his chin and cheeks lathered with shaving soap plundered from a captured artillery limber starbuck stropped his razor on his belt leaned close to his scrap of mirror then stroked the long blade down his cheek so what will you do hinton asked plainly nervous that starbuck would be provoked into some rash act the bastard can keep the rag starbuck said he had not really known what to do with the captured standard he had thought that perhaps he might give it to thaddeus bird or else send it to sally truslow in richmond what i really wanted was the stars and stripes he confessed to hinton and that eagle flag was only ever secondbest so i reckon that son of a bitch faulconer can keep it it was a stupid thing for moxey to do all the same hinton said unable to conceal his relief that starbuck did not intend to inflate the nights stupidity into an excuse for revenge he watched as starbuck squinted into a broken fragment of shaving mirror why dont you grow a beard he asked because everyone else does starbuck said although in truth it was because a girl had once told him he looked better cleanshaven he scraped at his upper lip im going to murder goddamn medlicott no youre not slowly so it hurts major hinton sighed he panicked nate it can happen to anyone next time it might be me son of a bitch damn nearly had me killed by panicking major hinton picked up the plundered jar of roussels shaving cream fidgeted with its lid then watched starbuck clean the razor blade for my sake he finally pleaded will you just forget about it the boys are unhappy enough because of pecker and they dont need their captains fighting among themselves please nate for me starbuck mopped his face clean on a strip of sacking give me a cigar paul and ill forget that baldheaded lilylivered gutless shadbelly bastard even exists hinton surrendered the cigar peckers doing well he said his tone brightening as he changed the subject or as well as can be expected doc billy even reckons he might survive a wagon ride to the rail depot hinton was deeply worried about replacing the popular colonel even though he was a popular enough officer himself he was an easygoing heavyset man who had been a farmer by trade a churchman by conviction and a soldier by accident of history hinton had hoped to live out his years in the easy rich countryside of faulconer county enjoying his family his acres and his foxhunting but the war had threatened virginia and so paul hinton had shouldered his weapons out of patriotic duty yet he did not much enjoy soldiering and reckoned his main duty was to bring safely home as many of the faulconer legion as he possibly could and the men in the legion recognized that ambition and liked hinton for it were to stay where we are today hinton now told starbuck ive got to detach a company to collect small arms off the battlefield and another to bring in the wounded and talking of the wounded he added after a seconds hesitation did you see swynyard yesterday hes missing starbuck also hesitated then told the truth truslow and i saw him last night he gestured with the cigar toward the woods where his company had fought against the pennsylvanians he was lying just this side of the trees truslow and i didnt reckon there was anything to be done for him so we just left him hinton was shrewd enough to guess that starbuck had abandoned swynyard to die ill send someone to look for him he said he ought to be given a burial why starbuck demanded belligerently to cheer the brigade up of course hinton said then blushed for having uttered such a thing he turned to look at the great smear of smoke that rose from the northern cooking fires beyond the woods keep a good eye on the yankees nate they aint beaten yet but the yankees made little hostile movement that morning their pickets probed forward but stopped obediently when the rebel outposts opened fire and so the two armies settled into an uneasy proximity then it began to rain slowly at first but with an increasing vehemence after midday starbucks company made shelters at the edge of the woods with frameworks of branches covered in sod then they lay under cover and just watched the gray rainlashed landscape in midafternoon when the rain eased to a drizzle corporal waggoner sought hintons permission for a prayer meeting there had been no chance for such a service since the battles ending and many soldiers in the legion wanted to give thanks hinton gladly gave his permission and fifty or more legionnaires gathered beneath some gunbattered cedars other men from the brigade soon joined them so that by the time the drizzle stopped there were almost a hundred men sitting beneath the trees and listening as corporal waggoner read from the book of job waggoners twin brother had died in the battles on the far side of richmond and ever since that death peter waggoner had become more and more fatalist starbuck was not sure that waggoners gloomy piety was good for the legions morale but many of the men seemed to like the corporals spontaneous sessions of prayer and bible study starbuck did not join the circle but rested nearby watching northward to where the yankee defense line showed between the distant woodlands as a newly dug strip of earthworks broken by hastily erected cannon emplacements starbuck would have been hard put to admit it but the familiar sounds of prayer and bible reading were oddly comforting that comfort was broken by a blasphemous oath from sergeant truslow christ almighty the sergeant swore what is it starbuck asked he had been half dozing but now sat up fully awake then he saw what had provoked truslow to blasphemy oh jesus he said and spat for colonel swynyard was not dead indeed the colonel hardly appeared to be wounded his face was bruised but the bruise was covered and shadowed by a widebrimmed hat that swynyard must have plucked from among the battlefield litter and now the colonel was walking through the brigades lines with his familiar wolfish smile hes drunk truslow said we should have shot the bastard yesterday peter waggoners voice faltered as the colonel walked up to the makeshift prayer meeting swynyard stopped at the edge of the meeting saying nothing just staring at the men with their open bibles and bare heads and every single man seemed cowed by the baleful eyes the colonel had always been a mocker of these homespun devotions though until now he had kept his scorn at a distance now his malevolence killed the prayerful atmosphere stone dead waggoner made one or two brave efforts to keep reading but then stopped altogether go on swynyard said in his hoarse voice waggoner closed his bible instead sergeant phillips who was one of major haxalls shrinking arkansas battalion stood to head off any trouble maybe youd like to join us at prayer colonel the sergeant suggested nervously the tic in swynyards cheek twitched as he considered his answer sergeant phillips licked his lips while others of the men closed their eyes in silent prayer then to the amazement of everyone who watched colonel swynyard pulled off his hat and nodded to phillips i would like that sergeant i would indeed sergeant phillips was so taken aback by the colonels agreement that he said nothing a murmur went through the bible study group but no one spoke aloud swynyard the bruise on his face visible now was embarrassed by the silence if youll have me that is he added in an unnaturally humble voice anyone is welcome sergeant phillips managed to say one or two of the officers in the group muttered their agreement but no one looked happy at welcoming swynyard everyone in the prayer group believed the colonel was playing a subtle game of mockery but they did not understand his game nor did anyone know how to stop it and so they offered him a reluctant welcome instead maybe youll let me say a word or two swynyard suggested to phillips who seemed to have assumed leadership of the prayer meeting phillips nodded and the colonel fidgeted with the hat in his hands as he looked around the frightened gathering the colonel tried to speak but the words would not come he cleared his throat took a deep breath and tried again i have seen the light he explained another murmur went through the circle of seated men amen phillips said swynyard twisted the hat in his nervous hands i have been a great sinner sergeant he said then stopped he still wore the same hated smile but some of the men nearer to swynyard could sense that it was now a smile of embarrassment rather than sarcasm the same men could even see tears in the colonels eyes drunk as a bitch on the fourth of july truslow said in a tone of wonder im not sure starbuck said i think he might be sober then hes lost his damn wits truslow opined sergeant phillips was more generous we have all been sinners colonel the sergeant said and fallen short of the glory of god i more than most swynyard it seemed was determined to make a public confession of his sins and of his rediscovered faith he was blinking back tears and fidgeting with the hat so frenetically that it fell from his hands he let it lie i was raised a christian by my dear mother he said and i received the lord into my heart at a camp meeting when i was a youth but i have been a sinner ever since a great sinner weve all sinned sergeant phillips averred again but yesterday swynyard said i came to my senses i was near killed and i felt the very wings of the angel of death beat about me i could smell the sulfur of the bottomless pit and i could feel the heat of its flames and i knew as i lay on the field that i deserved nothing less than that terrible punishment he paused almost overcome by the memory but then praise him i was pulled back from the pit and drawn into the light a chorus of amens and hallelujahs sounded among the circle of men they were all sincere christians and though they might have hated this man with an intense hatred the more honest among them had also prayed for the colonels soul and now that their prayers were being answered they were willing to give thanks to god for his mercies to a sinner swynyard had tears on his cheeks now i also know sergeant that in the past i have been unfair in my dealings with many men here to those men i offer my regrets and seek their forgiveness the apology was handsomely spoken and the men in the group took it just as handsomely then swynyard turned away from the circle and looked among the shelters for starbuck i owe another man an even greater apology the colonel said oh jesus starbuck swore and wriggled back into the shadow of his shelter bastards touched in the head truslow said hell be foaming at the mouth next and pissing himself well have to take him away and put him out of his misery we should have shot the bastard when we had the chance starbuck said then fell silent because swynyard had left the bible circle and was walking toward his shelter captain starbuck swynyard said starbuck looked up into his enemys face i can hear you colonel starbuck said flatly he could see now that the colonel had made an attempt to improve his appearance his beard was washed his hair combed and his uniform brushed the tic in his cheek still quivered and his hands shook but he was plainly making a great effort to hold himself straight and steady can i talk with you starbuck the colonel asked then after a moments silence please are you drunk starbuck asked brutally swynyard offered his rotting yellowtoothed smile only on gods grace starbuck only on his divine grace and with his help i shall never touch ardent spirits again truslow spat to show his disbelief swynyard ignored the insult gesturing instead to indicate that he would like to take a walk with starbuck starbuck climbed reluctantly out of his turf shelter shouldered his rifle and followed the colonel starbuck was wearing new boots that he had taken from a dead pennsylvanian the boots were new and stiff but starbuck was convinced they would wear in well enough after a day or two now though he felt the makings of a blister as he walked selfconsciously beside swynyard news of the colonels conversion had spread through the brigade and men were drifting toward the picket line to see the proof for themselves some evidently believed that the colonels religious experience was just another inebriated escapade and they grinned in anticipation of a display of drunken idiocy but swynyard seemed oblivious to the attention he was receiving you know why i sent your company forward yesterday he asked starbuck uriah the hittite starbuck said shortly swynyard thought for a second then the story of david and bathsheba came back from his dusty memories of childhood sunday schools yes he said and i intended for you to be killed i am sorry truly starbuck wondered how long swynyards manifestation of honesty would last and reckoned that it would be only until the colonels thirst overcame his piety but he kept that skepticism to himself i guess you were just obeying someone elses orders he said instead it was still a sinful action swynyard said very earnestly thus obliquely confirming that it had indeed been washington faulconer who had ordered starbucks company into the place of danger and i ask your forgiveness swynyard concluded his confession by holding out his hand starbuck excruciated with embarrassment shook the offered hand say no more about it colonel he said youre a good soldier starbuck a good soldier and i havent made life easy for you not for anyone really swynyard made the admission in a gruff voice the colonel had been weeping when he gave his halting testimony at the prayer meeting but now he seemed in a more rueful mood he turned and gazed north to where groups of yankees could be seen in the far fields beyond the nearer stands of trees no man on either side seemed inclined to belligerence this day even the sharpshooters who delighted to kill at long range were keeping their rifle barrels cold do you have a bible swynyard asked starbuck suddenly sure i do starbuck felt in his breast pocket where he kept the small bible that his brother had sent him james had intended the bible to spark starbuck into a repentance like the one that was transforming swynyard but starbuck had kept the scriptures out of habit rather than need you want it he asked offering the book to the colonel i shall find another swynyard said i just wanted to be certain you have a bible because im sure youre going to need one swynyard smiled at the suspicious look on starbucks face the colonel doubtless intended the smile to be friendly but the resulting foultoothed leer uncomfortably recalled the colonels usual malevolence i wish i could describe what happened to me last night and this morning he now told starbuck it was as though i was struck by a great light there was no pain theres still no pain he touched the livid bruise on his right temple i remember lying on the earth and hearing voices i couldnt move couldnt speak the voices were debating my death and i knew i had come to the judgment seat and i felt a fear a most terrible fear that i was being consigned to hell i wanted to weep starbuck and in my terror i called out to the lord i remembered my mothers teaching my childhood lessons and i called on the lord and he heard me starbuck had heard too many testimonies of repentant sinners to be either moved or even convinced by the colonels change of heart doubtless swynyard had received a shock and doubtless he intended to reform his life but starbuck was equally convinced that swynyards conversion would prove soluble in alcohol before the sun went down i wish you well he muttered grudgingly no no you dont understand swynyard spoke with some of his old savage force and laid his maimed left hand on starbucks elbow to prevent the younger man from turning away when i recovered my senses starbuck i found my sword stuck into the turf beside my head and there was a message impaled on the sword this message the colonel took from his pocket a crumpled and torn pamphlet which he pushed into starbucks hand starbuck smoothed the tract to see that it was called freeing the oppressed and had been printed in anne street boston the cover showed a picture of a halfnaked black man springing free from broken manacles toward a cross that was infused with a heavenly light the shattered manacles were attached to great iron weights labeled slavocracy ignorance and wickedness and beneath those iron weights was written the name of the pamphlets author the reverend doctor elial starbuck starbuck felt his usual tremor of distaste at any reminder of his fathers existence then handed the tract back to the colonel so what was your message he asked sourly that slavery is a sin against god that americas blacks have to be returned to africa is that what youre going to do with your pair set them free and never starbuck reflected had two slaves more deserved freedom swynyard shook his head to show that starbuck was still misunderstanding him i dont know what to believe about slavery dear god starbuck but everything in my life has to be changed cant you understand that slavery too but that wasnt the reason god left the tract beside me last night dont you see he left it there to give me a task no starbuck said i dont see my dear starbuck swynyard said very earnestly i have been brought back from the path of sin at the very last moment at that very instant when i was poised on the edge of hells fire i was saved the road to hell is a terrible path starbuck yet at its beginning the journey was enjoyable do you understand now what im saying no starbuck said who feared that he understood exactly what the colonel was saying i think you do swynyard said fervently because i think that you are on the first easy steps of that downward path i look at you starbuck and i see myself thirty years ago which is why god sent me a pamphlet with your name on it its a sign telling me to save you from sin and from the agonies of eternal punishment im going to do that starbuck instead of killing you as faulconer wanted i am going to bring you to eternal life starbuck paused to light a cigar he had plundered from the whitehaired pennsylvanian officer who had tried so hard to protect his flags then he sighed as he blew smoke past swynyards bruised face you know colonel i think i really preferred you as a sinner swynyard grimaced how long have i known you starbuck shrugged six months and in all that time captain starbuck have you ever called me sir starbuck looked into the colonels eyes no and i dont intend to either swynyard smiled you will starbuck you will were going to be friends you and i and i shall draw you back from the paths of sin starbuck blew another plume of smoke into the damp wind i never did understand colonel just why some son of a bitch can have a lifetime of sin and then the moment he gets scared turn around and try to stop other folks from enjoying themselves are you telling me the path of righteousness is not enjoyable im telling you ive got to get back to my company starbuck said ill see you colonel he touched his hat with a deliberate air of insolence then walked back to his men so sergeant truslow greeted starbuck the inflection of the word inviting news of the colonel you were right starbuck said hes gibbering mad so whats changed hes got drunk on god starbuck said thats whats changed he was trying to sound dismissive of swynyard but a part of him was sensing the same fires of hell that had brought the colonel to god but ill give him till sundown he went on then hell be tight on whiskey instead whiskey works faster than god truslow said but he heard something wistful in his captains voice and so he thrust a pewter flask at him drink some of this the sergeant ordered what is it the best spillskull five cents a quart tom canby made it two weeks back starbuck took the flask dont you know its against army regulations to drink homemade whiskey its probably against army regulations to go caterwauling with the wives of serving officers truslow said but that aint ever stopped you yet too true sergeant too true starbuck said he drank and the fierce liquor momentarily doused the fear of hellfire and then beneath a lowering sky he slept the federal governments bureaucrats might have been reluctant to fund major galloways horse but general pope immediately saw the value of having southern horsemen scouting behind southern lines and so he gave the major such a slew of tasks that a cavalry force ten times larger would have been hardpressed to fulfill them inside a month let alone the one week that general pope offered galloway the chief task was to determine whether general robert lee was moving his troops from richmond the northern headquarters in washington had ordered lees opponent mcclellan to withdraw his army from its camps close to the rebel capital and pope feared that lee hearing of that order might already be marching north to reinforce jackson he also feared that the rebels could be building up troops in the shenandoah valley and had asked galloway to make a reconnaissance across the blue ridge mountains and as if those two tasks were not sufficient pope also wanted to know more about jacksons dispositions and so galloway found himself under pressure to send horsemen south east and west he compromised as best he could taking his own troop south toward richmond while billy blythe was ordered to cross the blue ridge mountains and sniff out the rebel dispositions in the valley of the shenandoah adam meanwhile needed to replace the horses blythe had wished on him major galloway tried to reassure adam that blythe had meant no harm in buying such spavined hacks im sure he did his best the major said trying to knit the unity of his squadron im sure he did too adam agreed and thats what worries me but adam at least knew where his troop could acquire more horses and galloway had given adam permission to make his raid on condition that on adams way back he reconnoitred the western flank of jacksons army adam left to perform both tasks three days after the faroff sound of the battle at cedar mountain had bruised the summers heavy air two miles beyond the manassas farmhouse that was galloways headquarters adam found billy blythes troop waiting thought wed ride with you faulconer blythe said seeing as how you and i are going in the same direction are we adam asked coldly hell why not blythe said the shenandoah valleys that way adam said pointing west while were going south well now blythe said with his lazy smile where i come from a gentleman doesnt go around teaching other gentlemen how to suck a tit ill choose my own route to the valley if thats all right with you adam had little choice but to accept blythes company sergeant huxtable whispered his suspicion that blythe merely wanted to follow adam and take whatever horses adam found for his own profit but adam could hardly stop his fellow cavalry officer from riding in convoy nor on his dreadful horses could adam outrun blythe and so for two days the forty cavalrymen crept slowly southward blythe showed no sense of urgency and no desire to turn toward one of the high passes that led through the blue ridge mountains he ignored the chester gap then thorntons gap and finally powells gap hinting all the while that he knew of a better route across the mountains further south youre a fool if you use rockfish gap adam said i know for a fact the rebels will guard that pass blythe smiled maybe i wont use any gap at all you wont get horses over the mountains otherwise maybe i dont need to cross the mountains youd disobey galloways orders adam asked blythe frowned as though he was disappointed in adams obtuseness i reckon our first duty faulconer is to look after our men specially when you reckon that the southern army aint going to take too kindly to southern boys riding in yankee blue so it aint my aim to take any real bad risks thats why abe lincolns got all those boys from massachusetts and pennsylvania if anyones going to beat ten types of hell out of the confederates itll be them not us the important thing for us to do faulconer is just survive the war intact blythe paused in this long peroration to light a cigar ahead of the cavalrymen was a gentle valley crossed by snake fences and with a prosperouslooking farm at the southern end what joe galloway ordered me to do faulconer blythe went on is discover how many rebels are skulking in the shenandoah valley and i reckon i can do that well enough without crossing any damned mountain i can do it by stopping a train coming out of the rockfish gap and questioning the passengers aint that right suppose the passengers lie adam asked hell there aint a woman alive whod tell me lies blythe said with a smile he chuckled then turned in his saddle seth billy sergeant seth kelley answered reckon we should make sure no rebel vermin are hanging around that farmhouse take a couple of men go look seth kelley shouted at two marylanders to follow him then led them south through the trees that bordered the valley reckon well just wait here blythe said to the other men make yourselves at home now you say our most important duty is to survive the war adam asked blythe when the troopers had made themselves comfortable in the shade of the broadleaved trees because i reckon that the wars ending is when our proper work begins faulconer blythe said happily i even reckon that surviving the war is our christian duty the norths going to win thats plain as the nose on a pelicans face hell the norths got the men the guns the ships the factories the railroads and the money while all the souths got is a heap of cotton a pile of rice a stack of tobacco and more damn lazy niggers than half africa the norths got a whole heap of stuff and the south aint got a besotted hope so sooner or later faulconer were going to have an asswhipped south and a mighty pleased north and when that day comes we want to make sure that we loyal southerners get our just rewards we are going to be the good southerners faulconer and well be the ones who take over down south we are going to be hogs in clover rolling in milk and honey and getting the pick of the girls and making dollars like a dog makes spit blythe turned to stare at the farm now you dont want to risk all that by getting a bullet in your belly do you adam heard the chuckles of those men who agreed with blythe others looked grim and adam decided he would speak for those idealists weve got a job to do thats what we volunteered for blythe nodded as though adam had made a wonderfully cogent point hell now faulconer no one agrees with you more than me hell if i could reconnoitre clean down to the rappahannock then no one would be as happy as billy blythe hell id reconnoitre down to the pee dee if i could down as far as the swanee hell id reconnoitre to the last goldarned river on earth for my country so i would but i cant do it just plumb cant do it faulconer and you know why and here blythe laid a confiding hand on adams elbow and leaned so close that his cigar smell wreathed adams head we cant do nothing faulconer and thats the plain sad truth of it we cant even ride to the brothel and back on account of our horses being razorbacked pieces of fourlegged hogshit whats the first duty of a cavalryman to look after his horse billy one of his men answered aint that gods blessed truth blythe responded so i reckon that for the horses sake we just has to go gentle and keep ourselves unpunctured for the rest of the war hell now what in tarnation was that the question was blythes response to a pair of gunshots that had sounded from somewhere near the farmhouse for a man who had just preached a gospel of staying well clear of trouble he seemed remarkably untroubled by the gunfire reckon wed best ride to see if old seths in one piece boys he called and the men of his troop slowly pulled themselves into their saddles and loosened the colt repeating rifles in their holsters reckon your troop should stay and keep watch blythe told adam i aint saying we expects any trouble but you can never tell these woods are full of bushwhackers and every man jack of them is as mean as a snake and twice as treacherous so you watch out for partisans while the rest of us make certain old seth aint gone to meet his maker adam watched from the trees as blythe took his troop down to the farmhouse which was typical of so many homesteads in the virginia piedmont adam had often dreamed of settling in just such a farm miles away from his fathers pretensions and wealth the twostory house was weatherboarded with whitepainted planks and handsomely surrounded by a deep veranda which in turn was circled by a straggling but colorful flower garden a wide vegetable garden stretched between the house and the largest of a pair of barns that formed two sides of a yard that was completed by a rail fence orchards ran downhill from the house to where a stream glinted in the distance the sight of the homestead gave adam a pang of remorse and nostalgia it seemed wicked that war should inflict itself on such a place at the farm itself sergeant seth kelley waited on the veranda for captain blythe kelley was a long thin man with a narrow black beard and dark eyes who now lounged in a wicker chair with his spurred boots propped on the verandas rail and a cigar in his mouth his two men were leaning against the posts that flanked the short flight of veranda steps kelley took the cigar from his mouth as captain blythe dismounted on the parched lawn we was fired on billy kelley said with a grin two shots that came from the top floor came damn close to killing me so they did blythe shook his head and tutted but youre all right seth you aint wounded now they missed billy they missed but the rascals had this piece of bunting flying from the house so they did kelley held up a small rebel flag bad business seth bad business blythe said grinning as broadly as his sergeant sure is billy bout as bad as it can be kelley put the cigar back in his mouth blythe led his horse across the flower bed and tied its reins to a rail of the porch his men dismounted as blythe climbed the veranda steps and used kelleys cigar to light one of his own any folks inside blythe asked the sergeant two women and a passel of brats sergeant kelley said blythe pushed into the house the hall floor was made of dark wood on which lay a pair of hooked rugs a long case clock stood by the staircase its face proclaiming that it had been made in baltimore there was a pair of antlers serving as a coatrack a portrait of george washington another of andrew jackson and a pokerwork plaque proclaiming that god was the unseen listener to every conversation in this house blythe gave the clock an appreciative pat as seth kelley and two men followed him through the hall and into the kitchen where three children clung to the skirts of two women one woman was whitehaired the other young and defiant well now well blythe said pausing in the kitchen doorway what do we have here you aint got no business here the younger woman said she was in her thirties and evidently the mother of the three small children she was carrying a heavy cleaver which she hefted nervously as blythe walked into the kitchen the business we got here maam is the business of the united states of america billy blythe said happily he strolled past an ancient dresser and picked an apple from a china bowl he bit a chunk from the apple then smiled at the younger woman real sweet maam just like yourself the woman was darkhaired with good features and challenging eyes i like a woman with spirit blythe said aint that so seth you always did have a right taste for such women billy kelley leaned his lanky form against the kitchen doorpost you leave us alone the older woman said scenting trouble nothing in this world id rather do maam blythe said he took another bite from the apple two of the children had started to cry prompting blythe to slam the remnants of the apple hard onto the scrubbed kitchen table scraps of the shattered fruit skittered across the kitchen i would be obliged if you kept your sniveling infants silent maam blythe snapped i cannot abide a sniveling child no sir sniveling children should be whipped whipped the last word was bellowed so loud that both children stopped crying in sheer fright blythe smiled at their mother displaying scraps of apple between his teeth so wheres the man of the house maam he aint here the younger woman said defiantly is that because hes carrying arms against his lawful government blythe asked in a teasing voice he aint here the woman said again and then after a pause theres only us women and children here you aint got no quarrel with women and children my quarrels are my business blythe said and my business is to discover just why one of you two ladies fired a couple of shots at my nice sergeant here no one fired at him the older woman said scornfully he fired his own revolver i saw him do it blythe shook his head disbelievingly thats not what mr kelley says maam and he wouldnt tell me a lie hell hes a sergeant in the army of the united states of america are you telling me that a sergeant of the army of the united states of america would tell a lie blythe asked the question with feigned horror are you really trying to suggest such a thing no one fired the younger woman insisted the children were almost buried in her skirts blythe took a step closer to the woman who raised the cleaver threateningly you use that maam blythe said equably and youll be hanged for murder whats your name my names none of your business so ill tell you what is my business maam blythe said and he reached out for the cleaver and plucked it from the womans unresisting grasp he raised it then slashed it hard down to bury its blade tip in the table he smiled at the younger woman then blew cigar smoke toward the bunches of herbs hanging from a beam my business maam he said is with general order number five issued by major general john pope of the united states army which general order gives me the legal right and solemn duty to feed and equip my men with any food or goods we find in this house that might be necessary to our wellbeing that is an order given me by the general in command of my army and like a good christian soldier maam i am dutybound to obey it blythe turned and jabbed a finger toward sergeant kelley start searching seth outhouses upstairs cellars barns give the place a good shaking now you stay here corporal he added to one of the other men who had come into the kitchen we aint got nothing the old woman protested well be the judge of that maam blythe said start searching seth do it thorough now you damned thieves the younger woman said on the contrary maam on the contrary blythe smiled at her then sat at the head of the kitchen table and took a preprinted form from a leather pouch at his belt he found a pencil stub in a pocket the pencil was blunt but he tried its lead on the tabletop and was satisfied with the mark it made no maam he went on we aint thieves we are just trying to put gods own country back into one piece and we need your help to do it but it aint thieving maam because our uncle sam is a kind uncle a good uncle and hell pay you folks real well for everything you give us today he smoothed out the form licked the pencil and looked up expectantly at the younger woman your name honey i aint telling you blythe looked at the older woman cant pay the family without a name grandma so tell us your name dont tell him mother the younger woman cried the older woman hesitated then decided that giving the familys name would not cause much harm rothwell she said reluctantly a mighty fine name blythe said as he wrote it on the form i knew a family of rothwells down home in blytheville fine baptists they were and fine neighbors too now maam you happen to know what todays date is the house echoed with mens laughter and the heavy sound of boots thumping up the staircase then a burst of cheering erupted as some treasure was discovered in one of the front rooms more feet clattered on the stairs the young woman looked at the ceiling and a frown of distress crossed her face todays date maam blythe insisted the older woman thought for a second yesterday was the lords day she said so today must be the eleventh my how this summer is just flying by august the eleventh already blythe wrote the date as he spoke in the year of our lord eighteen hundred and sixtytwo this danged pencil is scratchy as hell he finished the date then leaned back in the chair sweat was pouring down his plump face and staining the collar of his uniform coat well now ladies this here piece of paper confirms that me and my men are about to commandeer just about any goldarned thing we take a fancy to in this property anything at all and when weve got it youre going to tell me the value of all that food and all those chattels and im going to write that value down on this piece of paper and then im going to sign it with my godgiven name and what youre going to do ladies is keep ahold of this piece of paper like it was the sacred word in the good lords own handwriting and at the end of the war when the rebels are well beaten and kind uncle sam is welcoming you all back into the bosom of his family youre going to present this piece of paper to the government and the government in its mercy and goodness is going to give you all the money every red cent theres just one small thing you ought to know first though he paused to draw on his cigar then smiled at the frightened women when you present this piece of paper youll have to prove that youve stayed loyal to the united states of america from the date on this form until the day the war ends just one little piece of evidence that anyone in the rothwell family might have borne arms or god help us even a grudge against the united states of america will make this piece of paper worthless and that means youll get no money honey he laughed you damned thief the younger woman said if youre a good girl blythe said mockingly then youll get the money thats what general order number five says and we shall obey general order number five so help us god he stood he was a tall man and the feather in his hat brushed the kitchens beams as he walked toward the frightened family but theres also general order number seven have you folks ever heard of general order number seven no well general order number seven decrees what punishment must be given to any household that fires on troops of the united states of america and a shot was fired at my men from this house thats a lie the older woman insisted and her vehemence made the three children start to cry again quiet blythe shouted the children whimpered and shivered but managed to keep silent blythe smiled by orders of major general pope who is duly authorized by the president and by the congress of the united states of america it is my duty to burn this house down so that no more shots can be fired from it no the younger woman protested yes blythe said still smiling we didnt fire any shots the young woman said but i say you did and when it comes right down to the scratch maam whose word do you think the president and the congress will believe my word which is the word of a commissioned officer of the united states army or your word which is the caviling whine of a secessionist bitch now which of us maam is going to be believed he took a silver case from his pocket and clicked open the lid to reveal the white phosphorus heads of lucifer matches no the younger woman had started to cry corporal kemble blythe snapped and kemble pushed himself off the kitchen wall take her to the barn blythe ordered pointing to the younger woman the woman lunged for the cleaver that was still stuck in the table but blythe was much too fast for her he knocked the cleaver out of her reach then drew his revolver and pointed it at the womans head im not a hardhearted man maam just a simple horse trader turned soldier and like any good horse trader i do sure appreciate a bargain so why dont you and i go and discuss matters in the barn maam and see if we cant work out an accommodation youre worse than a thief the woman said youre a traitor sir kemble was worried by blythes order take her kemble blythe insisted but no liberties shes mine to deal with not yours blythe smiled at the woman and her children i do so love war maam i do so love the pursuit of war i reckon war is in my blood my hot blood kemble took the woman away leaving her children crying while billy blythe went to reserve the pick of the houses plunder before snatching the real pleasure of his day on the saturday after the battle captain anthony murphy opened a book on how long it would take for colonel swynyard to begin drinking again it had been a miracle the whole legion agreed that the colonel had lasted two nights even if he had been concussed for much of the first but no one believed he could last another two nights without the succor of raw spirits ever since his alleged conversion the colonel had been shaking visibly such was the strain he endured and on the friday night he was heard moaning inside his tent yet he endured that night and the next so that on sunday he appeared at the brigades church parade with his onceragged beard trimmed and clean his boots polished and a determined smile on his haggard face his was the most earnest voice in prayer the most enthusiastic to shout amen and the loudest in singing hymns indeed when the reverend moss led the legion in singing depth of mercy can there be mercy still reserved for me can my god his wrath forbear me the chief of sinners spare swynyard looked directly at starbuck and smiled confidingly as he sang general washington faulconer took his secondincommand to one side after the openair service youre making a damned fool of yourself swynyard stop it the lord is making a fool of me sir and i praise him for it ill cashier you faulconer threatened im sure general jackson would like to hear of an officer being cashiered for loving the lord sir swynyard said with a touch of his old cunning just stop making a fool of yourself faulconer growled then walked away swynyard himself sought out captain murphy i hear you have a book on me murphy the irishman reddened but confessed it was so but im not sure i can let you have a wager yourself colonel if thats what youll be wanting murphy said seeing as how you might be considered partial in the matter sir if you follow my meaning i wouldnt have a wager swynyard said wagering is a sin murphy is it now sir murphy asked innocently then it must be a protestant sin sir and mores the pity for you but you should be warned that god is on my side so not a drop of ardent spirits will pass my lips ever again im overjoyed to hear that sir a living saint you are the irishman smiled and backed away that night after the colonel had testified at the legions voluntary prayer meeting he was heard praying aloud in his tent the man was in plain agony he was lusting after drink fighting it and calling on god to help him in the fight starbuck and truslow listened to the pathetic struggle then went to murphys shelter one more day murph starbuck proffered the last two dollars of his recent salary two bucks says hell be sodden tight by this time tomorrow night starbuck offered ill take two bucks for tomorrow night as well truslow added offering his money you and a score of others are saying the exact same thing murphy said dubiously then showed the two men a valise stuffed with confederate banknotes half of that money is saying he wont last this night and the other half is only giving him till tomorrow sundown i cant give you decent odds nate ill be hurting myself if i offered you anything better than two to one against its hardly worth risking your money at those odds listen starbuck said in the silence the three men could hear the colonel sobbing there was a light in swynyards tent and the colonels monstrous shadow was rocking back and forth as he prayed for help his two slaves who had been utterly taken aback by the change in their masters demeanor crouched helplessly outside the poor bastard murphy said its almost enough to stop you from drinking in the first place two to one on starbuck asked for tomorrow night are you sure you dont want to put your money on tonight murphy asked hes survived this far truslow said hell be asleep soon for tomorrow night then murphy said and took starbucks two dollars and then the two dollars that sergeant truslow had offered when the wagers were recorded in murphys book starbuck walked back past the colonels tent and saw lieutenant davies on his knees beside the entrance what the starbuck began but davies turned with his finger to his lips starbuck peered closer and saw that the lieutenant was pushing a halffull bottle of whiskey under the flap davies backed away ive got thirty bucks riding on tonight nate he whispered as he climbed to his feet so i thought id help the money thirty bucks even odds davies said then dusted the dirt off his pants reckon im onto a sure thing listen to the bastard its not fair to do that to a man starbuck said sternly you should be ashamed of yourself he strode to the tent reached under the flap and took out the whiskey put it back davies insisted lieutenant davies starbuck said i will personally pull your belly out of your goddamned throat and shove it up your stinking backside if i ever find you or anyone else trying to sabotage that mans repentance do you understand me he took a step closer to the tall pale and bespectacled lieutenant im not goddamn joking davies that mans trying to redeem himself and all you can do is mock him christ almighty but that makes me angry all right all right davies said frightened by starbucks vehemence im serious davies starbuck said although the lieutenant had never actually doubted starbucks sincerity ill goddamn kill you if you try this again starbuck said now go away starbuck watched the lieutenant vanish into the night then let out a long sigh of relief well keep this for tomorrow night sergeant he told truslow flourishing the whiskey that davies had abandoned then put it into swynyards tent exactly god damn daviess thirty bucks i need money far more than he does truslow walked on beside his captain what that suffering bastard swynyard really likes is good brandy then maybe we can find some on the battlefield tomorrow starbuck said and that discovery seemed a distinct possibility for although three days had passed since the battle there were still wounded men lying in the woods or hidden in the broken stands of corn indeed there were so many dead and wounded that the rebels alone could not retrieve all the casualties and so a truce had been arranged and troops from general bankss army had been invited to rescue their own men the day of the truce dawned hot and sultry most of the legion had been ordered to help search the undergrowth in the belt of trees where the yankee attack had stalled but starbucks company was set to treefelling and the construction of a massive pyre on which the dead horses of the pennsylvanian cavalry were to be burned on the turnpike behind the pyre a succession of lightsprung northern ambulances carried away the yankee wounded the northern vehicles specially constructed for their purpose were in stark contrast to the farm carts and captured army wagons that the rebels used as ambulances just as the uniformed and wellequipped northern soldiers looked so much smarter than the rebel troops a pennsylvanian captain in charge of the detail loading the ambulances sauntered down to starbucks men and had to ask which of the ragamuffins was their officer dick levergood he introduced himself to starbuck nate starbuck levergood companionably offered starbuck a cigar and a drink of lemonade its crystallized essence he said apologizing for the lemonade that was reconstituted from a powder mix but it doesnt taste bad my mother sends it youd rather have whiskey starbuck offered levergood a bottle its good northern liquor starbuck added mischievously other pennsylvanians joined the legionnaires newspapers were exchanged and twists of tobacco swapped for coffee though the briskest trade was in confederate dollars every northerner wanted to buy southern scrip to send home as a souvenir and the price of the illprinted southern money was rising by the minute the men made their trades beside the great pyre that was a sixtyfootlong mound of newly cut pine logs on which a company of confederate gunners was now piling the horses the artillerymen were using a slingcart that had a lifting frame bolted to its bed the wagons real purpose was rescuing dismounted cannon barrels but now its crane jib hoisted the rotting horse carcasses six feet in the air then swung them onto the logs where a team of men with their mouths and nostrils scarfed against the stink levered the swollen corpses into place with handspikes another two masked men splashed kerosene on the pyre captain levergood peered at the slingcart thats one of ours captured starbuck confirmed the carts northern origins indeed the slingcart still had the letters usa stenciled on its backboard no no levergood said one of my familys carts we manufacture them in pittsburgh we used to make sulkies buggies deerborns and horsecars now we mostly make army wagons a hundred wagons a month and the government pays whatever we ask i tell you starbuck if you want to make a fortune then work for the government they pay more for a seventon wagon than we ever dared charge for an eighthorse coach with leather seats stove silk drapes turkey carpets and silvergilt lamps starbuck drew on his cigar so why are you being shot at here instead of building carts in pittsburgh levergood shrugged wanted to fight for my country he sounded embarrassed at making the confession mind you i never dreamed the war would last more than a summer nor did we starbuck said we reckoned one good battle to teach you a lesson and that would be the sum of it reckon we must be slow learners levergood said affably mind you it wont be long now it wont starbuck asked amused mcclellans leaving the peninsula thats what we hear his men are sailing north and in another couple of weeks his army will be alongside ours and then well be down on you like a pack of wolves popes army and mcclellans combined youll be crushed like a soft grape i just hope there are enough beds in richmond to take care of us all there are plenty of prison beds there starbuck said but their mattresses aint too soft levergood laughed then turned as a voice boomed from the road read it read it let the word of god work its grace on your sinful souls here take and read take and read an older man dressed in preachers garb was distributing tracts from horseback scattering the leaflets down to the rebel soldiers beside the road jesus starbuck said in astonishment the reverend elial starbuck levergood said with evident pride that such a famous man was present he preached to us yesterday my but hes got a rare tongue in him it seems hes close to our high command and theyve promised him the honor of preaching the very first sermon in liberated richmond levergood paused then frowned youre called starbuck too are you related just a coincidence starbuck said he edged around the end of the pyre he had faced battle with evident courage but he could not face his father he went to where esau washbrook was mounting a solitary guard over the companys stacked weapons give me your rifle washbrook he said washbrook the companys best marksman had equipped himself with a europeanmade snipers rifle a heavy longrange killing machine with a telescopic sight running alongside the barrel youre not going to kill the man are you levergood asked the pennsylvanian had followed starbuck from the road no starbuck aimed the rifle at his father inspecting him through the telescopic sight the gunners had set fire to the horses funeral pyre and the smoke was beginning to whip across starbucks vision while the heat of the fire was quivering the image held in the guns crosshairs his father astonishingly looked happier than starbuck had ever seen him he was evidently exulting in the stench of death and the remnants of battle the flames of hell will burn brighter than these fires the preacher called to the rebels they will burn for all eternity and lap you with insufferable pain that is your certain fate unless you repent now god is reaching his hand out for you repent and you will be saved starbuck lightly touched the trigger then felt ashamed of the impulse and immediately lowered the gun for a second it seemed that his father had stared straight at him but doubtless the preachers own vision had been smeared by the shimmer of smoky heat for he had looked away without recognition before riding back toward the federal lines the flames of the pyre leaped higher as fat from the carcasses ran down to sizzle among the logs the last ambulances were gone north and with them the final wagons carrying the yankee dead bugles now called the yankee living back to their own lines and captain levergood held out his hand guess well meet again nate id like that starbuck shook the northerners hand kind of crazy really levergood said in halfarticulated regret at meeting an enemy he so liked then he shrugged but watch out next time we meet mcclellan will be leading us and mcclellans a regular tiger hell have you beat soon enough starbuck had met the tiger once and had watched him being beaten too but he said nothing of that meeting nor of the beating be safe he told levergood you too friend the northerners marched away pursued by the evilsmelling smoke of the burning carcasses did you know your father was here colonel swynyards harsh voice suddenly sounded behind starbuck starbuck turned i saw him yes i spoke with him swynyard said i told him i had the honor to command his son you know what he said swynyard paused to dramatize the moment then grinned he said he had no son called nathaniel you do not exist he said you have been written out from his life expunged condemned disinherited i said i would pray that you would be reconciled starbuck shrugged my father aint the reconciling kind colonel then you will have to forgive him instead swynyard said but first get your fellows ready to march were pulling back over the rapidan tonight before first light tomorrow itll be a fast march so tell your boys not to carry unnecessary baggage cant have them laden down with things like this eh starbuck swynyard took a bottle of brandy from his pocket found this in my tent starbuck just after you took that whiskey away i heard you reprove davies and im grateful that you did but a dozen other people brought me liquor anyway starbuck felt a twinge of shame at having planned to place daviess whiskey back in swynyards tent this very night were you tempted he asked the colonel of course i was tempted the devil has not relinquished me yet starbuck but i shall beat him swynyard gauged the distance to the funeral pyre then heaved the brandy at the flames the bottle scored a direct hit breaking to splash a pale blue light in the heart of the fire im saved starbuck swynyard said so tell murphys friends to keep their liquor to themselves yes colonel ill do that starbuck said then walked back to sergeant truslow hes saved and were poor sergeant starbuck said i reckon weve just lost our damned money truslow spat in the dust bugger may not last the night he said two bucks says he will truslow thought about it for a second what two bucks he finally asked the two bucks ill win from you tomorrow morning if swynyard lasts the night forget it the smoke blew north there to meld with dark clouds that heaped in the summer sky somewhere beneath those clouds the armies of the united states were gathering to march south and jacksons men outnumbered could only retreat adam waited with his troop at a place where he had a view toward the distant blue ridge mountains he was watching for partisans but sergeant tom huxtable kept glancing back toward the farmhouse tidy place he finally commented kind of house a man could live in forever adam agreed but not after billy blythes finished searching it huxtable could no longer keep his concern silent our jobs to hunt down rebels he said not persecute womenfolk adam was acutely uncomfortable with this direct criticism of his fellow officer he suspected the criticism might be justified but adam always tried to give all men the benefit of the doubt and now he tried to find some saving grace in blythes character the captains simply investigating gunfire sergeant i didnt hear anything said of womenfolk gunfire that seth kelley shot huxtable said like as not adam kept silent while he examined the woods and fields to the south the trees lay still in the windless air as he turned the field glasses back to the mountains a man should have beliefs you see sergeant huxtable said a man without beliefs captain is a man without purpose like a ship without a compass adam still said nothing he turned the glasses northward he watched an empty track then slid the lenses across a wooded ridge huxtable shifted his lump of chewing tobacco from one cheek to the other he had been a cooper in his native louisiana and then apprenticed to a cabinetmaker in his wifes village in upstate new york when the war had broken out tom huxtable had visited the whitespired village church knelt in prayer for twenty minutes then gone home and taken his rifle from its hooks over the fireplace a bible from the drawer in the kitchen table and a knife from his workshop then he had told his wife to keep the squash well watered and gone to join the northern army his grandfather had been killed by the british to establish the united states of america and tom huxtable was not minded to let that sacrifice go for nothing it maynt be my place to say it huxtable now went remorselessly on but captain blythe dont have a belief in his body sir hed fight for the devil if the pay was right adams men were of a like mind with their sergeant and murmured agreement mr blythes not in the north by choice captain huxtable continued doggedly he says hes fighting for the union but we hear he left his hometown a pace ahead of a lynching party theres talk of a girl captain a white girl of good family she says mr blythe wrestled her down and i dont want to know adam said abruptly then thinking he had spoken too fiercely he turned apologetically to his sergeant im sure major galloway has considered all this major galloways like yourself sir a decent man who doesnt believe in evil and you do adam asked youve seen the plantations in the deep south sir huxtable asked yes sir i believe in evil sir the conversation was interrupted by one of adams men who pointed northward adam turned and raised the field glasses for a second his view was of nothing but blurred leaves then he focused the lenses to see mounted men on a crestline he counted a dozen riders but guessed there were more they were not in uniform but carried rifles slung from their shoulders or thrust into saddle holsters a second group of horsemen came into view they had to be partisans the southern horsemen who rode virginias secret paths to harass the northern armies huxtable stared at the distant horsemen captain blythe will run away he said disgustedly he needs to be warned come on adam led his troop down from the hilltop they spurred east and adam wished their horses were not so decrepit the parched lawn in front of the farmhouse was now a bizarre array of furniture and household goods which blythes men were picking through in search of plunder there were buckets spittoons pictures lamps and rushbottom chairs there was a sewing machine a long case clock two butter churns a chamber pot and meal sifters some men were trying on suits of clothes while two more were swathed in womens scarves a man threw a bolt of cloth from an upstairs window and the bright cloth cascaded across the veranda roof and down to where the horses were picketed in the flower beds wheres captain blythe adam demanded of one of the scarfed men in the barn capn but he wont thank you for finding him there the man answered children screamed in the house adam threw his reins to sergeant huxtable then ran to the barn where corporal kemble was standing guard you cant go in sir the corporal said unhappily adam just pushed past the corporal unlatched the door and pushed into the barn two empty horse stalls were on the right an oat cutter stood in the floors center while a mound of hay filled the barns farther end blythe was in the hay struggling with a crying woman bitch blythe said slapping her goddamned bitch there was the sound of cloth ripping then blythe realized the door had been thrown open and he turned angrily around what the hell do you want he could not recognize the intruder who was silhouetted against the light outside leave her alone blythe adam said faulconer you son of a bitch blythe scrambled to his feet and brushed scraps of hay from his hands im just questioning this lady and what i do here is none of your damned business the woman clutched the remnants of her dress to her breasts and pushed herself across the floor he was attacking me mister she called to adam he was going to get out blythe shouted at adam but adam knew the time had come to make his stand he drew his revolver cocked it then aimed the weapon at blythes head just leave her alone blythe smiled and shook his head youre a boy faulconer i aint attacking her shes a rebel she fired on us i never the woman called step away from her adam said he could sense his heart pounding and recognized his own fear but he knew blythe had to be confronted shoot the interfering son of a bitch kemble blythe shouted past adam to the corporal touch the trigger corporal and ill kill you sergeant huxtable spoke from beyond the door blythe seemed to find the impasse amusing for he still grinned as he brushed scraps of hay from his uniform shes a traitor faulconer a damned rebel you know what the penalty is for firing on a northern soldier youve read general order number seven aint you he had taken the silver case of lucifers from his pocket just step away from her adam repeated i never wanted to be near her blythe said but the bitch kept trying to stop me from doing my job and my job faulconer is to burn this property down like major general john pope ordered he began to strike the lucifers then to drop the burning matches into the hay he laughed as the woman tried to beat the flames out with her bare hands her torn dress dropped open and blythe gestured at her nice titties faulconer or cant you make a comparison on account of never having seen none blythe chuckled as he dropped more matches and started more fires so why dont you shoot me faulconer lost your nerve because i dont want to tell the partisans were here theres a group of them a mile north of here and coming this way blythe stared at adam for a heartbeat then smiled nice try boy maybe two dozen of them sergeant huxtable said flatly from the barn door behind blythe the hay had started to burn fiercely the woman retreated from the heat crying her hair had come loose to hang either side of her face she clasped her bodice then spat at blythe before running out of the barn thank you mister she said as she passed adam blythe watched her go then looked back to adam are you lying to me faulconer he asked you want to stay here and find out adam asked you want to run the risk of meeting that womans husband goddamn partisans sergeant seth kelley shouted his sudden warning from the sunlight outside bout a mile away billy jesus hollering christ blythe swore then ran past adam and shouted for his horse come on boys get out of here take what you can leave the rest hurry now hurry the hay was well alight the smoke churning out the barn door where to sergeant kelley asked south come on blythe was desperate to escape the farm before the partisans arrived he snatched a bag of plunder rammed his spurs back and galloped south toward the woods his men followed in ragged order adam and his troop were the last to go they found blythe a halfmile inside the woods hesitating over a track leading west and another going south there were mens voices in the distant air and that was enough to make blythe choose the southward track that promised a faster escape because it went downhill adams horses were tired their lungs wheezing asthmatically and their flanks wet with white sweat yet still blythe pressed the pace not stopping until they had ridden a good six or seven miles from the farmhouse there was no evidence of any pursuit bastards probably stopped to put out that fire billy seth kelley opined cant tell with partisans blythe said cunning as serpents could be anywhere he looked nervously around the green woods the horsemen had stopped beside a stream that flowed eastward through sunlit woodlands the horses were all winded and a couple of the beasts were lamed if the partisans had followed adam knew then every man in blythes command would either be killed or captured what do we do now one of the men asked blythe we find out where the hell we are blythe snapped irritably i know where we are adam said and i know where were going blythe panting hard and with his red face covered in sweat looked at his fellow officer where he asked curtly were going to get some decent horses adam said and then were going to fight like were supposed to amen sergeant huxtable said blythe straightened up in his saddle are you saying i dont want to fight faulconer for a second adam was tempted to accept the challenge and make blythe either fight him or back down in front of his men then he remembered the partisans and knew he could not afford the luxury of fighting a duel so deep behind the enemys lines blythe saw adams hesitation and translated it as cowardice he grinned lost your tongue im going south blythe and i dont care if you come or stay ill let you go boy blythe said then pulled his horse around and spurred westward he planned to take his men to the foothills of the blue ridge then follow the mountains north until he came to the federal lines adam watched blythe go and knew he had merely postponed their confrontation then after dusk when his horses and men were rested adam led the troop south to where he planned a victory part two jackson like a snake that had struck hurt but not killed its prey retreated sullenly back across the rapidan river thus abandoning the battlefield at the foot of cedar mountain with its blackened swathes of scorched turf and long raw mounds of newly turned graves where turkey vultures gorged on bodies uncovered by dogs the yankees were left in possession of culpeper county and counted its possession as a victory though no one really believed jackson was defeated the snake still had fangs which meant that the northern generals must try to scotch it again yankee troops poured southward and spread their camps along the rapidans northern bank while south of the river in gordonsville the railcars brought fresh rebel troops from richmond on both banks of the river there was a nervous sense of great events waiting to happen and inevitably rumors fed that apprehension the rebels feared that mcclellans army of the potomac had joined forces with popes army of virginia and if that prospect was not frightening enough a northern newspaper hinted that the yankees had emptied every jail between washington and the canadian border and put the convicts in uniform handed them guns and sent them to lay virginia waste another tale insisted that the north was recruiting mercenaries in europe germans mostly and that each foreigner had been promised an acre of indian territory for every rebel killed i knew wed end up fighting hessians truslow remarked but we beat the sumbitches in so well beat the sumbitches in as well yet the most persistent rumor of all was that abe lincoln was enlisting freed slaves into his army because he cant find anyone else willing to fight against us lieutenant coffman averred patriotically most men dismissed the rumor of armed slaves as unthinkable but a week after the legion retreated from cedar mountain captain murphy found confirmation of the story in a twoweekold copy of the hartfordevening press that had somehow found its way into the rebel lines see murphy exclaimed to the officers sharing a jug of whiskey around a fire it is true he tilted the newspaper toward the campfire congress has extended permission for the president to enrol colored men into the army murphy read aloud congressman matteson of new jersey claims that the sable brethren of america are fervent in their desire to contribute their blood toward the great crusade and that so long as their childlike and excitable nature proves tractable to military discipline there is no reason why they should not fight at least as well as any treasonable rebel a chorus of jeers greeted the last two words afterward there was much discussion of the newspapers report and starbuck sensed a nervousness among the officers there was something very nightmarish in the thought of black troops coming to take vengeance on their old masters though how many of us ever owned a slave lieutenant davies asked resentfully i own some murphy said mildly and then after a pause mind you i pay the buggers well enough i dont think we irish are very good at slaveholding major hinton owns a dozen lieutenant pine of murphys d company added and swynyards owned plenty enough in his lifetime starbuck said though not any longer lieutenant davies observed in wonderment and indeed to everyones astonishment the colonel had manumitted his two slaves when jackson pulled the army back across the river the colonel despite coming from one of virginias most prominent slavetrading families had set free at least a thousand dollars worth of prime negroes by sending the two men north to the federal lines somehow it was that sacrifice even more than the colonels astonishing achievement of staying away from liquor that had impressed on the whole brigade that their secondincommand truly was a converted man hes even given up cigars davies added murphy took the stone jug from starbuck god knows why you protestants have such an unpleasant religion because its the true religion lieutenant ezra pine averred and our reward will be in heaven and heaven murphy insisted to his lieutenant is a place of all pleasures is it not which means that therell be rivers running brimful with the tastiest of whiskeys and boxes of the choicest cigars waiting ready lit at every corner and if those pleasures are good enough for the angels theyre good enough for me gods blessing on you pine murphy added and lifted the stone jug to his lips ezra pine wanted to start a theological argument about the nature of heaven but he was shouted down out in the darkness a man sang a love ballad and the sound of it made the officers silent starbuck guessed they were all thinking about that horde of convicts hessian mercenaries and vengeful freed slaves that was supposedly massing on the rapidans far bank if lee was here murphy broke the silence hed have us all digging trenches itd be sore hands so it would everyone agreed that robert lee would have fought a defensive battle but no one understood what thomas jackson might do i wish lee would come murphy said wistfully for theres nothing on gods earth so good for stopping a bullet as a yard or two of good clean dirt the next day starbuck heard the first rumor that confirmed that lee was indeed coming to take command of the rebel forces on the rapidan starbuck heard the rumor from an old friend who rode into the legions encampment brandishing two bottles of fine french wine we took ten cases off the yankees three miles beyond the rappahannock the jubilant speaker was a frenchman colonel lassan who was ostensibly a foreign military observer but who actually rode with the rebel cavalry for the sheer delight of fighting he had just come back from a raid deep behind the yankee lines and brought news of the enemys preparations there are lines of wagons as far as the eye can see nate mile after mile of them and every one crammed full with food powder and shot is that mcclellans army starbuck asked lassan shook his head thats popes army but mcclellans coming the frenchman sounded happy at such a gathering of armies with its implicit promise of fighting and if mcclellan comes starbuck said lee will come and thatll mean digging mile after mile of trenches the frenchman gave starbuck a look of surprise dear lord no lee cant afford to wait he dug trenches to protect richmond but trenches wont help herehe waved at the open countryand lee has to break the yankees before they join their armies together lees no fool nate he knows which end of a pig makes the mess starbuck laughed at the quaint phrase lassan spoke perfect english the legacy of a british father but at times he transposed a norman peasants language into his fathers tongue lassan himself was no peasant but a professional soldier who had fought in italy the crimea and north africa and who bore the scars of those wars across his eyepatched face they were terrible scars scars to terrify a child to nightmare yet lassan himself was an easygoing man whose besetting sins were warfare and women both dangerous pursuits he liked to tell starbuck but why settle for dullness in this sad bad world now with his horse picketed the frenchman strolled with starbuck through the legions camp lines the weather was such that none of the men had bothered to make turf shelters preferring instead to sleep on the open ground and so the lines were little more than piles of belongings interrupted by the remnants of cooking fires the legions new draftees were being drilled by sergeant major tolliver while the veterans not on picket duty were either sleeping playing cards or reading lassan who seemed to have taken it on himself to educate starbuck in matters military was explaining why lee could not afford a defensive strategy dig trenches and gun emplacements behind this river my friend and how are you to stop the yankees simply strolling round the end of your earthworks you dont have enough men to guard a trench dug from the chesapeake bay to the blue ridge mountains so instead of digging you will have to march and tip the enemy off balance it will be a war of maneuver a cavalrymans war naturally you infantrymen will have to do the real fighting and dying thats why god made infantrymen but we cavalrymen will do your scouting for you lassan scratched beneath his mildewed eye patch youll know things are getting warm nate when lee arrives or when the yankees attack starbuck said they wont theyre too sluggish the north is like a man who has grown so fat he is unable to move fast he just wants to roll over you and so crush you to death while you have to slice him up into little pieces starbuck walked a few paces in silence the two men had left the brigade lines behind and were now walking toward a stand of trees that screened the south bank of the rapidan can we win this war starbuck finally asked the frenchman oh yes lassan said without hesitation but it will be expensive if you kill enough yankees then they may think the game isnt worth the candle youll also need luck the frenchman had sounded confident but it nevertheless struck starbuck as a gloomy prescription of course lassan went on if you could get european support then everything changes can we starbuck asked as if the question had not been debated endlessly in the confederacy lassan shook his head france wont do anything unless britain leads the way and britain has been burned too badly by its past american adventures so britain wont intervene unless the south looks capable of winning the war by itself in which case you wouldnt need their help anyway which all means mon ami that it is up to the south to fight and win its own war they had reached the edge of the trees now a place made ragged by the axes of men seeking firewood and starbuck hesitated to go further but lassan gestured him on i wanted to talk to you in private the frenchman said and so he led starbuck down a vague path that zigzagged erratically through the underbrush pigeons clattered through the upper leaves while a woodpeckers staccato rattle sounded sudden and close i have to tell youlassan half turned to starbuck as he spokethat i have set myself up in an establishment in richmond it seemed an oddly unnecessary confession to starbuck perhaps because he was not entirely sure what the frenchman meant by an establishment a business you mean he asked dear lord god no lassan laughed at the very thought ive no head for commerce none no i mean i have established a household its on grace street you know it very well starbuck was amused by the thought of lassan fussing with domestic arrangements its an apartment lassan said we have five rooms above a tailors shop on the corner of fourth street then we have slave quarters downstairs at the back where theres a kitchen a small garden for herbs a peach tree and a wooden stable its rented of course and the kitchen chimney smokes when the winds in the west but otherwise its really very comfortable the middleaged lassan had never counted comfort as one of lifes priorities and he gave the word an ironic twist youve got slaves starbuck asked surprised lassan shrugged when in rome mon ami he took a cigar from his pouch lit it and handed it to starbuck before lighting one for himself i cant say that im comfortable with the arrangement he went on but i convince myself that the slaves are better off with me than with anyone else i have a stable boy there are two kitchen girls who clean as well and of course an upstairs girl who looks after clothes and all the rest of the flummery he sounded embarrassed again the two men had reached an old cart track that was much overgrown but was wide enough to let them walk side by side you sound as if youve taken a wife starbuck said lightly lassan stopped and faced his friend i have taken a companion he said very seriously we are not married nor shall we marry but for the moment at least we suit each other lassan paused you introduced me to her oh starbuck said coloring slightly and remembering how when lassan had first crossed the lines to attach himself to the rebel forces he had asked starbuck for an introduction to a house of pleasure in richmond starbuck had sent lassan to the best of all such houses the most exclusive house the house where sally truslow worked its sally starbuck asked indeed lassan said his one eye examined starbuck anxiously starbuck was quiet for a moment sally was the rebellious daughter of sergeant truslow and a girl with whom starbuck sometimes thought he was in love himself he had asked sally to marry him earlier in the year and at times starbuck was still convinced that they could have made such a marriage work he had been delighted when she had abandoned the brothel for the more lucrative job of being a spiritual medium and sallys seances were now famous in richmond a town obsessed with supernatural phenomena but there was no doubt that her success had more than a little to do with the fact that the darkened shrine of madame royall as sally now called herself was attached to richmonds most notorious house of assignation a proximity that added the spice of wickedness to her clients visits starbuck had half dared to hope that sally might want to complete her conversion to respectability by taking a husband but instead she had taken a lover and starbuck understood that in the gentlest possible way he was now being warned away from sallys bed good for you he told lassan she wanted to tell you herself lassan said but i insisted thank you starbuck said wondering why he was suddenly so damned jealous he had no call for jealousy indeed if he was so in love with sally why did he sneak out of the brigades lines at night to visit the crude tavern just south of the camp mccombs tavern had been put out of bounds but there was a redhaired girl working one of the upstairs rooms and starbuck was happy to risk washington faulconers punishment to visit her he had no call for jealousy he told himself again then began walking north along the cart track youre a lucky man lassan yes i am and sallys lucky too starbuck said gallantly even though he could not help feeling betrayed i think so the frenchman said lightly i am teaching her french starbuck forced a smile at the thought of sally truslow a girl from a hardscrabble farm in the blue ridge mountains learning to speak french except it was not so strange for sally had journeyed a long way from her fathers comfortless house she had learned societys manners and how to dress and how to talk and yet again starbuck felt a pang of jealousy at the memory of sallys exquisite beauty then he again thought how unfair it was for him to be envious for as often as he thought of sally he also thought of julia gordon adam faulconers abandoned fiancйe and he did not know which girl he preferred or whether in truth he was simply a fool for any woman even for a redhaired whore in a country tavern i am glad for you lassan he said with forced generosity truly thank you lassan said simply and then stopped beside starbuck where the cart track left the trees to run down to the river a house had once stood on the nearer bank but all that was left of the house now was a stub of broken brick chimney and the outlines of a stone foundation within which grew a thick and entangling clump of bushes the farther bank of the river was a forest of shade trees that hung over the swirling water though immediately opposite the house a cart track led between two willows into the far woods lassan stared at that distant cart track then frowned do you see what i see nate starbuck had been thinking of sallys startling beauty and of julia gordons graver face but now sensing that he was being tested he stared at the landscape and tried to see whatever was significant in it a ruined house a river a far bank of thick trees and then he saw the anomaly just as clearly as lassans trained eye had seen it the track that he and lassan had followed to this spot did not end at the river but rather continued on the farther bank which meant there was a ford here which was strange because every crossing of the rapidan was supposedly guarded to prevent a surprise northern attack yet here was a ford standing empty and unwatched because no one knows the fords here starbuck said or maybe the roadbed is washed away he added theres an easy way to find out lassan said he had the instinctive caution of any soldier coming to a river especially a river that divided two armies but he had stared hard at the further bank through a small glass and was satisfied that no yankees waited in ambush and so he now walked into the sunlight where he took off his spurred boots and hitched up his saber starbuck followed the frenchman wading into the river which flowed fast clear and shallow across a bed of fine gravel long weeds trailed upstream and a few fish darted in the shadows downstream but nothing obstructed lassan and starbucks progress indeed the water scarce reached either mans knees at the far bank the road reared steeply up from the water but not so steeply that a horse team could not have pulled a heavy gun and limber out of the river if the yankees knew about this ford lassan said they could be round your backside in a trice i thought you said they werent going to attack us starbuck commented as he pulled himself up onto the northern bank and ive also told you a hundred times that you must always expect the unexpected from your enemy lassan said as he sat in the shade of a willow and stared back across the river he gestured upstream with the cigar what units are that way none starbuck said were the westernmost brigade of the army so the yankees really could hook round your backside lassan said softly he smoked in silence for a few seconds then abruptly changed the subject back to his new household sally hopes youll visit us when youre in richmond i hope so too thank you starbuck said awkwardly lassan grinned i am becoming domesticated my mother would be most amused poor mama i am an adventurer while my sister lives in england so mama is rather alone these days youve a sister the countess of benfleet lassan gave a halfmocking grimace at the grandsounding title dominique married an english nobleman so now she has a castle five grown children and probably twice as many lovers i hope she does anyway he tossed the stub of his cigar into the water one of dominiques sons wants to join this war and she asked me which side he should fight for i said the north if he wants to be respectable and the south if he wants adventure lassan shrugged as if to suggest he did not much care either way i wonder if this fords got a name he said idly dead marys ford a man spoke suddenly from the far side of the track and the voice so startled starbuck that he reached for his revolver its all right massa silas is just plain harmless the unseen speaker chuckled then the bushes stirred and starbuck saw that an old negro had been hiding in the trees just a few feet away the old man must have been watching them for a long time silas is a free man the negro said as he sidled onto the track and drew from his filthy clothes a scrap of paper that had long lost any legibility free massa kemp gave silas freedom he waved the disintegrating scrap of greasy paper god bless massa kemp youre silas lassan asked silas the old man confirmed his identity with a nod mad silas he added as though the qualification might prove useful he was staring keenly at the stub of starbucks cigar lassan took out a new cigar lit it and gave it to the old man who was now squatting in the road do you live here silas over there massa silas pointed to the ruined house silas has a lair in there he chuckled then found the internal rhyme even funnier and almost rolled backward as he laughed at himself how old are you silas lassan asked silas is older than you massa silas laughed again but silass daddy now he saw the redcoats why dead marys ford silas lassan asked the old man shuffled a few inches nearer his clothes looked as old as himself and his hair was white and matted with dirt while his face was deep lined lassans question had swept the humor from that face replacing it with suspicion cos mary died he said at last here starbuck asked gently the white folks came looking for silas but silas wasnt here mistress pearces baby gone see they thought silas took it so they came and burned silass house and burned silass wife the old man looked very close to tears as he stared at the house where starbuck now saw a kind of hollowed den was scooped in the bushes under the brick chimney but the baby was never gone after all silas sighed as he finished the story she grown up now but silass mary shes still here too lassan lit himself another cigar and smoked in companionable silence for a few moments before giving the old man a smile listen silas more white folk are coming here theyre going to dig trenches along the edge of the trees over there at the top of your meadow they dont mean you any harm but if theres anything in your house thats valuable to you take it away and hide it you understand me silas understands you massa silas said very intensely lassan gave the old man two more cigars then clapped starbuck on the shoulder time to get back nate the two men waded the ford pulled on their boots then walked back through the woods starbuck wanted to find major hinton but the major was out of the lines and so accompanied by lassan starbuck went to the big farmhouse that washington faulconer had commandeered for his headquarters washington faulconer had gone to gordonsville leaving colonel swynyard in command of the brigade the colonel was in the farmhouse parlor sitting beneath the crossed flags of the faulconer legion that faulconer kept unfurled and draped across the parlor wall one of the two flags was the faulconer legions own banner derived from the faulconer familys coat of arms it showed three red crescents on a white field and had the familys motto forever ardent wreathed around the lower crescent the flag measured thirtysix square feet and had a yellow fringe just as did its companion flag which was the new battle flag of the confederate states of america the original flag of the confederacy had carried three stripes two red and one white with a starspangled blue field in its upper corner but when the wind dropped and the flag hung limp it had resembled the stars and stripes and so a new flag had been designed a scarlet banner blazoned with a blue cross of saint andrew and on that diagonal whiteedged cross were thirteen white stars the old flag with its stars and three stripes was still the official flag of the confederacy but when the confederacys soldiers marched into battle they now marched under their new battle flag the confederate war department had decreed that infantry regiments should carry a battle flag four feet square but such a flag was not nearly grand enough for brigadier general washington faulconer who had insisted on having a banner six feet by six feet made of the finest silk and edged with a tasseled fringe of golden threads the general had intended that his legions two flags should be the finest war banners in all the confederacy and so he had commissioned them from the same expensive french factory that had manufactured his illfated crescentbadged shoulder patches which means colonel griffin swynyard said when he saw the frenchman admiring the lavish flags that every marksman in the northern army will be aiming for them maybe you could persuade faulconer to stand beneath them starbuck suggested sweetly now nate let us be charitable swynyard said the colonel had been busily trying to reconcile the brigades accounts and seemed glad to be interrupted by visitors he stood and shook hands with colonel lassan apologized that general faulconer was away from the headquarters and insisted on hearing what circumstances had brought the scarred french cavalry officer to the confederate army youre welcome to a lemonade colonel swynyard said when the story was told indicating a jug of pale yellow liquid that was protected from wasps by a beaded cover of fine muslin i have wine colonel lassan produced one of his captured bottles swynyard grimaced captain starbuck will tell you that i have forsworn all ardent liquor colonel for over two weeks now he added proudly and it was astonishing what a change the abstinence had wrought in the colonel the sallow cast of his skin had vanished his sweating fits had faded and the twitch in his cheek that had once convulsed his face into a grotesque rictus had subsided to a faint tic his eyes were clear and alert he stood straighter and he was dressed each day in clean linen i am a new man he boasted though alas my rebirth has not given me a facility for mathematics he gestured at the brigades ledgers i need someone who can understand accounts someone with an education someone like you starbuck not me colonel starbuck said i was at yale that must make you good for something swynyard insisted not one whole hell of a lot starbuck said except maybe discovering unmapped fords he crossed to a handdrawn map of the area that lay on a clawfooted table just here he said not a long rifle shot away from the lines for a moment swynyard thought starbuck was being jocular then he crossed to the map table truly he asked truly lassan confirmed right there starbuck pointed on the pencildrawn map its called dead marys ford we waded across it colonel lassan said picking up the tale knee deep passable by artillery and as wide open as a barracktown whorehouse on a saturday night swynyard shouted for his horse now that he had released his slaves he was using hiram ketley colonel birds halfwitted orderly as his servant bird himself was on his way home to faulconer court house and was expected to survive so long as his wound stayed clean you dont have a horse starbuck swynyard asked as his own mare was brought to the front of the house no colonel cant afford one swynyard ordered another horse saddled and then the three men rode north through the woods to where the ruined house stood beside the river swynyard rode across the ford then back again our lord and master he said to starbuck ordered me not to change the brigades dispositions without his permission but even faulconer i suspect would agree that we have to put a guard here he stopped talking distracted by the stooped ragged figure of mad silas who had suddenly appeared out of the bushes in his ruined house like a beast scuttling out of a burrow whos that swynyard asked some poor old mad black lassan said he lives there is that a skull hes carrying swynyard asked in a tone of horror starbuck stared and felt a sudden shock as he realized that the object in silass hands was indeed an old yellow skull jesus he said faintly its more likely to belong to dead mary lassan said dryly i suppose he knows what hes doing swynyard said as silas crossed the river and disappeared into the far woods which is more than we do he returned his attention to the ford if weve not heard of this crossing then i cant believe the yankees know about it but even so we cant take a chance why dont you bring your company here starbuck with b and e as well ill make you a separate command which means youll bivouac here youll have to dig in of course and ill inspect your earthworks at sunset tonight for a second starbuck did not quite understand the implications of the colonels words does that mean ill be in command he asked who else the tooth fairy swynyards conversion had not entirely robbed him of savagery of course youre in command b and e companies are commanded by lieutenants in case you hadnt noticed but of course he added if you dont feel equal to the responsibility of command he left the question dangling im up to it sir and thank you starbuck said and then he saw swynyards triumphant grin and realized that he had actually called the colonel sir but then this was a special occasion the first time that captain nathaniel starbuck had been given the responsibility of an independent command i suspect the ford is in safe hands now swynyard said pleased with himself so colonelhe turned to lassan youve plainly seen more adventure than most like me he held up his left hand with its missing fingers so let us exchange stories of scars off you go starbuck fetch your men leave the horse with ketley yes sir starbuck said and felt his spirits soar he had a ford to guard priscilla bird had taken over her husbands responsibilities in the small schoolroom of faulconer court house where day by day she taught fiftythree children whose ages ranged from five to sixteen she was a good teacher patient with the slow demanding of the quick and firm in her discipline yet since the war had begun there were two sounds that were guaranteed to erode all order in her schoolroom one was the noise of marching feet and the other the clatter of massed hoofbeats on the road outside and despite all priscillas strictures the older children would always respond to those sounds by first sidling along their benches to see out of the windows and if they saw soldiers passing they would then ignore her protests and insist on hanging over the sills to cheer their passing heroes yet as the august temperatures rose to record levels priscilla became as sensitive to the sound of horses as any of the children she expected her wounded husbands return and that expectation was shot through with apprehension love relief and fear which was why she no longer protested when the children crowded at the windows for she was as keen as they to investigate every odd sound in the street not that troops passed very often for since the faulconer legion had marched away a year before the town had seen precious few soldiers in its streets the townsfolk read about the battles in the faulconercountygazette but the tides of war had ebbed and flowed far from the streets of faulconer court house indeed in the summer of hardly a uniform was seen in the town at all until on an august day as hot as any in memory the sound of cavalry drew the children to the schoolroom windows priscilla joined them scanning the street for the sight of a wagon that might be carrying her husband but all she saw was a tired group of horsemen with weapons on their shoulders the schoolchildren cheered while priscilla her heart aching felt sorry for the wearylooking men and their poor swaybacked horses one or two of the troopers smiled at the cheering children but most stayed grimfaced as they passed the school there were only twenty of the horse soldiers but their arrival was stirring the town with excitement and the expectation of news are you with jeb stuart one boy called repeatedly from the schoolhouse the confederacy still buzzed with the remembered pleasure of stuarts mocking ride clean around the whole of george mcclellans army are you jeb stuarts men mister the boy called again damn stuart you blackassed bastard one of the dusty troopers called back priscilla frowned stared and hardly dared to believe the suspicion that suddenly crossed her thoughts these men wore blue coats not gray or brown and the leader of the troop was suddenly familiar beneath the mask of dust on his suntanned face the man had a square golden beard and blue eyes that looked up to meet priscillas gaze he half smiled then courteously touched the brim of his hat it was adam faulconer get back priscilla shouted at the children and such was the fear and anger in her voice that all but the most rebellious of her pupils obeyed for there were yankees in faulconer court house adam had known it was imprudent to take his men through the very center of his hometown but once he had thought of the notion he could not shake it free he wanted to flaunt his new allegiance in front of his fathers neighbors and the very hurtfulness of that disloyal act made it all the more appealing he suddenly felt free of both his father and of his fathers money and that liberation had made him cast all caution to the wind and bring his blue troopers into the heart of his hometown sergeant huxtable he shouted when he saw priscilla bird pull back from the open schoolroom window sir huxtable called let the banner fly huxtable lets not be coy yes sir huxtable grinned then ordered corporal kemp to pull the cloth cover off the stars and stripes kemp unrolled the banner then raised it high on its lance shaftpole a last child had been cheering from the schoolroom but fell abruptly silent as the old flag unfurled to the bright virginia sun adam looking at that flag felt the familiar catch in his throat it was a sweet moment for adam as he rode through faulconer court house beneath his proper flag he rode proud in a strange uniform and he enjoyed the astonishment on the townspeoples faces good morning mrs cobb he called happily your husbands well youll doubtless be hoping for some rain for your vegetables he waved to grandmother mallory who was on the steps of the bank then greeted the blacksmith matthew tunney who was one of a group of drinkers who had crowded out of greeleys tavern to watch the strange horsemen pass keep your hand off your gun southerly adam warned an elderly man whose face displayed a livid outrage adams own men had unslung their colt rifles traitor southerly called but kept his hands in clear sight as the dusty hardfaced horsemen passed by the horses some of the townsfolk noted were mangy and illkept should be ashamed of himself a faulconer riding nags like that matthew tunney observed adam led the nags past sparrows dry goods store then by the episcopal church and the baptist church the courthouse and the livery stable sleeping dogs were startled awake and slunk out of the road as the horses clattered by adam paused by the livery stable to touch his hat to a wan thin woman i was so sorry to hear about joseph mrs may he said sincerely sorry mrs may just stared in apparent shock some townsfolk followed the horsemen but once adam had passed medlicotts watermill which marked the eastern extremity of faulconer court house he quickened his troops pace and so left the curious townspeople behind theyll be sending for help sergeant huxtable warned adam theres no help nearer than rosskill adam reassured the sergeant and well be well gone before anyone can get there and back and no one in rosskill will hear that noise he added as someone in the town began to tug the rope of the courthouse bell the bell was still tolling its alarm as adam turned his troop into a whitegated entrance that opened into an avenue edged by mature live oaks beyond the oaks were deep wellwatered pastures where cows stood to their bellies in cool ponds while at the end of the avenue was a wide comfortable house clad in creepers that smothered the houses weatherboards and encroached on its steepgabled roofs a weathervane shaped like a galloping horse surmounted a clock tower above the stable entrance the only warlike aspect of the house was a pair of bronze sixpounder cannons that flanked the main entrance the twin guns had been purchased by washington faulconer at the wars beginning in the expectation that the faulconer legion needed to have its own artillery yet in the rush to reach the first battle the weapons had been left behind and faulconer had found it simpler to appropriate the two cannons as garden ornaments adam pointed huxtable toward the stable youll probably find a halfdozen decent horses in there he said and the rest will be in the bottom fields ill take you there when ive finished in the house huxtable paused before swerving away a nice place he said staring up at the house home adam said with a grin sweet home home was seven springs adams fathers country house where washington faulconer kept the faulconer stud that was reputed to breed the finest horses in all virginia it was here that adam would find the remounts for his cavalrymen and not just any remounts but horses sprung from the best arab blood crossed and strengthened with sturdier american strains to breed a fast willing and enduring horse that could hunt a long cold winters day among the short hills and wooded valleys of virginia or else be spurred into a winning gallop in the last furlongs of a lungbreaking sweatstreaked steeplechase adam had risked coming this far south to equip his men with the best horses in america horses that could outrun and outlast the best of the souths famed cavalry indeed they were horses that should have belonged to the southern cavalry for the richmond government had ordered that all saddle horses should be surrendered to the army but adam knew his father had chosen to ignore the command faulconer horses according to washington faulconer were too valuable to be wasted on war and so the stud still existed adam let himself into the house he did not know whether or not his mother would want to see him but he intended to pay his respects anyway though as he walked into the front hall with its four portraits of washington jefferson madison and washington faulconer the first person he met was nelson his fathers personal servant adam stopped in surprise is my father here he asked the question with some trepidation for though he felt he was making a fine and defiant gesture in stealing a score of horses from seven springs he did not particularly want to meet his father while he made it nelson shook his head then put a finger to his lips and gave a glance upstairs as though warning adam of some danger then nelson beckoned adam along the corridor that led to washington faulconers study adam followed the black man the mistress sent john to rockville mr adam nelson said when he was certain that no one in the household could overhear him young master finney ran here from the town saying how youd arrived with the soldiers so mistress sent young john to fetch help adam smiled then no one will be here for at least an hour and a half maybe nelson agreed but the mistress says youre to be held here she says youre mindsick mr adam she says youre to be locked up till the doctors can see you the two men had reached the study and nelson now closed the door to give them privacy they say youve clear gone plumb mad crazy mr adam the servant said they would say that adam admitted sadly he knew his parents could not stomach his betrayal of virginia nor would they ever accept adams conviction that virginia was best served by adherence to the union he looked out of a window and saw some of the stable boys running in panic from sergeant huxtables men what are you doing here nelson he asked the servant the general sent me to deliver something nelson said evasively he was a trusted servant much older than his master and in charge of three younger black men who served the general as valets and cooks nelson like all washington faulconers servants was a free man though freedom in adams experience rarely lifted a negro out of poverty or released him from the need to show an obsequious respect to all white men and adam suspected that the outwardly servile nelson still harbored the secret resentments of most slaves washington faulconer on the other hand believed utterly in nelsons loyalty and had provided him with a pass enabling him to travel freely throughout confederateheld virginia adam crossed to the giant map of virginia that hung on a wall of the study do you think im mad nelson you know i dont mr adam do you think im wrong nelson paused then shrugged somewhere deep in the house a womans voice called in sharp reproof and a bell rang the mistress will be wanting me nelson said where is my father adam asked here he stabbed a finger at the peninsula east of richmond where he had last seen the legion again nelson paused then seemed to cross whatever rubicon of loyalty had been restraining him and walked to adams side the generals here he said placing a finger on the banks of the rapidan river to the west of the road going north from gordonsville to culpeper court house they fought against general banks up herenelsons finger moved up the culpeper roadthen they went back again i guess theyre just waiting for what for the north to attack dont know sir but on my way here sir i saw ever so many troops marching north i reckon therell be fighting soon adam stared at the map hows my friend starbuck he asked half ironically yet also interested in the fate of the man who had once been his closest friend thats why the general sent me here sir nelson said mysteriously and then when adam frowned in puzzlement the servant gestured across the study to where a flag lay draped across the generals desk mr starbuck captured that flag sir from the yankees the general took it from mr starbuck and made me bring it back here to be kept safe its a pennsylvania flag sir adam crossed the study and picked up the powderstained scorched bullettorn flag of purple cloth he smoothed out the embroidered eagle with its long talons above the german motto gott und die vereinigten staaten god and the united states adam murmured aloud and the sight of the captured northern banner gave him a sudden and exciting idea he went back to the map and asked nelson to describe the faulconer brigades deployment and as he listened adam found his idea becoming ever more practicable he was remembering the reverend elial starbucks fervent wish to be presented with a rebel battle flag and adam suddenly saw how he might be able to fulfill that desire for the moment however he contented himself with confiscating the pennsylvanian banner ill return it to its rightful owners he told nelson but first i should visit mother and your sister nelson said shes upstairs too but dont be long master young john can ride fast i wont be long outside the study window sergeant huxtables men were busy saddling their wonderful new horses adam smiled at the sight then crossed to the study door god willing he thought those horses would carry him to a coup that would make the north ring with triumph and the south cringe with shame then his mothers bell clanging loud he climbed the stairs and nerved himself for combat by sunset dead marys ford was properly protected at the edge of the woodland starbuck had dug a line of fifteen rifle pits that were invisible from the rivers far bank the red excavated earth had all been thrown back into the undergrowth and the pits parapets disguised with brush and dead logs so that if an enemy did try to cross the river they would be met with a blast of rifle fire from an apparently deserted tree line the advance picket was hidden inside silass ruined house where four men could keep a close watch on the far woods but the majority of starbucks men were bivouacked two hundred yards behind the rifle pits there they had made their encampment and there they would wait in case they were needed to reinforce the men serving their turn of duty in the ruins or in the rifle pits colonel swynyard approved all he saw have you sent anyone over the river he asked sergeant truslow starbuck called and truslow came and told the colonel what he had found on the far bank nothing truslow said he spat tobacco juice hitched his pants higher then told how he had led a dozen men up the far track until the trees ended thats a fair ways bout a long mile beyond thats a farm family called kemp lived there but theyre gone he spat again yankee lovers he explained both his expectoration and the absence of the kemp family saw a neighbor at the farm she lives another halfmile north and says she aint seen a live yankee in weeks so youre probably in for a restful time captain swynyard said did you consider putting pickets on the far bank id rather not starbuck said i dont want anyone shooting one of our own men by mistake i told the woman at the kemp farm to stay away from the river truslow said and the captain said the same to the old nigger but a sentry post a hundred yards up that track would give you more time to rouse your reserves swynyard pointed out truslow answered for his captain i laid a dozen felled trees over the track colonel there aint a yankee born who can come down that road without waking the dead swynyard nodded his approval then turned and gazed westward where another track followed the riverbank where does that lead he asked to lieutenant davies and twelve men starbuck answered theres a ruined barn just out of sight thats our western picket you seem to have thought of everything swynyard said approvingly including i hope the need to provide me with supper and after that captain youll doubtless allow me to lead a small prayer group for those men who care about their souls starbuck shrugged were pretty short of food colonel not that you aint welcome but suppers nothing but rough rice stewed squirrel and pea coffee if youre lucky but im staying here he wanted to see the night fall across the river so he would know what to expect when he took the late sentry watch dont get too tired swynyard advised then he strode back to where the cooking fires sifted their smoke into the leaves starbuck stayed at the tree line and watched as darkness fell and as the moon climbed above the far trees to silver the shallow water hurrying across its gravel bed he walked along the rifle pits and was filled with pride because this was his first independent command if a yankee cavalry patrol should come south and prove foolish enough to force its way past the felled trees then starbuck would fight his very own battle and if he recognized the truth he wanted to fight that battle because he knew he would win he would turn the silver ford bloody and add a pack of yankee ghosts to join the unquiet spirit of poor dead mary the river ran quick the moon threw black shadows and starbuck prayed that god would send him his own his very own small battle there were times when general washington faulconer needed to leave the problems of the brigade behind him such times he said gave him an opportunity to assess his brigade from what he called the distant perspective though most of his officers suspected that the distant perspective merely served to relieve the generals distaste for the discomforts of campaigning washington faulconer had been raised to luxury and had never lost his taste for cosseted living and a month of bivouacs and army food inevitably drove him to discover a hotel where clean sheets were smoothed onto a properly stuffed mattress where hot water was available at the pull of a bell rope and where the food was not hardtack wormridden or rancid the general even believed he deserved such trifling luxuries for had he not raised the legion with his own money other men had marched enthusiastically to war but washington faulconer had added an open wallet to mere enthusiasm indeed few men in all the confederacy had spent as much on a regiment as washington faulconer so why should he not reward himself with a few civilized trappings from time to time thus when his brigade was properly settled into its bivouac on the western flank of jacksons army general faulconer soon found reason to visit gordonsville for a night of comfort he was not supposed to leave his brigade without general jacksons permission but in the certain knowledge that such permission would not be forthcoming faulconer found his own justification i need spectacles he told swynyard airily cant see the fine detail on maps these days and upon that medical excuse he mounted his horse and with captain moxey in attendance rode eastward the town was barely three hours ride away so the dereliction was hardly serious and swynyard had been left with the strictest instructions that nothing was to be done without faulconers permission and that if any emergency did arise a messenger must be sent to gordonsville immediately the general considered that even a fool could understand those simple commands and swynyard in the generals opinion was a fool the man had made an idiot of himself with the bottle but was now making himself an even more conspicuous idiot with his ludicrous addiction to the holy spirit the generals own spirits began to soar the moment he rode away from the encampment he always felt such an elation when he could leave behind the smallminded irritations of the brigade where nothing was ever straightforward and where the simplest order provoked a flurry of queries obstructions misunderstandings and even downright disobedience and the more he pondered those frustrations the more convinced he became that the root cause of all his problems lay in the hostility of men like thaddeus bird colonel swynyard and nathaniel starbuck especially captain nathaniel starbuck take the simple matter of the crescent patches it had been no small achievement to have the cloth badges made for such furbelows were a luxury in the warstraitened confederacy yet faulconer had succeeded in having the insignia manufactured in france and then smuggled into wilmington on a swift blockaderunner the cost of the badges alone demanded respect and certainly the proposed function of the badges was admirable for the red crescent had been intended both to foster pride in the faulconer brigade and to serve as an identification mark in the smoky chaos of battle yet what had happened grinning soldiers had employed the patches for gambling counters or given them to girlfriends others had cleaned their rifles with the badges or else used them to patch the seat of their pants an insult that had driven the general to decree severe punishment for any man not displaying the red crescent insignia on his uniform jacket whereupon there had been a religious outcry against the wearing of a mohammedan symbol in a christian country letters had been written to hometown newspapers prayer meetings were held to intercede for washington faulconers heathen soul and seven army chaplains had carried their protests to the war department itself forcing faulconer to explain that the crescent moon was not intended to be a religious symbol but was merely a part of his familys escutcheon yet that explanation had only prompted new complaints about the restoration of aristocratic privileges in america the campaign against the insignia had been an outrageous farrago of lies and now the cause was utterly lost because any man who objected to wearing the red crescent could plausibly claim to have lost the badge in battle which all meant that washington faulconer had little choice but to accept defeata defeat made all the more odious because he was convinced it had been nathaniel starbuck who had orchestrated the whole controversy only starbuck could have dreamed up the religious objection or have invented the fantastic claim that wearing the patch reduced the brigade to the level of european serfs yet even the memory of that humiliation receded as washington faulconer rode the summer roads toward gordonsville he was contemplating the pleasures of a long bath a clean bed and a full table and the anticipation was more than rewarded when he entered the public parlor of the rapidan house hotel to be surprised by the presence of four old friends from richmond whose visit to the town happily coincided with his own two of the men were confederate congressmen and the other two like faulconer himself were directors of the orange and alexandria railroad the four men formed a commission that was supposed to be reporting to the war department on how the armys supply system could be improved but so far not one of the four commissioners had ventured further than the house of assignation that lay next door to the hotel happily all four men had read and admired the account in the richmond examiner that had described how the faulconer brigade had captured an enemy color at the recent battle and now they insisted that the general and his aide join them and recount their version of the triumph faulconer told the story modestly claiming to have been momentarily unsighted when the enemy standard fell though the modesty was beautifully calculated to encourage his listeners to draw the very opposite conclusion the standardbearer was a great brute of a german aint that so mox the general appealed for his aides confirmation he was indeed sir moxey said and i was damned glad you were there to deal with the fellow and not me the fellow took a halfdozen bulletsthe general lightly touched the ivory handle of his revolverand still he kept on coming some of these northern fellows are remarkably brave but of course theres not one of the rogues who can compare with our fine boys and here the general paid a moving tribute to the southern soldier describing him as the salt of the earth a rough diamond and an honest warrior each compliment being accompanied by a toast so that it was soon necessary to order another bottle of whiskey not that its very good whiskey one of the congressman said but even the worst is better than water like the nymphs du monde next door his fellow politician opined gordonsvilles whores are hardly enticing but even the worst is preferable to a wife all six men laughed if youve nothing more pressing one of the railroad men said to faulconer maybe youd like to saddle one or two of the ladies yourself i should be delighted faulconer said it shall be our pleasure to pay the other director said then courteously included captain moxey in the invitation myself i fancy the mulatto girl tonight the fatter of the two congressmen said as he poured himself another glass of whiskey and wed better enjoy ourselves this evening because tomorrow well all have to look busy cant have bobby lee thinking were idle lee faulconer asked hiding his consternation is lee here arrives tomorrow one of the railroad men said train was ordered this morning not that any of us are supposed to know who the trains for the other railroad man said yawning but its true lees coming to take command what do you make of lee faulconer one of the congressmen asked casually hardly know the man the general said which was a transparent evasion for the faulconer family was as prominent in virginian society as the lees and washington faulconer had been acquainted with robert lee almost all his life yet even so faulconer found himself puzzled by lees present eminence lee had started the war with a considerable reputation but nothing he had achieved since had justified that good standing yet with an apparent effortlessness that faulconer could only admire lee had risen to command the army of northern virginia faulconers only explanation for this phenomenon was that the leaders of the confederacy were deceived by lees grave demeanor into believing that deep thoughts were being pondered behind the generals calm and trustworthy eyes but he could hardly confess as much to two of those leaders i worry hes too cautious faulconer said instead though of course caution may be the right tactic to follow at the moment let the enemy come to us you mean the fatter congressman suggested for the moment yes faulconer said because theres little point in maneuvering ourselves into trouble let them break themselves on our bastions eh he smiled sounding confident but inside he was worrying that if lee was arriving in gordonsville next day then the town would surely be filled with highranking confederate officers who would look askance when they discovered faulconer was absent from his brigade without permission and the very last thing washington faulconer needed was the enmity of stonewall jackson jackson was already suspicious of faulconer because of his tardiness in joining the counterattack at cedar mountain though happily the capture of the enemy color had gone a long way toward preserving faulconers reputation but even so jackson could prove a powerful enemy especially as the richmond examiner was as supportive of stonewall as it was of washington faulconer all in all faulconer decided this was a moment for a tactical withdrawal i think this news means that we should get back to camp tonight mox faulconer said as he turned to his aide if lees coming therell doubtless be orders for us and we need to be ready captain moxey concealed his surprise at so sudden a departure and his disappointment at being denied the pleasures of the house of assignation next door ill order the horses sir moxey said and when the tired beasts were saddled the two officers without so much as taking a bath let alone partaking of the towns more exquisite recreations retraced their steps west into the twilight back at the hotel one of the congressmen remarked that the country was fortunate indeed in having men as devoted and disciplined as washington faulconer at its service and his three colleagues solemnly agreed before heaving themselves out of their chairs and ushering each other into the house next door it was black dark by the time washington faulconer reached the farm that was his brigades headquarters colonel swynyard was still awake sitting in candlelight beneath the crossed banners of the faulconer legion as he struggled to reconcile the brigades muddled accounts he stood as faulconer came in hid his surprise at the generals sudden return and offered a report on the days happenings two men had been arrested for drunkenness at mccombs tavern and were waiting for punishment in the morning i thought i put the tavern out of bounds faulconer said stretching out his right leg so moxey could tug off a riding boot so you did sir swynyard confirmed but you cant keep a rogue away from his liquor is that what you were going to say colonel faulconer asked nastily i was going to say sir that mccomb keeps a pair of whores and plenty of men will risk punishment for that mccomb keeps women faulconer growled then have the filthy creatures arrested goddamn it i dont want half the brigade felled by pox he lit a cigar and half listened as swynyard went on with his report but while appearing to pay attention faulconer was really thinking just how much he disliked this new manifestation of swynyards idiocy the old drunken swynyard had been largely invisible an embarrassment to be sure but a predictable embarrassment and a small price to pay for the support of his cousin the editor of the richmond examiner yet the new swynyard was a man who flaunted his morality with an assiduity that faulconer found grating where swynyard had once been oblivious of the brigades affairs he was now endlessly busy and endless too in bringing complaints and suggestions to faulconers attention tonight there was a problem with a consignment of percussion caps from the richmond arsenal at least half of the caps had proved defective then send the damn things back faulconer snapped i need your signature swynyard pointed out cant you forge it i can but would rather not damn your scruples give it to me then faulconer said and sadly there were three more desertions sir swynyard said placing the deserters report sheets beside the document needing the generals signature swynyards hand shook not from nerves but because sobriety had still not wholly calmed his alcoholravaged body who ran faulconer asked in a dangerous voice he hated desertions translating the crime as a criticism of his leadership two are haxalls men swynyard said referring to the arkansas battalion and haxall suspects theyre making for home and the third is one of the new men from richmond who reckons his wife is cheating on him hes the same fellow who ran two weeks ago so catch the bastard again and this time shoot him faulconer said slapping at a moth that annoyed him and how the hell did they run arent the pickets awake all three were part of a work party carrying ammunition to starbucks position sir swynyard said faulconer pulled his left boot back from moxeys grasp then looked up at the scarred bearded colonel explain faulconer said in a very menacing voice swynyard was well aware that the mention of starbucks name put him in a risky position but the colonel possessed both the courage of his military convictions and the strength of his newfound faith and so he confidently explained the discovery of the unsuspected ford and told how starbuck had suggested garrisoning the river crossing i gave him three companies sir and inspected him at dusk hes well entrenched and cant be outflanked goddamn it faulconer shouted thumping the table beside his chair what orders did i give you he paused but he was not waiting for any answer indeed the general could not have listened to any answer for all the frustrations of his last few months had swollen into an abrupt explosion that was now unstoppable like a volcanos molten core that had been cribbed too long by a cap of cold hard rock faulconers temper erupted into an incandescent rage that had nothing whatever to do with the point at issue indeed had swynyard merely told faulconer that an unguarded ford had been discovered on the brigades open flank then the general would doubtless have ordered two or three companies of riflemen to watch the crossing but the mention of starbucks name had tipped washington faulconer into instant fury for a few seconds it was a fury so profound that faulconer was incapable of speaking but then the words flowed and soldiers fifty yards from the farmhouse listened in awe while men bivouacked further away hurried closer to hear the diatribe swynyard faulconer said was a shadbellied weakling who if he was not sucking at his goddamned bottle was clasped to the tit of his new religion for christs sake you fool stand on your own goddamned feet this was unfair for the apparent point of faulconers rage was that swynyard had dared to take responsibility for moving part of the brigade without faulconers express permission but for these first few moments the flow of whitehot anger was not directed but simply went wherever faulconers frustrations let it fly and so the generals anger encompassed swynyards breeding his ugly appearance and his familys involvement in the slave trade then washington faulconer raked over swynyards apparent conversion scorning the colonels piety as fraudulent and his newfound efficiency as a pose it was a spectacular explosion washington faulconer was already feeling cheated because his stay in gordonsville had been cut short but now all the bitterness over his traitor son and his resentments over starbuck and the mulish manner in which the brigade reacted to his simplest orders fed the bitter torrent two decades of being despised by his wife and scorned by his wifes damned schoolmaster brother poured in an ugly spew from faulconers mouth as he screamed his insults at swynyard and finally when breathlessness alone made him drop his voice from a half scream into mere loudness he suspended swynyard from his duties you will consider yourself under arrest the general finished there was silence in the room moxey his face white with fear stood backed against the flags on the wall while not a sound came from the astonished audience outside the tic in swynyards cheek had begun to quiver and he was clenching and unclenching his maimed left hand but when at last he spoke he used the mildest tone i have to protest sir he began you can protest all you like damn you but itll do no good ive endured too much too much youre either drunk or praying either flat on your back or down on your knees and in either position youre no more damned good to me than a spavined bitch youre under arrest swynyard so get the hell out of my sight go faulconer shouted the order unable to bear the sight of the man for one instant longer then he stumped onebooted onto the veranda major hinton he shouted into the dark confident that the summons would be passed on and obeyed swiftly major hinton come here the general at last was taking command starbuck took his supper in the bivouac sitting beside a small fire with truslow and coffman the night was warm and humid darkening every moment as clouds heaped higher and higher above the blue ridge mountains for a time the moon silvered the trees then the clouds misted and finally shrouded its light supper was a piece of corn bread and fat bacon the corn had been badly milled and starbuck broke a tooth on a scrap of cob embedded in the grain he swore dentists favorite bread truslow said as starbuck spat out the cob and tooth fragment together then the sergeant offered a ghastly grin to show how many of his own teeth were missing pulled half of them myself the rest old mcilvanney yanked he was a welldigger who doubled up as a dentist starbuck flinched with pain when he took his next bite i dont know why god invented teeth he said i dont know why god invented yankees truslow added because otherwise thered only be indians and mexicans for christians to shoot lieutenant coffman unexpectedly observed i know why god invented junior lieutenants truslow observed for target practice he climbed to his feet stretched his arms and picked up his rifle in readiness to relieve the pickets in the rifle pits above the river i wish it would rain he said starbuck led the relief party through the trees to where the river flickered white in the night the far bank was utterly black and impenetrable its only lights the tiny white and evanescent sparks of fireflies then to the west where the clouds were building a spike of lightning shattered the dark above the mountains and shed a sudden bluewhite light that silhouetted the halfruined barn where the outlying picket guarded the riverside track sergeant mallory was now in charge of that picket and he sent edward hunt back along the riverbank to find starbuck captain captain hunt called what is it bob reckons theres some son of a bitch on the track captain starbuck climbed to his feet truslow he called im down at the barn a grunt acknowledged the information then starbuck followed hunt along the river it was that lightning hunt explained you saw the man man and a horse hunt said cheerfully plain as a pair of planks starbuck was skeptical he had learned in the last year just how deceptive the night could be a bush that would not attract a second glance in daylight could be transformed by darkness into a monstrous threat a herd of cows could be changed into a rampaging troop of enemy cavalry while just as easily a whole battalion of enemy troops could resemble a field of standing corn night fed the imagination and the imagination feared enemies or craved security and made the dark fit its desires now starbuck groped his way to where the picket was positioned behind the barns broken wall sergeant mallory was nervous theres someone out there sir he said we all saw him starbuck could see nothing except the darkness and the slight quivering sheen of the river did you challenge he asked no sir mallory answered starbuck placed his rifle on the makeshift parapet then cupped his hands who goes there he shouted as loud as he could nothing answered except the small stir of the wind and the sound of the river running we saw something sir mallory insisted we did sir truly one of the men put in are you sure it isnt the old black fellow starbuck asked this was a man and a horse sir mallory said starbuck challenged again and again received no reply maybe they got the hell out of here starbuck suggested and just as he spoke the far mountain range was raked with another stab of forked lightning the streaks slashing down to silhouette the treelined crests with fire but closer much closer the splinter of light touched a figure standing beside a horse not fifty paces awayor so it seemed to starbuck who had but a second to focus his eyes and make sense of the sudden stark contrasts of white nightfire and pitchblack dark who are you he shouted as the light faded leaving nothing behind but an imprinted image on his retinas that seemed to suggest that the man was wearing a saber scabbard and carrying a carbine no one answered starbuck cocked his rifle taking satisfaction from the solid heft of the springloaded hammer he felt with a finger to make certain a percussion cap was in place then pointed the gun just above where he thought the man was standing he pulled the trigger the explosion rebounded across the river valley echoing back from the trees on the far bank then fading like the crackle of the thunder in the distant mountains the muzzle flash lit a few square yards of ground beyond the barn but could not reach as far as the solitary silent unmoving man whom starbuck was now certain he had glimpsed in the lightnings glare hoofbeats sir mallory said excitedly hear them and sure enough the sound of horses hooves and the jingling of curb chains sounded above the endless river noise cavalry coming starbuck shouted to warn the men in the rifle pits behind he began to reload his rifle as mallorys picket slid their guns across the wall well give the bastards a volley starbuck said then checked his words because the hoofbeats were not coming from the west but from behind him from the direction of the brigades lines he turned to see a light moving among the trees above the ford and after a few seconds he saw that the light was a lantern being carried by a horseman starbuck the horseman shouted it was major hinton starbuck stand down starbuck told the picket major a second horseman appeared from the trees starbuck the newcomer shouted and in the lanterns light starbuck saw it was general washington faulconer who had shouted moxeys ratlike face appeared next then the three horsemen cantered down into the open ground beside the ruins of mad silass cabin starbuck faulconer shouted again sir starbuck shouldered his halfloaded rifle and walked to meet his brigade commander faulconers horse was nervous of the distant storm and edged sideways as a volley of thunder roared in the mountains faulconer gave the beast a hard cut with his riding crop i gave orders mr starbuck that no changes of disposition were to be made without my express permission you disobeyed those orders sir major hinton protested wanting to point out that starbuck had only been obeying swynyards instructions hinton himself had been busy at a neighboring brigades courtmartial all day else he would have reinforced colonel swynyards instructions himself captain starbuck received orders sir hinton began quiet faulconer rounded on hinton there is a conspiracy major hinton to subvert authority in this brigade that conspiracy is now at an end major hinton you will take these three companies back to the legions lines immediately captain moxey you will escort starbuck to headquarters you are under arrest mr starbuck sir starbuck began his own protest quiet faulconer shouted his horse pricked its ears back and tossed its head theres a horseman down the path starbuck tried again i said quiet faulconer shouted i do not give a damn mr starbuck if the archangel gabriel is on the goddamned path you have disobeyed my orders and you are now under arrest give that rifle to major hinton and follow captain moxey faulconer waited for starbuck to obey but the northerner remained stubbornly motionless or do you intend to disobey those orders too faulconer asked and underscored his implied threat by unbuttoning the flap of his revolvers holster truslow and coffman their faces dim in the lanterns small light watched from the tree line starbuck felt an insane urge to fight faulconer but then paul hinton leaned down from his saddle and took starbucks rifle away its all right nate he murmured soothingly it is not all right faulconer was exultant his evening which had begun so ill with his precipitate flight from gordonsville had turned into a triumph discipline is the first requisite of a soldier major faulconer went on and starbucks insolence has corrupted this regiment therell be no more of it by god none there are going to be changes lightning ripped the west shattering the night over the mountains and its sudden light betrayed the blissful happiness on washington faulconers face he had confronted his enemies and he had routed them both and the general for the first time since he had donned his countrys uniform felt like a soldier triumphant and starbuck was under arrest starbuck was put into colonel swynyards tent an embarrassed private from a company stood guard outside while inside the tent starbuck discovered swynyard sitting slumped on his camp bed and cradling what starbuck supposed was a bible a wax taper burned on a folding table to shed a sickly and wan light the colonels head was bowed so that his hair fell lank across his bony face starbuck sat at the other end of the bed and announced his presence with an oath a contagion swynyard responded mysteriously without offering any more formal greeting to his fellow prisoner thats what i am starbuck a contagion a contamination an infection a plague unclean out of step do you ever feel out of step with all mankind the colonel raised his head as he asked the question his eyes were red i tell you starbuck that the world would be a better place without me starbuck alarmed at the wild words looked more closely at the object in the colonels hands he had presumed it was a bible and now feared to see a revolver but instead he saw it was an uncorked bottle oh no starbuck said astonished at his own disappointment are you getting drunk swynyard did not answer he just stared at the bottle turning it in his hands as though he had never seen such an object before what did faulconer say to you the colonel asked finally nothing much starbuck said using a tone of indifference to show defiance he said id disobeyed orders you obeyed my orders but that wont make any difference with faulconer he hates you he hates me too but he hates you more he thinks you took his son away the colonel went on staring at the bottle then shook his head wearily im not drinking i took a sip and spat it out but i was going to drink it then you came in he held the bottle close to the dripping spluttering taper so that the feeble light refracted through the green glass and amber liquid faulconer gave it to me he says i deserve it its the best whiskey in america he says from bourbon county kentucky none of your busthead tonight starbuck no rotgut or popskull no redline special no brainbuster no skullsplitter no tanglefoot tonight the mention of tanglefoot whiskey evidently prompted some memory that made the colonel close his eyes in sudden pain no sir he went on sadly only the best of bourbon county whiskey for griffin swynyard clear as a dewdrop do you see he again held the bottle to the tapers light isnt that beautiful you dont need it colonel starbuck said softly but i do starbuck i need either god or whiskey and whiskey i have to tell you is a great deal more convenient than god it is more available than god and it is more predictable than god whiskey starbuck does not make demands like god and the salvation it offers is every bit as certain as gods and even if that salvation is not as long in duration as gods salvation it is still a true and tried remedy for the miseries of life whiskey is a consolation starbuck and a very present help in times of trouble and never more so than when it comes from bourbon county kentucky he swirled the bottle slowly gazing reverently at its contents are you going to preach to me starbuck no sir ive been preached at all my damned life and it didnt do neither me nor the preacher one damned bit of good swynyard lifted the bottle to his nose and sniffed he closed his eyes at the smell of the liquor then touched the bottles rim to his lips for a second starbuck was sure that the colonel was going to tip the whiskey down his throat then swynyard lowered the bottle again i guess preaching didnt do you any good starbuck because youre a preachers son probably hurt you rather than helped if a man tells you all your born days to keep away from the women and the whiskey then what else will you look for when they let go of the leash is that why you looked for them starbuck asked the colonel shook his head my father was no preacher he went to church sure but he was no preacher he was a dealer in slaves starbuck thats what it said on our housefront said it in scarlet letters three feet high jos swynyard dealer in slaves the colonel shrugged at the memory respectable people didnt come near us starbuck not near a dealer in slaves they sent their overseers and managers to buy the human flesh not that my father minded he reckoned he was as respectable as any man in charles city county he kept a respectable household ill say that for him none of us dared cross him he was a flogger you see he flogged his slaves his women and his children swynyard went silent staring down at the bottle the sentry shifted his feet outside the tent and pots clattered in the farmhouse kitchen as the servants cleaned up after washington faulconers late supper swynyard shook his head sadly i treated my slaves bad yes you did starbuck said but he never flogged his dogs swynyard was thinking of his father again never once not in all his years he smiled ruefully then lifted the bottle to his nose and smelt it again it really aint a bad kind of whiskey judging by its smell he said have you ever drunk scottish whiskey once or twice me too swynyard was silent for a few heartbeats i reckon i drunk just about everything a man can pour down his throat but i once knew a man who called himself a connoisseur of whiskeys a real connoisseurswynyard rolled the word round his tongueand this connoisseur told me there wasnt nothing in the whole wide world he didnt know about whiskeys and do you know which whiskey he reckoned was the best tanglefoot starbuck guessed swynyard laughed tanglefoot well it works ill say that for tanglefoot it works like a mule kick to the head tanglefoot does but it aint the best liquor in the world not if you want your mule kick to taste better than horse liniment no this man reckoned hed drunk every kind of whiskey that this vale of tears has to offer us and the best the very best the absolute real stuff starbuck was whiskey from ireland aint that the strangest thing maybe he was drunk when he tasted it starbuck suggested swynyard thought about that for a second then shook his head no i reckon he knew what he was saying he was a rich man and rich folks dont get rich by being fools at least they might but they sure dont stay rich by being fools and this man stayed rich and he didnt drink much either he just liked the taste you see he liked his whiskey and hed pay a rich mans price for irish whiskey but the guzzle he liked most of all was the widows champagne clicquot he raised the whiskey bottle in a tribute to madame clicquots champagne have you ever drunk veuve clicquot yes good for you be a sad thing to die without tasting the widows champagne but sadder still to die without salvation eh swynyard asked but he seemed confused by the question he stared at the bottle and again seemed about to drink from it then at the very last second relented there was a time starbuck when i could afford the widows champagne morning noon and night could have watered my horse in it could have watered all my horses in it i was rich starbuck smiled but said nothing you dont believe me do you swynyard said but there was a time starbuck when i could have purchased faulconer truly truly swynyard said gently mocking starbucks accent with the repetition i wasnt always a soldier i left west point class of fortysixth in my class you want to guess how many there were in west points class of fortysix swynyard extended a pistollike finger at starbuck and made a clicking noise of affirmation fortysixth out of fortysix i didnt exactly distinguish myself fact is twenty years later i was still no more than a captain and i knew i wasnt going to rise any higher than a captain and i wasnt ever going to kill anything more dangerous to the republic than a comanche or a mexican i always reckoned i might be a good soldier but the whiskey made sure i never was then one night in i got drunk and offered my resignation and that was the end of my career what did you do i did what every sensible soldier wanted to do i went to the feather river ever heard of the feather no california swynyard said the gold fields feather river and goodyears bar and three snake run thats where i struck it rich i found a lump of gold the size of a dog gold the colonel said staring into the heart of the whiskey real thick gold soft as butter pure as love and big as a coon dog in just one day starbuck i made thirty thousand bucks and all of it before breakfast that was before they made golddigging mechanical nowadays starbuck they sluice that gold out of the gravels with water jets that water flies so hard you could kill a regiment of yankees with that hose except it takes a regiment to build all the flumes and dams and not even the yankees are stupid enough to stand still while you construct it but i was lucky i got there early when all a man had to do was climb high and start rolling the rocks aside he fell silent and you lost it all swynyard nodded every last cent of it it all went down the gullet or across the barrelhead poker women whiskey stupidity i lost these fingers too he held up his left hand with its three missing fingers i thought those went to a mexican saber cut starbuck said thats what i tell people swynyard said or what i did tell them before i met the lord jesus christ but it aint true the truth is starbuck that i had them blown away when me and a german miner were using black powder up above shirt tail creek otto his name was and he was mad as a snake he reckoned there was a load of nuggets at the top of shirt tail and it took us a week to carry all our gear up there and then we blew the thing wide open and there wasnt nothing up there but dirt and quartz only otto blew it early see thinking hed blow me to hell and get to keep all the gold to himself and what happened to otto starbuck asked gently swynyard blinked rapidly his hands were gripping the whiskey bottle so hard that starbuck feared he might break the glass i have many sins on my conscience swynyard said after a while many i killed otto took a long time adying and i mocked him all that while god forgive me starbuck waited a few seconds praying desperately that the colonel would not suck on the bottle and when the war started starbuck finally asked i came back east reckoned i could have a new beginning i kind of persuaded myself i could do without the whiskey so long as i could be a proper soldier again i wanted to redeem myself you see a new country a new army a new beginning but i was wrong no starbuck said you werent youve been off the whiskey for days now swynyard did not answer but just stared into the golden depths of the expensive kentucky whiskey you dont want it colonel starbuck said but i do starbuck and thats the plain hard truth of it i want a drink so bad that it hurts put the bottle down starbuck said swynyard ignored him i never thought i could give up the drink never and then god helps me to do it at last and just as things are starting to be all right again faulconer does this to us what was i supposed to do leave the ford unguarded colonel starbuck said reaching for the whiskey bottle you did the right thing you know that and do you know why faulconer gave you that bottle tonight swynyard would not relinquish the whiskey but instead held the bottle just beyond starbucks reach he gave it to me the colonel said because he wants to humiliate me thats why no starbuck said he did it so you wont be in a fit state to testify at a courtmartial he wants you drunk colonel because the son of a bitch knows hes in the wrong but he also knows that no court will exonerate a staggering drunkard but if you stay sober colonel hes going to back down and there wont be any courtmartial swynyard thought about starbucks words then shook his head but i did disobey his orders not that it matters because faulconer dont care one way or another about dead marys ford he just wants to be rid of me dont you understand it isnt what i did or didnt do its because i made an enemy you too were being pursewhipped by a rich man starbuck and there aint nothing we can do about it goddamn it there is starbuck insisted faulconer doesnt run this damned army jackson does and if jackson says youre right and faulconers wrong then it wont matter if you and i disobeyed george washingtons orders not all of faulconers money can change that but i tell you one thing if you go in front of old mad jack with a hangover or with whiskey on your breath or looking like you used to look before you let christ into your heart then old mad jack will have you out of this army faster than you can spit starbuck paused and held out his hand now goddamn it colonel give me the whiskey swynyard frowned why would jackson care what happens to us because well make him care well tell him the truth so give me the bottle he still held his hand outstretched come on im thirsty swynyard held the bottle out but instead of handing it to starbuck he tipped it upside down so that the liquor gurgled and slurped onto the tents pine floorboards and there trickled between the cracks into the dirt when the bottle was empty swynyard let it fall weve got a battle to fight starbuck the colonel said so lets both be sober son of a bitch starbuck said the smell of the whiskey was tantalizing in the tent i was thirsty and tomorrow youll be sober swynyard said far in the distance the thunder grumbled the sentry sneezed and the colonel closed his eyes in prayer he had resisted temptation and endured despair and now like the soldier he knew he could be he would fight mad silas began pulling the felled trees off the road that led north through the woods it was hard work especially as he had his darling marys skull in a sack hanging from his neck and he did not like to bump the skull too hard in case it hurt her he talked to her as he worked saying how he was keeping the road clear because the man in the blue coat had asked him to and the man in the blue coat had said as how all the black folk would be better off if the blue ones beat the gray ones and even though the white men in the gray coats had been polite to mad silas and had even given him some cigars he still believed the blue horse soldier because the blue man had been young master harlan kemp the son of old master kemp who had given silas his freedom by first light silas had cleared the whole path then very cautiously he crept down to the riverbank and saw to his surprise that the gray soldiers were all gone their fires had cooled to ashes and their rifle pits were empty he clutched the scorched skull in his arms and debated with it what the soldiers absence might mean but he could not really make any sense of it yet their absence made him feel safe again and so he put his mary back in the hole in the ruined chimney breast where she now lived then glad to be home with her he walked down beside the river past the ruined barn to the tree and bush that at night looked so like a man and a horse he had a snare here set to trap rabbits going down to the river then just as he was parting the leaves of the bush he heard the hoofbeats he rolled down the bank into the long grass and lay very still the sun was not yet up so the light was gray and flat and the river water had no sparkle yet silas could clearly see the far bank and after a time he saw the men appear there they were white men in blue coats there were three of them each on foot and each carrying a long rifle a saber and a revolver they spent a long time staring across the river then one of them ran through the ford splashing the water high with his long boots and bright spurs silas lost sight of that man but after a minute or two the man called back over the river the bastards were here right enough major but theyve gone then a whole column of blue horse soldiers appeared at the ford their spurs scabbards and curb chains jingled as they urged their horses through the river the three men who had scouted the ford seized their reins and heaved themselves up into their saddles silas watched them go out of sight then listened as their hoofbeats faded away to the south and then he went on listening until there was nothing more to hear but the run of the river and the song of the birds then with a dead rabbit in his hand he went back to tell his mary just what excitements were happening at her ford this morning while far to the south unsuspected and unseen the yankee raiders went to ground and waited the yankees spring offensive might have failed stranding mcclellans army of the potomac on the muddy shore of the james river below richmond but now john popes army of virginia gathered its strength in virginias northern counties more and more supplies crossed the potomacs bridges to be piled high in the gaunt warehouses at manassas junction while on the sunruffled water of virginias tidal rivers boat after boat carried mcclellans veterans north from the james river to aquia creek on the potomac the two northern armies were joining forces and though that process of union was excruciatingly slow once the army of virginia and the army of the potomac were united then they would far outnumber robert lees rebel army of northern virginia so we have to strike first lee said in a murmur that was intended only for his own ears the general was staring northward in the dawn scrying his enemies from the high vantage point of clark mountain which lay on the southern bank of the rapidan river lees own veterans who had first stopped and then chased mcclellan away from richmond had all now come north to face popes threatened attack stonewall jackson had served to deter popes belligerence for the best part of a month but now the rebel army was once again united with robert lee at its head and so the time had come to drive pope back in utter defeat to which purpose lee had come to clark mountain he was surrounded by mounted aides but lee himself was on foot and using the back of his placid gray horse traveller as a rest for his telescope the morning light was pearly soft great swathes of rain smoked across the western countryside but it was dry to the north where lee could see folds of hills small fields whitepainted farms long dark woods and everywhere he looked yankees the enemys whitehooded wagons filled the meadows their guns were parked on every road and farm track and their tents dotted the fields while above it all like strands of tenuous mist the smoke of their cooking fires mingled to make a bluegray haze in another ten days two weeks at the most that army would be doubled in size and lee knew there would be small chance of ever beating it out of his native virginia but now while mcclellans men still thumped north in their requisitioned river steamers and sleek transatlantic packets there was a chance of victory that chance arose because john pope had placed himself in a trap he had brought the bulk of his army close to the rapidan so that it was ready to strike south but behind popes new position ran the rapidans wide tributary the rappahannock and if lee could turn popes right flank he stood a chance of driving the northern army hard toward the rivers junction where pope would be trapped between a horde of screaming rebels and the deep fastrunning confluence of the two rivers but to make that maneuver lee needed cavalry to screen his march and still more cavalry to mislead the enemy and more cavalry still to ride into the enemys rear and capture the rappahannock bridges and thus give the yankees no way out from their waterbound slaughter yard general stuart says hes real sorry sir but the horses just aint ready an aide now told lee in the dawn on clark mountain lee nodded abruptly to show he had heard the gloomy report but otherwise he showed no reaction instead he stared for a long last moment at the encamped enemy lee was not a vengeful manindeed he had long learned to school his emotions to prevent passion from misleading common sensebut in the last few weeks he had contracted a deep desire to humiliate major general john pope the northern general had come to virginia and ordered his men to live off the land and to burn the houses of loyal virginians and lee despised such barbarism he more than despised it he hated it carrying war to civilians was the way of savages and heathens not of professional soldiers but if john pope chose to fight against women and children robert lee would fight against john pope and if god permitted it lee would ruin his enemys career but the spring to snap the traps lid shut was not quite ready and lee resisted the temptation to close that lid without the help of his horsemen how long before the cavalry will be ready lee asked the aide as he collapsed the telescope one day sir most of the rebel cavalry had only just come north from its duty of screening mcclellans army beyond richmond and the horses were bone tired after the long march on dry hard roads by tomorrows dawn lee sought the clarification the aide nodded general stuart says for certain sir lee showed no evident disappointment at the enforced delay but just stared at the long strands of smoke that laced the far woods and fields he felt a twinge of regret that he could not attack this morning but he knew it would take him the best part of a day to move his cumbersome guns and long lines of infantry over the rapidan and jeb stuarts horsemen would have to entertain and deceive the yankees while those men and cannon moved into position so he must wait one full day and hope that john pope did not wake to his danger well attack tomorrow lee said as he climbed onto travellers back and prayed that the yankees went on sleeping major galloway arrived just after dawn guided by corporal harlan kemp to where adams men waited in a stand of thick trees two miles south of the rapidan galloways troop was accompanied by captain billy blythe and his men who had returned from their frustrating reconnaissance blythe claimed the enemy held all the high passes through the blue ridge mountains and had thus prevented him from crossing into the shenandoah valley but galloways own foray beyond the rapidan had convinced him that the rebels were not using the shenandoah valley to threaten popes army instead their regiments were bivouacking all along the rapidans southern bank and it was there in the heart of virginia that the threat existed and it was there thanks to adams timely message that galloway could both strike at the enemy and establish a rakish hellraising reputation for his fledgling regiment of cavalry which was why all galloways sixtyeight troopers were now concealed in a thicket just three miles from the western flank of lees army sixtyeight men against an army sounded like long odds even to an optimist like galloway but he had surprise and the weather both on his side the weather had turned that same morning when just one hour after dawn a rainstorm had come from the mountains to hammer at the western rebel encampments the roads had been turned into instant red mud the rain poured off roofs and streamed down gutters and flooded gullies and overflowed ditches and spread along the plowed furrows of lowlying fields thunder bellowed overhead and sometimes way off in the rainsilvered distance a slash of lightning sliced groundward perfect galloway said as he stood at the edge of the trees and watched the rain claw and beat at the empty fields just perfect theres nothing like a good hard rain to keep a sentrys head down he crouched under his cloak to light a cigar then because his own horse needed rest asked to borrow one of adams newly acquired mares lets look at your fathers rebels he told adam galloway left blythe in charge of the concealed horsemen while he and adam rode east adam was concerned about the danger of major galloway making the reconnaissance in person but galloway dismissed the risks of capture if something goes amiss tonight then i dont want to think it was because of something i left undone the major said then rode in silence for a few moments before giving adam a shrewd look what happened between you and blythe adam taken aback by the question stammered an inadequate answer about incompatible personalities but major galloway was in no mood for evasions you accused him of attempted rape adam wondered how galloway knew then decided that either sergeant huxtable or corporal kemp must have complained about blythe i didnt accuse blythe of anything adam said i just stopped him from mistreating a woman if thats what you mean galloway sucked on what was left of his rainsoaked cigar he ducked under a low branch then checked his horse so he could search the rainsoaked land ahead billy tells me the woman was merely offering herself because she wanted northern dollars the major said when he was satisfied that no rebel picket waited in the far trees and because she wanted to save her house sergeant kelley told me the same thing theyre lying adam said indignantly galloway shrugged billys a good enough fellow adam i aint saying hes the straightest man as was ever born i mean he sure isnt no george washington but were a troop of soldiers not a passel of churchmen does that justify rape adam asked hell thats your tale adam not his galloway said tiredly and when it comes to telling tales then you should know that billys telling a few on you too the major was riding ahead of adam on a waterlogged path that ran beside a wood the rain had finally extinguished his cigar which he tossed into a puddle blythe claims youre a southern sympathizer a gray wolf in blue clothing in fact he says youre a spy galloway held up a hand dont protest adam i dont believe a word of it but what else do you expect him to say about a man accusing him of rape maybe he could tell the truth adam proclaimed indignantly the truth galloway barked a laugh at the very thought of such a notion the truth in war adam is whatever the winner decides it is and the best way for you to prove that blythe is a liar is to make some rebel heads bleed tonight major adam said firmly all my men saw that woman she didnt tear her own clothes blythe did and adam adam there was a note of pleading in galloways voice the major was a decent and honest man who had a vision of how his irregular regiment of horse could shorten this war and now that vision was being threatened by rancorous dissension within his ranks nor did galloway really want to believe adams accusations for the major liked blythe blythe made him laugh and enlivened his dull evenings and for those reasons as well as a desire to avoid confrontation galloway tried to find extenuating circumstances whos to say the woman didnt attack billy when he tried to burn the barn we dont know what happened but i do know that weve got a battle to fight and a war to win and were better employed fighting the enemy than each other now trust me ill keep an eye on billy that much i promise but i want you to leave him to me his behavior isnt your responsibility adam but mine you agree adam could hardly disagree with such a reasoned and earnest promise and so he nodded yes sir good man galloway said enthusiastically then slowed his horse as the two men approached the crest of a shallow rise their blue uniforms were smothered by black oilcloth cloaks that hung down to their boots but each knew their disguise would serve small purpose if they were intercepted by a rebel patrol yet the weather seemed to have damped down all rebel watchfulness for galloway and adam were able to spy out the positions of the faulconer brigade without any sentry or picket challenging their presence they mapped the legions turfcovered bivouacs which were studded with pyramids of stacked arms and sifted with the smoke of the few campfires that still struggled against the windblown rain then noted the substantial farmhouse standing among the tents that adam knew belonged to the faulconer brigades headquarters from time to time a soldier would run between the shelters or slouch dejectedly away from the farmhouse but otherwise the encampment appeared deserted further south still was a meadow where the brigades supply wagons were parked and where picketed horses stood in disconsolate rows adam showed galloway the whitepainted ammunition carts then trained his binoculars on some unfamiliar vehicles and saw that they belonged to an artillery battery that had camped alongside his fathers brigade how many sentries would you expect on the wagons galloway asked peering through his own binoculars theres usually a dozen men adam said but i can only see one there must be more sheltering in the wagons adam suggested i guess so which means the sumbitches wont see us coming galloway sounded enthused at the prospect of fighting he knew he could not seriously hurt jacksons armyindeed this nights attack would be but the feeblest of pinpricksbut galloway was not trying to cause grievous damage instead he was hoping to inflict on the south the same kind of insult that jeb stuart had thrust on the north when he had led his cavalry clean about mcclellans army few men had died in that ride but it had nevertheless made the north into the laughingstock of the whole world galloway now hoped to provide proof that northern horsemen could ride as defiantly and effectively as any southern cavalier adam was fighting a different battle a battle with his own conscience he had obeyed that stern conscience when he had abandoned the south to fight for the north but the logic of that choice meant not just fighting against fellow southerners but against his own father and a lifetime of love and filial obedience struggled against the inevitability of that logic yet he asked himself as he followed galloway further south along the woodland tracks what else had he expected when he crossed the lines and pledged his allegiance to the united states adam had agonized for months about the wars moral choices and at the end of all that worry and selfdoubt he had reached a certainty that was weakened only by the duty he owed to his father but this night under a rainlashed sky adam would cut that filial duty out of his life and so free himself to the higher duty of the nations union galloway stopped dismounted and again stared southward through his field glasses adam joined him and saw the major was examining a halfdozen cabins a plankwall church and a ramshackle twostory house that all stood around a small crossroads mccombs tavern galloway said reading the sign that was painted in tar on the house wall good licker clean beds and plenty food but bad spelling do you see any troops there not one off limits id guess galloway said he wiped the lenses of his field glasses stared a few seconds longer at the tavern then came back to where his horse was tethered and hauled himself into the saddle lets go by early afternoon the wind had died and the rain had settled into a persistent and dispiriting drizzle galloways men sat or lay under what small shelter they could find while their horses stood motionless between the trees the pickets watched from the edges of the wood but saw no movement in the late afternoon when the light was fading to a sullen leaden gloom galloway gave his last briefing describing what the troopers would find when they attacked and stressing that their main target was the park of supply wagons the rebels are always short of ammunition he said and of rifles so burn everything you can find galloway divided his force into three adams troop would serve as a screen between the raiders and the bulk of the faulconer brigade while galloways troop reinforced with half of blythes men would attack the supply wagons billy blythe would wait with the other half of his troop near mccombs tavern where they would serve as a rear guard to cover the raiders withdrawal itll all be over quickly galloway warned his men only as long as it takes the sumbitches to get over their surprise he had his bugler imitate the sound of the call that would order the retreat when you hear that played on a bugle boys you get the living hell out of there straight down the road to the crossroads where captain blythe will be waiting for us with a jigger of rebel whiskey for every last man jack of you blythe added and the nervous men laughed galloway opened his watch be another two hours before we leave boys so just be patient the day darkened toward evening the troopers clothes were clammy with a greasy sweaty dampness galloway had forbidden fires so that the smoke would not betray their presence and thus they simply had to endure the cloying dank as the minutes ticked by men prepared themselves obsessively for battle believing that every small degree of painstaking care counted toward survival they used cloaks and saddlecloths to keep the rain from their repeating rifles and revolvers as they loaded the weapons chambers with powder wadding and miniй bullets on top of each bullet they put a plug of grease that was intended to prevent the flame in the firing chamber communicating with the neighboring charges and so exploding the whole cylinder they sharpened their sabers the sound of the stones harsh on the curved steel those men whose blades rattled in their metal sheaths dented the scabbards so that the weapons were held tight and silent by the compressed metal corporal harlan kemp then led a score of men in prayer he put one knee on the wet ground one hand on the hilt of his sword and raised his free hand toward god as he prayed that the lord would bless this evenings work with a mighty success and keep his servants free from all harm from the enemy adam joined the circle of prayer he felt very close to his men as he knelt with them and the very act of praying imbued the nights action with a sacred quality that lifted it above mere adventure into the realm of duty i do not want to be here adam prayed silently but as i am here lord then be here with me and let me help this war to a quick and just ending when harlan kemps blessing was finished adam climbed to his feet and saw billy blythe standing beside the mare adam had taken from the faulconer stud blythe ran his hand down the mares legs then slapped her rump you got yourself some good horses faulconer blythe said as adam approached youre in my way adam said brusquely then pushed the tall blythe aside so he could throw a saddlecloth over the mares back real nice piece of horseflesh blythe peeled back the mares lips to examine her teeth then stood a pace away to give the horse an admiring look bet she runs like a bitch in heat specially with a touch of the whip dont you find the whip tickles a female up real nice faulconer blythe chuckled when adam made no answer reckon a horse like this would suit me real well he went on shes not for sale adam said coldly he heaved the saddle onto the mares back then stooped to gather the girth strap wasnt reckoning on buying her from you blythe said then spat a stream of tobacco spittle close to adams face because there aint no point in buying things in war not when they have a habit of dropping into a mans lap thats what i like about war faulconer the way things come without payment thats real convenient to my way of thinking i figure it takes the sweat out of a mans life he smiled at the thought then touched a finger to the dripping brim of his hat you sure mind yourself now he said then ambled away grinning at his intimates and leaving adam feeling tawdry major galloway was the first to mount up he settled his feet in his stirrups pushed his repeating rifle into its saddle holster eased his saber an inch or two from its scabbard then made sure his two revolvers were in easy reach smoke your last cigars and pipes now boys the major said because once were out of this wood therell be no more lit tobacco till we wake the sumbitches his incendiarists checked their supplies lucifers flints steels tinder and fuses their job was to burn the ammunition while others of his men carried axes to splinter wheel spokes and hammers and nails to spike the rebels cannon one by one the men pulled themselves into their saddles a horse whinnied softly while another skittered nervously sideways water dripped from the leaves but adam sensed that above the darkening canopy of trees the rain had stopped the evening was young but the clouds made the sky seem like night for the union boys galloway said and the more idealistic of the men repeated the phrase and added gods blessing they were fighting for their beloved country for gods country for the best of all countries forward boys galloway said and the column lurched on its way to battle captain medlicott and captain moxey sat on the veranda of the farmhouse that served as general washington faulconers headquarters and stared at the evening rain on the western horizon medlicott noted where it should have been darkest at this time of day the sky was showing a pale strip of lighter cloud where the rainstorm had stalled but that evidence of dry weather showed no sign of wanting to move east but itll be a fine day tomorrow medlicott grunted the sweat dripped off his beard i know these summer storms he twisted in his chair and looked through the open parlor door to where the general was sitting at the clawfooted table itll be a fine day tomorrow general faulconer did not respond to medlicotts optimism the evening was sweltering and the general was in his shirtsleeves his uniform coat with its heavy epaulets and expensive braid trimming was hanging in the farmhouse hall along with his fine english revolver and the elegant saber that general lafayette had presented to his grandfather the general was staring at some papers on the table he had been contemplating these papers for much of the day and now instead of signing them he pushed them to one side i must be sure to do the right thing faulconer said by which he meant that he must be sure not to make a mistake that could recoil onto his own career goddamn it but they should be courtmartialed captain moxey spat tobacco juice over the verandas railing they should be in prison for disobeying orders sir moxey said emboldened by the privilege of being asked to give advice about the fate of colonel swynyard and captain starbuck but theyll plead they were merely doing their duty faulconer said worrying at the problem like a dog at a bone our orders are to guard the river crossings arent they and what were they doing just guarding a ford how do we persuade a court otherwise captain medlicott waved the objection away it aint a proper ford sir not really not on the maps anyway its just that the rivers running uncommon shallow this year he sounded very unconvincing even to himself but if i just dismiss themfaulconer now contemplated the alternative to a courtmartialwhats to stop them appealing my god you know their facilities for telling lies whod believe them moxey asked one pious drunk and a yankee troublemaker too many people would believe them faulconer thought that was the trouble swynyards cousin was influential and starbuck had friends and consequently faulconer felt as trapped as a man who has made a wonderful attack deep into enemy lines only to find that he cannot extricate his forces last night he had been triumphant but a single days reflection on the nights achievements had thrown up a score of obstacles to the completion of that triumph not the least of which was that swynyard had obstinately refused to get drunk a drunken colonel would have been much easier to courtmartial than a sober and repentant colonel and it was faulconers deepest wish to see both swynyard and starbuck dragged in front of a courtmartial then marched at rifle point to the confederate army prison in richmond but he did not see how he could make the prosecution case irrefutable the trouble is he said changing his argument yet again that there are too many people in this brigade wholl give evidence on starbucks side medlicott sipped brandy popularity comes and goes he said vaguely get rid of the sons of bitches and everyonell forget what they looked like in a couple of weeks in truth medlicott was wondering why faulconer did not simply march the two men down to the river and put a pair of bullets into their heads rains slackening moxey said medlicott turned to look at the general he was even more aware than moxey of the privileges of being one of the generals advisers moxey after all had pretensions of gentility his family kept horses and hunted with faulconers hounds but medlicott had never been anything except a hired man albeit a skilled one and he liked being in the generals confidence and wanted to keep the privilege by making sure the general did indeed rid himself of the troublemakers why dont you just return the two sons of bitches to richmond he suggested with a report saying theyre unfit for field duty then recommend that theyre sent to the coast defenses in south carolina faulconer smoothed the papers on his table south carolina because by this time next year medlicott said grimly theyll both be dead of malaria faulconer unscrewed the silver cap of his traveling inkwell unfit for field duty he asked tentatively ones a drunk the others a northerner hell id say they were unfit medlicott had been emboldened by the generals fine brandy and now somewhat obliquely offered his preferred solution but why be formal at all sir why not just get rid of the bastards shoot them moxey frowned at the suggestion while faulconer chose to ignore it not because he disapproved but because he could not imagine getting away with murder you dont think i need to give a reason for their dismissal the general asked what reason do you need beyond general unfitness for duty hell add indiscipline and dereliction medlicott waved each word into the night with a careless gesture the war department must be desperate to find men for the swamp stations in the carolinas faulconer dipped his pen into the ink then carefully drained the surplus off the nib onto the inkwells rim he hesitated for a second still worried whether his action might have unforeseen repercussions then summoned his courage and signed the two papers that simply dismissed swynyard and starbuck from the brigade he regretted not recommending them for courtsmartial but expedience and good sense dictated the lesser punishment the weather had made everything clammy so that the ink ran thick in the papers fibers as faulconer scratched his name he noted his rank beneath his name then laid down the pen capped the inkwell and blew on the wet signatures to dry them fetch hinton he ordered moxey moxey grimaced at the thought of walking a quartermile through the mud but then pulled himself out of his chair and set off through the dusk toward the legions lines the rain had stopped and campfires pricked the gloom as men emerged from their shelters and blew kindling into life faulconer admired the two dismissal orders and i give them passes for richmond good for tomorrow only medlicott suggested slyly that way if the bastards linger you can have them arrested again faulconer filled in the two passes then his work done walked across the veranda and down to the stretch of muddy grass that lay between the house and a peach orchard he stretched his cramped arms the clouds had made the dusk premature casting nights pall over what should have been a sweet summer evening youd have thought the rain would have broken this humidity medlicott said as he followed faulconer down the steps another storm might do it faulconer said he offered medlicott a cigar and for a few moments the two men smoked in silence it was hardly a companionable silence but medlicott had nothing to say and the general was evidently thinking hard faulconer finally cleared his throat you know of course that ive friends in richmond of course medlicott said gruffly faulconer was silent for a few seconds more ive been thinking you see he eventually said and it occurs to me that weve done more than our fair share of fighting since the war began wouldnt you agree hell yes medlicott said fervently so i was hoping we could have the brigade assigned to richmond faulconer said maybe we could become the experts on the citys defenses medlicott nodded gravely he was not sure just how expert a brigade needed to be in order to garrison the star forts and trenches that ringed richmond but anything that took a man away from the slaughterfields of open battle and closer to hot baths decent food and regular hours seemed pretty inviting experts medlicott said indeed and some of my friends in the capital are convinced its a good idea faulconer said you think the men will like it he added the question disingenuously im sure im sure medlicott said faulconer examined the glowing tip of his cigar politically of course we mustnt look too eager we cant have people saying we shirked the burden which means ill probably have to make a show of refusing the job but it would help me if my regimental commanders pressed me to accept of course of course medlicott said the miller did not really understand the prevarication but was quite happy to agree to anything that might get the brigade back to the comparative comforts of the richmond defenses and i was thinking that i might make paul hinton my secondincommand faulconer went on which means that the legion will need a new commanding officer medlicotts heart gave a leap of anticipation but he had the sense to show neither surprise nor delight surely your brotherinlaw will be back soon he said instead pecker might not want to return faulconer said meaning that he hoped he could persuade bird not to return but even if he does it wont be for a long time and the legion cant manage without a new commanding officer can it indeed not sir medlicott said some people of course would say the job ought to go to a professional soldier faulconer said teasing the eager medlicott but i think this war needs fresh eyes and ideas very true sir very true and you managed a fair number of men at the mill didnt you medlicotts gristmill had never employed more than two free men at any one time and one of those was usually a halfwit but the miller now nodded sagely as though he was accustomed to giving orders to hundreds of employees a good few he said cautiously then frowned because captain moxey muddied to his knees was returning just a few seconds more medlicott thought and he would have been the legions new commanding officer but now an excited moxey was demanding faulconers attention moxey faulconer turned to greet his aide major hintons not here sir not in the lines moxey said eagerly what do you mean not in the lines moxey was clearly enjoying making his revelations hes gone to mccombs tavern sir he said it seems its his fiftieth birthday sir and most of the legions officers went with him god damn them faulconer said they were plotting that was what they were doing plotting he did not believe the story about a birthday for one moment they were conspiring behind his back dont they know the taverns off limits they know its off limits captain medlicott intervened of course they know its downright disobedience sir he added to faulconer wondering whether he might not end up secondincommand to the whole brigade after all fetch them captain faulconer ordered moxey goddamn it faulconer thought but major hinton would have to learn that there was a new tight discipline in the faulconer brigade tell them to come here immediately faulconer said then paused because captain medlicott had raised a warning hand and the general turned to see a horseman approaching the general recognized the rider as captain talliser one of stonewall jacksons aides talliser saluted faulconer by touching a gloved hand to his hat brim then fetched a packet of papers from his saddlebag marching orders general reckon youll be busy packing up tonight marching orders faulconer repeated the words as though he did not understand their meaning talliser held on to the orders offering a scrap of paper and a pencil instead i need your signature first general or someones signature faulconer took the proffered paper and scribbled his name to confirm that general jacksons orders had indeed been received where are we going he asked as he took the orders north sir over the river talliser said tucking the receipt into a pouch on his belt youll eat with us talliser faulconer asked gesturing toward the farmhouse where his cooks were busy preparing supper real kind of you general talliser said but i should be getting back youll surely take a glass of something before you go a glass of water would be real kind talliser was not one of jacksons favorite aides for nothing he swung himself out of his saddle and winced at the soreness in his legs been a long day sir a real long day faulconer turned and was about to shout for nelson his servant then remembered that the wretched man had not yet returned from his errand to faulconer court house moxey he said instead before you go to mccombs tavern be kind enough to fetch a glass of water for captain talliser but moxey was no longer paying attention moxey was instead staring slackjawed and wideeyed past the farmhouse slowly moxeys hand began to point then he tried to speak but the only sound he could make was an incoherent stammer what the hell medlicott frowned at moxeys pathetic display then he too turned and looked south oh dear christ he blasphemed then he began to run away just as the yankees opened fire it all started so much more easily than major galloway had dared to hope the raiders riding in column of pairs stole through the dank twilight to the empty road that stretched between the rebel encampment and the crossroads where dim candlelights gleamed behind the taverns windows no one saw the cavalrymen move through the halflight and no one challenged them as they urged their horses up the small embankment that edged the road galloway chuckled as he heard singing coming from the tavern someones sure having a good time the major said then turned to captain blythe billy take your men south a little just make sure no one from the tavern interferes with us and listen for our bugle blythe touched his hat and turned his horse southward you take care now major he called softly as he led his men away the rest of galloways horse rode north the horses hooves sank into the mud but the going was not nearly as difficult as galloway had feared in winter once the snow and ice had thawed virginias unmacadamed roads could become impassable strips of filthy mud while in summer they could be baked hard enough to lame a wellshod horse but this days rain had merely served to turn the top few inches glutinous a small and smoky fire burned under some trees fifty yards ahead and galloway guessed it marked the southernmost picket of the faulconer brigade the major eased his saber in its scabbard licked his lips and noted how the clouds were already reflecting the great swath of campfires that burned to the east and north those to the east were rebel fires while the ones across the river were the lights of popes army only a few hours more galloway thought and his men would be safe back in those northern lines who the hells there a voice challenged from the shadows some yards short of the fire galloway his heart thumping reined in his horse cant see a damned thing he answered as unconventionally as the picket had challenged him who in tarnation are you there was the unmistakable sound of a rifle being cocked then a man in rebel gray stepped out from the cover of the trees who are you mister the man returned galloways question the sentry looked scarce a day over sixteen his coat hung loose on his shoulders his trousers were held up by a frayed length of rope and the soles of his boots had separated from their uppers names major hearn second georgia horse galloway said plucking a regiments name from his imagination and im sure glad you boys are southerners else wed have been in something wicked close to trouble he chuckled you got a light son my cigars plumb cold you got business here sir the nervous sentry asked forgive me son but i should have told you were carrying dispatches for general faulconer is he anywhere about another man just came with dispatches the sentry said suspiciously galloway laughed you know the army son never send one man to do a job properly when twenty men can do it worse hell wouldnt surprise me if our orders countermanded his orders well have you boys marching in circles all week long now how do i find the general son hes just up the road sir the sentrys suspicions had been entirely allayed by galloways friendliness there was a pause while he made his rifle safe and slung the weapon on his shoulder did you ride with jeb stuart sir the pickets voice was touched with awe i just guess we did son galloway said clean round the yankees now have you got that light for my cigar sure have sir the picket ran back to the fire and snatched a piece of wood out of the flames the fire flared up revealing two other men huddled in the shadows beyond sergeant darrow galloway called softly sir take care of them when were past no noise now yes sir the picket brought the flame back to galloway who bent toward it to light his cigar like all his men galloway had a cloak drawn tight around his uniform thank you son he said when the cigar was drawing straight on up the road you say yes sir theres a farmhouse there you keep dry tonight son you hear me galloway said then rode on he did not look back as darrow and his men disabled the picket there was no gunfire just a sickening series of thumps followed by silence to galloways right was the wagon park where the faulconer brigades ammunition was stored while ahead beyond a stand of dripping trees he could see the farmhouse and tents that marked the faulconer brigades headquarters galloway curbed his horse to let adams troop catch up with him you go on now he told adam and burn the farmhouse must i adam asked galloway sighed if its being used by the enemy adam yes if its full of women and children no hell man were at war yes sir adam said and rode on galloway drew on his cigar and walked his horse in among the supply wagons where a dozen black teamsters sat beneath a crude shelter made from a tarpaulin stretched between two pairs of wagon shafts a small fire flickered in the shelters opening how are you in there boys galloway asked as he peered past the fires smoke and where do i find the ammunition the white carts master over there the man who answered was whittling a piece of wood into the shape of a womans head you got an order from the quartermaster sir fine carving that real fine me i never could whittle guess i dont keep the blade sharp enough sure i got orders boy all the orders youll ever want my sergeant will give em to you galloway waved at the teamsters then walked his horse on toward the nearest ammunition cart that was painted white and had a hooped cover of dirty canvas as galloway rode he took a length of fuse from his saddlebag and a linen bag of gunpowder from a pouch he pushed one end of the fuse into the gunpowder then drew aside the wet canvas flap at the back of the cart to reveal a pile of ammunition boxes he rammed the bag between two of the wooden boxes then touched the glowing tip of his cigar to the fuses end he waited a second to make sure the fuse was burning then let the canvas curtain drop the fire sputtered down the fuses powderpacked tube to leave a small trickle of graywhite smoke galloway was already assembling another small charge to place in the next wagon while more of his men were heading toward the artillery park which was guarded by a handful of unsuspecting gunners armed with carbines galloway placed his second charge then pulled his cloak back to reveal his blue uniform he tugged his saber free and turned back to the sheltering teamsters make yourselves scarce boys he told them go on now run were yankees the first bag of powder exploded it was not a loud explosion merely a dull thump that momentarily lit up the interior of the wagons hooped canvas cover with a lurid red glow the canvas swelled for a second or two then a fire began to flicker deep inside the stacked boxes the teamsters were running one of galloways men leaned from his saddle and plucked a burning brand from the remains of their fire and tossed the burning wood into a third ammunition cart the first load of ammunition began to explode in a series of short sharp cracks that sounded as close together as the snaps of a fourth of july firecracker string and then the whole wagon seemed to evaporate in sudden flame the wet canvas cover flew into the air flapping like a monstrous bat with wings dripping sparks one of galloways men whooped in delight and tossed a firebrand into a stack of muskets keep em burning boys galloway shouted at those of his men who had been detailed as incendiarists then he led the rest of his troop in a charge toward the startled gunners the majors saber reflected the flamelight an artillery sergeant was still trying to prime his carbine as the saber sliced across his face the man screamed but all galloway knew of the blow was a slight jar up his right arm and the juddering friction of steel scraping on bone then the saber was free and he swung it forward to spear its tip into the neck of a running man two of galloways troopers were already dismounted and starting to hammer soft nails into the cannons touchholes others were setting fire to limbers crammed with ammunition while still more were cutting loose picketed team horses and stampeding them into the night saddle horses were being captured and led back to the road a powder charge exploded shooting sparks high into the night air men were shouting in the dark a bullet screamed high over galloways head bugler the major shouted here sir the man put his instrument to his lips not yet galloway said he only wanted to make sure the bugler was staying close for he knew he must sound the retreat very soon he sheathed his saber and drew out the repeating rifle which he fired toward the shadows of men beyond the guns the wagon park was an inferno the sky above it bright with flame and writhing plumes of firelit smoke a dog barked and a wounded horse screamed in the light of the fires galloway could see rebel gunners gathering in the darkness and he knew that at any moment a counterattack would swarm across the artillery park he turned to his bugler now galloway called now and the buglers call rang clear in the nights fiery chaos the major backed his horse through the gunline where the cannons were all spiked and the limbers burning back lads back galloway called his men back adam was inside the farmhouse when he heard the bugle call he had found the house empty except for two of his fathers cooks whom he had ordered to run away sergeant huxtable had meanwhile chased away a group of officers standing on the lawn killing a captain dressed in riding boots and spurs and huxtable now had adams troop lining the ditch at the end of the farms garden from where they were blazing rifle fire into the shadowy lines of the brigade the repeater rifles made it seem as if a whole company of infantry was attacking across the ditch corporal kemp joined adam in the farmhouse burn the place sir he asked not yet adam said he has found his fathers precious revolver and priceless saber hanging in the hall explosions sounded outside then the ripping noise of gunfire sir sergeant huxtable shouted we cant hold here much longer sir the faulconer brigade had begun to fight back and the rifle bullets were whipping thick above the farms yard and orchard adam seized his fathers sword and revolver then turned as kemp called him from the parlor look here look at this kemp had discovered the twin standards of the faulconer legion on the parlor wall huxtable called again from the dark outside hurry sir for gods sake hurry the bugle sounded again from the artillery park its call sweet and pure in the nights angry fusillades adam and kemp pulled the two crossed flagstaffs off their nails come on adam ordered were to burn the house sir you heard the major kemp insisted he saw adams reluctance belongs to a family called pearce sir kemp went on rebels through and through adam had forgotten that corporal kemp was a local man a bullet smacked into the upper floor splintering wood go take the flags adam told him then snatched up some papers that lay on a clawfooted table and held their corners into a flickering candle flame he held the papers there letting the fire take a good hold then dropped the burning documents among the slew of other papers there was a brandy bottle open on the table and adam spilt it across the floors rush matting then threw a burning paper onto the floor flames leaped up adam ran outside a bullet whipped past his head to shatter a window he jumped the verandas rail the pair of captured rebel flags trailed huge and bright across the flanks of corporal kemps horse sergeant huxtable had the bridle of adams mare here sir back adam shouted as he pulled himself into the saddle the horsemen retreated past the farmhouse where a fiery glow was already suffusing the parlor windows kemp had managed to furl the captured flags and now handed them to one of the troopers then drew his saber to slash at the guy ropes of the nearest tents a voice was shouting for water another voice shouted adams name but adam ignored the summons as he galloped toward the wagon park that now looked like a corner of hell flames were searing sixty feet high while the exploding ammunition spat trails of vivid smoke in every direction the bugle sounded again and adam and his men spurred down the road toward major galloways party count adam shouted one that was sergeant huxtable two corporal kemp three the next man called and so on through the whole troop every man was present anyone hurt adam asked not one man was hurt and adam felt his heart leap with exultation well done adam galloway greeted him just beyond the small stand of trees all well everyones present sir no ones hurt and us galloway sounded triumphant another limber of ammunition exploded punching red fire across the wounded camp then from the southern darkness there sounded a crash of rifle fire so sudden and furious that galloway looked momentarily alarmed he feared his men were being cut off then realized the noise was coming from the tavern at the crossroads which meant that billy blythe and his men were in a fight come on he shouted dug in his spurs and galloped to the rescue i dont feel fifty major hinton told captain murphy i dont even feel like forty but im fifty an old man nonsense murphy said fiftys not old ancient hinton lamented i cant believe im fifty you will tomorrow morning god willing murphy answered have another drink a dozen officers had walked to mccombs tavern to celebrate the majors halfcentury it was not much of a tavern merely a cavernous house where ale and homedistilled whiskey were sold and where two whores worked upstairs and two kitchen slaves served huge plates of dumplings bacon and corn bread downstairs major hintons private supper party was held in a back room where the days menu such as it was was crudely chalked on the plank wall not that the major needed to read the bill of fare for his officers had generously subscribed to buy a rare and expensive ham that liam mccombs cooks had boiled especially for the dinner captain murphy asked for irish potatoes to accompany the ham but mccomb had refused the request by saying that he would be happy if he never saw another damned potato in all his born days unless its been liquidated if you follow my meaning captain he said mccomb was a giant man more than sixty years old and with a belly on him like one of his own beer barrels you mean poteen murphy asked christ and i havent tasted poteen in seven years youll find it will have been worth the wait captain mccomb said and when the supper was finished and the shirtsleeved officers were sharing a bottle of fine french brandy taken at cedar mountain the tavern keeper brought a gallon stone jug downstairs a few sips of that captain he told murphy and youll swear youre back in ballinalea if only i was murphy said wistfully the wife made it mccomb said as he placed the stone jug on the table before she was taken bad not fatally i trust hinton asked politely god bless you no major shes lying upstairs with a fever so she is its the heat that does it to her theyre not natural these summers not natural at all well pay for the poteen sure we will murphy said sounding more irish than he had for many a long year youll not pay me a hapenny captain mccomb said roisin and i have two boys serving in the th virginia and theyd want you to be having a taste of it for nothing so enjoy it now but not too much now not if you want to enjoy the upstairs pleasures later a cheer greeted this remark for part of the nights entertainment would doubtless be afforded by the two rooms upstairs but not me hinton said when mccomb had gone im a married man i cant afford the pox starbuck hasnt got the pox murphy said and he must have sneaked down here at least a dozen times he never did hinton said shocked at the news starbuck and women murphy asked my god major its like whiskey and priests you couldnt keep the two apart with a pry bar god knows what they fed him up in boston to give him the energy but i wouldnt mind a bottle or two of it myself now try the poteen the poteen was passed around the table every captain from the legion was there except for daniel medlicott who had been summoned to faulconers headquarters and starbuck who was under guard in colonel swynyards tent no one not even major hinton was entirely sure what fate the general planned for starbuck but lieutenant davies was certain faulconer wanted a courtmartial hinton averred that a courtmartial was impossible maybe swynyard disobeyed faulconer but nate only did what swynyard ordered him to do hinton lifted the poteen jug to his nose and smelt it suspiciously itll all blow over he said speaking of starbucks predicament rather than the liquor faulconer will sleep on it then forget all about it hes not a man for confrontation not like his father was do i drink this stuff or use it as a liniment drink that murphy said and youll feel fifteen instead of fifty what in gods name is it hinton asked as he poured a few drops of the spirit into a tin mug potato whiskey murphy told him from ireland if you get the recipe right major its a drink from heaven but get it wrong and itll blind you for life and tear your guts into tatters for good measure hinton shrugged hesitated then decided that at fifty years old he had nothing to lose and so downed the colorless liquor in one gulp he took a deep breath shook his head then let out a hoarse sound that seemed to indicate approval he poured himself some more what was that captain pirie the legions quartermaster was seated beside a window that was amazing hinton said it takes your breath clean away gunfire pirie said and pulled aside the gauze curtain that kept the insects away from the candlelight the sound of an explosion thumped across the damp landscape followed by the splintering noise of rifles firing a great red suffusion of light blossomed to the north silhouetting the trees that lay between the crossroads and the brigades lines jesus murphy said softly then pulled his revolver from the holster that he had hung from a nail on the wall and went through into the taverns main room which in turn opened onto a rickety porch the other officers followed him joining mccomb and three of his customers under the porchs wooden roof from which hung two lanterns a second explosion spread its sheet of light across the northern sky and this time the great flame outlined a group of cloaked horsemen on the road whos there hinton called fourth louisiana horse a southern voice called back the skyline was red with flame and more rifle shots cracked in the camp its a raid hinton called as he ran down the porch steps revolver in hand fire the southern voice shouted and a volley of rifles slammed at the tavern from the reddened dark hinton was thrown to the ground by a monstrous blow to his shoulder he rolled in the mud toward the shadows under the porch as a bullet shattered one of the lanterns and rained glass fragments down onto the startled officers captain murphy fired his revolver twice but the sheer volume of return fire made him duck into the tavern for cover lieutenant davies had followed hinton down the steps and somehow made it safe across the road to the protection of the small church but none of the other officers succeeded in leaving the taverns veranda pirie was draped over the railings blood dripping from his dangling hands more blood was seeping between the planks onto major hinton who was gasping with pain liam mccomb had a shotgun that he fired up the road then a bullet smacked into the tavern keepers great belly and he folded onto the porch with an astonished look on his face his breath came in huge shuddering gasps as blood spread across his shirt and pants murphy ran to a side window but a second before he reached his objective a bullet slapped the gauze curtain aside then a second bullet ripped clean through the wall to strike a splinter out of the taverns counter the slaves were wailing in the kitchen while mccombs bedridden wife was calling pathetically for her husband the other women upstairs were screaming in terror murphy cupped his hands there are women in here stop your firing stop firing another voice took up the cry from the porch cease fire cease fire there are women here keep firing a man shouted from the firerent dark bastards are lying keep firing murphy ducked as more bullets riddled the wall the heaviness of the rifle fire suggested there had to be scores of enemy outside john torrance c companys captain was lying in the porch doorway apparently dead one of the legions lieutenants was crawling across the floor his beard dripping with blood then he collapsed onto a full spittoon and spilt its rancid contents across the floor a fire had started in the kitchen and its flames roared hungrily as they fed on the old buildings dry wood two of mccombs customers ran upstairs to try and take the women to safety as murphy hurried into the back room where the remains of the celebratory supper lay on the table he snatched his coat from the nail grabbed his cartridge pouch and leaped straight through a gauze curtain into the night the curtain wrapped itself round him tripping him so that he rolled helplessly in the mud for a few seconds he had an idea he might be able to drive the horsemen away from the front of the tavern if he could just fire at them from the darkness at the buildings rear but as he struggled to extricate himself from the muslin curtain he heard the click of a gun being cocked and looked up to see the dark shape of a horseman murphy tried to raise his revolver but the horseman fired first then fired again murphy felt something hit him with a blow like the kick of a horse then a terrible pain whipped up from his thigh he heard himself scream then lost consciousness as the rider fired again the fire spread from the kitchen mrs mccomb screamed as the flames licked up the stairs and the bedrooms filled with a thick smoke the two men who had tried to rescue the women abandoned their attempt instead stepping out of a bedroom window onto the porch roof in an effort to save themselves from the flames shoot them down billy blythe ordered excitedly shoot the bastards down a halfdozen bullets struck the two men who collapsed rolled twitching down the shingled roof then dropped to the ground blythe whooped with victory while his men kept pouring their withering fire into the burning building a bugle called to the north summoning the raiders to their retreat but blythe had his enemy trapped like rats in a burning barrel and like rats he decided they would die he fired again and again while the flames spread through the tavern leaping up the gauze curtains devouring the ancient wooden floors exploding barrels of liquor and hissing where it met the blood that was spilt so thick across the planks a man with burning clothes crawled across the porch then fell shuddering as bullets ripped at him a roof beam collapsed showering sparks into the night and billy blythe his mouth open and eyes bright watched enthralled major galloway arrived at the head of his raiders come on billy didnt you hear the bugle too busy blythe said his eyes wide and fixed on the glorious destruction flames writhed out of collapsing liquor barrels and flared fierce and brief when they caught a dead mans hair ammunition crackled in the flames each cartridge flashing white like a miniature firecracker what happened galloway stared in awe at the burning house sons of bitches fired on us blythe said still gazing enraptured at the horror he had engendered so we taught the sons of bitches a lesson lets go billy galloway said then seized blythes bridle and dragged his secondincommand away from the fire come on billy a figure stirred under the porch and two horsemen emptied their rifles revolving cylinders into the man a woman screamed at the taverns rear then the kitchen roof collapsed and the scream was cut sharply off it was a horse blythe assured galloway who had frowned when he heard the womans distress just a dying horse joe and dying horses can sound uncommon like women lets go galloway said there was a smell of roasting meat from the tavern and horrid things twitching in the furnace heat and galloway turned away not wanting to know what horrors he abandoned the horsemen rode west leaving the sparks whirling cloudward and a whole brigade whipped starbuck had wanted to challenge the raiders but swynyard stopped him from leaving the tent theyll slash you down like a dog ever been chased by a cavalryman no youll end up sabercut to ribbons keep quiet we must do something sometimes its best to do nothing they wont stay long yet the wait seemed forever to starbuck as he crouched in the tent then at last he heard a bugle call and voices shouting orders to retreat hooves thumped close by the tent which suddenly twitched and half collapsed as its guy ropes were cut starbuck squirmed out of the sagging wet canvas and saw adam on horseback not five paces away adam starbuck shouted not really believing his own eyes but adam was already spurring south his horses hooves throwing up great gobs of mud and water as he went starbuck saw the headquarters house burning and more fires flaring skyward among the supply wagons the sentry guarding swynyards tent had vanished so how did they cross the river colonel swynyard asked as he crawled out from the tents wreckage the same way theyll go back starbuck said the horsemen might have withdrawn southward but he had no doubt they would be riding a halfcircle to get back to the unguarded ford which meant a man on foot might just be able to cut them off general faulconer was shouting for water but starbuck ignored the orders he leaped over the ditch that separated the headquarters from the bivouac lines and shouted for sergeant truslow turn out fast now h company fell into ranks load starbuck ordered truslow had rescued starbucks rifle and now threw it to him with an ammunition pouch the general says were not to take orders from you the sergeant said the general can go to hell starbuck bit a cartridge and poured powder down the barrel thats what i reckoned too truslow said swynyard arrived panting where are you going starbuck spat the bullet into the muzzle were going to dead marys ford he said then rammed the bullet hard down slotted the ramrod back into place and slung the rifle from his shoulder why dead marys ford swynyard asked puzzled because damn it we saw one of the bastards there last night aint that right mallory saw him plain as daylight sergeant mallory confirmed besides starbuck went on where else would they cross the river every other fords guarded follow me starbuck shouted and the men ran through a darkness made livid by the great fires that burned uncontrollably in the brigade lines the farmhouse roof collapsed to spew a gout of flames skyward but that inflagration was dwarfed by the huge fires in the ammunition park every few seconds another powder cask would explode to send a ball of fire soaring up into the low clouds shells cracked apart rifle ammunition stuttered and dogs howled in terror the inferno lit starbucks path across the waterlogged meadow and into the trees but the deeper he ran into the woods the darker it became and the harder it was to find the path he had to slow down and feel his way forward sergeant truslow wanted to know just what had happened at headquarters colonel swynyard told him about the northern raiders and starbuck added that he had seen adam faulconer among the enemy horsemen are you sure colonel swynyard asked pretty damn sure yes truslow spat into the dark i said we should have shot the bastard when he crossed the lines this way they stumbled on through the woods then when they were still a quartermile short of the river starbuck heard hoofbeats and saw a glimmer of flamelight showing through the black tangled silhouette of the trees run he shouted he feared his company would arrive too late and that the northern horsemen would escape before he could reach the line of rifle pits at the woods edge then he saw the riders milling at the rivers nearer bank someone had made a torch by strapping dead twigs to a length of timber and the torch lit the horsemens passage through a ford made dangerously deep by storm water starbuck guessed most of the riders had long crossed the river but a dozen cavalrymen were still waiting on the southern bank as he slipped and skidded into a flooded rifle pit he held his weapon up high to keep it dry and saw the nearest horsemen turn in alarm as they heard the splash of his fall spread out starbuck shouted to his men and open fire three horses were in the middle of the ford with the river up past their bellies one of the cavalrymen cut with a whip to urge his horse on fire starbuck shouted again then aimed his own rifle at the nearest enemy he pulled the trigger and felt a surge of relief that at last they were fighting back someone fired from starbucks right the woods were full of trampling feet and the edge of the meadow was suddenly black with rebel infantry the ruined house where mad silas lived was a dark shadow in the meadows center beyond which the yankee carried his flaming torch high then the man suddenly realized that he was illuminating the target and so he hurled the brand into the river to plunge the night into instant and utter blackness a horse was screaming in the dark more rifles cracked their flames stabbing the sudden dark the yankees returned the fire rifles flared on the far bank men were shouting in panic calling on each other to get the hell across the water northern bullets whipped through the leaves over starbucks head he was up to his thighs in the flooded rifle pit he rammed a new bullet down the rifles barrel then fired again he could not see his targets because the muzzle flashes were dazzling him the night was a chaos of gun flames screams and splashes something or someone floundered in the water and starbuck could hear desperate shouts as the horsemen tried to rescue their comrade cease fire he shouted not because he wanted to help the rescuers but because it was time to take prisoners cease fire he shouted again and heard sergeant truslow take up the call h company starbuck called when the rifles had fallen silent forward the company advanced out of the trees and ran down the grassy slope a few yankee shots came over the river but in the dark the enemys aim was much too high and the bullets simply ripped their way through the black canopy of leaves starbuck ran past the ruined house where mad silas was cradling his dead mary the company began screaming the rebel yell wanting to scare the men who were still trying to rescue their wounded comrade from the river starbuck reached the ford first dropped his rifle and threw himself into the water he gasped at the stormgiven strength of the current then grabbed at the shadows in front and found himself clasping a wet handful of uniform a gun exploded a foot from his face but the bullet went wide then a man screamed as starbuck dragged him back toward the southern bank more rebels splashed into the river to help starbuck one of them fired at the yankees and the flash of his rifles muzzle showed a group of northerners wading to the far bank and a horse and rider being swept downstream starbucks prisoner gasped for breath while the drowning horse smashed the rivers surface with its flailing hooves give them a goodbye shot boys colonel swynyard called and a handful of starbucks men fired across the water come on you bastard starbuck grunted his prisoner was struggling like a fiend and throwing wild fists at starbucks face starbuck hammered the man hard with his right hand kicked him and finally dragged him back to the southern bank where a rush of men overpowered the yankee rest of the bastards got away truslow panted ruefully as the hoofbeats receded across the river we got all we needed starbuck said he was soaked through bruised and winded but he had won the victory he wanted he had proof that the ford had needed guarding and it had been washington faulconer who had removed the guard and so let the northern raiders cross the river just let that son of a bitch put us on trial now he told swynyard just let that son of a goddamned bitch try general stuarts aide reached lees headquarters before dawn and found the armys commander standing outside his tent in contemplation of a crude map scratched in the dirt the map showed the rivers rapidan and rappahannock while the fords across the further river were marked by scraps of twig it was those fords that the cavalry needed to capture if pope was to be trapped at the rivers confluence but it seemed there was to be no chance of success this day for the aide brought only a repetition of the previous days bad news the cavalry just arent ready sir general stuarts real sorry sir the aide was very sheepish half expecting a tirade from an angry lee its the horses sir he went on lamely they aint recovered the roads are wicked hard sir and general stuart was expecting to find more forage up here and the aide let his hopeless explanations trail away lees grave face scarce registered his disappointment indeed he seemed much more disappointed in the taste of the coffee than in the failure of his cavalry is this really the best coffee we have hudson he asked one of his younger staff officers until we can capture more from the yankees sir yes which we cant do without our cavalry upon my soul we cant he sipped the coffee again grimaced then laid the tin mug on a washstand that was set with his aides shaving tackle on the generals own washstand inside his tent there lay a dispatch that reported that federal ships had steamed up the potomac river in the previous twentyfour hours and what that figure meant lee knew was that mcclellans forces were well on their way to reinforcing popes army the ships sidewheels and screws were churning the potomac white in their efforts to combine the enemy armies and meanwhile the confederate cavalry was not ready which meant popes army would be safe for one more day the frustration rose in lee only to be instantly suppressed there was no profit in displaying temperament none at all and so the general looked placidly back at the crude map scratched in the dirt there was still time he told himself still time it was one thing for the northern generals to move an army by boat but quite another to land the troops and reunite them with their wagons and guns and tents and ammunition and mcclellan was a cautious man much too cautious which would give the rebels even more time to teach john pope a lesson in civilized warfare lee ruefully obliterated the map with the toe of a riding boot and gave orders that the army would not after all be marching that morning he retrieved his coffee what exactly do they do to this coffee he asked mix it with ground goober peas sir captain hudson answered mashed peanuts lee sipped again good lord it makes the coffee go farther sir it surely does it surely does of course sir we can always get some real beans from richmond hudson said if we say theyre for you im sure theyll find some no no we must drink what the soldiers drink at least when it comes to coffee we must the general forced himself to swallow more of the sour liquid the horses will be ready tomorrow you think he asked stuarts messenger very courteously almost as though he regretted pressing the cavalryman for a decision general stuarts confident of that sir very confident lee forbore to remark that twentyfour hours earlier stuart had been equally confident that the cavalry would be ready in this dawn but nothing would be achieved by recrimination and so lee offered the discomfited aide a grave smile my respects to general stuart he said and i look forward to marching tomorrow instead later that morning lee returned to clarks mountain to examine the enemy on the rivers far bank as he climbed the wooded slope he saw a pyre of dirty smoke smearing the western sky but no one on his staff knew what the smoke meant it came from jacksons lines and doubtless jackson would deal with whatever had caused the fire lee was more concerned with what was happening across the river and so once at the summit he dismounted and rested his telescope on travellers patient back and once again the yankee presence in the virginia hills was denoted by a myriad of smoking fires that hazed the green land like a winter mist but then lee saw that something was missing beneath that mist there were fires aplenty but no tents he moved the glass no wagons no horses and no guns there was nothing but the remains of campfires that the yankees had lit in the night stacked high with wood then left to burn as they crept away theyve gone lee said sir one of his aides stepped forward to hear better theyve gone lee collapsed his telescope but still stared northward theyve gone he said again almost as if he did not believe his own eyes pope had taken his men out of the trap he had retreated across the rappahannock he had seen his danger and abandoned the land between the rivers which meant lee thought that in a weeks time pope would have been reinforced by mcclellan and then it would all be finished bluecoated yankees would be rampaging all across virginia and john pope the wretched john pope who so passionately hated southerners would be the tyrant of all he surveyed unless that is the confederacy risked everything on a daring and desperate chance not a maneuver from the rule book but something from the devils box of tricks instead lee sensed the idea like a temptation he suddenly saw how he could tip john pope off balance and then savage him and the idea burgeoned in his mind even as the wellschooled and conventional part of his training attempted to reject the notion as too risky but another part of lee was tantalized by the beauty and symmetry of the outrageous idea it was a maneuver that would humiliate john pope and drive the yankees clean out of virginia and as lee considered the rewards and risks of his maneuver he felt the excitement of a gambler staking everything on a single run of cards the thing could be done yet his face betrayed no hint of that excitement as he climbed into his saddle and settled his boots into his stirrups my compliments to general jackson he said calmly pushing his telescope back into its case and gathering travellers reins into his hands and i would be much obliged if he would call on me at his earliest convenience and then lee thought he would let old mad jack off his leash and god help john pope then it was not convenient for major general thomas jackson to call on general robert lee it would be convenient soon but not yet for general jackson had two urgent duties to perform they were not pleasant dutiesindeed lesser men might have shrunk from them altogetherbut thomas jackson considered them simple responsibilities and so he performed them with his customary dogged diligence men had to be shot southern men except to the general they were not men but curs and trash who had deserted their duties and thus placed themselves beneath contempt their commanding officers had pleaded for the condemned mens lives but jackson had answered that men who desert their comrades deserve to be shot and officers who pleaded for such men deserved to be hung and after that curt response there had been no more pleas for clemency now beneath a clearing sky and on a meadow still damp from the previous days rains jackson had assembled his whole corps three divisions of soldiers twentyfour thousand men were paraded in rank after shabby gray rank to form three sides of an open square the morning was hot and the air stifling drums beat slow as a band played a ragged funeral dirge the band was paraded a few paces behind jackson who sat on his small rawboned horse and stared morosely at three wooden stakes that had been plunged into the dirt beside three roughsawn pine coffins and three freshly dug graves behind him his staff sat silent in their saddles some of them more nervous of this mornings killings than they had ever been of battle captain hudson lees aide who was waiting to escort general jackson back to meet the armys commander in gordonsville watched the gaunt famous figure and wondered if ever in all the history of warfare any commander had appeared so unprepossessing the generals beard was unkempt and his clothes looked in worse condition than any of his soldiers uniforms he had an old blue coat that was vaguely military in cut but threadbare and faded while for a hat jackson favored a shabby cadets cap with a creased brim that was pulled low over his eyes his horse was a bigheaded knockkneed clumsy beast with a patchy chestnut pelt while the generals enormous boots were thrust into rusted stirrups that hung from mended leather straps the most impressive military aspect of the general apart from his reputation was his rigid pose for he sat his horse straightbacked and with his head held high but then as if to spoil that martial stance he slowly and inexplicably raised his left hand until it was poised higher than his scruffy creased cap he then held the hand motionless as though he was beseeching the almighty for blessing the three doomed men were marched onto the field each man escorted by his own company the general had insisted that the criminals must be shot by their own comrades for those comrades were the men most immediately betrayed by each deserter an army chaplain waited for the condemned men who on reaching the stakes were ordered onto their knees the chaplain stepped forward and began to pray a small wind stirred the sullen air to the west a sifting plume of smoke showed where the yankee raiders had struck in the night and jackson reminded of that impudent raid looked toward the faulconer brigade to see the regiment that paraded without its colors they had lost their colors just as they had lost most of their officers and jackson brooding on the yankee coup felt a spasm of anger the prayer seemed unending the chaplains eyes were screwed tight shut and his hands clenched hard about a battered bible as he commended the three sinners souls to the god they were about to meet the chaplain reminded god of the two thieves who had shared his sons death on calvary and implored the almighty to look as charitably upon these three sinners as christ had looked upon the repentant thief one of the three men was unable to check his tears he was a beardless youth who had deserted because his sixteenyearold wife had run away with his uncle and now he was to die in a green field because he had loved her so much he looked up at his captain and tried to make a lastminute plea but the chaplain simply raised his voice so that the useless request could not be heard the other two men showed no emotion not even when the band finished its funereal music and went suddenly silent after a last uneven flurry on the drums the chaplain also finished he stumbled as he stepped backward from the victims a staff officer took the chaplains place and in a loud slow voice that almost carried to the rearmost ranks of the twentyfour thousand witnesses read aloud the charges against the three men and the verdicts of their courtsmartial the bleak sentences finished he stepped back and looked at the three company officers carry on no for the love of god no please no the young man tried to resist but two of his comrades dragged him to the stake and there pinioned him with rope the three men wore shirts pants and ragged boots a sergeant blindfolded the weeping youth and told him to stop his noise and die like a man the other two deserters refused their blindfolds ready the staff officer shouted and over a hundred rifles were raised to the firing position some men aimed wide some blatantly had their rifles uncocked but most of the men obeyed the order aim the staff officer called and two nervous men pulled their triggers instead both bullets flew wide wait for it a sergeant snarled a company officer had his eyes closed and his lips were moving in silent prayer as he waited for the order to fire one of the doomed men spat onto the grass to lees aide who had not expected to witness death this morning it seemed as though three whole divisions of troops were holding their collective breath while jackson his left hand held high seemed carved from stone no please no the young man called his blindfolded head was thrashing from side to side nancy he shouted desperately my nancy the staff officer took a deep breath fire the smoke jetted suddenly the volleys huge sound rolled across the fields to explode birds from faroff trees the three men jerked in sudden spasms as their shirts erupted with blood the companies commanding officers walked to the three stakes with their revolvers drawn but only one of the men was still alive the mans breath bubbled in the wreckage of his ribs and his bearded head twitched his company officer cocked his revolver held his breath and tried to stop his hand shaking for a second or two it looked as though he would be unable to give the coup de grace then he managed to pull the trigger and the living mans head was shattered by the bullet the captain turned away and vomited into the open grave as the band jerked into the tune of old dan tucker lees aide let out a long slow breath put em in their boxes a sergeant called and men ran forward to cut the dead men away from their stakes and lift them into the opentopped coffins which were then ramped up on the red earth mounds so that a passerby could see the corpses clearly take the wrap off the young lad the sergeant ordered and waited as the cuckolded youths blindfold was removed then one by one the regiments were marched past the dead men from virginia and georgia from the carolinas and tennessee from alabama and louisiana were all shown the three corpses and after the infantry came the artillery and the engineers all made to look into the eyes of the flyinfested dead so that they would understand what fate awaited a deserter general jackson had been the first man to inspect the three corpses and he had stared intently into the faces as though trying to understand the impulse that could drive a man to the unforgivable sin of desertion as a christian the general had to believe that such sinners could be redeemed but as a soldier he could not imagine any of the three men knowing a moments peace throughout eternity and his face showed nothing but disgust as he twitched his horses reins and headed toward the farm that served as his headquarters it was there in a parlor that was hung with an ancient portrait of president george washington and a newer one of president jefferson davis that the general undertook his second unpleasant duty of the day he stood with his ramrodstraight back to the portrait of washington and flanked by three senior staff officers summoned general washington faulconer into his presence the parlor was a small room made even smaller by a map table that almost filled the space between its limewashed walls washington faulconer entered the room to find himself cribbed in a narrow space and faced by four men behind the map table all standing and all looking uncomfortably like judges he had half expected to be seated opposite the general but instead this meeting was evidently to be conducted formally and washington faulconer felt even more uncomfortable at that daunting prospect he was wearing a borrowed sword and a borrowed jacket that was at least one size too big for him sweat was trickling into his golden beard the small parlor stank of unwashed bodies and dirty clothes general faulconer said in cautious greeting as he stood opposite his commanding general jackson said nothing at first but just stared at the fairhaired faulconer the generals face showed the exact same expression as when he had stared down at the three slackjawed chestshattered deserters in their cheap pine coffins and faulconer unable to meet the intensity of that blueeyed gaze looked guiltily away i gave orders jackson spoke at last in his clipped high voice that all the crossings of the rapidan were to be guarded i faulconer began but was instantly silenced quiet even jacksons three staff officers felt a frisson of terror at the intensity of that command while washington faulconer visibly shook i gave orders jackson began again that all the crossings of the rapidan were to be guarded men of your brigade general discovered an unmapped ford and were intelligent enough to obey my orders while youand here the general paused just long enough for a rictus to shiver his bodycountermanded them i faulconer began and this time was stopped not by a word of command but simply by the look in the generals blue eyes the damage jackson turned abruptly to one of his most trusted aides major hotchkiss a scholarly and painstaking man who had been deputed to discover the truth about the nights incursion hotchkiss had arrived at the remnants of the faulconer brigades headquarters at dawn and had spent the next two hours questioning survivors and now in a dry neutral voice he offered his horrid list fourteen dead sir hotchkiss said and twentyfour seriously hurt those are soldiers but there were at least six civilians killed and three of those maybe more were women we wont know for sure till the tavern ruins are cool enough to be searched hotchkisss news was all the more damning for being announced in a placid voice major hinton was among the dead while captain murphy was wounded so grievously that no one was certain that his name would not soon be added to the grim tally and among the dead is captain talliser my aide jackson added in a dangerous voice no one responded captain talliser was the son of a good friend jackson delivered his aides obituary and was himself a loyal servant of christ he deserved better than to be mauled to death by night raiders in the back of the house a mans voice suddenly began singing how sweet the name of jesus sounds pots clattered in that distant room then the hymn was interrupted by laughter the sound of the pots woke a tabby cat that had been sleeping on the parlors windowsill the cat arched its back yawned delicately stretched out each front paw then began to wash its face major hotchkiss looked back to his list of material losses sir he said my preliminary estimate is that sixteen thousand rifle cartridges were lost in the fire plus eightysix charges of powder and thirtyeight rounds of common shell two limbers four caissons and three wagons were burned out and at least six horses taken hotchkiss folded the list then raised scornful eyes to washington faulconer two battle flags were also carried away by the enemy another pained silence ensued it seemed to stretch forever before at last jackson spoke again and how did the raiders cross the river at a place called dead marys ford hotchkiss answered which had been properly guarded until the previous night the raiders were intercepted during their withdrawal and a prisoner taken the raiders also lost one horse hotchkiss a dry stern man who had once taught school added the fact of the horses death in a sarcastic voice faulconer colored and it was by your orders general jackson said ignoring hotchkisss sarcasm that the ford was uncovered this time faulconer tried no defense he looked up briefly but he still could not meet jacksons gaze and so he looked down again he wanted to say that he had only been trying to instill discipline into his brigade and that he had lost his precious saber in the night and worst of all that the whole humiliation had been at the hands of his own son and not just one humiliation for his servant nelson had returned that same morning with the dreadful tale of adams raid on seven springs which meant that adam had attacked both his mother and his father and the realization of those two awful betrayals filled faulconers eyes with tears you must have something to say faulconer jackson said faulconer cleared his throat accidents happen he suggested feebly the ford he shrugged it wasnt on the map sir merely a shallow spot lack of rain really he knew he was stammering like a fool and tried to pull himself together goddamn it was he not one of virginias wealthiest men a landowner who could buy this tom fool general a million times over and faulconer tried to remember all the risible stories about jackson how the general taught in a negro sunday school and how he gave a tenth of his income to the church and how he took a cold bath at six oclock every morning summer and winter alike and how he held his left hand in the air so the blood would not collect and turn an old wound rancid but somehow the catalog of jacksons eccentricities and imbecilities did not make faulconer feel any more confident i deemed that the ford was not important he managed to say and what did you deem my orders to be faulconer frowned not understanding the question i ordered all fords regardless of their importance to be guarded jackson said you thought i was amusing myself by delivering such a command faulconer defeated could only shrug jackson paused a second then delivered his verdict you are dismissed from your command general jacksons voice was harsher than ever prompted not just by faulconers dereliction of duty but also by the tears he saw in faulconers eyes general jackson did not mind tears in their proper place at a deathbed say or in contemplation of christs miraculous atonement but not here where men spoke of duty you will leave this army forthwith jackson continued and report to the war department in richmond for further orders if there are any further orders for you which it is my fervent hope there are not dismissed faulconer looked up he blinked back his tears for a second it seemed he might try and protest the hard sentence but then he turned without any acknowledgment and left the room jackson waited for the door to close political generals he said bitterly are as fit for soldiering as lapdogs for hunting he reached for major hotchkisss list and read its depressing statistics without showing any sign of regret or surprise make the arrangements for faulconers replacement he said as he handed the paper back to the staff officer then he picked up his shabby hat in readiness for his visit to lees headquarters a final thought struck him as he reached the door and he paused there frowning the enemy did well jackson said apparently to himself so we shall just have to do better it was midday before the ruins of mccombs tavern were cool enough to let a work party retrieve the bodies from the heart of the wreckage and even then the salvage work had to be done by men wearing protective strips of watersoaked sacking around their boots and hands the corpses had been shrunk by the fierce heat into black brittle manikins that smelt disturbingly of roasted pork starbuck supervised the work he was still officially under arrest but no one else seemed willing to take charge of the salvage and so while the brigade marched off to witness the executions and while general washington faulconer waited at general jacksons headquarters starbuck took a dozen men from his own company and set them to work so whats happening truslow had asked starbuck at dawn when the early light revealed the blackened and smoking wreckage dont know are you under arrest dont know whos commanding the legion medlicott starbuck said faulconer had made the appointment during the night dan medlicott truslow said disgustedly why in hells name appoint him starbuck did not answer he felt slighted by the appointment for he had been a captain long before daniel medlicott had bribed his way to the rank in the spring election but starbuck also understood that washington faulconer would never have appointed him to command the legion ive got a job for you starbuck told truslow instead the prisoners being unhelpful the man they had captured was called sparrow and came from virginias pendleton county one of the fractious western counties that had declared themselves to be a new state loyal to the union ill make the sumbitch squeal truslow said happily the morning wore on most of the legion witnessed the three executions but even when they returned to their encampment they still seemed dazed and stupefied by the nights disasters of the legions captains only medlicott moxey and starbuck remained alive and unwounded and of the officers who had attended major hintons birthday supper only lieutenant davies had survived serious harm davies had received a bullet slash on his left forearm but had escaped the worst of the massacre by taking cover behind the small church i could have done more he kept telling starbuck and died dont be a fool if youd have opened fire theyd have hunted you down and killed you like a dog davies shook at the memory he was a tall thin bespectacled man three years older than starbuck and with a perpetually worried expression he had been reading law in his uncles office before the war began and had often confided in starbuck his fears that he might never master the intricacies of that profession they knew there were women in the house he now said to starbuck i know youve told me starbucks tone was callous and peremptory in his view there was little point in endlessly discussing the nights tragedy in the vain hope of finding some consolation the mess had to be cleaned up avenged and forgotten which was why he was employing his company in retrieving the bodies from the burnedout tavern davies had come to watch the salvage perhaps to remind himself how narrowly he had escaped being one of the shrunken charred bodies murphy told them there were women inside davies said indignantly i heard him it doesnt matter starbuck said he was watching the cobb twins who were rummaging among the ashes in the center of the burned building izard cobb had found some coins and an ivory cribbage board that had somehow survived the fire undamaged those go to sergeant waggoner starbuck called across the ruins the newly promoted waggoner had been charged with collecting what few pitiable valuables might be rescued from the burned tavern but it does matter davies protested they killed women for christs sakestarbuck turned on the pale bespectacled daviesyoure about to get a captaincy which means your men dont want to hear what went wrong last night they want to hear how you intend to find the son of a damned bitch who did it to us and how youre going to kill him davies looked shocked captaincy i guess starbuck said the nights disasters had virtually beheaded the faulconer legion which meant there would either have to be wholesale promotions or else new people drafted in from other regiments maybe pecker will come back davies said wistfully as though colonel bird could make everything in the legion better peckerll be back when hes mended starbuck said and that wont be for a few weeks yet he suddenly whipped around to look at the wreckage again cobb if youve pocketed that silver ill hang you i aint pocketed nothing you want to search me ill search your brother starbuck said and saw his suspicion that izard cobb would palm the coins to his brother ethan had been plumb right give the money to sergeant waggoner he told ethan cobb then watched as his orders were obeyed now pick up that body he pointed to the blackened figure of one of mccombs cooks izard cobb made a great display of horror shes a nigger captain he protested if she was alive youd have been happy enough to bed her so now you can carry her to the grave and do it respectfully starbuck waited until the cobb brothers had stooped to their work then turned back to davies theyre lazy sons of bitches all the cobbs are lazy davies said always were the family ruined some prime bottom land off hankeys run just let it go to rack and ruin a shame his knowledge of such matters was a reminder that the legion was still largely composed of men who came from within a days walk of the town of faulconer court house men who knew each other and each others families and each others business men like starbuck an outsider were the exception it was that closeknit family feeling that had added to the regiments pain when major hinton was killed the legion lost not just a commanding officer but a friend a sidesman of the church a brotherinlaw a creditor a hunting companion and above all a neighbor and if murphy died they would lose another still davies said dan medlicott is a decent man starbuck believed daniel medlicott was a sly ponderous and cowardly tool but he also knew better than to criticize one local man to another instead he turned away to watch as hard and ethan cobb carried the distorted body free of the ashes truslows inquisition of the captured cavalryman had revealed that it was not adam who had been responsible for this massacre but a man called blythe yet starbuck still felt an extraordinary bitterness toward his erstwhile friend adam had ridden the high moral horse for so long preaching about the sanctity of the norths cause and now he rode with men who slaughtered women starbuck colonel swynyard called from the road beside the burned wagon park starbuck shouted at truslow to take charge then went to join swynyard five dead women starbuck delivered the final tally in a harsh voice two cooks mccombs wife and the upstairs girls the whores they were decent enough girls starbuck said one of them anyway i thought the tavern was out of bounds it was starbuck said and i didnt think you had any money i dont but she was a sweet girl sweet on you you mean swynyard said tartly then sighed i do pray for you starbuck i do indeed fitzgerald her name was starbuck said from ireland her husband ran off and left her with a pile of debts and she was just trying to pay them off he stopped suddenly overwhelmed with the misery of such a life and death poor kath he said he had been hoping sally truslow might help the girl maybe by finding her a more lucrative job in richmond but now kath fitzgerald was a shrunken corpse waiting for a shallow grave i need a goddamned drink starbuck said bitterly no you dont swynyard said because you and i are summoned to headquarters to see jackson and hes not a man to visit if youre stinking with whiskey oh christ starbuck blasphemed he had hoped that the nights raid would have finished his troubles but now it seemed jackson himself had taken an interest in his derelictions what does mad jack want how would i know swynyard said he scuffed a foot in the road which was still imprinted with the hoofmarks of the nights raiders hes seeing faulconer now wholl be bitching about us but we were right about dead marys ford swynyard said in a hopeful voice maybe jackson will acknowledge that maybe starbuck said but without any real hope that justice might be done general washington faulconer would doubtless have his wrist slapped but colonels and captains especially povertystricken colonels and captains made far more convenient scapegoats for disasters last night when he had captured the prisoner at the ford starbuck had been sure that he could defeat faulconers malevolence but in his interview with major hotchkiss jacksons aide starbuck had not felt a flicker of understanding or sympathy just a dry disapproval justice he reckoned was a rare commodity he swore at lifes unfairness then changed the subject by fishing a scrap of paper from his pocket did you ever hear of a fellow named joe galloway he asked the colonel swynyard thought for a second then nodded cavalryman regular army never met him but ive heard the name why he led last nights raid starbuck described what he had learned about galloways horse how it was composed of renegade southerners who could ride the paths of dixie with the same familiarity as rebel horsemen and how a captain billy blythe had led the detachment that had surrounded and savaged the tavern with their repeating rifles how did you find all this out swynyard asked prisoner talked starbuck said im surprised he told you so much swynyard said staring disconsolate at the scorched field where the remnants of the burnedout ammunition wagons stood he struck up a kind of rapport with truslow starbuck said it seems galloway has a farm near manassas that hes using as his depot and i was kind of hoping we might get back there one day to do what that starbuck said pointing to the ruins of the tavern swynyard shrugged i doubt well get the chance young moxey says were both to be posted to coastal defenses in the carolinas moxeys a poxed piece of ratshit starbuck said no doubt you once said that about me the colonel said oh no sir starbuck grinned i was never that complimentary about you swynyard smiled then shook his head ruefully be ready to leave in an hour starbuck ill arrange a horse for you and stay sober you hear me thats an order ill stay sober sir i promise for he had a whore to bury and a general to see major galloways raiders did not survive entirely unscathed the unfortunate sparrow was captured a marylander was missing while corporal harlan kemp the virginian whose local knowledge had led the raiders to dead marys ford had been shot in the belly all those casualties had been caused during the brief and unexpected fight at the river which had left kemp in terrible pain he spent the homeward journey drifting in and out of consciousness and every few minutes he would beg one of the men supporting him in his saddle to do him the same favor they would render to a badly wounded horse just shoot me for the love of christ please shoot me adam carried kemps rifle and one of the captured flags he was continually looking for any sign of pursuit but no rebel pursuers appeared as the raiders crossed the robertson river then the hazel and the aestham each waterway more swollen with storm water than the last until just after midday they came to the flooded rappahannock and were forced to ride six miles upstream to find a passable ford then safe at last on the northern bank they rode east toward the rail depot at bealeton two miles outside the town a shell screamed overhead to explode in a gout of mud and smoke just a hundred paces behind the horsemen galloway ordered the stars and stripes unfurled a second shell howled past to smash into a pine tree splitting the wood with a smoky crack that startled the tired horses so that the troopers had to struggle with their reins and slash back with spurs they could see the roofs of bealeton beyond the trees and see the smoke of the artillery edging one of those patches of woodland more smoke this time from a locomotive plumed up from the town itself the rebels cant have captured the place galloway said and told the standardbearer to wave the flag more vigorously the field gun did not fire again instead an apologetic northern artillery officer rode out to investigate the horsemen and to explain that general pope was nervous of rebel cavalry who might be probing the federal armys new positions on the rappahannocks north bank weve seen no secesh horse galloway told the artilleryman then spurred on into a town crammed with confused soldiery troops that had embarked in alexandria and manassas expecting to arrive in culpeper court house now waited for new orders and meanwhile the rails south of bealeton were being torn up and carried north for safekeeping and the trains employed on that task were blocked by the stalled troop trains that had been heading south so that now there were no fewer than eight trains marooned at the depot the towns roads were equally clogged there were men who had lost their regiments regiments that had lost their brigades and brigades that had lost their divisions staff officers sweated and shouted contradictory orders while the townspeople most of whom were rebel sympathizers watched with amusement galloway and adam added to the noise as they demanded a doctor for corporal kemp while every few moments a nervous northern gunner on the outskirts of the town would contribute to the chaos by loosing a shell into the steaming heat of the countryside in an attempt to see off some nonexistent southern horsemen makes you proud to be a yankee dont it galloway said sourly as he forced a path through the chaos i thought these boys were supposed to be marching down richmonds main street not running away a doctor was found and harlan kemp could at last be lifted from his horse his pants were stuck to the saddles leather by a mass of dried blood and had to be cut away before the moaning man could be carried into the presbyterian church lecture hall that was serving as a hospital a doctor gave the corporal ether then extracted the bullet from his guts but claimed there was little more that could be done for him in bealeton theres a hospital car on one of the trains the harried doctor said and the sooner hes back in washington the better he did not sound hopeful adam helped carry kemp on a stretcher to the depot where nurses of the christian sanitary commission took the sweating and shivering corporal under their care the hospital car was a sleeping car requisitioned from the new york central and still possessed its peacetime cuspidors fringed curtains and engraved lamp shades though now the luxurious bunks were attended by four nurses and two army doctors who were protected by a pair of faded red flags that hung at either end of the cars roof to proclaim that the vehicle was a hospital perforated zinc screens in the cars roof were supposed to provide ventilation but there was no wind and so the car stank of castor oil urine blood and excreta major galloway attached a label to kemps collar that gave his name rank and unit put a few coins into a pocket of the corporals uniform coat then he and adam climbed down from the pustulant car to walk slowly past a heap of coffins carrying stenciled labels directing their contents homeward there were corpses going to pottstown pennsylvania goshen connecticut watervliet new york biddeford maine three lakes wisconsin springfield massachusetts allentown pennsylvania lima ohio and adam reading the roll call of town names and knowing that each represented a family distraught and a town in mourning winced faulconer major galloway an imperious voice broke into adams reflections at first neither he nor major galloway could see who had summoned them then they saw a whitehaired man waving vigorously from a window further up the train wait there the man shouted wait there it was the reverend elial starbuck who in deference to the oppressive heat was wearing a linen jacket over his shirt and geneva bands having attracted their attention he worked his way out of the crowded passenger car and jumped down to the trackside where he pulled on a ragged straw hat that had replaced his lost top hat you have news he demanded good news i trust we need good news you observe we are retreating again the preacher made this speech as he plunged toward the two cavalrymen dividing the crowds with the aid of his ebony cane i fail to understand these things i truly do we have raised an army the largest that god has seen fit to put upon the face of the earth yet whenever a rebel scowls at us we scuttle backward like trespassing children fleeing a householder the reverend elial starbuck made this trenchant criticism despite the presence of a number of senior federal officers who scowled at his words but there was an authority in the reverend starbucks presence that subdued any attempt to contradict his opinions no one is sure anymore if they can capture richmond or whether they will simply defend the rappahannock there is confusion the reverend starbuck made the accusation darkly if i administered a church the way this government runs an army then i daresay satan would turn boston into an outpost of hell without so much as a bleat of opposition its too bad too bad i had hoped to return home with better news than this to boston youre returning so soon major galloway asked politely i undertook to be back in my pulpit by months end if i believed the capture of richmond was imminent then i would beg my congregations indulgence and stay with the army but i can no longer believe any such thing i had hoped your horsemen might inspire the army i recall some talk of making raids on richmond this accusation was accompanied by a scowl from the preacher we shillyshally major we linger we tremble at the slightest sign of the enemy we leave the lords work undone preferring timidity to boldness it grieves me major it truly grieves me but i am making notes and i shall report my findings to the northern people major galloway tried to reassure the preacher that popes retreat was merely a temporary precaution intended to give the north time to build its army into an irresistible force but the reverend starbuck would have none of such reasoning he had learned from one of popes aides that the retreat behind the rappahannock had been calculated to take advantage of the defensive capability of the rivers steep northern bank we have gone on the defensive the reverend starbuck exclaimed in a disgusted voice would there have been an israel if joshua had merely defended the river jordan or a united states if george washington had done nothing but dig ditches behind the delaware the lords work major is not done by digging and tarrying but by smiting the enemy and it shall be when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees then shalt thou go out to battle for god is gone forth before thee to smite the host of the philistines does not the first book of chronicles promise us as much then why are we not hearkening to the mulberries and going forth the reverend starbuck asked the question magisterially im certain we shall be advancing soon galloway said wondering what mulberries had to do with the prosecution of war then alas i must read about your advance in the journal rather than witness it for myself if indeed i ever reach boston again this last sentence was uttered in savage reproof of the chaos in bealetons small depot the reverend starbuck had been waiting a full day to leave for manassas junction but his train was trapped in the town by three supply trains that were being unloaded no one knew how long that unloading would take nor even if the offloaded supplies might not need to be reloaded in preparation for a further retreat still we are not without our comforts the preacher said sarcastically so follow me and he led the two cavalrymen to the end of the depot where volunteer ladies from the christian sanitary commission were serving reconstituted lemonade buckwheat bread and ginger cakes the reverend starbuck wiped the sweat from his face with an enormous handkerchief then used his cane to force a way to the trestle table where he demanded three servings of the refreshments one of the ladies timidly pointed to a handlettered sign proclaiming that the comestibles were for the consumption of uniformed men only but one ferocious glance from the preacher quelled her small protest once the ginger cakes and lemonade were secured and a suitable spot found for their consumption major galloway gave the reverend starbuck the splendid news john popes army might be retreating but galloways horse had stung the enemy the major forgivably exaggerated the damage his raiders had inflicted on the rebels multiplying the wagons and ammunition destroyed at least fourfold and while admitting to his own casualties he claimed his men must have killed at least two score of rebels we left their camp smoking with fire sir galloway said and reeking of blood the reverend starbuck put down his mug of lemonade so he could join his hands in a prayerful clasp bless the lord he said who smote great nations and slew mighty kings the news is better still sir adam said for while kemp had been under the doctors knife adam had found paper and string and made a parcel addressed to the reverend elial starbuck on walnut street in boston he had been planning to send the parcel from the depot but now he could deliver the prize personally it was obvious from the consistency of the package that it contained cloth and the reverend starbuck prodding with his finger was scarce able to believe what he suspected it isnt he began then without waiting to finish his question he tore the paper and string greedily away to reveal a bundle of folded scarlet silk slashed with white and blue the preacher sighed as he held up a golden fringe of the rebel battle flag god bless you my dear boy he told adam god bless you adam intended to keep the faulconer standard for himself just as he intended to use his fathers saber and revolver but the battle flag the red silk flag with the eleven white stars on the blue saint andrews cross was a gift for the reverend elial starbuck a trophy dragged from the filthy heart of secession that the preacher could use to show his subscribers that their donations were not being wasted im not sure if you want to know this sir adam continued diffidently as the preacher gazed entranced at the beautiful silk but that flag comes from nates battalion but the mention of his sons name only enhanced the preachers pleasure you took nates tawdry rag away did you well done youll take it to boston sir major galloway asked i surely will we shall put it on display major we shall hang it for all to see and maybe we shall invite people to throw mud at it on payment of a small sum toward the war effort then we shall burn it next july fourth he gazed at the rich red silk and a shudder mixed of lust and loathing racked his body and your altars shall be desolate he said in his marvelous voice and your images shall be broken and i will cast down your slain men before your idols he that is far off shall die of the pestilence and he that is near shall fall by the sword and he that remaineth and is besieged shall die by the famine thus will i accomplish my fury upon them then shall ye know that i am the lord there were a few seconds of awed silence from the dozens of people who had turned to listen to the preacher who now to show that his peroration was done picked up his mug of lemonade the prophet ezekiel he added helpfully amen major galloway said weakly amen so what becomes of you now major the reverend starbuck asked as he bundled the flag together he had ripped the wrapping paper into useless shreds but he managed to salvage enough string to tie the big silk folds into an approximation of neatness well look to do some work here sir hurt the enemy again i hope its the lords work youre engaged in the preacher said so do it well lay their land waste major strike them down and god give your arm the strength of ten while you do it youll write a full account of your raid so i might publish it to our subscribers of course sir then on to victory on to victory the reverend doctor starbuck thrust his empty lemonade mug into adams hand and then carrying the rebel flag as proudly as though he had captured it himself went back to wait in his car galloway sighed shook his head in marvel at such energy then went to find someone anyone who might have orders for his cavalry colonel swynyard and a nervous captain starbuck waited all afternoon to see general thomas jackson and they were still waiting as dusk fell and as one of the generals aides brought a pair of lanterns out to the veranda of the house where jackson had his headquarters not that he sleeps in the house the aide said stopping to gossip he prefers the open air even when its raining starbuck forced himself to make conversation he did not feel like socializing not when he was facing an unpleasant interview but the aide seemed friendly enough just so long as it aint storming the aide clearly relished retailing stories of his masters eccentricities and hes up every morning at six to take a cold dip jaybird naked and shoulders under out here he uses that old horse trough and on a summer morning that might be pleasant enough but in winter ive seen old jack skim the ice off a tub before baptizing himself the aide smiled then turned as a black man appeared around the side of the house jim he called tell these gentlemen what the general likes to eat he dont like to eat nothing the black man grumbled he eats worse than a heathen its like cooking for a fighting cock mr lewis is the generals servant the aide said not his slave his servant and hes a great man jim lewiss admiration for the eccentric jackson was every bit as heartfelt as the uniformed aides there aint more than a dozen men like the general in all the world and thats a straight fact and there aint any man in the wide world like the general for the whippin of yankees and thats a straighter fact but he still eats worse than a goat nothing but stale bread dirtplain meat egg yolk and buttermilk the aide said and fruit in the morning but only in the morning he reckons that fruit ingested in the afternoon is bad for the blood you see while the generals real bad for yankee blood lewis said with a laugh he sure is lethal for yankee blood lewis dipped a pail in the generals bathtub then carried the water toward the kitchen at the back of the house while the aide carried his second lantern to the far end of the porch voices sounded inside the house where candlelight shone at a muslincurtained window win battles starbuck and you can be whatever it pleases you to be swynyard said bitterly you can be mad you can be eccentric you can even be rich and privileged like faulconer the colonel paused watching the dark fall over the far woods and fields where the host of campfires glimmered you know what faulconers fault is being alive starbuck said sourly he wants to be liked swynyard ignored starbucks venom he really believes he can make the men like him by treating them leniently but it wont ever work men dont like an officer for being easy they dont mind being treated like dogs like slaves even so long as you give them victory but treat them soft and give them defeats and theyll despise you forever it dont matter what kind of man you are what kind of rogue you are just so long as you lead the men to victory he paused and starbuck guessed the colonel was reflecting on his own career rather than faulconers colonel swynyard captain starbuck another aide appeared in the doorway his voice was peremptory and his manner that of a man who wants to discharge an unpleasant duty quickly this way starbuck plucked his coat straight then followed swynyard through the hall and into a candlelit parlor that was much too small for the trestle table that served as a stand for the generals maps not that starbuck had time to take in the rooms furnishings for as soon as he entered he felt himself come under the fierce and offputting gaze of the extraordinary figure who glared at the two visitors from the tables far side jackson said nothing as the two men were shown in the general was flanked by major hotchkiss and another staff officer swynyard hat in hand gave a short sharp nod in salute while starbuck just stood to attention and stared at the gaunt roughbearded face with its bright wild eyes and malevolent frown a face starbuck suddenly realized that was uncommonly like colonel swynyards own ravaged visage swynyardjackson finally acknowledged his visitors once of the th us infantry but not a good record accused of drunkenness i see he had a sheaf of papers that he glanced at continually you were courtmartialed and acquitted wrongly swynyard said causing jackson to look up from the papers in surprise wrongly the general asked like many artillery officers he was notoriously hard of hearing his eardrums having been hammered by too many cannon blasts did you say you were wrongly acquitted wrongly sir swynyard spoke louder i should have been cashiered sir for i truly was drunk sir frequently drunk sir helplessly drunk sir unforgivably drunk sir but thanks to the saving grace of our lord jesus christ sir i shall be drunk no more jackson confronted with this ready admission of guilt seemed rather taken aback he drew another sheet of paper from the sheaf and frowned as he read it brigadier general faulconerhe said the name with a wry tone of distaste talked with me this morning afterwards he saw fit to write me this letter in it swynyard he says that you are a drunkard while you young man are described as an immoral womanizing and ungrateful liar the hard bluegray eyes looked up at starbuck hes also a fine soldier general swynyard put in also the general pounced on the word starbuck suddenly resented the inquisition he had been trying to win a damn war not run a sunday school also he said flatly and then after a very long pause sir hotchkiss looked intently down at his feet two of the candles on the map table were guttering badly sending streams of sooty smoke to the yellowed ceiling in the back of the house a voice began singing how sweet the name of jesus sounds jackson looked momentarily annoyed by the sound then he slowly lowered himself into a straightbacked chair or rather he perched on the edge of the cane seat with his spine held rigidly parallel to but not touching the back starbuck supposed that his stupid belligerence had just destroyed any chance of receiving lenience but it was too late to back down now jackson turned his gaze back to swynyard when did you find christ colonel he asked and swynyard answered with a passionate testimony of seeing the light on the battlefield of cedar mountain for a moment he ceased to be a soldier talking to his superior but became just a simple man talking to his brother in christ he told of his former sinfulness and of his continual drunkenness and he contrasted that fallen condition with his newfound state of grace it was a testimony of salvation like the thousands of others that starbuck had heard the same kind of transforming story that had comprised the bulk of his youthful reading and he supposed that the general too must have heard a myriad of such tales but jackson was plainly enthralled by swynyards tale and now colonel jackson asked when the testimony was done do you still crave ardent spirits every day sir swynyard said fervently every minute of every day but with the help of our lord jesus christ i shall abstain the great danger of temptation jackson said in a rather puzzled voice is how very tempting it is he turned his gaze on starbuck and you young man were brought up in a christian household were you not yes sir a tabby cat had started to wind itself around starbucks ankles rubbing its flanks on his frayed trouser ends and playing with the tags of his bootlaces this letter claims youre a northerner jackson said gesturing at faulconers letter which now lay on the table from boston sir so why then are you fighting for the south jackson frowned that was the womanizing sir starbuck said defiantly he sensed swynyard stir beside him and he guessed the colonel was trying to convey the message that starbuck should quell his combativeness but starbuck was annoyed by the implication that he needed to prove his loyalty to these southerners the cat was purring loudly go on jackson said in a dangerously toneless voice starbuck shrugged i followed a woman south sir then stayed on here because i liked it jackson stared into starbucks face for a few seconds he seemed to dislike what he saw and looked down at the papers instead we have to decide what to do with the brigade it isnt in a good state eh hotchkiss hotchkiss gave a very small shrug no reserve ammunition no transport and one regiment virtually officerless jackson looked at swynyard well well just have to take the ammunition from the enemy sir swynyard said jackson liked that answer he turned his gaze back to starbuck who was suddenly and belatedly realizing that this interview was not a disciplinary affair but something altogether different what is this armys greatest failing jackson asked starbuck starbucks mind whirled in panic its greatest failing for a second remembering the mornings executions he was tempted to say desertion but before his tongue could frame the word a previous thought blurted itself out straggling sir some regiments lost a quarter of their number through men falling out of the ranks during long marches and though a good number of those stragglers reappeared within a day or two some went missing forever he had given the general a good answer but even so starbuck wished he had thought for a moment longer and given a more considered response then astonishingly he saw he had answered correctly for jackson was nodding his approval and how have you prevented straggling in your unit starbuck i just tell the sons of bitches theyre free to go sir starbuck said you do what jackson barked in his high voice hotchkiss looked alarmed and the other staff officer shook his head as though he pitted starbucks stupidity i just tell them they can leave the regiment sir but i also tell them that they aint allowed to leave with any property of the confederate government just in case they straggle all the way home or into the enemys arms so i tell them theyre free to go but first i strip the sons of bitches stark naked and confiscate their guns then i kick them out jackson stared at him you do that truly it was hard to tell whether the general approved or not but starbuck could not back out of the tale now i did it once sir he admitted just the once but i only needed to do it the once sir because we havent had another straggler since except for the sick sir and theyre different starbucks voice tailed away as the general began to behave in the strangest fashion first he brought up a bony knee then he clasped the raised knee in both his huge hands and after that he rocked his body back as far as the stiff chair would allow then he put his head back and opened his mouth as wide as it would go though without uttering any sound at all starbuck wondered if the general was suffering a seizure but then he saw the two staff officers grinning and he realized that this odd display was jacksons peculiar method of displaying amusement the general stayed in the weird pose for a few seconds then rocked forward again let his knee go and shook his head he was silent for a few more seconds then turned to swynyard how old are you colonel fiftyfour sir swynyard said sounding rather ashamed fiftyfour was old for a soldier unless like lee he was the commander in chief jackson himself was thirtyeight while most of the fighting was done by boys yet to see their twentyfirst birthday but jacksons point was not about the optimum age for a soldier but was instead a theological comment i was myself of mature years before i found christ colonel i do not say one should be of ripe age before conversion but nor should we blame the young for failing to do what we ourselves did not do as for your womanizinghe looked at starbuck marriage will cure that if selfdiscipline fails i find that daily immersion in cold water and regular exercise helps chop wood young man or swing from a branch you can leap fences but exercise exercise he suddenly stood and snatched up washington faulconers letter which he held into a candle flame he held the paper in the flame until it was well alight then moved it gently and safely into the empty fireplace where he watched it burn into ash war brings change he said as he turned back to his visitors it changed me it will change you i confirm your appointments you colonel swynyard will take over faulconers brigade and you major starbuck will take command of his legion in return you will fight for me and fight harder than you have ever fought in your lives we are not here to defeat the enemy but with gods help to destroy him and i look for your help in that ambition if i receive that help i will accept it as your duty but if you fail then i shall send you both after faulconer good night to you starbuck could not move he had entered the room expecting punishment and had instead received promotion and not just promotion but command of his own regiment my god he had command of the legion and suddenly he felt terrified of the responsibility he was only twentytwo surely much too young to command a regiment then he remembered micah jenkins the georgian who had led his whole brigade hard and deep into the yankee army at seven pines and jenkins was not much older than starbuck himself there were other officers in their twenties who were leading regiments and brigades so why should starbuck not be ready good night gentlemen jackson said pointedly starbuck and swynyard were both startled from their astonishment they allowed themselves to be led outside by an aide who offered his own congratulations on the lanternlit porch major hotchkiss the aide said recommended you both he felt that the brigade had suffered enough without having outsiders thrust on it give him our thanks swynyard said and if i might give some advice gentlemen the aide said you should have your men cook as many rations as they possess and have them ready for a very early march in the morning he smiled and walked back into the house my god swynyard said faintly a brigade the colonel seemed moved nearer to tears than to exultation he was silent for a few seconds and starbuck guessed he was praying then swynyard led the way to where their horses were picketed i wasnt altogether honest with you earlier the colonel said as he untied his horse i knew hotchkiss was sounding me out about the legions new commanding officer but i dared not raise your hopes or mine i confess starbuck clumsily mounted the borrowed horse medlicott wont be happy the object of this war colonel swynyard said tartly is to correct abraham lincolns political misconceptions not to make captain medlicott happy he waited until starbuck had settled himself in the saddle i thought you were going to upset jackson starbuck grinned old jack can hardly be expected to approve of womanizing can he swynyard looked up at the sky the last clouds had gone and there was a splendor of stars arching over their heads i suppose i shouldnt pass on rumor the colonel said but there are stories that old jack had a love child once long ago the stories are probably untrue but who knows maybe you have to know sin before you can hate it maybe the best of christians are made from the worst of sinners so theres hope for me yet starbuck asked teasingly only if you win battles starbuck only if you win battles the colonel looked at the younger man the legion wont be an easy job starbuck no sir but im the best man for it starbuck smiled at the colonel im an arrogant son of a bitch but by god i can fight and now he had a whole regiment to fight for him and he could not wait to start general thomas jackson put the interview with swynyard and starbuck out of his mind the very second that they left the room concentrating instead on the maps that major hotchkiss had painstakingly drawn for him those handmade maps spread edge to edge on the trestle table where their corners were weighted down by candlesticks showed the country north of the rappahannock the country where robert lees impudent and daring idea would be put to the test it was an idea that jackson liked because it was challenging and because it held immense possibilities which meant it also held enormous risks the enemy was digging in beyond the steep northern bank of the rappahannock inviting the rebels to throw away their lives in vain attacks across the deep river the enemy doubtless planned to stay behind the river while more and more of mcclellans regiments joined their ranks until at last their numbers were overpowering and they felt confident of sweeping lees ragged army clean out of history so lee in response was proposing to break one of the fundamental rules of war lee was planning to split his already outnumbered army into two smaller armies each one horribly vulnerable to attack that vulnerability was the risk but it was a risk predicated on the likelihood that john pope would not attack but would instead sit tight behind his steep riverbank and wait for mcclellans regiments to swell his ranks so lee planned to divert popes attention by making threatening movements on the rappahannocks southern bank and while pope watched that diversion thomas jackson would march westward with the smaller rebel army jackson would march with just twentyfour thousand men who would go west then north and then with gods help eastward until they had hooked far and deep into the enemys rear and once behind popes lines that small rebel army would cut and slash and burn and destroy until john pope would be forced to turn back to destroy it then the small army the vulnerable army would have to fight like the devil itself to give lee time to come to its aid but at least the rebels would be fighting on ground of their own choosing and not attacking across a blooddyed river jacksons small army was the anvil and lees bigger army the hammer and by gods good grace john popes army would be caught between the two but if the hammer and anvil failed to come together then the history books would say that lee and jackson had thrown away a country by breaking the basic rules of war by mere tomfoolery but tomfoolery was the only weapon the rebels had left and it might just work so tomorrow in the dawn tom fool jackson would march they marched they marched like they had never marched in their lives before and like they hoped they would never have to march again they marched like no troops had ever marched and they did it through a day as hot as hell and as dry as hells bones and through a thick dust kicked up by the men and horses who marched in front a dust that coated their tongues and thickened their throats and stung their eyes they marched on broken boots or with no boots at all they marched because old mad jack had told them he expected them to march but no one knew why they were marching or where first they marched west into a plump country unvisited by forage parties from either army where the folk greeted the leading regiments with crackers cheese and milk but there was not enough food to serve all the men who trudged past regiment after regiment brigade after brigade the long hurting line of jacksons foot cavalry heading west into america with dust on their faces and blood in their boots and sweat in their beards where are you going boys an old man shouted at the troops going to lick the yankees pa one man found the energy to call back but no one except the general really knew their destination lick em good boys lick the sumbitches good and hard the legion had been woken at three in the morning by bugles that had stirred weary men from a shallow sleep the soldiers grumbled and cursed at old jack then blew their fires alive to boil their foultasting coffee starbuck issued all the ammunition the legion possessed each man would carry thirty rounds half the usual issue but that was all the cartridges that were left him the men would carry their thirty rounds their weapons their bedroll and a haversack with as much hardtack and boiled beef as they could carry but they could carry nothing else all knapsacks and heavy baggage were to be left south of the rappahannock under a corporals guard of wounded and sick men too weak to march daniel medlicott whose promotion to major had been washington faulconers final gift to the legion came with sergeant major tolliver to make a formal protest at starbucks orders if the legion met an enemy they said then the men could not fight properly with only half an issue of ammunition starbuck nervous at this first challenge to his authority had delayed the confrontation by stooping to his campfire and lighting himself a cigar well just have to fight twice as hard then he said trying to turn away their unhappiness with levity it isnt a joke starbuck medlicott said of course it isnt a joke starbuck snapped the rejoinder louder than he had intended its war you dont give up fighting just because you dont have everything you want the yankees do that not us besides we aint fighting alone all of jacksons men are marching with us the sergeant major looked unhappy but did not press the argument starbuck suspected medlicott had talked the sergeant major into joining a protest that arose more from medlicotts pique than from a genuine concern and medlicott starbuck conceded did have cause to feel misused for one day the miller had thought himself the commander of the faulconer legion and then out of the blue the man he most disliked in the regiment had been promoted over his head medlicott maintained his protest had a more noble aim than salving his hurt pride you dont understand he told starbuck because youre not a local man but i am and these are my neighborshe waved a hand at the legionand its my duty to get them home to their wives and little ones makes you wonder why were fighting a war at all starbuck said medlicott blinked at the bostonian unsure how to understand the remark i dont think we should march he reiterated his protest heavily and it wont be my fault if theres disaster of course it wont be your fault starbuck spoke caustically itll be my fault just as itll be my fault if there aint a disaster a year before he thought his pride in being grammatical would never have allowed him to say aint but now to his private amusement his boston accent was following his allegiance south and your duty major he went on is not to make sure your neighbors get home but to make damn sure the yankees get home and if the sumbitches dont have the sense to go of their own accord then your duty is to send them back to their wives and little ones inside boxes thats your duty good morning to you both he turned away from the two unhappy men captain truslow truslow shambled over just truslows good enough he said your companys at the rear starbuck said and you know what to do if you find stragglers he paused and that includes straggling officers truslow nodded his bleak assent in addition to commanding company h truslow also had command of the regiments eight surviving draught horses that had once pulled the ammunition wagons and supply carts now without any vehicles to drag they would serve as ambulances for the men who genuinely could not keep up the pace the legion marched at dawn the order to leave their heavy baggage behind had alerted the men to the fact that this was to be no ordinary march no stroll through the countryside from one bivouac to another but no one had been prepared for a march as hard as this thomas jackson usually allowed his men a tenminute rest every hour but not today today they marched without any rest stops and there were staff officers beside the road to make sure no one dawdled and there were more staff officers waiting at the first ford to make certain no man paused to take off his boots or roll up his pants just keep marching the staff officers shouted keep going come on the troops obeyed squelching out of the ford to leave wet footprints that dried swiftly under the hot august sun the sun rose still higher it had been one of the hottest summers in living memory yet today it seemed as though the heat would reach new heights of discomfort sweat drove trickles through the layers of dust that caked mens faces sometimes when the road ran across the summit of a shallow crest they would see the line of infantry stretching far ahead and far behind and they guessed that a whole corps was on the march but where it was going only god and old jack knew they did not march in step but loped along in the gait of experienced infantrymen who knew they would have to endure this agony a whole day through close up the sergeants shouted whenever a gap appeared in a companys files and the call would echo up and down the long shambling line close up close up they passed parched fields dried ponds and empty barns farm dogs growled from the roads verges and sometimes started fights with the soldiers pet dogs such fights were usually popular diversions but today the sergeants kicked the beasts apart and beat the country dogs away with rifle butts keep going close up every hour or so one of the cavalry patrols that were screening the march from the enemys horsemen would canter past the legion on its way to take up new positions far ahead of the long column and the horsemen would answer the infantrymens questions by saying they had seen no enemy so far it seemed the yankees were oblivious to jacksons men as they moved across the hot summer landscape men hobbled as muscles first tightened and then seized with cramp the pain began in the calves then spread to the thighs some men like starbuck wore boots they had taken at cedar mountain and within a few miles those new boots had worn mens heels and toes to bloody blisters starbuck took his boots off and tied them round his neck then marched barefoot for a few hundred yards he left small bloody footprints in the dust then the blisters dried but went on hurting his feet hurt his legs ached there was a stitch in his side his throat burned his bad tooth throbbed his lips were cracked his eyes stung with the sweat and dust and this was just the start of the march some officers rode horses swynyard was mounted as were major medlicott and captain moxey moxey was now back with the legion starbuck had not wanted him but nor did swynyard want him to stay as an aide and so moxey was now the captain of company b the newly promoted major medlicott had gone to company a with the consolatory honor of commanding the legions four rightflank companies moxey had the next company sergeant patterson now lieutenant patterson had command of c while murphys old lieutenant ezra pine was now the captain of d company the left four companies had sergeant howes now a lieutenant in command of e a captain leighton who had been borrowed from haxalls arkansas regiment to command company f captain davies took over medlicotts old company g and truslow whom starbuck had insisted on promoting into a full captain was in charge of company h it was a ramshackle list of officers cobbled together from disaster and the men in the legion knew it was makeshift and did not like it starbuck understood the disquiet most men did not want to be soldiers they did not want to be torn away from home and women and familiarity and even the most reckless young mans sense of adventure could be quickly eroded by miniй bullets and parrott gun shells what held these reluctant warriors to their duty were discipline friendship and victory give them those things starbuck knew and the men of the faulconer legion would believe they were the best damn soldiers in all the damned world and that there was not a man alive or dead in any uniform in any country of any era who could lick them in a fight but the legion had no such belief now its sense of comradeship had been shattered by galloways raid and by the disappearance of washington faulconer most of the legions men had known faulconer since childhood he had dominated their civilian lives as he had their military existence and whatever his faults unkindness had never been among them faulconer had been an easy master because he had wanted to be liked and his disappearance had unsettled the ranks they were ashamed too because the legion was the only regiment that marched without colors every other unit marched with flying banners but the legion to its disgrace had none so as they marched starbuck spent time with each company he did not force himself on them but instead began by ordering them to close up and march faster and then he would just march alongside and endure the embarrassed or unfriendly looks that told him most of his men believed he was too young to be their commanding officer he knew those looks did not mean he was unpopular for in the spring when the legion had held its final election for field officers nearly twothirds of the men had written starbucks name on their ballots despite washington faulconers opposition but that springtime defiance had not meant they wanted the young northern rebel to be their commanding officer not at twentytwo and not at the expense of men from their own virginian community and so starbuck marched with them and waited for someone to throw the first question the conversation he had with company g was typical enough where are we going billy sutton newly made up to sergeant wanted to know old jack knows and he aint saying are we going to see general faulconer again that question came from a man who had once worked on washington faulconers land and who doubtless wanted to know that his old job would be waiting for him at the wars end reckon you will starbuck answered hes just gone on to higher things cant keep a man like general faulconer down you should know that so wheres he gone the question was hostile richmond there was another silence except for the sound of boots slapping the road rifle stocks knocking against tin canteens and the hoarse rasp of men breathing dust drifted off the road to coat the bushes a reddish gray story is that old jack gave faulconer the back of his hand sergeant berrigan asked is that what you hear major starbuck noted the use of his new rank and guessed that berrigan was a supporter he shook his head way i hear it is that old jack just reckoned general faulconer could be more use in richmond faulconer werent never happy with all this marching and sleeping rough you all know that he wasnt reared to it and he never got a taste for it and old jack just agreed with him that was a shrewd enough reply intimating that faulconer was not as tough as his men most of the legion did not really want to believe that their general had been dismissed for that truth reflected on themselves and so they were ready enough to embrace starbucks kinder version of faulconers sudden disappearance what about colonel bird a man asked peckerll be back soon starbuck assured them and hell have his old job back and captain murphy another man called last i heard he was doing real well hell be back too the company trudged on are we still the faulconer legion a corporal asked i reckon starbuck said most of us come from there the answer was an evasion for given time starbuck intended to change the regiments name just as swynyard planned to change the brigades name they going to make tony murphy a major like you that surly question came from a tall scowling man called abram trent who sounded deliberately unfriendly trents question suggested that starbucks promotion had come too quickly and at the expense of men who were native to faulconer county starbuck met the question headon aint my decision trent but if you reckon i shouldnt be a major then ill be real happy to discuss it with you just as soon as we stop walking you and me together no one else the men liked an officer who was ready to use his fists and starbucks offer to fight made them respect him while the reluctance of any man to take up the offer only increased that respect starbuck knew that men like abram trent were the centers of resistance to his new and fragile authority and by facing them down he helped make their defiance impotent he finished by telling company g what little he knew about their destination old jack doesnt march us like dogs for the hell of it boys were on our way to give the yankees a whipping so save your breath and keep marching battle he thought and specifically victory in battle was the elixir that would restore the legions confidence but not every man was eager for battle late in the morning when few men had any breath left for questions or answers captain moxey caught up with starbuck moxey had been riding his horse but now he led the beast by its reins i cant go on he said starbuck gave the sallow moxey an unfriendly glance you look fresh enough to me mox it aint me starbuck but the horse starbuck edged the sling of his rifle away from the spot on his right shoulder that was being chafed to rawness though he knew that within seconds the sling would work its way back to the sore spot again your horse aint in command of a company mox you are shes lame moxey insisted starbuck looked at the mare which was indeed limping slightly on her right rear leg so let her loose he said it aint probably nothing more than a bad shoeing job moxey said so if you give me a pass starbuck ill find a blacksmith in a village near here and catch you up starbuck shook his head cant do that mox old jacks orders no ones to leave the march i wont be long moxey insisted hell its what weve always done on a march he tried to sound offhand but only succeeded in being petulant his family had money but as pecker bird had always maintained not quite enough money for its pretensions just as moxey did not possess quite enough grace to be a gentleman there was a perpetual air of grievance in moxey as though he resented a world that had inexplicably denied his family the last few thousand dollars that would have made its existence free of all financial worry while moxey the eldest son lived in terror that one day he might have to work for a living starbuck grimaced as he trod on a sharpedged stone he was marching barefoot and for a pace or two the pain stopped him from speaking then the brief agony subsided so what is it mox starbuck asked you dont want to fight moxey bristled are you accusing me of cowardice im asking you a goddamned question starbuck snapped moxey immediately backed down my horse is lame thats all starbuck shifted the rifle onto his left shoulder though immediately the sore spot on that shoulder began to chafe the orders are clear mox if your horse cant keep up then youre to leave it behind put her in a field where some farmer can find her shes a valuable mare moxey protested from faulconers stud i dont care if shes a goddamned unicorn from the stables of the sun starbuck said coldly if she cant keep up then she stays behind moxeys anger flared raw she aint a boston coal haulers nag starbuck shes real horseflesh worth near a thousand bucks starbuck changed his rifle back to his right shoulder just keep up with us mox horse or no horse you can boil your son of a bitch brains moxey said and turned angrily away starbuck felt a sudden rush of fresh energy he turned after moxey took him by his elbow and steered the smaller man forcefully into some trees that grew beside the road starbuck made himself smile so that the watching men would not construe the scene as a fight between two officers but as soon as he had moxey and his horse safe out of the columns sight he turned the smile off now listen here you son of a goddamned bitch you may not like it but im in charge of this goddamned regiment and youre nothing but a captain in it and youre going to do what every other man in this regiment has to do i dont care if you ride your damned horse till shes broke and i dont care if you leave her here to starve but i do care that youre leading company b when we face the damned yankees so what are you going to do mox march or ride moxey had gone pale i aint going to leave my horse shes too valuable starbuck pulled his revolver from its holster i tell you mox he said as he thumbed a percussion cap onto one of the cones they should have drowned you at birth and saved the rest of us a heap of trouble he spun the cylinder so that the primed chamber would be the next under the hammer then placed the revolver at the tired mares drooping head with the muzzle just above her eyes what the hell moxey began starbuck thumbed back the hammer as the mare stared at him with her soft brown eyes youre a leprous piece of ratshit mox starbuck said in a calm voice but it just happens that i need you despite that and if this here mares the obstacle to you doing your job why then the marell just have to go to heaven he tightened his finger on the trigger no moxey dragged the mare away from the revolver shell make it starbuck lowered the hammer just be sure you make it too mox goddamn it youre mad and im your commanding officer too mox and i reckon its a wise thing not to upset commanding officers especially mad commanding officers next time itll be your brains not the mares starbuck lowered the revolvers hammer then jerked his head toward the road get back to your company starbuck followed moxey back to the road company h was just passing and truslow spat toward moxeys disconsolate figure what was that about he asked starbuck mox and me were just looking at his horse deciding whether it could make the distance it could go on forever truslow said scathingly so long as he takes the damn stone out of its hoof is that all it is what the hell did you think it was truslow seemed not to be affected by either the days heat or the speed of the march he was one of the oldest men in the legion but also the toughest he did not much care for being made into an officer because rank had always been a matter of indifference to truslow but he did care about starbuck whom he perceived as being a clever man and a cunning soldier you need to watch moxey he said i guessed as much starbuck said i mean really watch him truslow moved a wad of chewing tobacco from one cheek to the other hes faulconers pet and faulconer wont want us to succeed starbuck shrugged what can moxey do about that he doesnt even want to be here he just wants to run away hes a sly one truslow said hes like a dog he needs a master see and now that faulconers gone hell like as not shove his nose into medlicotts pocket truslow sniffed you hear the rumor that medlicott is putting around he says that if hed kept command of the legion we wouldnt be fighting with jackson but sitting in the trenches at richmond says its a fact like hell it is starbuck said wincing as the weight of the rifle dug into his shoulder but its the kind of rumor men believe if they get unhappy truslow said and it aint any good pretending that everyone in the legion wants you to be in charge you forget how many men in this regiment depend on washington faulconer for a living they cut his trees fish his streams take his wages keep their money at his bank and live in his houses look at will patterson truslow was referring to the newly promoted commander of c company pattersons been trying to become an officer ever since the fighting began starbuck said he should be grateful to me that family aint grateful for nothing truslow said sergeant patterson the son of a stonemason in faulconer court house had twice tried to win election to officer but had failed both times starbuck was not certain patterson would make a good officer but there had been no one else he could promote and a good half of the patterson business comes from washington faulconer truslow went on so do you think will patterson can afford to be your supporter so long as he fights starbuck said thats all that matters but medlicott moxey and patterson truslow said pointedly are in charge of your three righthand companies so just how hard do you think those boys will fight when matters get bloody starbuck thought about that observation and did not like what he was thinking he kept his conclusion to himself grinning at truslow instead some people like me he said who coffman hes a boy too young to know better swynyard madder than a rabid bat pecker madder than two rabid bats murphy murphy likes everyone besides hes irish you i like you truslow said scornfully but just what kind of recommendation do you think that is starbuck laughed anyway he said after a few paces were not here to be liked were here to win battles so make sure you do truslow said make goddamn sure you do the tired hot men received a respite when they came close to the rappahannock so far the army had inarched well to the south of the river but now they were turning north to march past the yankees flank the rivers northern bank was a bluff up which the road climbed steeply and one of jacksons eighty guns had stuck on the slippery bank the teamsters used their whips and the nearest infantry were summoned to put their shoulders to the gun wheels but the delay inevitably backed the column up and the grateful men collapsed beside the road to rest their aching legs and catch their breath some men slept their faces given a corpselike look by the dust coated on their skin moxey surreptitiously removed the stone from his mares hoof then sat beside a glumlooking major medlicott most of the legions other officers gathered around starbuck hoping to glean more information than he had given to their men but starbuck insisted he did not know where they were going itll be the shenandoah valley captain davies opined and when no one contradicted him or even asked why he held the opinion he explained it anyway thats old jacks backyard right hes a terror in the shenandoah once the yankees know were in the shenandoah then theyll have to split their army in two not if they decide to let us rot in the shenandoah the newly promoted lieutenant howes commented so we wont rot there but cross into maryland davies suggested up the shenandoah straight across the potomac and over to baltimore once weve got baltimore we can attack washington i reckon a month from now we could be running abe lincoln out of the white house on one of his own fence rails daviess confidence was greeted with silence someone spat in the road while another man tilted his canteen to his mouth and held it there in hope of finding one last trickle of tepid water down the shenandoah truslow finally said not up down davies asked puzzled by the contradiction why should we march south downs north and ups south truslow said always has been and always will be you go to the valley and ask the way up and theyll send you south so well be going down the shenandoah not up up or down davies said offended by the correction who cares were still going north itll be a twoday march to the shenandoah another two to the potomac and then a week to baltimore i was in baltimore once captain pine said dreamily everyone waited to hear more but it seemed pine had nothing to add to his brief announcement up starbuck saw the battalion in front being ordered to their feet get your lads ready they crossed the river and headed north they did not follow the road which here tended westward but marched over fields and through woods across shallow streams and wide paddocks following a shortcut that at last brought the column to a dirt road leading northward starbuck held a hazy map of virginia in his head and he sensed how they were now marching parallel to the blue ridge mountains which meant that just as soon as they reached the manassas gap railroad they could turn west and follow the rails through the pass into the shenandoah valley and that valley was aimed like a gun at the hinterland of washington so maybe the excitable davies had it right starbuck tried to imagine the fall of washington he saw the ragged rebel legions marching through the conquered ring of forts that surrounded the yankee capital and then under the eyes of the silent shocked spectators who lined the streets parading past the captured white house he heard the victory music and saw in his minds vivid eye the starcrossed battle flag flying high above the white plump and selfsatisfied buildings and when the victory parade was finished the soldiers would take over the captured city and celebrate their triumph colonel lassan the frenchman had spent a week in the norths capital and had described the city to starbuck it was a place lassan had said devoid of hard sinews there was no industry in washington no wharves no factories no steamdriven mills to scream their whistles and shroud the sun with their filth it was lassan said a small city with no purpose but to manufacture laws and regulations an artificial city where slyness passed for intelligence and venality replaced industry it was peopled by pale lawyers plump politicians rich whores and faceless hordes of black servants and when the rebels marched in the lawyers and politicians would doubtless be long gone which meant that only the good souls would be left behind that tantalizing prospect served to keep starbucks mind off his blistered feet and burning muscles he dreamed of a soft city of captured champagne of wide beds and starched white sheets he dreamed of fried oysters and turtle soup and roast beef and tenderloin steaks and peach tarts all of it eaten in the company of the lawyers rich washington whores and that tantalizing thought suddenly reminded him of the goldenhaired woman he had glimpsed in her husbands open carriage behind the yankee lines at the battle of bull run she lived in washington and had invited starbuck to visit her but now for the life of him he could not remember her name her husband had been a northern congressman a pompous and dimwitted man but the wife had been golden and beautiful a vision whose memory was lovely enough to console a weary man marching through the small virginia towns where excited people applauded as their soldier boys went by yearold rebel flags hoarded through the months when the yankees had been the nearest troops were hung from balconies and eaves while small boys brought the troops buckets of tepid well water to drink starbucks pains seemed almost numb by the time the sun began to sink behind the serrated peaks of the blue ridge mountains ahead of him he saw the soldiers taking off their hats and he wondered why so many would make that gesture and then a staff officer cantered back along the line of march calling out that the men were not to cheer we dont want any yankee cavalry scouts to hear us the staff officer said so no cheering cheering why no cheering starbuck his thoughts wrenched back from imagined washington luxuries to his wretched sweating reality suddenly saw a pokerbacked figure standing atop a housesized rock beside the road it was jackson hat in hand watching his troops march by starbuck instinctively straightened his shoulders and tried to put some spirit into his step he snatched the ragged sweatstained hat off his long black hair and stared at the hardfaced man who seeing starbuck gave the smallest nod of recognition behind starbuck the legion pulled off their hats and fell into step to march past the legendary general no one cheered no one said a word but for the next mile it seemed to starbuck that there was an extra spring in every mans pace they marched on into the evening the western sky was a livid crimson streaked with gold a blaze of color that slowly shrank and faded into a gray twilight the marching pains came back relieved now by the slow fall in the days fierce temperature the men looked for signs of bivouacs that would tell them they had arrived at their destination but no troops were camped beside the road and no campflres drifted smoke into the evening instead the march went on and on into the darkness the moon rose to whiten the dust that coated the legions rifles and clung to the mens skin no one sang no one spoke they just marched on and on mile after damned mile under a gibbous moon to their right far off a great red glow showed where the smear of yankee cooking fires covered the northern virginia counties and starbuck trying to keep himself alert realized that jacksons army was already north of most of that glow which surely meant that the enemy was outflanked and for the first time he wondered if they were indeed planning to turn west into the shenandoah maybe he thought they would turn east instead to plunge like a dagger into the yankee rear in here in here no fires a voice startled starbuck out of his reverie and he saw a horseman gesturing toward a nightdark meadow get some rest the horseman was evidently a staff officer well be marching at dawn no fires theres a stream at the bottom of the hill for water no fires starbuck acknowledged the orders then stood in the meadows gate to watch the legion shamble past well done he called out to each company well done the men scarcely acknowledged his presence but just limped into the meadow that lay at the crest of a small hill moxey kept on the far side of his company so he would not even have to acknowledge starbucks existence truslows company went past last any stragglers starbuck asked none that you need know of starbuck walked beside truslow into the meadow a hell of a march he said tiredly and tomorrow we probably do it again truslow said you want me to set a guard starbuck was tempted to accept the offer but he knew the men of company h would think he had picked on them because they were his old company and so he deliberately chose company a instead major medlicott was too tired to complain starbuck limped round his mens bivouac he wanted to make certain that they had water to drink but most had already fallen asleep they had simply lain down on the grass and closed their eyes so that now they lay like the dead collected for burial at battles end a few walked to the stream to fill their canteens a few smoked a few gnawed at hardtack but most of the men just lay sprawled in the moonlight starbuck stayed awake with the pickets to the south the moon shone on yet more men tramping up the road but one by one the regiments turned into the fields to snatch their brief rest the regiments were still coming when starbuck woke medlicott to relieve him and still marching when he lay down to sleep he dreamed of marching of pain of a sunbitten day spent sweating northward on a stonehard road that led not to whores on white sheets in a fattened city but to battle on the morning that jacksons army marched west major galloway received orders to report to general mcdowell whose troops formed the right wing of popes army an odd and disquieting report had come from that western flank one of general bankss staff officers had been spying the enemy positions from a hill north of the rappahannock and had spotted a distant column of mixed infantry and artillery marching westward on the rivers far bank the road the rebels were following snaked up and down through hilly country so that the staff officer could only glimpse scattered parts of the column but he had estimated the number of regiments by counting their flags and reported that the rebel force must have numbered at least twenty thousand men the column had eventually disappeared in the heat haze that shimmered over the distant farmland and woods general banks forwarded the report to general mcdowell who in turn sent it on to general pope with an added comment that the column was probably aiming to cross the blue ridge mountains and then advance north through the shenandoah valley maybe mcdowell surmised the rebel force planned to attack the federal garrison at harpers ferry then cross the river and threaten washington pope added the report to all the other disquieting evidence of rebel activity jeb stuarts horsemen had raided one of the armys forward supply depots at catletts station the rebel horse had swarmed out of a rainswept night like fiends from hell and though the raid had done little real damage it had made everyone nervous there were more reports of rebel activity on popes eastward flank near fredericksburg while other observers saw clear signs that the rebels were planning a direct assault across the rappahannock river general pope felt like a juggler given one indian club too many and so he sent a stream of peremptory telegrams to the war department in washington demanding to know when he might expect mcclellans forces to join his own then rattled off a series of orders designed to repel all the threatened attacks at once union troops marched and countermarched under the hot sun none of them knowing quite what they were doing or where the enemy was supposed to be it was the cavalrys job to determine the enemys position and so major galloway was ordered to report to general mcdowell who in turn instructed him to lead his men into the swathe of empty country that lay between the northern army and the blue ridge mountains it was into that hazy spread of land that the mysterious enemy column had been seen marching and mcdowell wanted galloway to find it but just as galloway was ready to leave a new order arrived from general popes headquarters it seemed a party of rebel horsemen had recently crossed kellys ford and galloway was ordered to find out where that enemy was headed the major demanded a map it took him a long time to discover kellys ford he had somehow expected it to be near warrenton where mcdowells forces were anchored but instead he found it to be fifteen miles away on the armys eastern flank he protested the stupidity of one cavalry regiment being required to be in two places at once but was told that most of the armys cavalry was either immobilized through lack of fodder or else was busy galloway stared down at the map which jobs the most important he asked popes staff officer a colonel scratched in his beard i reckon that if the johnnies are crossing kellys ford then theyll be planning to cut us off from mcclellans boys he ran a nicotinestained finger up from the ford to show how a rebel force could cut popes men off from aquia creek where mcclellans army was coming ashore theyd split us up and thatd be bad real bad and this other column galloway asked gesturing toward the western landscape the colonel squashed a louse between two nicotinestained thumbnails in truth he had no idea which threat was the greater but nor did he want to consult his master who was already in a furious mood because of the constant stream of conflicting intelligence reports that were confusing all his careful plans my guess the colonel ventured and it is only a guess mark you is that the seceshers are dragging a false trail they probably want us to weaken ourselves by sending men to the shenandoah valley but the war isnt going to be won in the shenandoah but here on the river lines he slapped the map across the band of rivers that barred the roads between washington and richmond but on the other hand majorthe colonel was too canny not to qualify his judgmentwe sure would like to know just what in tarnation those twenty thousand johnnies are doing and everyone says your boys are the best for that kind of job they say you can ride behind the enemy lines isnt that right so galloway had no choice but to split his small force if the threat at kellys ford was the more dangerous then that justified using two troops of men and so galloway decided to go there himself and to take adams troop with him while billy blythe would take his men and investigate the mysterious western column you aint to get in a fight billy galloway warned blythe just find out where in hell the rebs are headed and then get word back to mcdowell blythe seemed happy with his orders his horses were tired and hungry but he did not have so far to ride as galloway and once in the saddle his men rode slowly they headed into an empty countryside that was parched by an afternoon sun that burned like a furnace blythe led his troop a few miles west of the last union pickets and then stopped at the summit of a small hill to stare into the empty landscape so just what in hell are we doing billy sergeant kelley asked blythe chasin our tails seth just chasin our bornagain tails sergeant kelley spat in disgust so what if the enemy are out here hell billy our horses aint been fed proper in three days and they aint been rested proper neither you reckon we can outrun jeb stuarts boys on these nags the men murmured their agreement blythe waved at the serene heathazed countryside what enemy sergeant do you see an enemy kelley frowned there was a smear of dust way off to the northwest but that was so far beyond the rappahannock that it was surely being kicked up by northern troops while to the west where the mysterious column had supposedly disappeared there was nothing but trees and sunglossed fields and gentle hills so what the hell are we doing here the sergeant asked again blythe smiled like i told you seth chasin our tails so why in hells name dont we do something more useful instead like give our horses a proper feed he tugged at his reins turning his horses head south i seem to remember a farm not so far away a den of rebel vipers it was but there was fodder there and maybe it didnt all burn up to hell and i reckon you and i have got unfinished business there kelley grinned you mean that rothwell woman and her children i hate children blythe said i do so hate young children but their mothers blythe smiled ah i do so love a ripe young mother twenty miles to the east major galloway found kellys ford guarded by a strong rebel garrison on the southern bank that garrison sniped ineffectually at galloways horsemen as they explored the northern side of the river where they discovered no hoofprints nor any other evidence of a rebel force across the river the local black population always the best source of information for northern scouts said that no confederates had crossed the river in two days and those men had only come across to get fodder for their horses galloway dutifully searched the riverbank for five miles east and west but neither he nor adam found any rebels the rumor had been false and galloway knowing his day had been wasted rode slowly home a dozen miles north of the ford was warrenton junction where the branch rails from warrenton joined the main orange and alexandria line confusion besieged the junction two trains loaded with guns and ammunition were trying to pass south to the bealeton depot while another was trying to haul twentyfour boxcars loaded with hardtack uniforms percussion caps and artillery shells down to warrenton meanwhile three empty trains and a hospital train waited in the pitiless sun for clearance northward the sweet smell of pinewood lay over the depot coming from the log stacks that waited to feed the locomotive furnaces the reverend elial starbucks passenger car was attached to the hospital train the preacher escaped the heat in the cars stifling interior by walking up and down in the trains long shadow where he was forced to watch as a succession of newly dead men were carried from the redflagged cars the men were not dying from their wounds but from heat prostration and their fate angered the reverend elial starbuck these were good decent young americans who had gone to fight for their country and their reward was to be dumped beside a rail track where their corpses crawled with flies if the hospital train did not move soon then every sick man in the cars would be dead and so the reverend starbuck discovered an engineer colonel who appeared to possess some authority over the railroad and of whom he demanded to know when the trains would be cleared north in boston the reverend starbuck assured the colonel we have such things as timetables we find them useful in boston sir the colonel retorted you dont have jeb stuart the delay on the railroad was caused by the raid stuart had made on catletts station the next depot on the line where the rebel cavalry had taken scores of prisoners captured a paychest and even snaffled up general popes best uniform coat a teeming rain had prevented the raiders from burning the bridge that carried the rails over cedar run yet even with the bridge intact the raid had inflicted chaos on the rail schedule but your train will be the first one north tomorrow afternoon the colonel promised the reverend starbuck youll be in washington by wednesday sir i had hoped to be in richmond by then the reverend said caustically the colonel bit back any retort and instead arranged for the hospital cars to be moved into the shade of a warehouse and for water to be brought to the surviving wounded some fugitive slaves who were now employed as laborers on the railroad were ordered to dig graves for the dead the reverend starbuck wondered if he should witness for christ to the laboring blacks but decided his mood was too bleak for effective evangelism his opinion of the army had slipped all week but now reached fulminating bottom in all his born days he had never witnessed any organization so chaotic so incapable or so sluggish the smallest boston grocery shop displayed more managerial acumen than these uniformed incompetents and it was no wonder that the lumpenskulled rebels were making such fools of the norths generals the preacher sat on the open platform at one end of his passenger car and as the sun sank huge in the west he wiped the sweat from his forehead and took on the pleasurable chore of making notes in his diary for a pungent letter he planned to send to the massachusetts congressional delegation five miles away in warrenton itself major galloway reported to the army headquarters he found the same colonel who had dispatched him that morning and who now seemed disappointed that no enemy had crossed kellys ford youre sure the colonel asked certain absolutely certain the colonel scratched at his beard found a louse and squashed it between his thumbnails what about the twenty thousand johnnies in the west the colonel asked i sent my secondincommand that way but he hasnt reported yet the colonel yawned then stretched his arms no news is good news eh if your fellow had found anything hed have doubtless sent word and no one else is squealing about twenty thousand rebels so its probably all moonshine pure moonshine which reminds me he turned in his chair and reached for two glasses and a whiskey bottle youll join me good he poured the whiskey but even if there are twenty thousand johnnies loose what damage can they do he paused thinking about his question then laughed at the very thought of the whole united states army being frightened of such a tiny force twenty thousand men he said disparagingly what harm can they do captain davies woke starbuck reveille sir starbuck thought he had to be dreaming no worse he thought he was not dreaming his muscles were strips of pain his bones were set solid starbuck up davies said starbuck groaned its dark they want us marching in twenty minutes oh no jesus no starbuck muttered he groaned again then turned onto one side the mere effort of rolling over hurt everything hurt he could not bear to think of trying to stand on his blistered feet water davies who had taken over picket duty from medlicott offered starbuck a canteen starbuck drank then felt for a cigar he had two left both preserved from harm by being wrapped in his hat he borrowed daviess cigar to light one of his own then coughed some life into his lungs jesus he said again then remembered he had to set an example and so he struggled to his feet he blasphemed again stiff davies asked why didnt i join the cavalry starbuck asked then tottered a few steps it was nightdark still without even a hint of dawn in the eastern sky stars were bright overhead while the moon hung low above the blue ridge to mark its forested draws deep black and starkest white he sat to pull on his boots it hurt just to tug them over his raw feet awake colonel swynyards voice asked i think i died and went to hell starbuck said as he forced himself to stand again maybe thats it colonel maybe none of this is real were all in hell nonsense were heavenbound praise him then i wish hed hurry starbuck complained around him the field heaved and groaned as waking men realized the ordeal that waited for them starbuck scratched at a louse transferred the one remaining cigar to his pocket pulled the hat onto his head slung his rolled blanket over his left shoulder and the rifle on his right and thus was ready to start breakfast was taken on the march for starbuck it was a slatehard slab of hardtack that gnawed at his aching tooth he tried to remember when he had last had a decent meal his uniform trousers were belted with rope that gathered in at least five inches of material that had been well stretched before the wars first battle then the blisters on his feet began hurting again and the sore spot on his right shoulder began to chafe and he forgot about food and just concentrated on walking through the pain the column still marched north once when the road rose to offer a view of the moonlit western hills starbuck saw the notch that marked where the manassas gap carried the railroad through the blue ridge and into the fertile shenandoah valley in the moonlight the gap looked a far way off and starbucks spirits fell at the thought of marching all that long way his muscles were slowly unknotting but only to hurt even more the legion passed between two rows of houses their windows dimly lit with candlelight a tethered dog barked at the passing soldiers and an unseen woman called from a window to offer the soldiers her blessings then abruptly the road climbed a steep few feet and starbuck almost tripped on a steel rail he recovered his footing and stepped safely over the metal to realize that the legion had at last reached the manassas gap railroad the road divided here one branch climbing west toward the blue ridge and the other going east toward the yankees a mounted staff officer dominated the junction and he was pointing the troops east so they were not going to the shenandoah valley after all but were instead to march toward the rising sun that climbed through the vast smear of smoke marking where a waking armys cooking fires burned they were to march east toward battle the sun rose like hellfire in their eyes it dazzled them and cast their shambling shadows long on the dusty road behind every now and then starbuck would see the rails of the manassas gap railroad lying alongside the road like twin streaks of reflected fire but no trains ran on those strips of molten steel all the locomotives and stock had been taken south or else commandeered by the yankees to shuttle their supplies from alexandria through manassas junction to their forces on the rappahannock and now starbuck realized stonewall jackson was behind those forces and maybe starbuck thought the yankees knew he was coming for how could twentyfour thousand men hope to avoid a hostile armys scouts ahead of the marching column lay a low range of hills so low that in peacetime the hills would scarcely have been noticeable but starbuck could see that the apparently innocuous slopes were more than steep enough to check an infantry attack and if the federals had put guns in the dark trees at the crest of those hills then jacksons long march must end in bloody defeat the road and the empty railroad arrowed side by side toward a pass through the low hills jacksons cavalry advanced either side of the rail embankment their carbines cocked as they nervously watched every fence and wood and house the passage through the unregarded hills was called thoroughfare gap and if the yankees had been shadowing jacksons march then thoroughfare gap was the place to put their ambush and as the steep walls of the pass narrowed the horsemen advanced ever more slowly and cautiously they tried not to think of hidden gunners waiting with taut lanyards or of lines of concealed infantry poised with loaded rifles every creak of a saddle or rustle of wind or clatter of a horseshoe on stone startled the scouting horsemens nerves then suddenly they reached the passs summit and the whole eastern countryside lay open before them and it was empty there were no limbers no guns no caissons no federals at all there was nothing but low hills and thick woods stretching into the long blue distance stonewall jackson had hooked his small army clean and undetected into the yankees unprotected belly now all he had to do was twist the hook and start the killing close up the officers shouted close up the men marched in silence too tired to talk or sing from time to time a man would break ranks to snatch a green apple or an ear of unripe corn from the farmlands on either side of the road while other men broke ranks to be ill behind a hedge but always they hurried on after their comrades and pushed themselves back into line the horses pulling the guns labored under the whips and their guns wheels ripped the roads surface into broken ruts that turned mens ankles but still they marched at the same cracking pace behind a cavalry vanguard that late in the morning rode into a small town where a federal band was practicing in the main street the band belonged to a regiment that had gone on a daylong route march leaving their musicians to entertain the sullen virginian townspeople those sullen people cheered up as the band fell slowly silent the music ended with one last astonished and froglike grunt of a saxhorn tuba as the musicians realized that the horsemen in the street were pointing guns straight at their heads the bandsmen had been assured that they were at least twenty miles from any enemy forces yet now they were faced by a graycoated pack of grinning men on dusty sweatfoamed horses lets hear you play dixie boys the cavalry leader ordered some of the bandsmen began to edge backward but the cavalry officer cocked his rifle onehanded and the bandmaster hastily turned around raised his hands to ready the musicians and then led them in a ragged rendition of the rebel anthem in the middle of the afternoon with the musicians now silent prisoners under guard general jacksons column struck southeast on a wide road that passed through harvested fields and plundered orchards the men could guess where they were going now for ahead of them was a great moving plume of smoke that showed where the orange and alexandria railroad carried the northern armys supplies south to the yankee troops every bullet every cartridge every slab of hardtack every percussion cap every shell every pair of boots every bayonet every small and large thing that an army needed to fight was being carried down that single track and jacksons leading infantry was now within earshot of the wailing whippoorwill cadence of the locomotives whistles they could even hear the distant and rhythmic clatter of car wheels crossing the rail joints the trains were running out from manassas junction which lay only a few miles to the north for a time jackson had been tempted by the thought of marching directly on the junction but it seemed inconceivable that the largest federal supply base in virginia would not be guarded by earthworks and guns and regiments of prime infantry so instead the general planned to cut the railroad at bristoe station which lay just four miles south of the depot local people said that bristoe station was guarded by a mere handful of cavalry and only three companies of northern infantry dusk was falling as the leading rebel infantry breasted a slight rise and started down the long slope to bristoe rebel cavalry had ridden ahead of the infantry but those horsemen were nowhere in sight and all the leading infantry could see were the twin rails gleaming empty in the days dying light and a scatter of clapboard houses from which kitchen smoke trickled skyward the small garrison had no idea that danger threatened a northern cavalryman stripped to the waist and with his suspenders dangling carried a canvas pail of water from a well to a horse trough another man played a fiddle assiduously practicing the same phrase over and over again men smoked pipes in the small warm breeze or read hometown newspapers in the last light of the setting sun a few men saw the infantry on the western road but they assumed the approaching soldiers must be federal troops the infantrys flags were flying but the sinking sun was huge and red behind the rebel column and so the yankees could make out no details of the approaching banners or uniforms the leading rebel regiment was from louisiana its colonel gave the order for his men to put percussion caps on the cones of their loaded rifles till now they had marched with their guns unprimed in case a stumbling man set off a cartridge and so alerted the enemy i guess we arrived here before the cavalry the colonel said to his adjutant as he scraped his sword clear of its scabbard the sound of the steel on its scabbards throat seemed to release the village to hell for just as the colonel pulled his sword into the suns scarlet light so the hidden rebel horsemen launched their charge from a belt of trees north of the settlement bugles ripped the sky and hooves pounded the earth as a screaming line of rebel cavalry broke from cover and stormed down on the village the man with the pail of water stood frozen for a second then he dropped the pail and ran toward a house halfway there he changed his mind and ran back toward his tethered horse more northerners mounted up and abandoning everything except their weapons fled eastward a few of the yankee horsemen were too late and were trapped in the small village as the rebel cavalry thundered into the single street a northerner wheeled his horse and cut with his saber but before his stroke was half completed a southern blade was in his belly the southerner rode on dragging his saber free from the clinging flesh rifles crashed and smoked from the houses where the northern infantry had taken cover a horse and man went down their blood splashing together across the dusty road the southern cavalry fired back with revolvers until their colonel shouted at them to forget the sheltering infantry and capture the rail depot instead another volley splintered from the houses and a horseman was snatched back from the saddle his comrades spurred on to the depot where scattered groups of northern infantry gathered under the water tower and alongside the fuel bunkers where the pine logs were stacked the largest group of yankees rallied around the greenpainted shed where a terrified telegrapher was sheltering under the table rather than sending a message the man was still cowering with his head in his arms when the victorious southern horsemen scattered the infantry and threw open the sheds door and ordered the telegrapher out i aint done nothing the telegrapher called desperately he had been too frightened to send any message so that no northerner yet knew that the armys vital rail line was severed come on billy the horseman pulled the telegrapher out into the dusk where the victorious southern horsemen were chasing the last of the northern garrison out into the fields behind them a cheer sounded as the louisiana infantry swept into bristoes single street a volley of shots crashed and splintered into a house where a group of yankee infantry still tried to defy the attackers but then the villages other defenders began to call out their surrender the louisiana men ran from house to house yanking bluecoated soldiers out into the street one last stubborn yankee fired at the attackers from a shed behind a general store and received a full company volley for his pains and then the firing in the village died away a few shots still sounded in the field beyond the railroad but otherwise the fighting had ended and stonewall jackson had hooked clean behind john pope and cut his eighty thousand men off from their supplies it was a feat that had been achieved by just twentyfour thousand men who on bloodied feet and with aching muscles and dry mouths and empty bellies now marched into bristoe it was a summers evening and the light was fading into a warm soft darkness they had marched more than fifty miles across country to sever the yankees supply line and soon jackson knew the stung northerners would turn on him like fiends which was exactly what lee wanted the northerners to do lee wanted popes army to abandon its welldug earthworks behind the rappahannocks steep northern bank and jacksons job was to lure them out jacksons men were now the bait twentyfour thousand vulnerable men isolated among a sea of northern troops which all added up jackson reckoned to the probability of a pretty rare fight to the south of the depot a train whistle offered its mournful sound to the falling night smoke misted the sky then a locomotives lamp appeared around a bend to glimmer its shivering reflections on rails that had begun to quiver from the thunder of the approaching wheels the train unsuspecting steamed north to where a rebel army and a yankee nightmare waited the legion marched into bristoe just as the train rounded the bend south of the depot the doors of the locomotives firebox were open so that the flames were reflecting bright on the underside of the long rolling plume of smoke the train was traveling so slowly that starbucks first thought was that it planned to make a stop at the depot then a fountain of sparks whirled from the tall stack as the locomotive accelerated there was just enough light remaining in the day for the engineer to have seen troops milling about the station and suspecting trouble he pulled his whistle cord in warning and threw the regulator hard across to put all the locomotives power into the great driving wheels the reflected glow of the furnace disappeared as the firebox doors were slammed shut the locomotive was hauling a light load just two sleeper cars showing red flags to denote they were carrying wounded men a passenger car that was routed through to alexandria and a mixture of unladen gondolas and boxcars that would be unhitched in manassas junction to be loaded with guns and ammunition for the next days southward run there was a disorganized flurry of activity in the depot as rebel infantry seized whatever obstacles lay close to the track and hurled them across the rails the most substantial blockage was formed from a pile of ties and rails that had been stacked ready for repair work and that were now hurriedly thrown into the locomotives path the whistle sounded again the bell was clanging incessantly a tocsin of alarm in the darkness while the rails were shaking with the weight of the approaching train get back get back officers shouted and the rebel soldiers scurried away from the tracks that were now bright with the reflected light cast by the locomotives huge kerosene lamp the windows of the passenger car flickered washes of yellow light over the fuel bunkers and water tower two rebels dropped a last length of rail over the track then scrambled for their lives as the train thundered into the depot the gilded and scarletpainted locomotive plowed through the smaller barricades splintered a heap of barrels and fence rails scattered a cord of firewood as though the pine logs were mere twigs then the engine flashed through the lamplit depot with its pistons pounding and its tall stack churning out a torrent of sparkridden smoke the engineer hauled on the whistles chain as the kerosene lamp illuminated the ominous barricade of steel rails and massive timber ties that lay just beyond the depot the train was still accelerating watching rebels held their breath in anticipation of spectacular disaster then cheered as the locomotives wooden cowcatcher struck the barrier but the heavy barricade simply disintegrated in the face of the speeding train there was a cascade of sparks from the front wheels a tumbling of wooden baulks and clanging rails a crash as the locomotives lantern shattered into scraps of glass and metal then the defiant whistle sounded once again as the train buffaloed its way through the remnants of the makeshift barrier and sped on northeast toward manassas passengers had peered anxiously out of the car windows as the train swayed and rattled through the depot but the faces vanished when a handful of rebel soldiers opened fire a bullet clanged off the locomotive another severed a steam line while a dozen windows in the hospital and passenger cars were shattered most of the bullets were fired at the boxcars which the rebels fondly imagined contained a fortune in plunder that was being denied them the train safe through the obstacles was sounding its whistle continually as a warning to the federal troops ahead though to the rebels the whistle sounded more like a mocking call of victory the locomotive rumbled over the bridge that crossed the broad run stream just north of the depot then disappeared into woods and the cabooses twin red lanterns were the last things the rebels saw as the train hurried away men began firing at those lamps until officers shouted at them to cease fire the rumble of the rails died then mysteriously swelled again a staff officer had ridden a hundred yards south to where a small hillock offered a view and now he cupped his hands and shouted back to the station another train coming pull up the track a second staff officer ordered just north of the depot where the rails ran on top of an embankment toward the stream an officer had discovered the trunklike box where the repair crews kept their tools and suddenly the embankment was swarming with men carrying sledgehammers and crowbars the second train was still a mile away but its rhythmic noise swelled drumlike in the night as the first lengths of rail were lifted and thrown aside the work became more effective as it was organized some troops were detailed to knock aside the chairs that held the rails to the ties while others heaved the loosened rails off the track and down the embankments slopes staff officers ordered the men not employed in lifting rails to hold their fire so that the approaching train would not be warned of danger youll get a passel of them through now an elderly civilian observed to starbuck the legions help was not needed to destroy the line so its men were standing in the village street from where they hoped to get a prime view of the destruction they run em up empty this time of evening the old man went on then they start hauling em back again all night and day oneway traffic see empty this way full that you boys come far far enough right glad to see you yankees are too high and mighty for my taste the old man grinned as the new train sounded its whistle to warn the depot of its approach that first onell be pulling into manassas right now guess those northern boys there will be pissing themselves with worry they told us wed never see you boys again leastwise not till they marched you through as prisoners the locomotive whistle sounded again men scattered away from the embankment as staff officers cleared the milling soldiers from the depot so that the engineer of the approaching train would not be alerted to his danger by the sight of a waiting crowd the locomotive thudded into sight it was hauling a train of boxcars that rattled and swayed under the moonlit smoke starbuck looked down at the old fellow who had spoken to him are you saying that first train will be in manassas by now he asked its only an hours walk that way the old man pointed northeast train does it in ten minutes ten minutes starbuck thought he was that close to where galloways horse had its lair my god he thought but what pleasure there would be in doing to galloways house what galloways men had done to mccombs tavern then he pushed that apprehension of revenge aside as the train thundered into the village hold your fire an officer shouted from somewhere down the line hold your fire starbuck saw some of his own men level their rifles no firing he shouted guns down but the target was irresistible the men nearest starbuck lowered their guns but a score of others fired and suddenly the whole village crackled with rifle fire on board the locomotive the firemans first reaction was to jump to the tender and haul on the hand brake and for a second there was a shower of sparks from the protesting machinery but then the engineer realized his danger and shouted for the brakes to be released as he poured more steam into the driving wheels the train lurched forward with gouts of steam hissing from a score of bullet holes that surrounded the locomotive with a lamplit halo of vapor through which the boxcars were dragged toward the embankment the engineer ducked to shelter from the rifle fire and so never saw the missing track ahead of his train his locomotive was still accelerating as it plowed off the end of the rails for a few seconds the whole train kept going in a straight line as dirt and stones spewed in a dark wave beneath the locomotives churning wheels but then the boxcars began to concertina and tumble and the locomotive rolled slowly over spilling fire as it slid down the embankment the boxcars piled into a heap of twisted frames and shattered planks jacksons men cheered as the destruction continued and still cheered as the commotion ended the engine had stopped a few yards short of the bridge over broad run while fifty yards behind the last dozen boxcars still stood upright on the undamaged track the wrecked train had no caboose instead a pair of redlensed oil lamps glowed at the back of the last boxcar some men began to tear open the undamaged cars hoping to find yankee luxuries to replace the stonehard biscuit hard green apples and unripe scavenged corn they had eaten in the last two days rightly or wrongly every southerner believed that no yankee could go to war without a larder of delicacies on his back and so the rebels splintered the cars open in hopes of finding a lavish supper but the wagons were all empty a whistle sounded in the dark another train the staff officer watching from the hillock to the south of the station shouted the warning get back back officers and sergeants pushed the disappointed plunderers away from the wrecked train while other men stamped out the fires that had been sparked when the locomotive spilt down the embankment cavalry helped clear the scene so that the crew of the oncoming train would suspect nothing hold your fire this time a bearded officer rode along the line of grinning soldiers hold your fire son of a bitch wont keep coming with those lights burning truslow appeared beside starbuck and nodded toward the stalled boxcars where the twin red lamps still glowed to reflect on the steel rails truslow waited for someone to realize the fact but no one seemed to have noticed the lamps so he took matters into his own hands by running across the strip of waste ground that separated the rail line from the nearest houses a cavalryman saw the running figure and wheeled his horse to intercept let him be starbuck shouted truslow reached the train unhitched his rifle and swung its brasshiked butt into the two lanterns there was a tinkle of glass and the twin lights vanished just seconds before the new train rocked around the western bend a hush fell over the watching men as the train steamed past the hillock clattered over some switchgear that led to an unused siding vented smoke around the water tower and then hurtled into the dim yellow light cast from the lanterns hanging in the depot no one fired a rifle the engineer leaned from his cab to wave a greeting to anyone who might be in the depot but saw no one and so sounded his whistle instead the engineer was anticipating the comforts of manassas where he and his fireman would cook their supper by grilling two steaks on a greased shovel held in the locomotives firebox afterwards they would play cards and drink some liquor in the engineers shed before hauling a heavy train of ammunition south in the early morning both men were professional pennsylvanian trainmen who had volunteered to serve in the us military railroad where the money was good the liquor plentiful the whores cheap and the danger they told each other constantly pretty much minimal the engineer was still thinking of shovelgrilled steaks as his locomotive struck the remnants of the first train the cowcatcher lifted up the rearmost boxcar catapulting the vehicle high enough to scrape along the top of the boiler and shear the lamp smokestack steam dome and bell clean off the locomotive the impact of the third train collapsed the remaining cars of the second then the deadweight of the moving boxcars piled into the crash and drove the locomotive deeper into the wreckage the wheels finally jumped the rails and the locomotive slid sideways to a halt there was a passenger car behind the tender and screams sounded from the chaos as the boxcars crashed in behind the last boxcars stopped upright in the depot itself while deep among the wreckage at the front of the train a fierce fire started to burn on either side of the track well out of dangers range men were whooping with joy another train the staff officer called from the hillock and once again a whistle sounded from the darkness well do this all night truslow was unusually animated there was a brute joy in such freedom from all the customary and careful regulations of normal life a squad ran to the depot to extinguish the rear lamps of the stalled train other men doused the depots own lights so that the oncoming train would not glimpse the boxcars standing among the buildings deep among the burning wreckage smoke hissed from the locomotive men were trying to extricate the crew and passengers as well as extinguish the fires as the fourth train of the night rocked into sight with its lantern flaring yellowwhite in the everblackening darkness come on you son of a bitch truslow growled but instead of a third crash there was a scream of brakes as the engineer scented trouble ahead maybe it was the darkened depot or perhaps it was the unextinguished fires that still flickered in the wreckage but something made the engineer apply his brakes the wheels locked to skid down the rails through a fountain of flowing sparks the locomotive stopped just short of the hillock and the engineer rammed it into reverse gear and released the steam smoke poured from the stack as the machinery labored to push the great train backward the staff officer on the hillock dragged his revolver free and spurred toward the locomotive that was now spinning its wheels the officers horse reared away from a jet of steam then the wheels began to bite and the tons of steel and iron and wood began to crawl away southward the staff officer fired at the cab and shouted at the engineer to halt but the engineer kept the regulator fully open and the protesting cars gathered speed and the rhythm of the locomotive became faster and faster as the train backed safely away the staff officer fired again but the train was now moving quicker than his horse could gallop and so he abandoned the chase and just watched as the train disappeared into the dark with its whistle screaming shrilly it was clear no more trains would come this night and so jackson ordered his men back into the depot there was work to do the survivors had to be brought out of the two wrecked trains the bridge north of the village had to be destroyed and the prisoners had to be interrogated the lanterns in the depot were lit once more and the general paced up and down beneath their feeble light as he gave his orders the survivors of the train wrecks were brought to the depot confederate surgeons worked on the wounded while food and water were fetched from the houses one northerner a burly and whitehaired civilian dressed in an expensive suit and with a sealhung gold watch chain stretched across his ample vest heaved himself onto an elbow to stare across the track at the rebel officers in the depot the civilian had a new bandage around his head and a splint on his left leg he stared for a long time seemingly unable to take his eyes from the skinny bearded unkempt and plainuniformed man who snapped his orders in a highpitched voice the northerner finally beckoned one of the rebel soldiers to his side son who is that thats stonewall sir the soldier said and then seeing that the civilian was weak and in pain he knelt and supported the mans head thats old jack sir large as life the wounded man stared at the ragged figure who carried no insignia of rank and whose headgear was nothing but a cadets shabby cap the northerner was a bureaucrat from washington who was returning from a visit to discuss general popes supply problems he was a man accustomed to the high imperious style of officers like john pope or george mcclellan which was why he found it so hard to believe that this unprepossessing figure with its tangled beard and threadbare coat and torn boots was the bogeyman who gave waking nightmares to the whole united states army are you sure thats jackson son the bureaucrat asked im sure sir dead sure thats him the civilian shook his head sadly oh my god he said just lay me down a gust of laughter echoed from the nearby soldiers jackson across the tracks frowned at the laughter the general was listening to a brigadier who was assuring him that the yankees had tons of ammunition a treasurehouse of equipment and a cornucopia of food stuffed into the warehouses at manassas junction but they aint got nothing more than a corporals guard to watch over it all the brigadier asserted and by morning general theyll have a ton of boys out of washington to keep us at bay and the sons of bitches excuse my language general are only four miles away let me take my two regiments general and ill give you manassas by dawn with just two regiments jackson asked skeptically with my two regiments general i could take hell by storm let alone a supply depot the brigadier paused you want to talk to the man he jerked his head toward the captured engineer who had revealed just how small was the garrison and great the prize at manassas junction jackson shook his head then paused a second go he finally said go because the night was still young and the mischief merely beginning the reverend elial starbuck had been an impatient passenger on the first train that left warrenton junction for the north the rails were supposedly clear yet even so the train made miserably slow progress in new england as the preacher proudly informed his traveling companions the rails were capable of continuous highspeed travel but he supposed army railroad management combined with southern construction techniques had rendered the orange and alexandria road incapable of matching the unsurpassed efficiency of the boston and albany sixty miles an hour is not unusual in new england the reverend starbuck declared a civilian engineer spat into a cuspidor and declared that a coalburning locomotive of the illinois central had been timed at over seventy miles an hour long way from new england too he added pointedly doubtless it was going downhill the preacher responded or perhaps the timing watch was manufactured in richmond he was pleased with that riposte and could not resist laughing aloud night was falling glossing the cars windows with reflected lamplight the preacher settled the bundled rebel flag more comfortably on his lap and tried to see some detail of the countryside but just as he put his face to the glass the train gave a sudden jerk and began to speed up the engineer pulled out his watch just ten minutes to manassas junction he said the rhythm of the steam engine quickened as the car rattled faster and faster over the jointed rails to shake the brass cuspidors and vibrate the gasjet flames behind their misted lamp globes i suppose youd call this a snails pace in new england reverend the engineer called across the car the lanterns of a depot flashed by in the halfdarkness then just as the reverend starbuck was about to respond to the engineers taunt the window beside him collapsed in a shower of broken glass for a terrifying few seconds the preacher was certain the train was derailed and crashing eternity seemed suddenly imminent then he heard men whooping outside and there was the alarming sight of gray uniforms and a heartstopping glimpse of rifle flames flashing in the dark the train gave a violent lurch but somehow kept going a woman passenger screamed in fear keep down an artillery officer shouted from the front of the car another window was smashed and a bullet ripped into the stuffing of the empty seat opposite the preacher but then the train was running free into the welcome darkness beyond the depot the wheels thundered over a bridge as the locomotives whistle and bell sounded their warning is anyone hurt the artillery officer called as passengers heads cautiously surfaced above the seat backs the rush of air through the broken windows guttered the lamp flames and scattered the pages of a newspaper along the central aisle anyone hurt the officer demanded again sing out now now by gods grace no the reverend starbuck answered as he shook spicules of broken glass from the folds of the flag he was still picking the scraps from the precious silk as the wounded locomotive panted and groaned into manassas junction all off now an imperious voice commanded the passengers everyone off bring your luggage everyone off the ambushed car had been bound for the alexandria depot hard across the river from washington and the reverend starbuck had been looking forward to an early departure from the capital on the cars of the baltimore and ohio at baltimore he planned to take a horsedrawn tram across town to the depot of the philadelphia wilmington and baltimore road where he would find a car bound for new york once in new york he would abandon the railroads for a cabin on one of the fast and comfortable boston steamships but now it seemed his journey was again to be delayed take your luggage folks the man ordering everyone off the train called the reverend starbucks carpetbag was now considerably heavier than when he had first come south it was true that he had distributed all his abolitionist tracts but in their place he had gathered some valued souvenirs of battle none to be sure was as precious as the great silken banner but nevertheless he had discovered some objects with which he expected to excite bostons curiosity packed in his carpetbag were two gray rebel caps one with a bullet hole and the other satisfyingly stained with blood a zinc plug from an unexploded shell a revolver with a barrel shattered by a cannonball the knucklebone of a dead rebel and a rusting belt buckle with the initials csa stamped clearly on its face the heaviest of his souvenirs were copies of southern newspapers illprinted on crudely made paper and containing editorials of an evil that even the reverend doctor starbuck found breathtaking it all added up to a considerable weight that he lugged off the train before accosting the young captain who had so peremptorily ordered the passengers off the car youre preparing another train the preacher demanded for what the captain retorted turning around from the open window of the telegraph office for washington of course for washington my god uncle youll be lucky dont suppose anything will move now till first light if there are bushwhackers at bristoe then god knows where else they might be i have to be in washington by morning the preacher protested you can walk the captain said rudely it isnt a step more than twentyfive miles but there wont be any more trains tonight uncle and in the morning i daresay theyll be sending troops down from washington he paused i guess you can wait for one of those trains to go back but this train isnt moving anyplace not till its been in the workshops for repairs he turned back to the telegrapher what do they say the telegrapher eased back from his machinery which was still stuttering tinnily they want to know how many raiders sir well the captain demanded of the trains engineer who was standing behind the telegraphers how many bushwhackers did you see two or three hundred the engineer suggested uneasily the reverend elial starbuck cleared his throat they were not bushwhackers he said sternly but rebel soldiers i saw them clearly the captain gave the elderly minister a tired look if they were troops uncle theyd have cut the telegraph but they havent which makes me think theyre amateurs but weve told the army whats happening so theres no need to worry theyve cut the wire now sir the telegrapher broke in just this second sir he jiggled his key but nothing came back lines still open to alexandria but everythings dead to the south of us sir so what are we to do one of the dispossessed travelers demanded plaintively the captain grimaced you might get rooms at micklewhites tavern here but if micks full youll have to leg it into manassas town its not far up the track or theres a road beyond the wagon park if the reverend elial had wanted rest and shelter he would have used major galloways house which lay not far beyond the town but he had no mind for creature comforts this night instead with his ebony cane clutched firmly in his right hand and with the flag and carpetbag clasped awkwardly in his left he set out in search of some officer who might pay him more attention than the glib young captain the depot itself hardly encouraged his hopes for it consisted of nothing but great dark buildings hastily thrown up on the foundations of the warehouses burned by the rebels when they had abandoned the depot earlier in the year while here and there among the dark monstrosities a sentrys brazier fought the night with a small red glow between the huge warehouses were weedstrewn rail spurs where more materials were stored in boxcars and where long low gondola cars carried brandnew field guns the moon silvered the cannons long barrels and the reverend starbuck wondered why the guns were here instead of pounding the rebels into submission the war he decided was being prosecuted by halfwits he left the warehouses behind and stumped through a wagon park toward the lights of the nearby town a lesser man than the reverend elial starbuck might have hesitated before entering the towns main street for the place was raucous with drunks most of the drinkers were railmen but there were plenty of black folk among them and the sight of the negroes angered the reverend starbuck where he wondered were the missions and where the christian teachers the town had been declared an official refuge for escaped slaves but by the evidence before his eyes it seemed that the negroes would have been better off in servitude than being thus exposed to debauchery uncleanness and liquor there would need to be changes he asked a soldier where the commander of the garrison might be found and was directed to a guardroom attached to the post office a lieutenant scrambled to his feet as the reverend starbuck entered then answered the preachers query by saying that captain craig was absent hes gone to look to our defenses sir it seems there are bandits on the rail line south sir more than bandits lieutenant the raiders are rebel troops i saw them with my own eyes infantry definitely rebel infantry i saw the same scum at cedar mountain so i know of what i speak ill make sure captain craig hears what you have to say sir the lieutenant spoke respectfully though he was privately dubious about the preachers report there had been rumors of rebel raiders near manassas every night for the last two weeks but none of the rumors had proved true and the lieutenant doubted whether a minister of the gospel could tell the difference between rebel soldiers and bushwhackers especially as even the bestdressed rebels looked little better than cutthroat outlaws but not to worry sir the lieutenant continued captain craig ordered our artillery and cavalry to deploy and he put all our infantry on alert the lieutenant decided it might be wiser not to add that there were only eight cannon in the defenses aided by a mere hundred cavalrymen and a single company of infantry manassas was supposed to be a safe posting as safe as garrison duty in maine or california i dont think our sleep will be disturbed sir the lieutenant said soothingly the reverend starbuck was pleasantly surprised to discover that at least one officer seemed to have performed his proper duty this night captain craig is that his name the reverend starbuck had taken out his diary and was now penciling a note hes done well lieutenant and i like to report commendable behavior when i encounter it his name is captain samuel craig sir of the th pennsylvania the lieutenant said wondering just how important this authoritative minister was you report to the government perhaps sir i report to the greatest government that ever ruled on this earth lieutenant or on any other the reverend starbuck said as he finished writing his note then maybe youd like to add my name sir the lieutenant said eagerly its gilray lieutenant ethan gilray of the provost guard just the one l sir and thank you for asking gilray waited as the minister penciled his name and will you be wanting quarters for the night sir theres a mrs moss in main street a most christian woman who keeps a very clean house for a virginian the reverend starbuck closed his diary i shall wait in the passenger depot lieutenant much as he was tempted by a clean bed he dared not miss the chance of a northbound train yet before he returned to the depot he still had one christian obligation to discharge the provost guard is responsible is it not for discipline the reverend starbuck asked indeed it is sir then i shall have no alternative but to report you for the grossest dereliction of duty lieutenant a duty that is christian before it is military there are negroes in town lieutenant gilray who have been permitted access to inebriating liquor would a loving parent put ardent spirits in the way of his children of course he would not yet the negroes came to manassas on just such a promise of protection a promise made by our government that you as that governments representative have broken by allowing them to fall prey to the temptation of strong drink it is a disgrace sir a shameful disgrace and i shall make certain that our authorities in washington are made fully aware of it good day to you the reverend starbuck left the speechless gilray and went back into the night he felt better for that discharge of his duty for he was a fervent believer that each man every day should leave the world a better place than he found it he walked back through the town listening to the drunken songs and seeing the scarlet women who lifted their skirts in the stinking alleys he fended a drunk off with his cane somewhere in the dark a dog whined a child cried a man vomited and a woman screamed and the sad sounds made the reverend starbuck reflect on how much sin was souring gods good world satan he thought was much abroad in these dark days and he began to plan a sermon that likened the christian life to a military campaign maybe he thought there was more than a sermon in that idea but a whole book and that pleasant thought kept him company as he strode down the moonlit road toward the depot such a book would be timely he decided and might even earn him enough to add a new scullery to the house on walnut street he had already planned his chapter headings and was beginning to anticipate the books adulatory notices when suddenly shockingly the sky ahead of him flashed red as a cannon fired the sound wave crashed past him just as a second cannon belched flame that briefly illuminated a rolling cloud of gunsmoke then the reverend starbuck heard the chilling and ululating sound that he had mistaken at cedar mountain for aristophanes paean he stopped knowing now how the devils noise denoted a rebel attack and he watched in disgust as a scatter of bluecoated soldiers fled from the depots shadows northern cavalrymen were galloping between the dark buildings and fleeing infantrymen were running along the rail lines the reverend starbuck listened as the rebels foul paean turned into cheers and then to his chagrin he saw gray coats in the moonlight and knew that the devil was scoring yet another terrible victory in this summers night a brazier was tipped over causing fire to flare bright between two warehouses and in the sudden flamelight the reverend starbuck saw the satanic banner of the southern rebels coming toward him he gaped in horror then thought of the greater horror of being captured by such fiends and so he hid the captured flag under his coat and stick and bag in hand turned and fled he would seek shelter in galloways house where hidden from this rampaging and seemingly unstoppable enemy he would pray for a miracle the legion marched at dawn they were hungry and tired but their steps were lightened by rumors that the warehouses at manassas had been captured and that all the hungry men in the world could be fed from their contents starbuck had last seen the manassas depot wreathed in smoke when the confederates had destroyed the junction the legion indeed had been the very last rebel infantry regiment to abandon manassas leaving the warehouses nothing but ashes yet as the depot came into view starbuck saw that the great spread of buildings was now more extensive than ever the northern government had not just replaced the burned warehouses but had added new ones and built fresh rail spurs for the hundreds of freight wagons that waited to be hauled south but even those new facilities were not enough to hold all the northern supplies and so thousands of tons of food and materiel had to be stored in hooded wagons parked wheeltowheel in the fields beyond the warehouses a staff officer spurred back down the marching column go get your rations boys its all yours a present from uncle abe all yours the men invigorated by the thought of plunder quickened their pace slow down starbuck shouted as the leading companies began to break away from the rest major medlicott the commander of a company turned in his saddle and offered starbuck a lugubrious expression well take the end warehouse starbuck pointed to the easternmost part of the depot which was still clear of rebel troops he feared the chaos that would result if his regiment was scattered among a score of warehouses and mixed with revelers from a dozen other brigades captain truslow he shouted toward the rear of the column im relying on you to find ammunition lieutenant howes i want pickets around the warehouse keep our men inside coffman i want you to find some local people and discover where the galloway farm is yet for the moment there was no time to consider revenge on galloways horse only to plunge into the stacks of boxes and barrels and crates that were piled in the vast dim warehouse and inside the adjacent boxcars and wagons it was a hoard that the hardpressed confederate army could only dream of possessing there were uniforms rifles ammunition haversacks belts blankets tents saddles boots bridles percussion caps gum rubber groundsheets picket pins telegraph wire signal flags and lucifer matches there were candles lanterns camp furniture drums sheet music bibles buckets oilcloth capes jars of quinine bottles of camphor folding flagpoles bugles replacement pay books friction fuses and artillery shells there were spades axes augurs saws bayonets cooking pots sabers swords and canteens then there was food not just armyissue hardtack in boxes and desiccated soup in canvas bags but luxuries from the wagons of the northern armys sutlers who made their money by selling delicacies to the troops there were barrels of dried oysters and casks of pickles cakes of white sugar boxes of loose tea slabs of salt beef sacks of rice cans of fruit sides of bacon jars of peaches combs of honey bottles of catsup and flasks of powdered lemon best of all there was coffee real coffee readysweetened coffee baked ground mixed with sugar and packed into sacks there were also bottles of liquor rum and brandy champagne and wine cases and cases of wine and spirits packed in sawdust and all disappearing fast into thirsty mens haversacks a few conscientious officers fired revolvers into the cases of liquor in an effort to keep their men from drunkenness but there were simply too many bottles for the precaution to be of any effect lobster salad sir private hunt his dirty face smeared from ear to ear with a pink confection offered starbuck a knife blade loaded with the delicacy from a newly opened can came from a sutlers wagon youll make yourself sick hunt starbuck said i hope so sir hunt said starbuck tried the proffered salad and found it delicious starbuck wandered in a daze from one store bay to the next the supplies seemed to have been stacked without any system but just crammed into the warehouse in whatever order they had arrived from the north there were cartridges from britain tinned food from france and salt cod from portugal there was lamp oil from nantucket cheese from vermont and dried apples from new york there was kerosene medical sulfur calcined magnesia sugar of lead and laxatives made of powdered rhubarb there was so much material that if two armies the size of jacksons force had plundered the depot for a month they could not have opened every box or explored every dusty stack of crates what you cant carry away well have to burn a staff officer called to starbuck so search it well and the legion like small boys released to a toyshop splintered open the crates and whooped with glee at every fresh discovery patrick hogan of c company was distributing officers shoulder boards while cyrus matthews was cramming his face with a nauseating mix of dried apple and chipped beef one man had discovered a cabin trunk that seemed to contain nothing but chess sets and he was now disgustedly scattering knights rooks and bishops as he dug down in search of greater treasures bandmaster little had found a box of sheet music while robert decker one of the best men in truslows company had discovered a cased match rifle precisionmade for a marksman and equipped with a barrellength telescopic sight a hair trigger a separate cocking trigger and a small pair of legs at the barrels muzzle to support the weapons huge weight itll kill a mule at five hundred paces sir decker boasted to starbuck itll be heavy to carry bob starbuck warned him but itll even things against the sharpshooters sir decker answered every rebel hated the yankee sharpshooters who were lethally equipped with similar longrange target rifles captain truslow had commandeered two brandnew seventon wagons that both carried small brass plates proclaiming them to be the products of levergoods carriage factory of pittsburgh pennsylvania there were boxes attached to the wagon sides that were filled with repair tools lanterns and cans of axle grease and truslow always reluctant to concede that anything could be well made in the hated north nevertheless admitted that the levergoods company built a halfdecent vehicle the two graypainted wagons would replace the old ammunition carts burned in galloways raid and truslow had his men busy stacking the wagon beds with boxes of rifle ammunition and crates of percussion caps the draught horses were fitted with brandnew collars hames and traces then backed into the shafts captain pines men were distributing boots while lieutenant pattersons company was handing out sacks of coffee captain daviess company was employed in taking down the barn doors from a warehouse the doors were needed as ramps so that a georgian artillery battery could maneuver some brandnew northern cannons off their gondola cars the georgians were presently equipped with napoleon twelvepounders that were in their commanders word tired but now they would be armed with a halfdozen parrott twentypound rifles so new that the packing grease from the foundry was still sticky on their barrels the artillerymen wrecked the wheels and spiked the vents of their old guns then dragged away their new weapons each of which displayed a neatly stenciled legend on its trail property of the usa colonel swynyard watched the plunder from horseback he had helped himself to a brandnew saddle and was sucking on a strip of beef jerky sixteen men he said gnomically to starbuck sir thats all we lost to straggling out of the whole brigade and most of them will turn up i dont doubt some other brigades lost hundreds swynyard grimaced as the strip of beef aggravated a sore tooth i dont suppose you came across any false teeth did you no sir but ill keep a lookout i think ill have doc billy take all mine out theyre nothing but trouble i confess starbuck that my new faith in almighty god is shaken by the existence of teeth do your teeth hurt one does you probably smoke too much swynyard said tobacco smoke might be good for keeping the lungs open but ive long believed that the juice of the weed rots the teeth he frowned not for the thought of tobacco juice but because a train whistle had sounded in the warm morning wind swynyard gazed toward the northern horizon where a billow of smoke showed above distant trees weve got company i guess swynyard said the thought of northerners reminded starbuck that stonewall jackson would not have marched fifty miles in two days just to replenish his armys stock of ammunition and food does anyone know whats happening starbuck asked the perennial soldiers question im told that general jackson is not given to confiding in his inferiors swynyard said or in his superiors either for that matter so i can only guess and my guess is that weve been sent here as bait bait starbuck repeated the word flatly it did not sound good im guessing that weve been sent up here to pull the yankees out of their defenses on the rappahannock swynyard said then paused to watch a soldier shake loose yards and yards of mosquito netting which could mean that in a few hours well have every blessed yankee in virginia trying to kill us he finished then stared northward to where a brisk rattle of rifle fire had sounded the volley was followed by the heavier sound of artillery someones getting thumped swynyard said with a bloodthirsty relish then twisted in his saddle to watch a sad procession come into sight beside the warehouse a group of rebel soldiers were escorting a long line of black men and women some crying but most walking with a stiff dignity escaped slaves swynyard explained curtly a woman tried to break away from the column but was shoved back into place by a soldier starbuck counted almost two hundred of the slaves who were now ordered to form a line close beside a captured portable forge what they should have done swynyard said is keep running north of the potomac why didnt they because the yankees declared manassas a safe refuge for contrabands they want to keep the darkies down here you see south of the masondixon line its one thing to preach emancipation but quite another to have them living in your street aint that the case i dont know sir starbuck grimaced as he saw a leatheraproned blacksmith test the heat of the forges furnace the portable forge was a traveling blacksmiths shop mounted on the back of a heavy wagon that could travel with the army and shoe horses or provide instant repairs to broken metal the smith dragged a length of chain out of a barrel and starbuck immediately understood what was about to happen to the recaptured slaves so how many blacks live in your fathers street swynyard demanded none except for a couple of servants and has your father ever had a black at his dinner table not that i know of starbuck said a hammer clanged on the anvil the smith was fashioning manacles out of barrel hoops then brazing the open manacles onto the chain heat shimmered over the small open furnace which was being fanned by two soldiers pumping a leather bellows every minute or so a recaptured slave was forced to the forge to have one of the newly made manacles closed around an ankle a hugebellied captain with a bristling black beard was supervising the operation cuffing the slaves if they showed any resistance and boasting how they would suffer now they had been recaptured what happens to them starbuck asked you can never trust a black thats run away swynyard said speaking with the authority of a man born into one of virginias oldest slavetrading families it dont matter how valuable he is hes been spoilt for good if hes tasted a bit of liberty so theyll all get sold down the river women too the colonel nodded women too and children so theyll all be dead in a year unless theyre real lucky swynyard said and die sooner being sold down the river meant going to the sweated chain gangs on the cotton plantations of the deep south swynyard looked away i guess my two boys had the good sense to keep on running they aint here anyway i looked for them he paused as the gunfire to the north reached a crackling crescendo powder smoke was whitening the sky indicating that a skirmish of some severity was taking place but the fact that no staff officers were demanding reinforcements from the troops rifling the depot suggested that the enemy was well in hand right now swynyard said id guess that weve just got a few odds and ends coming to attack us the real attack wont hit till tomorrow something to look forward to starbuck said dryly the colonel grinned and rode on leaving starbuck to stroll among his happy men there was no grumbling now about missing a chance to join the richmond garrison instead the legion was reveling in its chance of loot captain moxey had found some frilled shirts and was pulling them on one above another to save himself the trouble of cramming them into a haversack already stuffed with tins of chicken in aspic sergeant major tolliver had unpacked a whole case of longbarreled whitney revolvers and was attempting to stow as many as possible in his clothing while lieutenant coffman had discovered a handsome black cloak edged with blue silk braid that he swirled dramatically around his body at least two men were already blind drunk starbuck dragged one of the drunken men off a case marked massachusetts arms co chicopee falls the man groaned and protested but starbuck snarled at him to shut up then levered the case open to find a shipment of adams caliber revolvers the guns with their blued barrels and crosshatched blackwalnut grips looked deadly and beautiful starbuck discarded the clumsier longbarreled colt he had taken from a dead new yorker at gaines mill and helped himself to one of the new revolvers he was just loading the last of the adamss five chambers when a chorus of shouts erupted from further down the warehouse starbuck turned to see an excited mob of his men chasing an agile black figure who swerved around an astonished coffman leaped over an opened crate of canteens and would have got clean away had not the drunk beside starbuck reached out an oblivious hand that inadvertently tripped the fugitive the boyhe was hardly more than a boysprawled in the mud where he was pounced on by his cheering pursuers bring the bastard here major medlicott strode down the warehouse carrying a teamsters whip the prisoner yelped as abram trent cuffed him around the head goddamned nigger thief trent had the boy by one ear and was hitting him with his free hand thieving black bastard enough starbuck pushed a man aside let go of him hes a thieving i said let go of him trent reluctantly let go of the boys ear but not without giving the captured fugitive a last savage blow the boy staggered but managed to stay on his feet he looked around for an escape realized he was trapped and so adopted a defiant air he had a thin face long black hair a straight nose and high cheekbones he was dressed in a sailors bellbottom pants and a billowing striped shirt that gave him an exotic look starbuck had once spent a few weeks with a traveling troupe of actors and there was something in the boys flamboyance that reminded him of those distant times whats your name starbuck asked him the boy looked up at his savior but instead of showing gratitude he spat aint got a name whats your name starbuck insisted again but only received a truculent glare for answer medlicott pushed through the ring of men stay out of this starbuck he said raising the whip against the black lad starbuck stepped in front of major medlicott he kept a smile on his face as he put his mouth close to medlicotts right ear and he kept smiling as he spoke softly so softly that only medlicott could hear him listen you lilylivered son of a bitch you give me orders one more time and ill pistolwhip you down to corporal starbuck was still smiling as he stepped a pace backward dont you agree thats the best way to proceed major medlicott was not certain at first that he had heard right and just blinked at starbuck then he took a backward pace and flicked the whip toward the captured boy he stole my watch medlicott said the little black bastard lifted it out of my pocket when i laid my coat down it was a present from my wife too he added indignantly from edna starbuck looked at the boy give the major his watch dont have it starbuck sighed and stepped forward the boy tried to twist aside but starbuck was too quick for him he grabbed a handful of long dirty hair and held the squirming boy still search him coffman he said lieutenant coffman nervously began searching the boys pockets at first he found nothing then it became apparent that the pants pockets had been elongated into long capacious sausageshaped sacks specially strengthened to hold and conceal plunder and the men watched in amazement as the evidence of the boys thefts was dragged into the light coffman produced two hunter watches a gilt picture frame a collapsible silver cup a folding mirror two razors a brass match case a carved pipe a signet ring an ivoryhandled shaving brush a comb a pack of cards and a handful of coins the men stared in awe at the hoard oh my god one of them said just lay me down and a bellow of laughter swept through the crowd coffman stepped away from the boy thats all sir he said theyre all my property the boy insisted trying to retrieve one of the watches and the ring of men laughed and cheered at his insolence they had been baying for his blood just a minute before but there was something irresistible about the young mans unrepentant face and impressive haul of thefts medlicott retrieved his watch hes a goddamn thief he should be whipped but i thought we were all thieves today starbuck said and he was about to kick the boy on his way when a stentorian voice shouted from outside the ring of legionnaires hold on to that nigger the voice shouted and the men slowly parted to make way for the big bearded captain who had been supervising the manacling of the recaptured slaves another damn runaway the man said reaching for the boy im a free man the boy insisted and im abraham lincoln the captain said as he grabbed the boys striped shirt he cuffed the long black hair aside and displayed one of the boys earlobes to starbuck took his earring out didnt he first thing a runaway does take off the earring earrings denoted slave status so if youre free lad the captain went on why dont you show us your papers the boy plainly had no papers for a second or two he looked defiant then he was overwhelmed by despair and tried to twist out of the captains grip the captain slapped him hard around the head youll be picking cotton now lad he belongs to me starbuck said suddenly he had not intended to speak and certainly he had never intended to claim ownership of the boy but there was something appealing about the young mans spirit that reminded starbuck of his own desperate attempts to remake himself in an image of his own devising and he knew that if he did not speak up then the boy would be hammered and burned into the chains and then sold down the river to the living hell of the cotton plantations the captain gave starbuck a long hard look then spat a viscous brown stream of tobacco juice out my way boy you call me sir starbuck said or ill have you arrested and charged for rank insubordination now boy get the hell out of my regiment the captain laughed at starbucks presumption then twitched the fugitive slave toward the forge starbuck kicked the man hard between the legs then rammed a flat palm into the bearded face the captain let go of the escaped slave and staggered backward he was in terrible pain but he succeeded in keeping his footing and was just starting forward with his fists clenched when there was the unmistakable click of a gun being cocked you heard the major truslows voice said so git the captain put a hand to his face to wipe blood away from his mustache he looked askance at starbuck wondering if the youngster really was a major then decided that anything might be true in wartime he pointed a bloodsmeared finger at the cowering boy hes a contraband the law says hes got to be returned you heard the captain starbuck said so git starbuck waited till the man had gone then turned and took hold of the boys ear come here you son of a bitch he said dragging the boy away from the crowd and into the warehouse where he threw the lad hard onto a pile of grain sacks listen you little bastard ive just saved you from a whipping and better still ive just saved you from being sold down the river so whats your name the boy rubbed his ear you really a major no im the goddamn archangel gabriel who are you whoever i want to be the boy said defiantly starbuck guessed he was fourteen or fifteen an urchin who had learned to live by his wits so who do you want to be starbuck asked the boy was surprised by the question but he thought about it then grinned and shrugged lucifer he said at last you cant be lucifer starbuck said shocked thats the devils name only name im giving you master the boy insisted starbuck guessed that was true so he settled for the satanic name so listen to me lucifer my names major starbuck and i need a servant real bad and you just got the job are you hearing me yes sir there was something cheeky and mocking in the response and i need a comb a toothbrush field glasses a razor thatll hold an edge and something to eat other than hardtack and shoe leather are you hearing me i got ears master see lucifer insolently plucked back his long ringlets one on each side see so you go and get those things lucifer starbuck said i dont care how and you be back here within the hour can you cook the boy pretended to think about the question drawing out his silence just beyond the edge of rudeness sure i can cook good so get whatever you need for cooking utensils starbuck stood aside and bring me as many cigars as you can carry the boy sauntered into the sunlit doorway where he stopped plucked his disarrayed clothing into shape then turned to look at starbuck suppose i dont come back just make sure you arent sent down the river lucifer the boy stared at starbuck then nodded at the wisdom of that advice are you making me into a soldier he asked im making you my cook the boy grinned how much are you paying me major i just saved your worthless life and thats all the wages youre getting from me you mean im your slave the boy sounded disgusted i mean youre a goddamn servant to the best goddamn officer in this goddamn army so get the goddamn out of here and stop wasting my goddamn time before i goddamn kick you out the boy grinned do i get a goddamn gun you dont need a gun starbuck said in case i have to protect myself from the yankees who want to make me into a free man lucifer said then laughed cant be a soldier without a gun you aint a soldier starbuck said youre a cook you said i can be whatever i want to be the boy said remember then he ran off thats one nigger you wont see again truslow said from just outside the door i dont really want to see him again then you shouldnt have risked a fight for him truslow said that captain would have murdered you so thank you starbuck said i didnt run him off to save your good looks truslow said sarcastically but because it dont do the boys no good to see their major having the shit thumped out of him you want a pickled oyster he held out a jar of the delicacies then as starbuck helped himself truslow turned and watched as a disconsolate herd of bluecoated prisoners limped past the men were smartly uniformed but looked utterly whipped some of their heads showed livid saber slashes wounds that had cut so deep that the blood had soaked their tunics down to their waists the northerners limped past going to their long imprisonment and truslow grinned just aint their day is it he said just aint their goddamn day colonel patrick lassan of his french majestys imperial guard who was officially a foreign military observer attached to the rebel army but who preferred to do his observing from the front ranks of the rebel cavalry took a handful of his horses mane and slowly drew his long straight sword through the coarse hair to scrub the blade clean of blood he needed to clean the steel three times before it was fit to slide back into the scabbard then lighting a cigar he trotted slowly back along the path of the cavalry charge a brigade of new jersey troops had come from the defenses of washington to evict what they believed was a band of rebel cavalry raiders from the depot at manassas junction only instead of encountering a handful of ragged cavalrymen they had marched straight into the depots old defensive earthworks manned by stonewall jacksons veteran infantry and artillery whipped by rifle fire and flayed by cannons the new jerseymen had retreated it was then that jackson had unleashed the cavalry who had turned their retreat into a rout dazed northerners still reeled blindly about the field where the horsemen had charged the northerners were mostly wounded in the head or shoulders the bloody wounds of men caught in the open by cavalrymen carrying sabers their comrades were either lying dead where the volleys of the entrenched defenders had ambushed them or else were struggling to safety across the rainswollen bull run where a year before so many of their countrymen had drowned in the defeat of the first invasion of the confederate states of america lassan watched the rebels round up the living and loot the dead the confederates were joking about the ease of their victory claiming it was further proof that a halfdozen northerners were no match for a single southerner but lassan was both more experienced and more sanguine and knew that the attack of the new jersey brigade had been a blunder by an inexperienced general the new jersey officers had been so new to war that they had attacked with drawn swords oblivious that they were thus making themselves targets for southern marksmen the northern officers had led their men to horror but lassan knew that this slaughter of the innocents was an aberration and that soon the real fighting would begin the north had been surprised by jacksons march but it would not be long before the yankee veterans arrived to snap at the bait that hung so temptingly at manassas junction for the north now had stonewall jackson outnumbered they had him isolated and so they must surely believe they had him doomed all day the yankees tried to make sense of the storm that had broken behind their backs the first confused reports merely spoke of bushwhackers then it was claimed the raiding party was a large band of jeb stuarts horsemen and finally there were worrying reports of rebel infantry and artillery inside the defenses of manassas junction but no one could tell john pope precisely what was happening at his supply depot he knew that no trains were coming from manassas and that the telegraph to washington had been cut but neither of these events was uncommon and for much of the day pope regarded all reports from manassas as mere alarmist rumors spread by panicking men frightened by a handful of confederate cavalry raiders john pope was unwilling to abandon his conviction that lee must do what john pope had planned for lee to do which was to launch a grand yet suicidal attack across the swirling rappahannock but slowly grudgingly like a man refusing to admit that the heavy clouds above his parade had begun to rain pope began to understand that the commotion at manassas amounted to a great deal more than a raid it was the opening move of a campaign he had not planned to fight but to which he was now forced to react well be riding north tonight you mark my words major galloway observed did you hear me adam but adam faulconer was not listening to his commanding officer instead he was staring at a recent copy of the richmond examiner that had been exchanged for a new york times by one of the northern pickets then brought to john popes headquarters where major galloway and adam had been peremptorily summoned the major had scanned the illprinted sheets snorted in disgust at the editors secessionist distortions then relinquished the rag to adam now galloway was kicking his heels in the hallway and waiting while a succession of flustered aides carried maps into the parlor where the general was trying to comprehend the days events did you read this adam suddenly demanded of galloway galloway did not need to be told what item in the newspaper had offended adam i read it the major said but i dont necessarily believe it five women dead adam protested its a rebel newspaper galloway pointed out the story was headlined outrage in orange county yankee raiders the newspaper reported seeking to emulate the exploits of jeb stuart had crossed the rapidan to raid lees forces but had instead burned down a country tavern and killed everyone inside there was no mention of the raid on the faulconer brigade nor of the guns and wagons that galloways men had destroyed but only a pitiful description of the innocent civilians dying inside the inferno that had engulfed what the newspaper described as mccombs hotel presumably because a goodly number of the examiners readers might well approve of taverns being destroyed even if their destroyers were the hated yankees hotels on the other hand were not necessarily the devils way stations and so liam mccombs establishment had been appropriately elevated the reader can only imagine the terror of the women as they beseeched their attackers to spare their lives the examiner trumpeted and a paragraph later it seems northern cavaliers can be brave enough when their foes are women and children but they display nothing but clean heels and horses tails when faced by southern soldiers theyre beating the patriotic drum galloway said wearily by telling halftruths and outright lies there were soldiers in that socalled hotel adam even the newspaper admits as much and it says here sir that those soldiers called on the enemy to cease fire what else would it say galloway asked and then in grudging acknowledgment of adams anger he went on when billy gets back well ask him the truth and you think hell tell you the truth adam asked hotly galloway sighed i think maybe billy has an excess of zeal adam but i dont reckon billy murdered any woman that night i aint saying no woman died but only that it was an accident tragedy happens in wartime adam its why were trying to end the war quickly adam threw the newspaper down in disgust his disgust was not so much with the examiner but with galloways refusal to face the truth that billy blythe was a man who used warfare as an excuse for criminality blythe even boasted about using the war as a means of enrichment and the more adam reflected on blythe the angrier he became so that he was forced to calm himself down by taking a deep breath he listened to the angry voices coming from the generals parlor and it struck him that war was a dreadful instrument that stirred a whole society into turmoil bringing the worst to the top and driving the best down galloway saw the anger on the younger mans face and wondered whether adam was too tender for war maybe a man needed billy blythes callous carapace to be a good soldier yet it was undeniable that it had been adam and not blythe who had provided galloway with his one victory galloway now wondered where blythe was for his secondincommand had never returned from his patrol into the west maybe he had followed the strange column to its destination and would be waiting at galloways farm or maybe more disastrously blythes troop had been ambushed and cut to pieces by the rebels beyond the town a train whistle hooted mournfully while further away where the federal army was dug in on the rappahannocks northern bank the thunder of cannon fire rumbled incessantly the southern gunners had started an artillery duel that had been raging all day probably galloway now realized as a means of diverting john pope from what was happening behind his back when this wars overadam broke his silence after a long pausewe shall have to live in this community we shall have to make our peace with neighbors and family but well never have peace if we condone murder the norths virtue he wanted to add lay in its moral rectitude but the sentiment sounded too pompous for utterance galloway privately doubted whether any southerner who had fought for the north could ever hope to make a home south of washington again but he nodded anyway ill make inquiries adam i promise you he said and adam had to be content with that promise for suddenly the parlor door was thrown open and john pope himself strode into the hallway the northern commander checked when he saw the waiting cavalry officers youre galloway right yes sir a manassas man arent i right yes sir galloway acknowledged pope snapped his fingers the very man youre to take your fellows home galloway jacksons there one of our fellows saw the wretch in person and escaped to tell the tale theres no doubt about it jacksons in manassas and you know what that means it means weve got him in the bag you understand me the general was suddenly exultant he might have been reluctant to accept that his battle lay at manassas and not across the rappahannock but a few hours of reflection had convinced him of the advantages of accepting jacksons foolhardy challenge the damned fool has marched halfway round our army to maroon himself in manassas and tomorrow were going to snap him up my god jeb stuart might make a fool of george brinton mcclellan by riding clean around his army but no stonewall jackson will march clean round john pope no sir so gallowaypope jabbed a finger at the major take your fellows north and find out just where the wretched man is and report to me when you know were going to bristoe tonight if you want to put your horses on our train then come now hurry the commander strode into the street followed by flustered aides clutching luggage and maps so wheres lee galloway asked faintly but no one responded perhaps because no one heard him or perhaps because no one thought the question important all that mattered was that stonewall jackson had marched himself into a trap and that john pope was about to destroy him once and for all weve got the fool in the bag pope boasted as he hurried toward the train he believed would carry him northward to victory right in the bag lucifer did return he returned with a leather grip that had been put in store by a northern officer but that now held starbucks new possessions every damn thing you wanted lucifer said proudly and a silver hairbrush too see make you look real good and i got you cigars good ones lucifer had also discarded his flamboyant clothes and replaced them with a northern cavalrymans pants over which he was wearing a gray jacket a leather belt and a buttonflapped holster yet somehow his natural elegance imbued even that humdrum uniform with flair is there anything in that holster starbuck demanded i got myself a cooking implement lucifer said made by mr colt of hartford in connecticut you mean youve got a gun starbuck said flatly it is not a gun lucifer protested it is a utensil for killing the food you want me to cook for you and if i cant have a utensil i cant get meat and i cant cook the meat i cant get and you cant eat the meat i cant cook and then youll starve and ill be so hungry i wont even have the strength left to bury you starbuck sighed if youre caught with a gun lucifer then someone will take the skin off your back if i have got myself a colt cooking utensil major then there aint no son of a stinking bitch alive who can take the skin off any one little part of me starbuck gave in he sent the boy to find some food but warned him to be ready to leave at any minute the daylight was fading its twilight obscured by the myriad of fires that burned among the wagons and boxcars and starbuck expected imminent orders to move away from the fiery smoke pillars that were surely serving as beacons to draw every northern soldier within twenty miles not that the rebel army was in a fit state to move some men snored in alcoholic stupors while others gorged with rich food slept oblivious of the incendiary parties who went from warehouse to warehouse burning what could not be carried away in the last of the light starbuck shaved himself using a new mirror and razor that lucifer had found then he feasted on pickled oysters and fresh bread and butter dark came and there were still no orders to move starbuck assumed jackson had decided to run the risk of spending the night in the captured burning depot and so he made himself a bed from a pile of brandnew northern overcoats but the softness of the makeshift mattress was disconcertingly comfortable and so he rolled off the pile onto the familiar dirt and there slept well and woke to inferno he opened his eyes to see a sky lancing with red fire and to hear a thunderous roll of monstrous noise filling the night he started up reaching for his rifle while all around him the men of the legion woke to the same terrifying cacophony a burning fragment fell from the sky to thump into the dirt beside starbuck what the hells happening starbuck asked of no one in particular then he realized that the norths great supply of ammunition was being destroyed boxcar after boxcar of cartridges percussion caps shells and artillery propellant was being torched the explosions thumped across the depot each one flashing a bright illumination that pulsed its brilliance high into the sky monstrous flames boiled hundreds of feet into the air where hissing missiles spat through churning smoke oh my god a man said after one particularly sharp and bright explosion just lay me down the phrase which was spreading throughout jacksons army prompted an immediate burst of laughter major starbuck major starbuck captain pryor now swynyards aide searched among the startled men im here were to march now what time is it midnight sir a little after starbuck shouted for sergeant major tolliver a warehouse crammed with shrapnel disintegrated in flame to make the night momentarily as bright and red as hells deep at noon the explosion was followed by a tantalizing smell as barrels of cured bacon caught the flames and fried a loose horse galloped in terror past a gang of sweating demons who were destroying the last locomotives in the depot by stuffing their fireboxes with gunpowder and mangling the condenser tubes with bullets ready colonel swynyard shouted he was already on horseback and his geldings eyes reflected the nights fires like some mythical beast march they went north blindly following the brigade in front and leaving behind a writhing pit of red horror explosion after explosion ripped through the burning depot as flames climbed yet higher into the night the north had labored mightily to amass the supplies necessary to subdue the south and now all that labor was evaporating into flame smoke and ash starbucks men trudged wearily burdened by their plunder and hardly refreshed by the few hours of sleep they had snatched at the days end some of the mens heaviest loot was abandoned early joining the other trophies thrown aside by tired soldiers in the flickering unnatural light starbuck saw a discarded snare drum beside the road then two swords with chased gilt handles a pair of post office scales and a fine saddle there were piles of food candlesticks greatcoatswhatever treasures a man had fancied taken then abandoned as his muscles cramped again no one knew where they were going or why their progress was slow and never slower than when it was discovered that the column was on the wrong road and local guides had to be stirred from their beds to guide the heavily laden soldiers across the country toward dark woods the gun teams were whipped bloody as they hauled their heavy cannon through entangling hedges and across fields of growing wheat lieutenant coffman still swathed in his handsome cloak fell in beside starbuck i found out what you wanted sir he said starbuck could not even remember what he had asked coffman to discover so he asked its just off the sudley road sir theres a farm track near the fords and you go north a quartermile and there it is theres meant to be a limewashed pillar at the gate of the track though the fellow i spoke to says it needs repainting starbuck frowned down at the young lieutenant what in hells name are you talking about the galloway farm sir coffman sounded aggrieved yes of course sorry yet now the information seemed very trivial starbuck would dearly have liked to visit the galloway farm but he realized the wish was quixotic in this night of fire and tumult jackson was withdrawing from manassas so the legions revenge on galloway must wait thank you coffman he said and well done he added trying to soothe the young mans ruffled feathers just before dawn the legion stumbled across a road climbed a hill and so came to a stretch of deep woods behind the soldiers beyond a fold of nightblack land the depots fires roared like the stokehold of hell the glow of the destruction was furnace fierce and the smoke a gigantic pyre so that to starbuck standing at the woods edge and looking back it seemed as though a great section of the earth itself was burning the fires had been set four hours before yet still the bright explosions pulsed the night and churned their smoke skyward beyond the fire and dimmed by its brightness the worlds edge just showed the first cold silver line of dawn back now back now a mounted staff officer was pushing men away from the open meadow and into the cover of the woods and no fires no fires whats happening starbuck asked get some rest the man said and stay hidden and no ones to light a fire unless they want to be burned alive by old jack himself were not marching any further captain davies asked the staff officer not for the moment just stay in hiding get some rest and no fires the staff officer rode on repeating his message starbuck pulled his men back into the wood jackson had come to manassas turned the place to hell and gone to ground the reverend elial starbuck hardly slept that night at times his eyes closed out of sheer weariness and he would lean his aquiline head against the chairs high back and begin to snore gently but almost immediately another great explosion would rattle the windows of major galloways parlor and the preacher would wake with a start to see yet another ball of fire climbing up from the incandescent glow that marked where the great depot was now a furnace the devil was at his work the preacher thought grimly then tried to sleep again he had decided against using one of the bedrooms in case he needed to make a quick escape from marauding rebels and so he spent the night in the halffurnished library parlor with his stick his heavy bag and his precious flag beside him the only weapon to hand was major galloways decorative guidon on its lancetipped staff that the preacher leaned against the chair in the fond hope that its spear point might be useful to skewer a godless rebel he had spent the whole of the previous day in the same parlor his frustrations had twice driven him from the house in search of an escape from the rebel forces but each time he had glimpsed grayclad horsemen in the distance and so had scurried back to the dubious safety of the farm before the preachers arrival there had been a guard of four cavalry troopers in residence their job to protect galloways depot against the depredations of the majors sullen southern neighbors but the men had fled when jacksons troops had arrived the farms three black servants had stayed and they had fed the preacher and prayed with him but none of the servants was convinced by the reverend starbucks optimism that john pope would surely come to punish the men who had dared put manassas to the torch the preacher did manage to sleep a little toward dawn he lay slumped in the wing chair with the rebel banner clasped to his lean belly until a final massive explosion woke him to the wan light of early morning he felt stiff and cold and tired as he climbed to his feet from the parlor window he could see an enormous pillar of smoke climbing heavenward but he could see no enemy cavalrymen in rat gray coats disturbing the landscape it seemed too early to expect breakfast and so leaving his luggage in the house and taking only his cane and the precious flag he ventured timidly into the morning there was dew on the grass and mist in the folds of land two whitetailed deer bounded away from him and crashed through a thicket just to the north he could see the glint of the bull run through a gap between trees but he could still see no soldiers he walked past the servants cabins to the end of galloways yard and searched for enemies but all that moved in the pearl gray landscape was the pillar of smoke churning from the depot there was a sense of lonely desolation in the landscape almost as though the preacher was the last man left on earth he walked slowly up the farm path ever watchful but he saw nothing that threatened him and when he reached the road he turned to his left and climbed to the crest of the gentle rise so he could see across the long valley that lay to the east there was still no enemy in sight the fields were stripped of livestock the farms seemed deserted and the land lay barren he walked on he kept meaning to turn back to the farm and roust the servants to their morning duties in the kitchen yet curiosity kept him walking just a few paces more and every few paces he would determine to go just a little bit further still until at last he decided he would explore as far as the crest at the valleys far side and if he had still seen no sign of the enemy then he would return to the farm take his breakfast and carry his luggage northward so resolved he walked doggedly on following the pillar of smoke as moses had followed the pillar of cloud across the wilderness he climbed the valleys eastern side following though he did not know it the course of the first northern attack in the battle that had opened the fighting in virginia and passing though he would not have wanted to know it the place where his son had first stood in the rebel battle line this was the ground where the norths first invasion of the south had been turned back and the fields on either side of the road still showed white where fragments of bones had been unearthed from shallow graves by scavenging animals someone had placed a skull atop a tree stump at the entrance to a farm road and the macabre face grinned yellow teeth at the preacher as he passed by he reached the wooded crest he had now walked a mile from galloways farm and in front of him he could see the warrenton turnpike running empty through a valley while on the valleys far side at the crest of a steep green hill the ruins of a burnedout house stood gaunt and black against the great smear of dirty smoke that hideously obscured the dawn the house had been destroyed in the battle fought across these manassas fields a year before but the preacher assumed the dwelling had been burned by the rebels on the previous day it did not occur to him that a southern army would hardly torch a virginia farm he simply saw new evidence of the devils work and knew it had to be the responsibility of the forces of slavocracy barbarians he said aloud into the empty country barbarians something thumped on the road behind and the preacher turned to see the grinning skull had been tipped from its tree stump and was now rolling across the road beyond the skull was a horseman holding a rifle that was aimed straight at the reverend starbuck to his surprise the preacher discovered he was not really frightened at thus facing one of the devils who had scourged this land barbarian the preacher shouted angrily waving his stick at the horseman heathen doctor starbuck the horseman responded politely is it you sir the preacher gaped at the cavalryman major galloway youre hardly the person i expected to meet here sir major galloway said as he spurred toward the preacher a whole troop of horsemen followed the major from the trees as galloway explained to the reverend starbuck how he and his men had taken a train north to bristoe during the previous night and were now trying to establish the whereabouts of stonewall jacksons army i havent seen any rebels this morning the preacher said and he told how he had spent the night at galloways farm he confirmed that the property was unscathed and reported that although he had seen a handful of southern horsemen the day before he had seen none in this dawn they appear to have vanished the reverend starbuck said darkly as though the rebels possessed satanic powers so has captain blythe galloway said unless perhaps hes at the farm alas no im sure hell turn up in his own good time galloway said wanly then turned in his saddle and called on adam to bring one of the spare horses for the preachers convenience we were on our way to the farm galloway told the reverend and after that were ordered to search the country north of the bull run i was hoping to go north the preacher announced i have to reach washington im not sure youve much hope of doing that today sir galloway said respectfully theres some evidence that jackson took his troops north maybe theyre planning to attack the centreville defenses he might have vanished but hes certainly not far away the major peered round the empty landscape as though he half expected the rebels to appear like stage villains springing from a trapdoor i cant tarry here the preacher protested vigorously i have a church to administer responsibilities i cannot escape youll certainly be safer here sir galloway suggested calmly seeing as how general popes here now and the rest of his army is on its way he leaned out of his saddle to hold the spare horse while the preacher clambered into its saddle the rebel flag almost fell from the reverend starbucks grip but he managed to hold on to the bundled silk as he settled himself on the horses back a trooper handed up the preachers stick then gave him the reins in fact if you do stay here sir major galloway went on i reckon you might even see a scrap of history being made history i have been promised nothing but history all month major i was promised a pulpit in richmond but for all those fine promises i might just as well have planned on preaching gods word in japan but the rebels have blundered now sir galloway explained patiently leastwise general pope reckons they have jacksons stranded here sir miles from his own lines and general pope plans to cut him off and destroy him thats why popes here sir were going to finish jackson once and for all you really think pope can do that major the preachers question was caustic galloways reply was emollient i reckon general pope means to try sir and none of us really know just what the general can do in battle i mean he was pretty successful in the west sir but he aint fought here and that was why he was brought to virginia so i guess he might astonish us all yet yes sir i reckon we might see a fair battle before the days out and i even reckon we might win it too the prospect tempted the reverend starbuck he had come to virginia with such high hopes and had seen those hopes crumble to nothing but now it seemed there was a chance of victory after all besides it was now thursday morning and he knew he could never reach boston in time for sunday worship which meant he might just as well stay here and see the norths nemesis beaten in battle and what a fine subject for a sermon that would make he thought like satan plunging into the abyss jackson would be brought low and the reverend starbuck would be a witness to the demons shattering fall he nodded assent he would stay and fight all day long jacksons troops waited in the woods most slept like the dead so that starbuck setting his sentries just inside the tree line could hear the murmur of the sleeping army like a swarm of bees twentyfour thousand rebel soldiers were snoring not six miles from manassas yet the northern army was oblivious of their presence lucifer brought starbuck an early dinner of cold pork apples and walnuts still eating off the yankees he explained the luxury foodstuffs then he squatted beside starbuck and stared down the hill toward the empty turnpike in search of yankees there were none in sight so where are the black folks friends lucifer asked god knows lets hope they dont find us the sun was low in the sky and with any luck night would fall before the enemy found jacksons hiding place you dont want to fight lucifer asked sarcastically i dont want to die you wont die you were born under a lucky star like me i can tell starbuck scoffed at the boys confidence and i tell you lucifer that just about every poor son of a bitch whos died in this war thought he was too lucky to get killed but i really am lucky lucifer insisted and youd better be just as lucky as me because you know what i was hearing back there among the other humble servant folk that there are men in this regiment who dont like you i know that starbuck said the pork was tender and the apples fresh he wondered how long it would be before he was back on hardtack and salted offal but did you know theyve written a letter about you lucifer offered a sly sideways glance then lit himself one of the cigars he had acquired for starbuck the bald fellow wrote the letter you know the man you made me give his watch to meddlesome is that his name and i hear some three or four officers have signed it and at least forty or fifty soldiers and theyre sending the letter to a congressman they say youre too young and that you should be sent down the river just as fast as the army can get itself rid of you the boy grinned then drew his finger across his throat they got nothing but trouble for you major starbuck told lucifer what the letter writers could do with their damned letter no ones sending me down the river he added not if i win battles but suppose they dont let you win lucifer asked starbuck acknowledged the question with a deprecating shrug then stole the boys cigar you know what ive learned about soldiering to take another mans smoke away that the worst enemy is never the fellow in the other uniform thats what he paused with the cigar halfway to his lips because a sudden fusillade had sounded in the west the shots were from far away but they ripped and crackled angrily in the late afternoon here we go again starbuck said and sucked on the cigar as his heart lurched he wondered if fear ever decreased or whether it got worse and worse until a man could no longer make himself stand upright in battle men woke among the trees and listened uneasily to the sound of firing all but the newest conscript had learned to judge a fights intensity from the sound of its guns and this fight was hard and furious and so they expected orders that would send them to join in but no such orders came the fight continued into the dusk and no one knew who was fighting or who was winning only that a skim of powder smoke showed white above the tree line in the west colonel swynyard finally brought the legion news it seemed that a column of yankee troops had been marching on the turnpike and that jackson had ordered his own stonewall brigade to intercept and destroy the column except the yankees are too stubborn to run swynyard said theyre standing toetotoe and fighting like demons i thought we were supposed to be hiding from the yankees starbuck said i guess weve hid long enough maybe old mad jack reckons its time to draw the yankees on to us swynyard suggested he looked up at the darkening sky and grimaced not that theyll come tonight but tomorrow he glanced over at lucifer who was crouched beside starbucks few possessions hows your darkie the colonel asked gruffly he seems willing enough he looks a sly one to me hes got soft hands starbuck which like as not means hes been someones house pet and those pants he was wearing when you found him the longpocket ones they aint the pants of an honest man if you want a good slave get yourself a bonebrained field hand who aint afraid of a bit of work but your boy looks more like the dangerous type of slave to me what is the dangerous type the clever type not all the darkies have brains like mules you know some of them are real sharp and my father always reckoned it was the clever ones who needed breaking first whip em bloody hed say then work them to death because if theres trouble among the people then you can be sure its the clever ones who started it so get rid of the clever ones and that way youll have no trouble thats the first and last rule of keeping slaves starbuck and youre probably breaking it i dont suppose its christian to beat a darkie without cause so i wont suggest you do it but id still advise you to send the boy away i wont do that i like lucifer starbuck said lucifer is that what he calls himself dear lord swynyard said shocked by the names impiety find out what hes really called starbuck dont put up with that kind of nonsense and have him cut his hair off you dont want a black dandy and for the lords sake take that gun off him for a start its illegal but more important if you encourage him to think hes a cut above the other darkies hell soon think hes a cut above you give a clever slave an inch and hell take you for everything youve got the colonel checked this stream of advice to listen to the firing which had reached a new intensity almost as if the two sides were equally desperate to reach a victory before the sun dipped beneath the horizon not our business thank god get some sleep tonight starbuck because i daresay well be neck deep in yankees tomorrow the longhaired guntoting lucifer watched the colonel go what did he say about me he asked starbuck he gave me good advice starbuck said he told me to whip you bloody then work you to death lucifer grinned you dont want to do that im your good luck major he turned back toward swynyards retreating figure and made a deliberately formal gesture with his clenched right fist which at the last moment he uncurled to let fall a few scraps of fragile bone and powdery white dust starbuck thought he recognized the ribs of a small bird among the litter lucifer had let drop but he did not like to ask what the strange gesture meant he was afraid to know so instead he looked out from the trees and saw at last yankees horsemen were galloping across distant fields spurring toward the firefight that still crackled in the west the enemy was gathering like storm clouds heaping and tomorrow they would fight the reverend elial starbucks hopes which had plunged so low during the inconveniences of the rail journey now soared again and once again it was the acrid smoke of battle that filled him with that fierce exaltation he had breakfasted with major galloway and afterward leaving his luggage in the farm the preacher had ridden to manassas junction to see the damage done to the depot and to introduce himself to general popes headquarters the general had been affability itself and had willingly given his permission for the famous preacher to stay with the army even inviting him to share the headquarters potluck suppers for the next few nights thus honored the reverend starbuck had ridden south to bristoe to commiserate with his old friend nathaniel banks who had been given the undemanding task of guarding the rail depot banks who still considered his action at cedar mountain a victory complained bitterly about his present duties but the reverend starbuck was in no mood to encourage such backbiting his spirits were being revived by the arrival of train after train from warrenton junction each train crammed with troops fetched from the rappahannock defenses the damage to the rail line north of bristoe meant that the trains had to disgorge their passengers in the open country and soon the line of parked locomotives and cars stretched for more than two miles the men marched in from the fields where they had alighted and boasted that they had come to knock stonewall down once and for all the preacher liked their spirit his own spirits rose even higher when late in the afternoon he heard the sound of gunfire coming from the north he took his tired horse toward the sound of the guns passing through quiet fields and deserted woods until at last he came to the valley where the warrenton turnpike ran and where a rill of smoke showed where men fought in the valleys bottom he rode toward the fighting arriving just as an enemy regiment made an attack on the yankees open right flank the graycoated attackers advanced in a line two ranks deep their rifles were tipped with bayonets that reflected the dying suns scarlet light they came in good order kicking down a snake fence and then advancing across a pasture the attack was silent suggesting that these rebels planned to save their famous yell for the last few yards of their charge some rebels were screaming that weird sound off to the preachers left but that larger battle seemed stalemated between two opposing lines of riflemen the northerners had seen the threat to their right flank and hurried three regiments to meet it two of the regiments were from wisconsin and the third from new york the northerners formed their ranks in a fold of land where they crouched behind a fence the attackers oblivious to the number of yankees facing their charge began to hurry and their first shrill yells yipped in the dusk the defiant sound prompted the northern line to stand behind their fence and fire a shattering volley across the pasture the volleys noise ripped over the valley and rolled back rifle flames glittered in the failing light while the layered cloud of powder smoke drifted across the meadow to where the confederates had been brought to a sudden astonished halt the reverend starbuck oblivious of the bullets that whipsawed around his horse cheered his northerners on their first volley had stopped the rebel attack dead their second turned it into a bloody mess and their third began to drive the grayclad regiment backward the rebel fire became ever more feeble as the northern fire increased one of the rebels banners toppled was plucked up and immediately fell again as the new standardbearer was thrown back by a dozen bullets thats the way to deal with devils boys the reverend starbuck shouted a heaped line of dead and injured men showed where the tide of the confederate attack had stalled and now the survivors grudgingly abandoned that writhing bloody heap as they edged backward earlier in the day the preacher had equipped himself with a colt revolver from among galloways stores and now he remembered the weapon and drew it from his saddle pouch he fired at the stubborn rebels who though their line had been broken and bloodied still tried to return the overwhelming northern fire by the left oblique forward a stentorian voice shouted and the new york regiment swung forward like a gate that threatened to close on the remnants of the rebel attackers halt the new yorkers commanding officer called aim the preacher hurried his horse after the advancing new yorkers fire the new york volley slashed into the rebels tattered flank it was a killing volley a massive blow that seemed to twitch the surviving rebels bodily backward blood misted the evening air as the bullets smacked home gray coats were splattered with red and the field littered with still more dead and dying bodies a man reeled out of the rebel line blood pouring from an eye socket he collapsed to his knees looking as if he was praying and the reverend starbuck cried in triumph as he fired his revolver at the man doing gods work the new yorkers colonel rode across to the preachers side think not that i am come to send peace on earth i came not to send peace but a sword the reverend starbuck trumpeted the text then fired at a rebel who seemed to be giving orders our lords own words he added to the colonel were certainly doing his work well this time the colonel shouted over the sound of his mens volleys i pray as much the reverend starbuck fired his guns last cylinder and hoped he had slaughtered at least one rebel with his efforts his wrist hurt from the guns massive kick it was a long time since he had fired a gun and he was not sure he could remember quite how to load a revolver i suppose you wouldnt know where pope is the colonel asked the preacher i last saw him in manassas would you be going back there sir and if so can you take a message willingly the colonel scribbled on a page of his notebook lord knows where jacksons main body is but it cant be far away we need to bring everyone here tomorrow morning to flush the mudsill out and finish him off he tore the page out of his book and handed it to the preacher just like weve finished off these rogues the colonel said gesturing at the rebel regiment that had been beaten back with terrible loss the field writhed with bodies while a sorry handful of survivors limped back toward the far woods poor fellows the colonel said poor fellows the scum of creation the preacher averred devils in cretinous shape colonel as even a casual glance at their skull shapes might reveal they are southerners halfwitted morally infantile and criminal dont feel sorry for them expend your pity on the negroes they enslaved indeed the new yorker muttered taken aback by the vehemence of the preachers words youll deliver my message to pope sir with pleasure colonel with pleasure the reverend starbuck said and then feeling as though he was at last making a real contribution toward the destruction of the slavocracy he turned his tired horse and headed back across the hills he arrived in the days last light at the smoking ruins of the depot where lines of twisted scorched boxcar frames stood on blackened wheels amidst great drifts of smoking ashes there was acre upon acre of ruin of desolation of destruction indeed to the preachers heightened senses there was something biblical in the awful sight almost as though he witnessed the results of a visitation of gods wrath upon a people who had been lax in their duty the reverend starbuck did not doubt that god could use even the hated slavocracy to scourge the north for its sins but the time would surely come when the north would repent and on that happy day the armies of the godly would inflict a destruction similar to this horror upon all the rebels habitations and towns and farms and perhaps the reverend starbuck fervently prayed that great revival and consequent victory was starting here and now he discovered the armys commanding general in a farm just north of the depot a score of senior officers surrounded pope among them and outranked by all of them was major galloway his face coated with dust and his uniform soaked with sweat pope snatched at the message the reverend starbuck carried its from wainwright he announced the general read the scribbled note quickly and was so pleased by what he read that he slapped the table weve got him weve got him hes on the warrenton road but hes been blocked there hes trapped he was at centreville now hes retreating toward warrenton pope made a fine slashing pencil mark on one of the maps that lay on the table i saw no sign of him at centreville sir galloway said nervously no wonder the fellow was going backwards pope laughed but who minds whether you saw him or not galloway it doesnt matter where he was but where he is now and hes right here he made another pencil slash forming a cross on the warrenton turnpike at the place where the reverend starbuck had seen the rebel attack trounced so tomorrow well bag the whole crowd the general could not hide his elation for almost a year the north had shuddered at the name of stonewall jackson and tomorrow pope would end the fear and destroy the bogeyman major galloway though outranked by the bearded men around him stuck to his guns but what about the fellows my officer saw at salem sir he was speaking of billy blythe who had at last reappeared with a convoluted and not wholly convincing story of being chased by southern horsemen and of being forced to take shelter for two days and nights in a draw of the blue ridge mountains but however false the tale rang the final part seemed true enough blythe claimed he had returned to the norths lines by following the foothills of the blue ridge until he reached the deserted rails of the manassas gap railroad but that when he had tried to follow that rail line east he had almost been captured by southern cavalry pickets who had been guarding an immense column of troops hurrying toward thoroughfare gap blythes men had confirmed that part of their captains story and galloway had brought the grim news to pope but how reliable is this fellow pope asked galloway the northern general did not want to believe that yet more rebels were marching toward manassas he preferred his own theory that jacksons panicked retreat had been intercepted on the turnpike captain blythe is galloway began then could not continue billy can be wild at times sir he admitted truthfully but his men are telling the same tale and so they should men ought to support their officers pope said dismissively so what exactly did they see men approaching the thoroughfare gap sir wagons guns and infantry pope chuckled what your fellows saw galloway was jacksons supply train slipping off to the west stands to reason major if jacksons retreating this wayhe slashed the pencil from east to westthen his wagons and guns wont be going in the opposite direction not unless hes a good deal more stupid than we suppose no major your fellow saw the rebels retreating not advancing and tomorrow well turn that retreat into a rout his aides murmured agreement tomorrow the north would turn the war around tomorrow the north would begin the utter destruction of rebellion in virginia only one of popes senior officers demurred he was an elderly artillery officer wearing the star of a brigadier general on his collar and he seemed worried enough by galloways report to ask whether it was worth running any risks if we pull back behind the centreville defenses sir we can wait for mcclellans troops to join us in a week sir with respect we can overwhelm every rebel in virginia you want me to retreat john pope asked scathingly this army sir is far too accustomed to retreat it has been led by men who know nothing except how to retreat no its time we advanced time we fought and time we won hallelujah the reverend starbuck interjected but wheres lee galloway asked but no one had heard the question general pope and his staff had gone to their potluck supper taking the generals and the visiting preacher with them and leaving galloway alone the fighting died as darkness swamped the turnpike the north assuming that jackson had tried to force his way past them claimed victory while jackson whose object had been to draw the northerners into a full attack kept his silence the wounded cried in the dark while all around them rustling in the night an army gathered for the kill at manassas on friday august the first light showed a few moments after half past four it was a gray wolfish light at first little more than a cold thinning of the eastern darkness yet it was sufficient to rouse jacksons army the men rolled their blankets and for the first time since they had left the burning depot were allowed to light fires the sons of bitches know were here now so we dont have to hide starbuck told his men then sighed with content as he smelt the wondrous aroma of real coffee being brewed on dozens of fires at a quarter past five a mug of the coffee clasped in his hands he watched the scenery take shape across the turnpike there were troops now where there had been none the night before the brown smear of smoke that still rose from the depot had drawn an army to manassas and starbuck could see lines of bivouacked infantry parks of guns and rows of tethered cavalry horses the enemy like his own men were brewing coffee or shaving while curious yankee officers trained their field glasses and telescopes toward the silent western woods where the mingling plumes of smoke at last revealed the true extent of jacksons position well fight here you reckon captain ethan davies asked starbuck davies was cleaning his spectacle lenses on the skirt of his coat it aint a bad place to defend davies added hooking the spectacles back onto his ears the land fell away from the woods toward the turnpike and starbuck like davies reckoned it was not a bad place to stand and fight because the yankees would have to attack uphill while the rebels would have the concealing woods at their back yet as the sun rose jackson abandoned the position and ordered his army to retreat westward they did not go far just a halfmile across unfilled fields into another ragged stretch of blackjack oaks maples and birch trees this new wood was interrupted by small patches of rough meadowland and cut by two streams and a railbed that had been graded but never finished with ties and rails the railbed had been intended to carry a line that would bypass manassas junction and so keep the trains of the manassas gap railroad from paying the exorbitant fees required to use the rails of the orange and alexandria railroad but the investors had run out of cash and abandoned the work leaving only a smooth wide grassy roadway that ran through deep cuttings and along high embankments as it curved always level through the undulating woods it was on the railbed that jackson stopped with his twentyfour thousand men colonel swynyards brigade would defend a stretch of the unfinished railroad that ran through a deep cutting the eastwardfacing bank of the cutting provided a firestep for riflemen who could if overwhelmed retreat across the wide entrenchment into the woods on the western side a hundred paces behind the cutting the ground rose steeply though to the right of swynyards line where the faulconer legion was posted that hill faded away so that starbucks righthand companies had no natural barrier behind them only a flat stretch of young woodland and dense shrub that change in topography also meant that the cutting became shallow as the railbed rose toward an embankment while the existence of a deep spoil pit behind the line only made the defense line even more confusing the spoil pit only half filled was where the railroad men had dumped the dirt and rocks they had not needed to build up their embankments the spoil pit marked the dividing line between swynyards brigade and their neighbors to the south and starbuck once his men were in position walked to meet those neighbors a regiment from north carolina their colonel was a very tall very thin very fairhaired man in his early middle age with an elaborately drooping mustache amused eyes and a weatherbeaten face he had very long and studiedly oldfashioned hair that flowed past the faded blue collar of his gray frock coat colonel elijah hudson he introduced himself to starbuck of stanly county and uncommon proud of it major starbuck of boston massachusetts colonel hudson pushed back a lock of his curled hair to uncover one ear i do believe my hearing has been quite obliterated by the artillery major for i could swear you said boston so i did colonel so i did but my boys are all virginians the good lord alone knows why you came here from massachusetts major but i sure am glad to make your acquaintance your boys up to hum are they i reckon mine are rogues each and every one of them not a man of thems worth a wooden nickel but lord above how i do love the wretches aint that so boys colonel hudson had spoken loud enough for his nearest men to hear and those men grinned broadly at his words and this here major hudson went on to introduce starbuck to his men is a poor lost northerner fighting for us miserable rebels but you all be nice to him boys because if his lads give way then well all be so many dead ducks waiting for john pope to pluck us and i dont have a fancy to be plucked by a cleric this day starbuck led hudson past the spoil pit to the legion and introduced him to major medlicott explaining that medlicott not only commanded the company immediately adjacent to the north carolinians but was also responsible for the whole right wing of the legion sure pleased to meet you major hudson said putting out a hand my names elijah hudson and im from stanly county the best county in all the carolinas even though my dear wife does come from catawba county god bless her and how are you medlicott seemed disconcerted by the tall mans friendliness but managed to make a civil response weve got ourselves a killing patch hudson said gesturing across the rail cutting to where the ground ran bare to the closest stretch of woods it was a killing patch because any yankees attacking out of the woods would be forced to cross those fifty paces of open land under constant fire i cant say it was ever my burning ambition to kill yankees hudson said but if the dear good lord above wants me to do it then he sure does make it easy in a place like this mind you if the northern gentlemen do manage to get past the railbed then were all going to be in a heap of trouble if that happens we might as well all pack it in and go back to our jobs what is your job major he inquired of starbuck soldiering i guess i was a student before the war im a miller medlicott answered to a similar inquiry and what better job could a man have hudson asked than to grind the lords corn into our daily bread that sure is a privilege major a genuine privilege and im proud to know you for it and your profession sir starbuck asked the tall hudson cant rightly say ive got any profession starbuck other than a love of god and stanly county i guess you could say i do a little of everything and a fair heap of nothing but if i was pushed to the scratch id have to confess to being a farmer just one of americas toilladen farmers but proud as heck of it hudson smiled broadly then offered his hand again to both men i guess i should go and make sure my rogues arent running away out of sheer boredom i count it a real privilege to fight beside you gentlemen and i wish you much happiness of the day with a wave of his hand the lanky hudson strode away a nice fellow starbuck said grasping folk north carolinians medlicott said dourly i never did trust a north carolinian well hes trusting you starbuck said tartly because if we give way here then hell be outflanked he stared at medlicotts riflemen who were making themselves comfortable in the shallow stretch of the railbed cutting then turned to look at the remains of the construction crews spoil pit which was now an overgrown hollow stretching for thirty yards behind the makeshift entrenchment the hollows stony overgrown bed could serve as a hidden path into the rear of the rebel defenses i guess we ought to barricade the pit starbuck said i dont need you to teach me my business medlicott answered starbucks temper whiplashed uncontrollably listen you son of a damned bitch he said i aint losing this damned battle because you dont like me if the yankees use that pit to get behind my line im going to use your damned skull for regimental target practice you understanding me medlicott unable to compete with the intensity of starbucks anger backed away two paces i know how to fight he said uneasily starbuck resisted the temptation to remind medlicott of his cowardice at cedar mountain then make sure you do fight he said instead and to help you put an abatis across the pit an abatis was a barrier of branches that would entangle an attacker and offer a breastwork to a defender starbuck saw the hurt in the millers face and regretted the fierceness of his tone i know you dont like me medlicott he said trying to make amends but our quarrel aint with each other its with the yankees and youre a yankee the miller said sullenly starbuck resisted the impulse to tonguelash the wretched man a second time get your fellows to build the abatishe forced himself to speak calmlyand ill be back soon to look at it dont trust me is that it i hear you write a good letter starbuck said but i just dont know how good an abatis you can build with that parting shot he walked away blowing the frustration from his lungs in a plume of cigar smoke he wondered if he should have reversed the legions usual order of battle by putting truslows men on the right and medlicotts on the left but such an act would have been construed as a deep insult to the rightflank companies and starbuck wanted to demonstrate to the men of those companies if not to their officers how he trusted them he walked on to the northern end of his line where truslows company was entrenched in the deepest section of the railbeds cutting on their left was one of the brigades small florida battalions truslow had paced the open land in front of the cutting to make certain his men knew the exact range of the woods its seventyfive yards from here to the timberline truslow told starbuck and even a blind son of a bitch can hit a yankee at seventyfive yards the bullet will hardly have started to drop he raised his voice so that the nearest floridans could hear him aim straight at the bastards hearts and at worse youll puncture their bellies this is infantschool killing not the hard stuff the hard stuff was openfield fighting where a bullets longrange trajectory was so pronounced that a shot properly sighted at a man standing three hundred yards away would sail high over the cap of a soldier a hundred paces nearer starbuck had seen a full regimental volley fired at a line of skirmishers without a single bullet finding its mark there was a constant coming and going of staff officers probing the woods beyond the killing patch to watch for the yankee advance colonel swynyard made a similar reconnaissance and returned to give starbuck what news he could they aint advancing yet he said you think theyll come if they do what theyre supposed to do yes he confirmed that the previous evenings action on the turnpike had indeed been designed to draw the yankees to the attack i guess our job is to hold them here while lee brings up the rest of the army swynyards mention of lee was the first mention starbuck had heard of the armys commander since they had arrived in manassas where is lee he asked just the other side of thoroughfare gap swynyard said hes that close starbuck was surprised i guess thats where he always intended to be swynyard said with undisguised admiration he sent us on ahead to draw the yankees away from the river and now hes following on behind which means that if we can just hold the yankees all morning then lee should hogtie the lot of them this afternoon if the good lord wills it that is the colonel added piously the tic in his right cheek which had slowly subsided after his abandonment of liquor had mysteriously returned to full force for a second starbuck wondered if swynyard had been at the bottle then realized the tic must be a symptom of nervousness this was the colonels first battle as a brigade commander and he desperately wanted it to be a success how are your boys swynyard asked good enough starbuck said wondering what symptoms of nervousness he was displaying shortness of temper maybe swynyard turned and pointed to the hill behind the legions line ive got haxalls arkansas boys up there if things get hard ill send them down to help but once theyve gone we dont have any reserves artillery starbuck asked none that ive seen swynyard said none at all i guess but if lee gets here fast then maybe we wont need none the colonel climbed back to his command post the sun rose higher promising to bring another stifling day off to the south muffled by distance rifle shots sounded but it was hard to tell whether they were being fired in anger or were merely the sound of men trying to provoke distant pickets some of starbucks men slept as they waited a few pinned paper labels to their jackets to identify their bodies in case they died others wrote letters or read or played cards in the spoil pit the abatis was now breast high tall enough for you medlicott asked starbuck is it tall enough for you starbuck retorted its your life it might save not mine if they attack at all medlicott said in a tone of voice suggesting that starbucks expectation of battle was merely alarmist by late morning starbuck was himself wondering if the northern army would ever attack maybe the northerners had detected lees approach and slipped away to fight another day for this day had become somnolent its peace broken by nothing more threatening than an occasional and distant rifle shot then just as starbuck had convinced himself that he was safe from battle this day the woods to the left erupted with furious rifle fire startled men woke and pushed their rifles over the cuttings crude parapet all along the line hammers clicked as men cocked their guns but no yankees appeared in the killing patch only a frightened deer that ducked in and out of the sunlight before any man could squeeze off a shot then a staff officer from the brigade to the north rode up the line shouting for men to advance into the woods to do what starbuck shouted back the staff officer was excited and sweating a drawn sword in his hand yankees are over there you can hit them in the flank do it starbuck colonel swynyard had arrived just in time to hear the officer go for them starbuck sent coffman to tell colonel hudson what was happening he wanted to keep the north carolinian well informed just as hudson had promised to keep starbuck apprised of any threats on his southern flank then starbuck scrambled up the cuttings face legion the men climbed from the cutting and formed in two ranks there were no battle flags to be raised in the legions center where starbuck took his place forward he shouted the fighting was crackling and spitting in the woods punctuated by rebel yells it was hard to tell just what had provoked the fight but plainly some rebel troops had crossed the railbed to intercept some yankees among the trees where starbuck now led the legion he went fast knowing that his careful battle line would be shredded by the oaks but also knowing that any chance of finding an open yankee flank was too compelling to be ignored the men panted behind him crashing through undergrowth and splintering dry fallen branches as they ran starbuck was leading the legion to his left going slantwise across the rebels front line he could see gunsmoke sifting through the leaves ahead then he glimpsed flashes of blue where a handful of northern soldiers ran through the woods he ran toward those enemy but the blue coats disappeared in the trees somewhere a rifle fired and starbuck heard the bullet ripping through the leaves overhead but he could not see the gunsmoke or tell whether it was a friend or foe who had fired he slowed down to catch his breath the legion had long lost its cohesion as the companies broke apart in the woodland so that now they were streaming through the trees like packs of hunters on a quick scent a volley crashed to starbucks left but no bullets came his way a riderless horse foaming with sweat and with white eyes flashing plunged through the brush and galloped unchecked between two of starbucks companies the wood suddenly seemed empty of enemy starbuck could hear shouted orders and sporadic rifle fire but he could see no one and he feared he had led his men far astray then a sudden warning shout turned him to his left and there suddenly was an enemy a huddle of yankees were kneeling and firing loading and aiming but their targets were not the men of the legion but other southerners way off to the legions left which suggested that starbuck had indeed discovered the norths open flank legion halt aim he was giving his men precious little time they skidded to a halt and raised their guns tire the small group of yankees were swept cruelly away over two hundred bullets had been fired at a score of men and only one of them was able to stand when the volley was done and that man was staggering and bleeding charge starbuck shouted and let me hear you scream the legion began to sound the rebel yell starbuck remembered that he had not ordered the men to fix bayonets but it was too late to remedy the lack now the legion had been unleashed and nothing could stop the ragged charge that screamed through the wood to take the enemys open flank the trees ahead were filled with fleeing yankees more rebels were coming from the left and starbuck shouted at his men to wheel right this way this way the breath was pounding in his lungs somewhere a man screamed again and again the sound terrible and pathetic until it was blissfully cut short by a rifle shot starbuck leaped a dead man stumbled on a fallen log pushed through a laurel screen then saw he had blundered into an open field covered with running men halt he shouted stop here reload the legion made a rough line at the woods edge and fired at the horde of retreating yankees the men were too breathless and too excited to shoot well but their rifle fire did serve to hasten the yankees panicked retreat another rebel regiment appeared to the legions left and pursued the enemy into the open meadow but when company h began to follow captain truslow pulled them back just a second before a northern battery unmasked itself in a stand of trees on the meadows far side the first cannon whipped a barrelload of canister through the exposed rebel pursuers a second gun fired this gun aiming shell at starbucks men the missile cracked overhead and exploded in the trees just as a ragged northern volley whistled over the pasture back colonel swynyard had advanced with the legion back to the railbed lads well done lieutenant howes starbuck shouted a party to collect guns and ammunition weve got some prisoners here sir howes called back starbuck had not been aware of any prisoners being taken but sure enough there was a disconsolate group of a dozen men under a corporals guard who had to be escorted back to the brigade headquarters howes men found a score of usable rifles and several hundred cartridges that they carried back through the woods a nice beginning colonel swynyard said to starbuck when the legion was back in its cutting easy pickings starbuck was dismissive he could not recall a single bullet coming near him he knew the legion had not needed to be involved in the fight but he was glad that his regiment had been given such a swift and simple victory it was as swynyard had told him a good beginning but your man meddlesome didnt move lucifer waited till swynyard was gone before talking to starbuck i watched him he took his men into the woods and stopped there you went on he stayed back starbuck grunted not wanting to encourage lucifers indiscretion how old are you he asked the runaway slave instead lucifer blinked with surprise at the unexpected question seventeen he said after a while why starbuck suspected lucifer had added at least a year to his age because youre too young to die thats why so take yourself back to the wagon park i aint going to die im charmed lucifer said charmed starbuck asked how he was remembering the crushed bird bones just charmed lucifer said like i never got caught as a thief till your men trapped me and there you were he grinned see charmed but you were a thief starbuck said not with disapproval but simply to pin down the first piece of information about his past that lucifer had so far offered you think id wear those pants with long pockets otherwise mick gave them to me mick mr micklewhite lucifer said he owns the big tavern at manassas junction and i worked for him you were his slave i was his thief lucifer said but he wanted me to do other things because he said im young and goodlooking he laughed in selfmockery but starbuck detected an anxiety behind the words what sort of things starbuck asked you need to be told you dont know about appetite appetite but before lucifer could answer there was a loud snap of a breaking twig in the woods beyond the killing patch the legion went still fingers poised on triggers but nothing more sounded from the trees off to the right the firing began again but that faroff battle belonged to someone else starbuck looked for his servant again but lucifer had vanished taking his past with him ahead of starbuck the green woods were silent somewhere beyond the silence eighty thousand yankees gathered but here for the moment there was peace starbuck had chosen not to put skirmishers into the woods the killing patch between the railbeds cutting and the tree line was too wide so that by the time his own skirmishers would have returned to the legions lines the pursuing yankees would already have been halfway across the open space the north carolinians on the legions right however were faced by an evernarrowing strip of open land and had taken the precaution of putting a skirmish line among the trees and it was those men who alerted starbuck to the days second yankee attack an assault much better organized than the norths first motley advance the battle between the skirmishers did not take long the yankees were advancing in too much force and the woods were no place for scattered men to fight against a horde hudsons skirmishers fired a single round each then ran for their lives yet that scattered volley was sufficient to warn the legion that the attack was coming starbuck was in the cutting with company c which was now commanded by the excitable quicktempered william patterson who was a stonemason and thus the unwilling butt of too many jokes about gravestones patterson had pretensions of gentility and had greeted his unexpected promotion by adorning himself with a red waist sash a plumed hat and a sword he had discarded the sword and plumed hat for this days fight but the sash still marked him as an officer ready boys ready he shouted and his men licked dry lips and watched the trees anxiously theyre coming boys theyre coming patterson called yet still the green woods were empty the trees dappled by sunlight alone and the humid air unsullied by powder smoke then suddenly the northerners were in sight a mass of men ran soundlessly into view flags and bayonets were bright for a second a split heartbeat starbuck watched the rare sight of a whole army attacking straight into his face then bellowed the order to open fire fire patterson echoed the shout and his companys front vanished in a cloud of powder smoke fire moxey screamed at the company next door pattersons men were spitting bullets into rifles shoving ramrods down barrels and scrabbling for percussion caps in the upturned hats placed conveniently beside the firestep fire company ds captain pine shouted fire lieutenant howes called from company e the yankee attack was oblique emerging from the trees first to the south then to the north and suddenly like a great tide bursting on a beach the sound of the attack overwhelmed starbuck it was the sound of a great infantry charge the noise of cheering screaming swearing men and the noise of drums and bugles behind them and the noise of his own mens bullets whacking into rifle stocks and the noise of miniй bullets thumping into flesh and the noise of the first wounded men screaming and gasping and the noise of ramrods rattling metallic in rifles and the whistling whipquick noise of hollowtailed miniй bullets and the noise of thousands of heavy boots and the noise of screaming orders and the noise of men cursing their clumsiness as they fumbled to tear open cartridges it was an unending crescendo of noise a tumult of battering sound waves that obliterated senses already swamped by powder smoke all a man could do now was fight and fighting meant pouring lead into the gunsmoke to drive away the pounding cursing enemy and the enemy still came forward rank after rank of bluecoated men beneath their high striped banners fire a yankee shouted fire truslows voice answered from the legions left flank theyre firing high private matthews exulted just five paces from starbuck then matthews was flicked backward by a bullet to the head that took away a saucersized piece of his skull and spattered his neighbor with blood and brains lieutenant patterson stood transfixed as matthewss body slid to a halt at his feet the body twitched blood pouring from the shattered cranium fire starbuck shouted he saw a boy pull the trigger nothing happened yet the boy started to ram another charge down a barrel probably stuffed with unfired charges starbuck picked up matthewss bloodsticky rifle and ran to the boy fire the damn thing before you load it he snapped handing the frightened lad the new gun starbuck took the boys rifle and tossed it back out of the cutting he fired his own rifle into the gray mist of smoke then ran along the cutting past moxeys company to where medlicott guarded the vulnerable right flank the miller was fighting well enough firing his revolver into the smoke that was now being fed by the volleys of both sides to create a single filthysmelling leprous yellow cloudbank the yankee charge seemed to have stalled though it had not been defeated instead the northerners were holding their ground in the killing patch and trying to overwhelm the rebel line with volley fire were still here starbuck still here the speaker was the genial colonel hudson who had come to his own left flank on an errand not dissimilar to starbucks own mr lincolns republican party is noisy today is it not the colonel said gesturing toward the yankees with a switch of hazel that was apparently his weapon of choice a bullet slapped past hudsons long hair rotten shot the colonel lamented terrible shooting they really should look to their musket training then a second great cheer sounded from beyond the smoke and there was a resurgence of that first terrible sound that had swollen to burst against the rebels defenses dear lord hudson said i do believe a second line is coming hold hard boys hold hard he strode back along his line oh christ oh christ major medlicott was fumbling percussion caps onto his revolver oh christ he raised the gun only half primed and shot blindly into the smoke beyond that smoke the yankee fire had slackened as the first wave of attackers made way for the second the rebels fired on into the gloom seeing their targets only as dark shadows in the luminous smoke cloud then a screaming mass of men with fixed bayonets materialized in that fogbank back medlicott shouted and his men scrambled away from the shallow cutting stay and fight damn it starbuck bellowed but the panic was infectious and the company streamed past him for a second starbuck was alone in the wide ditch then he saw the open mouths of yankee attackers not ten paces away and he ran for his life he expected a bullet in the back at any second as he scrambled up the western bank and followed medlicotts company into the tangle of saplings and bushes the yankees scented victory they cheered as they jumped down into the cutting and as they scrambled up its further bank their flags streamed forward a gap had opened between the legion and hudsons north carolinians and the northern infantry poured into the gap where they discovered the unguarded spoil pit like a wave of water released by a broken dam they swarmed into the hollow only to surge up against the abatis they recoiled for a second as the tangle of branches checked their headlong charge then they flowed around the barriers flanks to swarm up to the spoil pits edge fire colonel swynyard had brought haxalls arkansas battalion down the hill to meet the yankee charge where it tried to climb out of the spoil pit rifles slashed fire into the pit the rebels could not miss for the yankees were crammed tighter than rats in a terrier pit fire major haxall called and a second volley whipped down and the yankee mass seemed to quiver like a great wounded beast get your men formed and fight swynyard shouted angrily at starbuck goddamn it fight damn starbuck was lost confused the attackers in the pit were being slaughtered but more yankees had crossed the ditch and were charging through the scrub where handfuls of dogged rebels resisted them starbuck blundered through the trees seeking men any men finding nothing but chaos and then he saw peter waggoner the giant biblethumping sergeant from company d sweet jesus starbuck thought but if company d had been thrown out of the railbed then the legion must be unraveling all along its length waggoner sir wheres your company here sir here and there crouching frightened behind the big sergeant was most of company d captain pine was pushing men into line screaming at them to stand and fight fix bayonets starbuck called and follow me and scream for gods sake scream the ululating bloodchilling sound of the rebel yell whipsawed in the air as the company followed starbuck back toward the railbed goddamn it but he would not be beaten a yankee appeared in front of starbuck and he fired his revolver straight into the mans face which seemed to vanish in a spray of red as the shock of the guns recoil jarred up to starbucks shoulder he half slipped in a slick of blood then fired into a mass of blue uniforms in front charge he screamed charge and waggoners men came with him screaming like devils released to mischief and the disordered yankees went backward the desperate charge through the brush had collected more groups of scattered legionnaires so that starbuck was now leading almost a third of his regiment in a bloodcrazed desperate vicious counterattack the northerners had been on the brink of victory but were suddenly confused by this unexpected opposition the yankees retreated starbuck leaped back into the railbed a northerner slipped on the far bank turned and swung his rifle starbuck fired at the man heard him scream then jumped over the falling body to sprawl and trip at the top of the embankment a rifle shot cracked over his head then a wave of his own men went past him and a giant hand plucked him onto his feet come on sir it was sergeant peter waggoner a cannon fired somewhere adding its new noise to the din of battle behind starbuck at the rim of the spoil pit the rifle volleys still flailed down to turn the hollow into a charnel house the yankees were retreating stunned by the violence of the rebel backlash starbuck ran past the heap of bodies killed in the rifle duel that had preceded the second yankee surge forward he knew he had lost command of his men and that now they were fighting from instinct and without proper guidance and so he sprinted forward to try and get ahead of them and somehow bring them under control the yankees had brought a small cannon forward to the edge of the trees the gun was scarcely four feet high and had a short widemuzzled barrel they had managed to fire one shot with the gun and now its fourman crew was desperately trying to haul the weapon back through the trees to save it from being captured by the screaming battlemaddened gray wave in their haste the gunners rammed one of the gunwheels into a tree and thus stalled their retreat the gun starbuck shouted the gun if he could concentrate his men at the gun then he had a chance of regaining control of the legion go for the gun he shouted and ran toward the cannon himself something hit him hard on the left thigh spinning him and almost knocking him down he limped for a pace waiting for the delayed agony to sear through his body he took a breath ready to scream and almost sobbed instead as he felt wetness spill down his leg then realized the enemy bullet had merely smashed his canteen it was not blood but water his hip was bruised but he was unwounded and his selfpitying scream turned into a defiant yelp of relief all around him the rebel yell filled the air one of the yankee gunners knowing that the trapped weapon was lost leaned across a wheel to tug the lanyard of the cannons primer and starbuck realizing with horror that the cannon was still loaded and that a storm of canister was about to be unleashed on his men fired the last shots of his revolver he saw a slash of bright metal show on the cannons barrel as a round ricocheted off the bronze then his last bullet whipped the enemy gunner backward onto the ground legion starbuck screamed to me he was among the trees now just yards from the gun the yankees had fled into the broken smoking wood where the trunks were bitten by rifle fire legion legion legion starbuck shouted he reached the cannon and put a proprietorial hand on its bulletflecked barrel legion form line form line fire legion legion he was screaming like a mad thing as though he could impose his will on the excited men by sheer force of mind and voice form he shouted the word desperately and men at last heard him and at last obeyed him companies were mixed together officers were missing sergeants and corporals were dead but the maddened charge somehow shook itself into a crude firing line that slammed a volley into the wood the volley was matched by one from the enemy the yankees retreating into the trees had turned and formed their own battle line one of starbucks men screamed as he was hit in the leg another staggered back into the smoky sunlight with blood seeping between fingers that were clutched to his belly a bullet smacked hollowly into one of the captured cannons ammunition chests somewhere a man gasped the name jesus over and over god almighty starbuck thought but somehow they had survived he felt sick to his stomach he felt ashamed and his hands were shaking as he reloaded his revolver he had failed he had felt the legion disintegrate around him like a crumbling dam and there had been nothing he could do there were tears on his face tears of shame at having failed he pressed the percussion caps onto the revolvers cones and fired it into the shadowed smoke beneath the trees sir captain pine of d company his lips blackened by powder and his eyes red from the smoke appeared beside him do we take the gun sir he gestured at the captured cannon yes starbuck said then forced himself to calm down to think keep firing he shouted at the legions ragged line then he looked more carefully at the gun a dead horse lay nearby just one horse and there was no limber but only wooden chests of ammunition and starbuck remembered swynyard telling him about the mountain howitzers of the old us army and he realized that this twelvepounder cannon was one of those old roughcountry guns that were transported on the backs of single packhorses this captured howitzer was not a heavy gun but even so it would need a halfdozen men to drag it through the trees and back to the railbed and starbuck knew that the absence of even a halfdozen men would weaken his line enough to let the yankees surge back maybe he thought he should just spike the gun and abandon it then he saw a mass of blue uniforms behind his fragile line and panic soared in him he was about to scream at his men to turn and drive this new enemy away then realized that the blue coats belonged to prisoners they were yankees who had survived the horror in the spoil pit and who had now climbed out into the open ground get some of those yankees starbuck said to pine and have them drag the gun back and be careful its loaded use prisoners sir pine asked apparently shocked at the idea do it starbuck turned back to the east to see that his men were doggedly firing and loading firing and loading most were sheltering behind trees just as the yankees were which meant that the firefight was settling into a stalemate but soon the legion must withdraw to its railbed trench and starbuck was determined that the retreat should be made in good order he would not lose control as he had before lieutenant pine was arguing with a captured yankee officer starbuck stooped to the guns trail and picked up a length of oneinch rope with iron prolonge hooks spliced into its ends he threw the rope to pine shoot the bastard if he wont do as hes told he shouted pine finally organized a morose work party of a dozen prisoners who were given the rope to hold pine himself attached one of the hooks to the lunette the ring at the tip of the guns trail then shouted at his unwilling team to haul away the trail swung around and the gun eased itself away from the tree so that its short blackmouthed muzzle was turned to face back toward its erstwhile owners stop starbuck shouted the astonished prisoners dropped the rope clear me clear me starbuck bellowed at those of his men who were firing at the enemy from in front of the cannon clear me two men looked around saw the gun facing them and ran hastily to one side starbuck when he was sure the field of fire was clear of his own men leaned across the wheel and grasped the primers lanyard he waited a handful of seconds until he could see some northerners stepping from behind trees to aim their rifles then pulled the lanyard the gun cracked like the shattering hammer blow of doom smoke jetted thirty yards forward while the gun itself recoiled clear out of the trees and almost ran down its bluecoated haulers the tin canister had split apart at the muzzle to scatter its balls like giant buckshot starbucks ears were ringing from the explosion take it away hurry starbuck shouted at the scared yankee prisoners whip them if they wont work starbuck shouted at pine we slavers know how to whip the startled yankee prisoners began to haul as though their lives depended on it and the smoking gun trundled away across the rough ground so fast that it bounced two feet in the air when its wheels struck a sprawling corpse in the trees the cannon smoke cleared to reveal a patch of woodland ripped and scarred by canister keep firing starbuck shouted at his men then as pines team dragged the gun back across the shallowest part of the cutting and so up to the sparse woodland beyond starbuck ran to his right to determine where his mens line ended he found lieutenant patterson wheres medlicott starbuck shouted over the rifle fire havent seen him sir have your men load then go back to the railbed and be ready to fire when the rest of us come back starbuck had to shout over the splintering rifle fire patterson nodded he was wildeyed and frenetic firing a revolver again and again at the yankees even when the revolvers hammer began clicking on exploded percussion caps patterson kept cocking and firing cocking and firing starbuck slapped the unprimed gun down and made the lieutenant repeat the orders he had been given do it now starbuck ordered then ran northward to find lieutenant howes sergeant tyndale and captain leighton he told them to pull their men back to the railbed one last volley to keep the yankees busy he ordered then run like hell understand starbuck was beginning to understand the legions ragged dispositions now medlicott and moxey were missing the four center companies were either in the trees or gone back with lieutenant patterson while presumably truslow and davies had never moved from the railbed fire captain leighton shouted and the rifle flames speared bright in the trees back starbuck shouted back they ran back leaping the tideline of bluecoated bodies and then jumping over their own dead into the railbed the northerners were slow to realize that the rebels were gone and it was a long moment before their first skirmishers appeared at the tree line had enough johnny one northerner shouted go back billy before we send you home in a box a rebel called back oh my god another man said panting from the exertions of the last few minutes just lay me down starbuck ran down the railbed until he came to captain daviess company which as he had suspected had never moved from its position truslow had seen to that barricading the railbed with a fallen tree so that the threatening disaster to the south had been given no chance of spreading as far as his company there were dead yankees all along the front of truslow and daviess men but none of the enemy had come closer than fifteen yards from the parapet so what were you doing up there truslow asked calmly not very well starbuck confessed the legions still in place truslow said in a voice so grim that it was a moment or two before starbuck realized the words were probably meant as a compliment god knows if we can take another attack he said aint none of gods business truslow said but if the bastards do come again then well just have to drive them off again well done this rare enthusiastic praise was not directed at starbuck but at sergeant bailey who had brought replacement ammunition to the railbed two other men were tending a fire so that truslows company would have boiling water to scour the powder deposits from their rifles starbuck walked back along his defense line the yankees had settled at the tree line from where they were directing a constant and harassing rifle fire at the railbed starbucks men kept their heads down sometimes raising themselves to fire a shot or sometimes just lifting a rifle over the makeshift parapet and squeezing the trigger blindly dont waste ammunition starbuck snarled at one man who had thus fired without sighting first if youre going to shoot aim and if youre not keep low there were bodies in the railbed some were the legions own dead lying on their backs mouths open and hands curled starbuck recognized a few men with sadness some without any regret and a handful with satisfaction one or two of the rebel dead were strangers he should have known them but he had not had time to learn the names and faces of every new conscript the yankee dead had mostly been hoisted onto the parapet to help protect the rebel living while the legions whitefaced wounded lay breathing shallowly against the rear slope of the cutting starbuck resisted the urge to crouch as the cutting became shallower an officer was supposed to show his men an example of fearlessness and starbuck kept his pace steady even as his mind screamed and his pulse raced with fear bullets slapped the air around him for the few seconds that he was exposed to the yankees then he was able to jump down into the spoil pit which was grotesque with enemy dead the smell of blood was thick and the first flies already swarming on the bloodied wounds it was the spoil pit starbuck reckoned that had saved the legion the hollow had drawn the attackers away from the rest of the line because of its promise of a safe covered route into the rebel rear but once in the pit the northerners had been trapped first by the abatis and then by the fire of haxalls battalion which swynyard had brought down from the hill were thin on the ground sir lieutenant patterson greeted starbuck thin patterson shrugged half a and b companies are missing medlicott moxey starbuck need not have asked both men were absent and no one knew where they might be coffman was safe crouching under the railbeds shallow parapet with a rifle he had taken from a dead man and captain pines mountain howitzer was also safe it had been parked at the back crest of the spoil pit where it was attracting yankee bullets patterson saw starbuck glance at the gun we forgot to bring the ammunition sir starbuck swore nothing was going right this day nothing except as truslow had said the legion was still in place which meant the battle was not lost and happily except for the one hapless mountain howitzer the yankees had not deployed any artillery against the legion the woods were too thick to let the gunners of either side deploy their weapons though just as that thought occurred to starbuck some shells began to explode they were rebel shells and they burst in the woods over the yankees who astonished by the shrapnel crept back from the tree line the gunfire seemed to be coming from far to the south but it stopped abruptly as a surge of cheering and rifle fire sounded further down jacksons line starbuck listening to the sound of battle guessed he was hearing a yankee attack like the one the legion had just though barely survived the gunners had shortened their range to enfilade the attackers and the yankees close to the legion crept back to the tree line to begin their harassing fire again haxalls men had returned to the hill from where they were now sharpshooting across the railbed while hudsons north carolinians were also back in place the tall colonel hudson saw starbuck and strode toward him a hot place starbuck he meant the railbed hard by the spoil pit im sorry my fellows ran my dear man mine went as well scattered like barnyard fowls hudson decently refrained from pointing out that his men had no choice but to run once medlicott had exposed their flank have you the time the colonel now asked a yankee shot my watch see he showed starbuck the torn pocket where the watch had been stored bullet went straight through without touching me but it rather mangled the watch pity it belonged to my grandfather it kept terrible time but i was fond of it and hoped to pass it on to my son youve got a son starbuck asked somehow surprised by the information three altogether and a brace of daughters toms my oldest boy hes twentyfour now and serves as one of lees aides lee starbuck was impressed the lee bobby himself nice fellow still pity about the watch the colonel picked a piece of shattered watch glass from the remnants of his pocket coffman starbuck shouted what time is it coffman had inherited an ancient timepiece from his father and now he fished its bulbous case from an inner pocket and clicked open the lid it says thirty minutes after four sir it must have stopped this morning starbuck said it cant be that late but look at the sun hudson said intimating that it truly was that late in the afternoon then wheres lee starbuck asked i thought he was coming to relieve us i find it best to plan military affairs on the twin principles that whatever i am told is certain will never occur and that whatever is proclaimed impossible is disastrously imminent there is no good news in war hudson pronounced grandly only less bad news dear oh dear the mild oath had been caused by a resurgence of enemy rifle fire from the tree line i do believe my dear starbuck that the republican party claims our attention again ah well to our toil to our toil and the storm broke again the reverend elial starbuck was trying to understand what was happening comprehension he thought was not much to ask war was as rational an activity as any other human endeavor and must he presumed yield to analysis yet whenever he inquired of a general officer what exactly was occurring in the western woods he received a different answer the north was attacking one general said yet the generals own men were sprawling in the meadows playing cards and smoking pipes all in good time all in good time the general said when the preacher asked him why his men were not supporting the attack one of the generals staff officers a superior young man who made clear his disapproval of a civilian intruding on a battlefield informed the reverend starbuck that jackson was retreating the yankees were pursuing and that the commotion in the woods was nothing but a noisy rear guard major galloway also tried to reassure the preacher galloway had been ordered to wait until the attacking infantry broke through jacksons line after which his men would join the northern cavalry in their pursuit of the shattered enemy the reverend starbuck waited on horseback for that promised breakthrough and tried to convince himself that the majors explanation made sense jacksons attempting to retreat southward sir galloway told the preacher and our fellows have him pinned against the woods over there but even galloway was unhappy with that analysis the major after all had failed to find any evidence that jackson had ever gone to centreville so it did not make sense that he would now be retreating from that town which raised the mystery of what exactly the southern general was doing and that mystery was made even more worrying by billy blythes repeated assertions that he had seen a second rebel army marching toward manassas from the west galloway was unwilling to share his anxiety with the reverend doctor starbuck but the major had the distinct impression that perhaps general pope had utterly misunderstood what was truly happening galloways unhappiness was compounded by the acrid mood that prevailed within his small regiment blythes return had stirred adam faulconers anger an anger that had come to a head the night before when the virginian had accused blythe of murdering civilians at mccombs tavern blythe had denied the accusation we was fired on by soldiers blythe maintained and the soldiers begged you to stop firing because there were women there adam insisted if a man had done that blythe said i would have ceased fire instantly instantly upon my word faulconer but what kind of a man do you take me for a liar adam had said and before galloway could intervene the challenge had been made but the duel had not yet been fought and perhaps galloway dared hope the duel would never be fought to which end he now enlisted the reverend starbucks aid the preacher happy to have a purpose while the infantry battle still raged spoke first to captain blythe and afterward brought a report of the conversation back to galloway blythe admits there might have been women in the tavern the reverend starbuck said and the thought distresses him greatly but he plainly wasnt aware of them at the time and he promises me that he heard no calls for any ceasefire the preacher paused for a moment to watch the smoke trails of artillery shells arching across the distant woods then frowned at the major what kind of women would be in a tavern anyway galloway hoped the question was rhetorical but the preachers expression suggested he wanted an answer the major cast around for a suitable evasion and found none whores sir he finally said coloring with embarrassment for having used such a word to a man of god precisely the preacher said women of no virtue so why is faulconer making this commotion adam has a tender conscience sir he is also in your regiment major by courtesy of my money the preacher said sharply conveniently overlooking that the money for galloways horse had actually been subscribed by hundreds of humble wellmeaning folk throughout new england and i will not have the lords work hampered by a misplaced sympathy for fallen women captain faulconer must learn that he cannot afford a tender conscience not on my money youll talk to him sir galloway asked directly the preacher said and immediately beckoned adam to one side the two men rode far enough for their conversation to be private then the preacher demanded to know exactly what evidence adam had for his accusation of murder the evidence of a newspaper sir adam said and my own apprehension of captain blythes character it was a southern newspaper the reverend starbuck easily demolished the first part of adams evidence so it was sir and your other evidence is merely founded upon your dislike of captain blythes character you think we can afford the luxuries of such selfindulgent judgments in wartime i have grounds for that dislike sir grounds grounds the reverend starbuck spat the two words out we are at war young man we cannot indulge in petty squabbles adam stiffened it was captain blythe who issued the duel challenge sir not me you called him a liar the reverend starbuck said yes sir i did the reverend starbuck shook his head sadly i have talked with blythe he assures me on his word as a gentleman that he had no idea any women were present in the tavern and he still maintains there were none present but he accepts he might be mistaken and all he asks of you is your acceptance that he would never have continued the battle had he known that his actions were risking the lives of women i believe him the reverend starbuck paused offering adam a chance to utter agreement but adam remained obstinately silent for the love of god man the preacher protested do you really believe that a man of honor an officer of the united states army a christian would persecute women no sir i dont believe that adam said pointedly it took a few seconds for the reverend starbuck to appreciate the debating point adam had made and the appreciation did not improve the preachers temper ill thank you not to be clever with me young man i have investigated this matter i know the wickedness of mankind better than you faulconer i have wrestled with iniquity all my life and my judgments are not based on southern newspapers but on hard experience tempered i trust with prayerful charity and i am telling you now that captain blythe is no murderer and that his actions that night were chivalrous it is unspeakable that a man could behave in the way you describe unthinkable manifestly impossible adam shook his head i could tell you of another occasion sir he said and was about to tell the tale of the woman he had discovered in the barn with blythe but the preacher gave him no chance to tell the story i will not listen to rumor the reverend starbuck insisted my god i will not listen to rumor we are engaged upon a crusade faulconer a great crusade to forge gods chosen nation we are purging that nation of sin burning the iniquity from its heart with a fierce and righteous fire and there is no room no merit no satisfaction no justification for any man to put his personal whims ahead of that great cause as our lord and savior himself said he that is not with me is against me and upon my soul faulconer if you oppose major galloway in this matter then you will find that christ and i are both become your enemies adam began to feel a sympathy for his onetime friend nathaniel starbuck i would have no one doubt my loyalty to the cause of the united states sir he said in feeble protest to the preacher then shake blythes hand and admit you were wrong the reverend starbuck said me that i was wrong adam could not help asking the astonished question aloud he admits you might be right and that perhaps there were women there so can you not do the same and admit that he would have behaved differently had he known adams head was awhirl somehow he was not sure how he had been maneuvered into the wrong he was also painfully aware that he was in the preachers debt and so though it cut hard against a stubborn grain he nodded his head if you insist sir he said unhappily its your conscience that should insist but i am glad all the same come and the reverend starbuck thumped his horses flanks to lead adam across to where the grinning billy blythe waited mr faulconer has something to say to you captain the reverend starbuck announced adam made his admission that he might have misjudged captain blythe then apologized for that misjudgment he hated himself for making the apology but he nevertheless tried to make it sound heartfelt he even held out his hand afterward blythe shook the offered hand i guess we southern gentlemen are just too hotheaded aint that right faulconer so well say no more about it adam felt demeaned and belittled he put a brave face on the defeat but it was still a defeat and it hurt major galloway though was touchingly pleased by the apparent reconciliation we should be friends galloway said we have enemies enough without making them from our own side amen to that blythe said amen to that amen indeed the reverend starbuck echoed and hallelujah adam said nothing but just stared at the woods where the smoke rose from the guns while to the south unseen by any northern troops regiment after regiment of rebel infantry was marching on a country road that led to the open flank of john popes army lees reinforcements were arriving just as the yankees last great charge of the day was hurled against the railbed in the woods above the blue ridge mountains the sun sank slowly into a summers evening the reverend starbuck saw the imminence of nightfall and clenched his fists as he prayed that god would grant john pope the same miracle that he had granted unto joshua when he had made the sun stand still above gibeon so that the armies of israel would have the time to strike down the amorites the preacher prayed bugles sounded in the woods a loud cheer echoed among the trees and the last great onslaught of the day charged on the last northern attack of the day was by far the strongest and most dangerous for instead of being launched in line it came in an oldfashioned column that struck like a hammer blow at the shallowest section of the railbed it also struck at the vulnerable junction between starbucks men and elijah hudsons north carolinians and starbuck watching from the lip of the spoil pit at the back of the railbed instinctively understood that his men would never stand against this tidal wave that streamed from the woods the attacking battalions were so close together that their flags made a bright phalanx above the dark ranks the flags showed the crests and badges of new york and indiana of pennsylvania maine and of michigan and beneath the flags the shouts of the attackers drowned the snapping sound of the legions rifles ten paces back starbuck shouted he would not wait to be overrun he heard hudson shouting a similar command then all sound from the rebel side was momentarily obliterated by the vast northern cheer that greeted the retreat of the defenders back starbuck shouted again when the northern cheer faded back keep in line keep in line he strode along the legions ranks watching his men rather than looking at the surging enemy backwards steady now steady he was suddenly so proud of the legion they were watching bluecoated death come at them in a massive rush yet they retreated in good steady order as he took them back another ten paces into the thin woodland behind the railbed he halted them among the saplings reload he shouted reload men bit cartridges poured powder and spat bullets they rammed the charges hard down then upended the rifles and pressed percussion caps onto fireblackened cones aim starbuck shouted but wait wait for my order all along the legions line the heavy rifle hammers clicked into place wait for my order and aim low starbuck called he turned to watch the charge just as the northerners reached the railbeds cutting the triumphant yankee troops poured down the trenchs sloping outer wall and then still cheering swarmed up its rearward slope straight into the sights of the waiting legion fire starbuck shouted the volley exploded along the line hurling northerners back into the trench at twenty paces such a volley was mere slaughter work but it did no more than check the onrushing attack for the few seconds necessary for the unwounded attackers to push aside their encumbering dead and dying then urged on by officers and inflamed with the prospect of victory the yankees came forward for their revenge but starbuck had already taken his men back to the hill where haxalls arkansas battalion waited in support the legions retreat had again opened a gap in front of the spoil pit and again that gap enticed the yankee attackers it was the place of least resistance and so the attacking column poured into the inviting open space a few of the northerners found themselves among the stinking bodies in the spoil pit but most ran around the pits rim and then charged on toward the open country beyond they left behind a litter of wounded men a trail of crushed saplings and starbucks forlorn captured howitzer which had been thrown off its carriage haxalls men helped seal the gap by firing one blistering volley and by the time the smoke of that volley had cleared the legions rifles were loaded again fire starbuck shouted and heard the command echoed toward the regiments left flank the northern attack was slowing not because it was being outfought but simply because too many yankees were trying to push through the narrow gaps either side of the spoil pit and were meeting a stiffening resistance as starbucks right flank and hudsons left closed on each other haxalls men extended starbucks line and when at last the gap was closed turned back to hunt down the yankees who had broken through the junction of starbucks virginians and hudsons north carolinians was now some fifty paces behind the spoil pit and it was there that the line steadied and began a murderous fight with the yankees who had not succeeded in breaking through jacksons line the fight started with the two sides just thirty paces apart close enough for men to see their enemies faces close enough to hear an enemys voice close enough for a bullet to mangle a mans flesh with undiminished horror this was an infantry fight rifle against rifle the ordeal for which both sides had trained incessantly starbuck had to forget those yankees who had broken through and were now loose at his rear his sole duty was to stand and fight and trust someone else to worry about the yankees who had breached the line just as someone else must worry about the possibility of more yankees crossing the railbed to join this duel of rifles if those enemy reinforcements arrived starbuck knew then the legion must be overwhelmed but for the moment the northerners were being held they were being held by men who knew their survival depended on being able to load their rifles faster than the enemy there was no need for any officers or sergeants to give commands the men knew what to do they did it lieutenant patterson was dead killed by his red sash that had attracted too many yankee bullets it was a miracle to starbuck that any man survived the maelstrom of closerange rifle fire but the sulfurous powder smoke served as a screen and the yankee fire slackened as the northerners edged back toward the railbed no regiment however brave could long survive a rifle duel at close range and the instinct for both sides was to retreat but starbucks men were standing hard against the hills base and the slope inhibited their natural instinct to shuffle a few inches backward every time they reloaded their rifles but the open land behind the yankee line tempted the northerners to yield their ground inch by bloody inch then yard by smoldering yard starbuck lost count of the bullets he fired his rifle was now so fouled with powder that it was painful to ram each new bullet down the barrel he fired and fired again his shoulder bruising from the recoil his eyes smarting from the smoke and his voice hoarse from the days shouting he heard the distinctive meatax sound as bullets struck men around him and was dimly conscious of bodies falling backward from the line he was also conscious that rank gave him the freedom to leave the battle line except that the responsibility of command perversely decreed that he could not take that voluntary backward step and so he fought sometimes he shouted at the line to close up but mostly he just rammed and fired rammed and fired consumed by the conviction shared by every man in the line that his were the bullets that were pushing the enemy back he flinched each time the heavy gun slammed back into his shoulder and he choked each time he bit open a cartridge and so tasted the acrid saltrich mouthdrying gunpowder sweat stung his eyes somewhere in the back of his mind was the terror of being injured but he was too busy loading and firing to let that terror overwhelm him an occasional bullet slicing close by left him momentarily shaking but then he would ram another round into the recalcitrant rifle and crash another shoulderbruising shot toward the yankees and fish for another cartridge in his haversack as he let the rifles heavy stock fall to the ground once pouring powder into the barrel the new charge caught fire and exploded a bright gash of flame into his face he recoiled from the pain his eyeballs seared raw then angrily rammed the embers dead in the barrel with his ramrod minutes later another sharp pain shot hard through his right arm and he almost dropped the rifle from the sudden agony then he saw he had been struck not by a bullet but only by a sharptipped splinter of bone that had been ripped from his neighbors ribcage by a yankee bullet the man was on the ground twitching as the blood flooded from his shattered chest he looked up at starbuck tried so hard to speak then choked on blood and died starbuck stooped to feel in the mans haversack for more cartridges and found just two he was down to the bottom layer of his own rounds now close up he shouted close up and a momentary lull in the fighting gave him an opportunity to back out of the line where men were asking friends and neighbors for any extra ammunition starbuck handed out what few rounds he had left and then climbed the steep hill in search of the legions spare ammunition supply a score of wounded men had taken refuge on the hill one of haxalls arkansas men his left arm hanging bloody tried to load his rifle onehanded goddamned sons of bitches the man muttered over and over goddamned sons of yankee bitches a shell burst overhead to slap hot scraps of smoking metal into the hill yankees have brought up two more howitzers colonel swynyard was seated halfway up the hill field glasses in hand he sounded very calm we need ammunition starbuck said trying to sound as collected as the colonel but unable to keep a note of panic out of his voice none left the colonel shrugged helplessly i have to apologize to you starbuck me i swore at you earlier i apologize you did christ starbuck spat out the blasphemy as another shell screamed low overhead to ricochet up from the slope and explode somewhere beyond the summit had swynyard sworn at him starbuck did not remember nor did he much care he was suddenly worrying far more about what had happened to the mass of yankees who had streamed through the gap into the armys rear and there disappeared suppose those men were about to counterattack we must have ammunition he shouted to swynyard used it all long days fighting the colonel seemed remarkably calm as he aimed his revolver at the northern battle line and methodically pulled the trigger theyre slackening when theyre gone well pillage the dead for ammunition starbuck ran downhill and pulled two of captain daviess men out of the ranks youre to search the dead and wounded he told them and find ammunition hand it out hurry he sent one man to the left the other to the right then took their place in the ranks and drew his revolver starbuck found himself standing alongside the bespectacled captain ethan davies who was fighting with a rifle theyre from indiana davies said as though starbuck would be interested in the news what who starbuck had not been listening instead he had been searching the smokesmeared enemy line for any sign of a man giving commands these fellows davies indicated the nearest yankees with a jerk of his chin theyre from indiana how do you know i asked them of course shouted at them he fired flinching from the painful impact of the rifles heavy recoil against his bruised shoulder i almost married a girl from indiana once davies added as he dropped the rifles butt onto the ground and pulled out a paperwrapped cartridge what stopped you starbuck was priming his revolver with percussion caps she was catholic and my parents disapproved davies spoke mildly he bit off a bullet poured the gritty powder down the hot barrel then spat the bullet into the muzzle with powderblackened lips his spectacles were smeared into opaqueness with dust and sweat i often think of her he said wistfully then rammed the bullet down hard swung the rifle up capped it and pulled the trigger she came from terre haute dont you think thats a wonderful name for a town starbuck cocked his revolver how did a virginian happen to meet a catholic girl from terre haute he had to shout the question over the splintering noise of gunfire shes some kind of distant cousin i met her when she came to faulconer court house for a family funeral davies cursed not because of the memory of his lost love but because the cone of his rifle had become brittle from the heat and shattered he threw the gun down and took another from a dead man somewhere in the battle smoke a young man screamed horribly the scream went on and on punctuated by short gasps of breath davies shuddered at the awful sound oh my god he said callously when the screaming ended suddenly just lay me down i wish people would stop saying that starbuck said its getting on my nerves youd prefer biblical quotes davies asked lambs to the slaughter he offered misquoting isaiah the sword of the lord is filled with blood starbuck offered another quotation from the same prophet as he fired two rounds of the revolver it is made fat with fatness and with the blood of lambs davies shuddered at the sentiment i keep forgetting you were a theology student theres nothing like a course of old testament studies to make a soldier ready for battle starbuck said with relish he lowered his revolver and listened to the sound of the fighting the yankee fire was definitely slackening they wont last long now he said his mouth was so dry that talking was difficult he had replaced his shattered canteen with another but had long drained its tepid contents now he stooped and unlooped a dead mans canteen her name was louisa davies said who starbuck said he tipped the canteen to his mouth and was rewarded by a trickle of lukewarm water who he asked again my distant catholic relative from indiana davies said as he primed his new rifle and two years ago she married a corn chandler with any luck youre about to kill the bastard starbuck said and thatll make the lovely louisa into a respectable young widow and you can marry her when the wars over he emptied the rest of his revolvers chambers into the smoke keep firing he shouted at the company then slapped davies on the shoulder as he left the company to walk back along the legions rear bastards are giving way boys keep firing keep firing he reloaded his revolver as he walked doing the job without needing to look down at the weapon starbuck remembered his first day of battle not a mile or two from this very spot when he had been unable to load his revolver because his hands had been trembling and his vision blurred while now he did it without thinking or looking the legion kept firing but were taking very little return fire except for an occasional shell lobbed by the small howitzers at the edge of the trees and those shells were mostly fused too long and so exploded harmlessly among the shattered saplings behind the battle line the yankee line splintered into groups by the steady rebel firing was stumbling back across their own dead toward the railbed there was a danger they might go to ground there and starbuck reckoned his dazed and bloodied men would have to charge with fixed bayonets to keep the northern retreat moving but just a second before he shouted the order so a great backwash of attackers surged from the west the northerners who had passed clean through the rebel line into the open land beyond were now streaming back they had been harried by haxalls arkansas battalion then intercepted by a brigade sent by lee to reinforce jacksons hardpressed men and now the northerners were in full retreat let em through hudson shouted at starbuck the choice was either to open ranks and let the northerners go back beyond the railbed or else to turn and fight but hudsons implied choice was to give the enemy a free pass home there were simply too many yankees for the battleweary rebel line to take on especially as there were still plenty of northerners firing from the railbed a decision to fight would have meant firing both east and west so starbuck gratefully shouted his assent to hudson and then pulled the legions right wing clear of the retreating yankees the fleeing enemy surged past the spoil pit starbuck watched the disorganized enemy run past then another flicker of movement closer to the hill made him look right to see a small group of grayclad men running parallel with the enemy but keeping well away from danger major medlicott and captain moxey were in the lead of a score of men who now tried to rejoin the legions ranks without their arrival being noted starbuck ran toward the fugitives where were you he asked medlicott what do you mean medlicott demanded he turned away from starbuck and aimed his rifle at the yankees running past fifty paces away starbuck slapped the rifle down where were you the yankees pushed us back medlicott said his tone daring starbuck to contradict him we tried to rejoin starbuck knew the man was lying he could see from the state of medlicotts soldiers that none of them had been fighting their eyes were not reddened by smoke their lips were not blackened by powder and their faces did not have the feral halfscared halfsavage look of men pushed to the edge of endurance all still wore the red crescent badge denoting their loyalty to washington faulconer and all of them starbuck was sure had skulked for the best part of the day yet he could prove nothing and so he settled for a feeble acceptance of medlicotts lie keep fighting he said he knew he had handled the confrontation badly a suspicion confirmed when moxey laughed aloud the laughter was drowned by a sudden earhurting roar as a flight of shells crashed into the killing patch beyond the railbed the rebel artillery which had been preoccupied these last long minutes with yankee attackers further south had switched their fire back to the ground opposite swynyards brigade and the effect of the shrieking bursting smokeriven shells was to drive the enemys howitzers away from the tree line and the retreating yankees into the shelter of the railbed cutting youve got to get them out of there starbuck swynyard immediately shouted from the hillside the yankees had suddenly learned the value of the railbed and were using its protection to start a galling rifle fire on the legion the men returned the fire but the rebels were getting by far the worst of it starbuck still standing beside the recalcitrant righthand companies cupped his hands fix bayonets he watched as his men crouched behind the thin cover of the fireblasted saplings and slotted long blades onto the black hot muzzles of their rifles he turned and saw moxeys resentful men doing the same moxey was wearing one of the frilled shirts he had looted at manassas junction and somehow the finery made starbuck hate the man even more he pushed that hatred out of his mind as he capped the five chambers of his new adams revolver ready he called to medlicotts men one or two nodded but most ignored him he looked to his left and saw the strained anxious faces of the other companies charge he shouted charge the legion rose from its crouch like men snapping from nightmare the yankees in the railbed responded with a volley that billowed smoke along the lip of their makeshift parapet a shell cracked overhead to make an instant black cloud men were falling bleeding calling in pain but most of the legion were still running through the blackened scrub and reeking smoke they screamed their war scream the smoke of the yankee volley cleared and the northerners armed now with unloaded rifles saw a glitter of bayonets fast approaching and so they scrambled hurriedly out the railbeds far side just as a salvo of rebelfired shells crashed into the dirt and exploded shrapnel into their faces most of the northerners instinctively shied away from that highexplosive death just as the rebel line leaped into the trench kill them truslow shouted and rammed forward with a bayonet that he abandoned in his first victim so that he could unsheath his bowie knife most of the yankees decided that fleeing through the shells offered a better chance of survival than being disemboweled in a bloodsodden trench and so a horde of northerners scrambled out of the railbed and ran across the open ground others stayed and surrendered a handful tried to fight the rebel counterattack and were killed starbuck saw peter waggoner leading a squad of men against a stubborn group of northerners there was a volley a scream then waggoner swung his rifle by the muzzle to smash its stock against a mans head and the other northerners began to shout their surrender out in the open ground another salvo of shells ripped smoke flame and metal shards through the fugitives starbuck a smoking revolver in his hand saw a mans head bowling along the ground like a spent cannonball he gaped at it not sure that his eyes were really seeing what his brain was registering no no no no please a northerner was staring up at starbuck with horror on his face the mans hands were raised he was shaking in terror thinking that he was about to be executed by the tall southern officer with the bitter eyes and smoking gun youre safe starbuck told the man then turned to see that neither medlicotts men nor moxeys company had charged with the legion instead they were in the spoil pit where they were attempting to look busy by rounding up prisoners there was unfinished business there and business that had to be settled soon or else there would be no legion left to command major medlicott he shouted across to the spoil pit yes medlicotts tone was cautious i want the legions ammunition pooled then redistributed and search the dead for cartridges he looked up at the sky it would be dark soon your men have first picket duty and keep a careful watch they always do medlicott said defiantly he had been half expecting a reprimand for disobeying the order to charge the railbed and his tone suggested the scorn in which he now held starbuck for not daring to impose discipline starbuck ignored him he had other things to do he had the dead to count the wounded to rescue and ammunition to find so he could be ready to fight again tomorrow a good days work gentlemen an excellent days work john pope was ebullient about his armys achievement as he strode into the farm that was his field headquarters a dozen men awaited his arrival and so infectious was the generals pleasure that they actually burst into applause as he came through the door most of those who had been waiting for pope were general officers but there was also a congressman from washington and the reverend elial starbuck from boston carrying inevitably the bundled rebel flag that was his precious trophy and souvenir the reverend starbuck had spent the day on the field and was as dusty dirty and tired as any of the soldiers though pope himself looked very fresh as he lifted the lid of one of the supper tureens on the long dining table he sniffed its contents appreciatively venison steak good good i hope theres some cranberry jelly to go with it alas sir one of the aides murmured never mind pope was in a forgiving mood the railroad bridge at bristoe had been repaired so that trains could now run the length of the orange and alexandria which meant that the last regiments being carried north from warrenton could be transported all the way into the smoking ruins of manassas junction from where it was a short step to tomorrows battlefield or rather to tomorrows victory for john pope was now convinced that he was on the brink of a historic triumph general mcdowell who had lost the first battle fought at manassas but who now led popes third corps was similarly confident of victory especially as more troops were arriving hourly those reinforcements were coming not just from popes own army of virginia but also from mcclellans army of the potomac though i doubt well see the young napoleon here tomorrow mcdowell said heavily i doubt it too pope said sitting at the table and helping himself to a piece of venison george wont want to witness another man winning a victory that would take far too much shine off his buttons eh he laughed inviting the table to laugh with him whereas i dont mind who gets the credit so long as the usa gets the victory aint that a fact pope threw this outrageous statement at one of his aides who blandly confirmed its truth you know what george wants me to do pope went on as he helped himself to buttered beans george wants me to pull the army back to centreville and wait there here we are with stonewall jackson skewered to the wall and im supposed to walk away to centreville and why so the young napoleon can take command he doesnt want you to win the victory he couldnt win mcdowell suggested loyally and ive no doubt that if i did pull back to centreville pope went on without actually disagreeing with mcdowells statement then the very first thing our young napoleon would do is hold a parade i hear george is uncommon fond of parades very fond the visiting congressman said and why not parades are very good for the publics confidence a victory might be better for their confidence mcdowell suggested the third corpss commander had piled his plate with venison steaks and sweet potatoes well damn georges parades pope said wondering like everyone else about the table whether mcdowell could possibly add another spoonful of supper to his heaped plate i shall not retreat to centreville i shall win a victory instead thatll astonish washington isnt that so congressman youre not used to generals who fight and win pope laughed and his laughter was echoed about the supper table though the general noticed that the famous boston preacher alone seemed unamused you look tired doctor starbuck the general observed genially a day in the saddle general the preacher said im most unaccustomed to such exertions no doubt id be weary if i spent a day in your pulpit pope responded gallantly but the preacher did not even smile at the response instead he put a notebook on the table pulled a candle close to its open pages and expressed a polite puzzlement at some of the events he had witnessed that day such as what john pope asked men attacking other men doing nothing to help them the preacher said succinctly it seemed to the reverend starbuck that the federal attacks had come so close to success yet the survivors complained that the reinforcements who might have guaranteed northern victory had never stirred from their bivouacs john pope felt an impulse of anger he had no need to explain himself to meddlesome priests yet pope knew that he possessed few allies in the armys highest reaches and fewer still in washington john pope was an abolitionist while most of his rivals like mcclellan were fighting not for the slaves but for the union and john pope knew that he needed public opinion to be on his side if he was to prevail against his many political enemies the reverend starbuck was a powerful persuader of the northern public and so the general subdued his irritation and patiently explained his days achievements he spoke between mouthfuls gesturing with a fork what the army of virginia had done he said was to pen stonewall jackson up against the western hills and woods pope glanced at the congressman to make sure that he was listening then went on to explain how jackson had wanted to escape down the warrenton turnpike but had instead been corralled the preacher nodded impatiently he understood all this but why do we need wait till tomorrow to kill the snake we had him trapped today surely pope mindful of what the pencil in the preachers hand could achieve smiled weve pinned jackson into some rough country doctor but we havent quite cut off all his escape routes what you were witnessing today was a gallant fight to keep jackson staring in this direction while our other fellows curled around his flanks the general demonstrated the strategy by surrounding a gravy boat with cruets and tomorrow doctor we can attack again with the absolute assurance that this time the wretches have no escape he dropped a salt cellar into the gravy splashing the tablecloth no escape at all amen mcdowell said through a mouthful of venison and butter beans you only saw a small part of a greater design pope explained to the preacher does not the good book have something to say about there being more things in heaven and earth than we can dream of shakespeare said it the preacher remarked stiffly still penciling his notes there are more things in heaven and earth horatio than are dreamt of in your philosophy hamlet act one scene five he closed the book and slipped it into his pocket so tomorrow general we might expect a victory to rank with cannae or with yorktown pope hesitated to claim ground quite that high especially in front of a congressman yet he had raised the expectation himself so long as mcclellans men fight as they should he answered neatly shifting the responsibility onto his rival no one responded indeed no one liked to stir that can of worms mcclellans men were famously loyal to their general and many of them resented being under the orders of john pope and there was a fear that resentment might be translated into a reluctance to fight i wonder what lees doing an artillery officer at the tables far end asked robert lee is doing what robert lee always does best pope declared which is sitting on his hands and letting someone else do the scrapping lees waiting south of the rappahannock digging in he sent jackson to disrupt our preparations but he reckoned without the swiftness of our response he underestimated us gentlemen and that will be his undoing is that a plate of pears might i trouble you for a serving thank you an orderly brought a jug of lemonade for the teetotalers and a decanter of wine for the others beyond the farm windows there was a pretty sprinkling of firelight where the nearest battalions were bivouacking on a hillside a band was playing in the distance the music sweet and plangent in the warm summer darkness did anyone discover what those rebel troops were doing beyond groveton one of mcdowells officers asked as he spooned thick cream onto his pears there had been a handful of reports about rebel troops arriving on the open western flank of popes army alarmist rumors pope said confidently all they saw were enemy cavalry scouts the last throes of a dying army gentlemen are always the sight of its cavalry scouts looking for a way out but not tomorrow not anymore from now on this army marches forward to richmond to richmond the assembled officers murmured and to victory to richmond the congressman said and reelection to richmond the reverend starbuck said and emancipation all in the morning during the night hudsons north carolinians made a new abatis in front of the railbed where neither the cutting nor its adjacent embankment offered a real obstacle to the yankee attackers i should have thought of it before hudson admitted so should i starbuck said he paused except i thought lee was coming i never reckoned wed have to fight alone all day i told you hudson said in a kindly voice always to expect the worst but where is lee starbuck insisted on the question despite the older mans advice the lord only knows hudson said softly and i guess well just have to go on fighting till the good lord lets us into the secret i guess so too starbuck said bleakly he was morose aware that his first day in command of a fighting regiment had not been a success the legion had twice been driven from its position and though it had twice regained the railbed it had suffered cruelly in the process worse two whole companies of the regiment were in virtual mutiny starbuck remembered moxeys laughter and he knew as certainly as he knew anything in all his life that the mocking laughter had been his opportunity to crush the defiant righthand companies once and for all starbuck knew he should have pulled out his revolver and put a bullet smack between moxeys eyes but instead he had pretended not to hear and so had given his enemies a victory the construction of the new abatis was harassed by yankee sharpshooters whose fire did not end at nightfall in the dark the sharpshooters fired wherever they saw movement beside a distant fire and that constant danger drove men to take cover in the railbed or else to seek the safety of the hills rearward slope where the brigades surgeons worked by candlelight the brigades own sharpshooters replied to the yankee fire the flames of their heavybarreled rifles spitting long and whipthin in the darkness the marksmen held their fire only when a shout requested that they respect the movements of a stretcher party but whenever the stretcher bearers had finished their task and had called their thanks for the enemys courtesy the firing would begin again the only good news of the night was the arrival of a mailbag that had been brought from gordonsville with lees advancing troops sergeant tyndale distributed the letters and parcels making a sad pile of mail addressed to dead men one of the parcels had come from the richmond arsenal and was addressed to the officer commanding the faulconer legion the big package proved to contain a standardissue battle flag a fourfootsquare banner woven from common cloth that was intended to replace the captured silk standard there was no flagstaff so starbuck sent lucifer to cut down a straight tenfoot sapling then in the light of a campfire at the rear of the hill he opened his two letters the first came from thaddeus bird who reported that he was recovering remarkably well and hoped to return to the legion very soon priscilla does not share this hope and constantly discovers new symptoms that might require a further period of convalescence yet i feel my absence from the legion keenly the letter went on to say that anthony murphy had safely reached faulconer court house and was also recuperating though he was not expected to be on his feet for a week or two yet is it true bird then asked that swynyard has seen the divine light if so then it proves christianity must be of some use in this world but i confess i find it hard to comprehend such a conversion does the dragon purr does he pray before he beats his slaves or after you must write to me with all the malicious details the letter finished with the news that washington faulconer had not been seen in faulconer court house but was rumored to be stirring up political trouble in richmond starbucks second letter had come from the confederate capital to his surprise and pleasure the letter was from julia gordon adams erstwhile fiancйe who now regarded starbuck as her friend she wrote with good news my mother has yielded to my wish and allowed me to become a nurse in chimborazo hospital she did not yield graciously but under the pressure of poverty and to the hospitals solemn undertaking to pay me a wage though i have yet to see that promise fulfilled i am being tutored they say and so must abjure all hopes of payment until i can distinguish a bandage from a bottle of calomel i learn i learn and at night i weep for the poor boys here but doubtless i shall learn not to do so she made no mention of adam nor was there anything personal in the letter it was simply the words of a friend seeking a sympathetic ear you would not recognize the hospital now julia concluded it daily spreads fresh buildings across the park and each new ward is filled with wounded before the builders sawhorses are even moved out i pray daily that you will be spared seeing it from one of the cots starbuck stared at the letter and tried to recall julias face but somehow the picture would not form in his head dark hair and good bones he remembered and a quick intelligence in the eyes but still he could not see her image in his minds eye youre looking homesick colonel swynyard interrupted starbucks thoughts letter from a friend starbuck explained a girl swynyard asked as he sat opposite starbuck yes starbuck said then after a pause a christian girl colonel a good virtuous and christian girl swynyard laughed how you do yearn for respectable citizenship in the kingdom of god starbuck maybe you should repent now maybe this is the hour for you to put your trust in him youre trying to convert me colonel starbuck made the accusation sourly what greater favor could i do you starbuck stared into the fire maybe he said slowly you could replace me as commander of the legion swynyard chuckled suppose starbuck that after one day of abandoning alcohol i had told you i was finding the whole thing too hard would you have approved starbuck managed a rueful grin back then colonel id have told you to wait a day then go back to the bottle that way i might have won the bet i had on you swynyard was not altogether pleased with the reply but he managed a smile so ill give you the same advice wait a day see how you feel tomorrow starbuck shrugged i didnt do well today i panicked i was shouting and running around like a scalded cat swynyard smiled none of us did well today im not real sure jackson did well today and the good lord alone knows what happened to lee but the enemy didnt do well either were still here starbuck and they aint beat us yet see how you feel tomorrow the colonel stood up sparks whirled past his lean face maybe you should turn your companies around tomorrow he suggested put truslow on the right and medlicott on the left i did think about doing just that starbuck admitted and starbuck plucked a burning brand from the fire and used it to light a cigar i think ive got a better idea colonel he tossed the brand back onto the flames and looked up at swynyard you remember what you said about old mad jack that it didnt matter how eccentric a man was so long as he won i remember so starbuck grinned so you wont approve of what im going to do which means i wont tell you what it is but itll work swynyard thought about that answer so you didnt really want to be replaced ill let you know tomorrow colonel starbuck spent the night in the railbed where he slept for a few precious moments but it seemed he was woken every time a sharpshooter let a bullet fly across the ground separating the armies in the morning before the mist lifted to make him into an easy target he climbed the hill to watch the land emerge from the vapor in the distance beyond the trees a swarm of smoke tendrils marked the enemys cooking fires while off to the left and much closer than he had expected a bright gleam between two stands of trees briefly showed beneath the shifting skeins of mist he borrowed a rifle from one of haxalls sharpshooters and used its telescopic sight to inspect the gleam i guess thats the bull run he said to the sharpshooter the man shrugged cant think theres another river that big round here sure aint the big muddy though nearer at hand starbuck could see a stretch of road running between two pastures he suspected it was the sudley road which meant the legion was less than half a mile from the twin fords across the catharpin and bull runs he had crossed those fords a year before on the day that washington faulconer had tried to eject him from the legion and if that far gleam was indeed the run and the road really was the highway leading from manassas to sudley then it meant that the legion was close tantalizingly close to the galloway farm with nothing but an army between the legion and its vengeance starbuck handed the sharpshooters rifle back then went downhill to where the surgeons still worked on the previous days wounded he talked with the legions casualties and then with a dead mans rifle on his shoulder and a handful of salvaged cartridges in his haversack he ran back to the railbed a sharpshooter tried to kill him as he crossed the scrubland but the yankees bullet whipped a foot wide to thump into a bloated corpse and startle a swarm of flies into the warm morning air then starbuck leaped the parapet and slid down into the railbeds cutting to begin his new days work the first attack of the saturday morning was an advance by two companies of northern infantry who emerged from the trees in skirmish order they walked gingerly and with bayonets fixed almost as if they suspected that their orders to advance on the railbed were a mistake oh my god captain davies began the idiotic refrain that had the mysterious power to convulse jacksons army dont starbuck growled but he could have saved his breath just lay me down a halfdozen of daviess men finished the sentence and immediately began laughing imbeciles starbuck said though no one could tell whether he referred to the legionnaires or to the handful of yankees who were crossing the open ground where hundreds had died the day before some idiot got his orders confused davies commented with an indecent relish lambs to the slaughter march he eased his rifle over the parapet hold your fire starbuck called he was waiting for the enemys main body to appear at the edge of the trees but it seemed the handful of northern skirmishers was expected to capture the railbed on their own such suicidal behavior suggested davies was right and that some poor northern officer had misunderstood his orders or perhaps the enemy believed the rebels had abandoned the railbed during the night starbuck disabused them of the notion he used just two of his companies he wanted the other companies to conserve their ammunition but the fire of f and g companies was sufficient to send the northern soldiers scuttling ignominiously back to the tree line two skirmishers were left on the ground and another halfdozen limped as they fled one of the wounded men repeatedly flapped an arm as though gesturing at the rebels not to fire again none did i suspect our northern neighbors were feeling us out starbuck taking our pulse to see if any life remains in us good morning to you the speaker was the exuberant colonel elijah hudson who was ambling down the railbed as though he were merely taking a morning stroll i trust you slept well half well starbuck said it was a noisy night so it was so it was i confess i abandoned my efforts to sleep and retired into the woods to read homer by lantern light i was struck by the line about arrows rattling in their quivers as the archers advanced to battle you remember it he must have heard the noise to have described it those were the days starbuck none of this loitering in a trench but up with the sun a quick sacrifice to allseeing zeus and then a chariot ride to glory or to death i suppose you breakfasted cold chicken and hot coffee starbuck said lucifer was proving adept at feeding starbuck though admittedly the boy still had the supplies taken from the manassas depot as his larder lucifers real test would come when all he had was weevilridden hardtack rancid bacon grease and rotting salt beef if the boy even stayed long enough to face such a culinary test so far the fugitive slave seemed amused at being a part of the confederate army but doubtless he would run whenever the whim took him my son came to see me last night hudson now told starbuck who had to think for a second before remembering that hudsons eldest son was an aide of robert lee tom told me that lee arrived yesterday the colonel went on but pete longstreet declined the order to attack our mr longstreet is a meticulous fellow he likes to make certain he has a sufficiency of mud and water before he makes his pies let us hope the yankees stay long enough to be attacked or maybe i shouldnt hope that my boys are wicked low on cartridges mine too starbuck said well if all else fails hudson said we shall just have to throw rocks at them he smiled to show he was jesting then prodded his stick into the cuttings bank like a farmer testing the dirt at planting season did your fellows suffer badly yesterday he asked the question in a deceptively casual tone badly enough twentythree killed and fiftysix with the doctors much the same much the same hudson said shaking his head at the news a bad business starbuck a bad business but cant be helped what fools we mortals be i have some coffee on the boil if you want to make a neighborly call hudson gave a wave with his stick and strode back to his own regiment lieutenant coffman had resumed his role as starbucks aide he had been slightly wounded the day before by a bullet that had cut a ragged dirty groove in the flesh of his upper left arm truslow had cleaned and dressed the wound and coffman kept touching the makeshift bandage as if to make certain that the badge of his courage was still in place he bore no other badges indeed it was now impossible to tell that the ragged coffman was an officer for he carried a rifle had a haversack and cap box on his belt and had the halfstarved halffearful dirty face of a common soldier what happens now sir he asked starbuck thats up to the yankees coffman starbuck said he was watching sergeant peter waggoner lead a small prayer group and remembering how another group of men had willingly followed the big sergeant into the railbeds cutting where waggoner had swung his rifle like a club to break apart a knot of yankee resistance it was not so much the sergeants bravery that now impressed starbuck as the fact that men had so willingly followed waggoner into the fight captain pine starbuck shouted at company ds commanding officer six cartridges apiece pine said leaping to the conclusion that starbuck needed to know the bad news of how many rounds his men had left whos your best sergeant after waggoner starbuck asked instead pine thought about it for a second tom darke you might have to lose waggoner thats why pine flinched at that news then shrugged to replace poor patterson maybe starbuck said vaguely but dont say anything to waggoner yet he walked back to the south passing the remnants of pattersons company c now under the command of sergeant malachi williams who offered a curt nod as starbuck passed none of company c had joined medlicotts retreat the day before nor indeed had every man in a and b company the rot starbuck decided was confined to a stubborn handful who doubtless assumed that washington faulconer still wielded more power in the legion than nathaniel starbuck starbuck resisted the temptation to crouch as the trench became shallower keep your head down he told coffman youre not keeping yours down the lieutenant replied im a yankee i lack your valuable blood starbuck said just as a sharpshooter in the northernheld woods tried for him the bullet struck a branch in the new abatis and ricocheted up into the air while the sound of the gun echoed back from the hillside starbuck gave a derisive wave to his unseen assailant then jumped down into the spoil pit where medlicott and moxey were standing beside a small fire over which a coffeepot was suspended a halfdozen of their men were lounging near the fire and looked up suspiciously as starbuck and coffman arrived is that coffee fresh starbuck asked cheerfully there isnt much left moxey said guardedly starbuck peered into the pot plenty enough for lieutenant coffman and me he said then gave his tin mug to coffman pour away lieutenant starbuck turned to medlicott i had a letter from pecker youll doubtless be pleased that he expects to be back soon good medlicott said forcefully and murphys well thank you lieutenant starbuck took the proffered mug and blew across the steaming coffee is it sweetened he asked medlicott medlicott said nothing but just watched as starbuck sipped the coffee we heard from general faulconer moxey blurted out unable to keep the news to himself did you now starbuck asked and how is the general for a moment neither man answered indeed medlicott seemed annoyed that moxey had even mentioned the letter but now that its existence was known the major decided to take responsibility for its contents hes offered captain moxey and i jobs he said with as much dignity as he could muster i am glad starbuck said feelingly what sort of jobs in his stables perhaps serving at table kitchen hands maybe somewhere a cannon barked flat and hard the noise of the shot rolled and faded across the countryside then a train whistle sounded in the faroff depot the whistle was a very homely sound a reminder that a world existed where men did not wake to sharpshooters and bloated corpses the general needs a pair of bootcleaners maybe starbuck asked he sipped the coffee again it was very good but he made a disgusted face and poured the liquid onto the spoil pits stones so that it splashed onto medlicotts boots what sort of a job major starbuck asked medlicott was silent for a few seconds as he controlled his temper then he managed a grim smile general faulconer says there are vacancies in the provost guard at the capitol starbuck pretended to be impressed youll be guarding the president and congress and all those richmond politicians and their whores is it just the pair of you who are needed or can you take the rest of us with you too we can take enough men starbuck medlicott said but only the right kind of men he added the childish insult and there was a murmur of agreement from the nearby soldiers who had clearly been invited to share medlicotts supposed good fortune and that explains why youre avoiding all the fighting starbuck said as though the idea had only just dawned on him dear lord above and i thought you were simply being cowards now you tell me youre keeping yourselves safe for higher and better duties why didnt you tell me before starbuck waited but neither man answered starbuck spat at their feet listen you sons of bitches ive served in the richmond provosts and general winder runs that crew of spavined leprous bastards not general faulconer general faulconer has about as much influence in richmond as i do hes promising you an easy berth just to make you unhappy here but i aint going to let you play that game youre here to fight not dream so this morning you sons of bitches are fighting with the rest of us is that clear moxey looked apprehensive but medlicott had more faith in washington faulconer than moxey well do what we have to do he said stubbornly good starbuck said because what you have to do is fight he walked to the edge of the spoil pit and leaned with pretended nonchalance on its slope he propped his rifle against the bank and started cleaning his fingernails with the bodkin he used for reaming out the cones of his revolver i forgot to shave this morning he said to coffman you should grow a beard sir coffman said nervously i dont like beards starbuck said and i hate cowards he was watching the men around medlicott seeing their hatred and wondering if any dared threaten him with violence that was a risk he would have to take when the moment came and until it came he would wait in the spoil pit that he turned into a temporary regimental headquarters bandmaster little who served as the battalions chief clerk as well as its fussy maker of music brought him a bagful of tedious paperwork and starbuck passed the time filling in the lists of dead indenting for rations and sending urgent pleas for ammunition no ammunition came but nor did the yankees the sun rose to its height and still no attack came once in a while a rattle of gunfire would crackle across the country but otherwise there was silence two armies were poised side by side yet neither moved and the peace of the day frustrated starbuck he needed a fight to bring his confrontation with medlicott to fruition maybe the bastards have gone home he told lucifer when the boy brought him a midday meal of bread cheese and apples theyre still over there i can smell them lucifer said the boy glanced at the brooding medlicott then looked back to the cheerful starbuck youve been tugging on his chains lucifer said with amusement its none of your business lucy lucy the boy was offended starbuck smiled i cant call you lucifer it isnt proper so i shall call you lucy the boy bridled but before he could think of a response there was a sudden shout from one of colonel hudsons pickets and then a great rushing and trampling noise in the woods beyond the killing patch starbuck abandoned the bread and cheese snatched up his rifle and ran to the pits forward edge where a squad from moxeys company was lying on their bellies with their rifles trained under the abatis see anything starbuck asked nothing yet the noise was getting louder it was the noise starbuck reckoned of hundreds if not thousands of boots trampling down the undergrowth it was the noise of an infantry attack designed to break through jacksons line once and for all it was the noise that foretold battle and all along the railbed men pushed rifles over the parapet and cocked hammers sumbitches dont give up the man next to starbuck said he was one of those who had stayed and fought the day before whats your name starbuck asked him sam norton from faulconer court house rosskill norton answered rosskill was the nearest railhead to the legions hometown what did you do there norton grinned last job i had in rosskill was sweeping out the county jail starbuck grinned back unwillingly i guess never minded sweeping it out major cos once youd swept out the jail you had to sweep out the sheriffs house and sheriff simms had two daughters sweeter than honey on a comb hell i know men who robbed stores and stood rock still just begging to be locked up for a chance at emily and sue starbuck laughed then went silent as the trampling of feet was translated into a sudden rush of men hundreds of men who shouted their hoarse war cry and charged across the narrow strip of open land toward the embankment where elijah hudsons north carolinians waited fire hudson shouted and the embankment was rimmed with smoke fire starbuck shouted and the legion gave what flanking fire they could but for most of the men the angle was too acute for their rifles to help the beleaguered hudson the yankee charge reached the embankments foot and surged up its face hudsons men stood up for a second starbuck thought the carolinians had merely stood to run away but instead they advanced across the flat railbed and met the yankee charge headon they swung rifles slashed with bowie knives and rammed forward with bayonets starbuck stared into the woods directly opposite the legion and saw no threat there the noise of the handtohand fighting to his right was terrible an echo from the medieval days of men being butchered by steel and crushed by clubs the bestiality of the sound was a temptation to leave well alone and stay in the railbeds cutting on the excuse that a second yankee attack might come straight for the legions position but starbuck knew that assumption was merely an excuse for cowardice and so he slung his rifle and jumped down to the spoil pits floor major medlicott were going to help major medlicott did not move the men with him stared sullenly at starbuck you heard me starbuck asked it aint our fight starbuck medlicott summoned his courage to articulate his defiance of starbuck besides if we leave here the yankees could attack straight into the pit again and then where would we be starbuck did not answer instead he looked sideways at coffman go and send sergeant waggoner to me he said softly so that only coffman could hear then tell truslow that hes got to hold the railbed with companies g and h hes to ignore my order to charge understated yes sir coffman ran off on his errand medlicott had not heard the orders starbuck gave but sneered anyway sending for swynyard starbuck could feel his heart beating flabbily in his chest major medlicott he said very slowly and distinctly im ordering you to fix bayonets and go to colonel hudsons assistance medlicotts big red face seemed to twist in a spasm of loathing but he managed to make his answer sound respectful its my judgment we should guard our own position he said just as formally as starbuck youre disobeying an order starbuck asked im staying here the miller said stubbornly and when starbuck did not respond immediately medlicott grinned in anticipation of victory no ones to move he called to his men our jobs to stay here and he stopped speaking because starbuck had shot him starbuck did not really believe he was doing it he was aware that the act would either seal the legion as his regiment or else condemn him to a courtmartial or a lynching he drew the heavy adams revolver and straightened his right arm while his thumb clicked the hammer smoothly back then his finger took the triggers pressure so fast that the look of triumph on medlicotts face had scarcely started to change when the bullet struck him just beneath his right eye blood and bone made a cloud of droplets about the majors shattering skull as he was thrown backward his hat went straight up in the air while his body flew back three yards twitching as it flew then flapping like a landed fish as it thumped heavily onto the dirt there the body lay utterly still with its arms outstretched oh my god starbuck heard himself saying just lay me down he began to laugh medlicotts ashenfaced men watched him none of them moved medlicotts dead fingers slowly curled starbuck pushed the revolver into its holster captain moxey he said very calmly moxey did not wait for the rest of the sentence company he shouted fix bayonets moxeys men ran south along the railbed to help hudsons lefthand company medlicotts men still stared dumbly at the body of their officer then up at starbuck this was the moment that starbuck had half expected to turn mutinous but none of the company made any move to avenge the dead miller anyone else want to disobey my orders starbuck asked them no one spoke the men seemed dazed then peter waggoner ran up panting sir youre a lieutenant now waggoner starbuck said in charge of a company take over follow captain moxey and get rid of those yankees sir waggoner was slow to understand do it starbuck snapped then he unslung his rifle and pushed his bayonet into place he turned toward the rest of the regiment legion fix bayonets he waited a few seconds follow me it was a risk because if the yankees were waiting to attack the legions positions then starbuck was giving them victory but if he did not help the north carolinians then the yankees would probably break through into the woods and so he took threequarters of the legion down the railbed to help hudsons men some of those men were out of ammunition and were hurling rocks at the yankees throwing so hard that the heavy stones drew blood when they struck on sweatstreaked faces follow me starbuck shouted again moxey and waggoner were helping hudsons lefthand companies but the biggest threat was in the center of the colonels line and starbuck now led his reinforcements down the back of the embankment to where that yankee pressure was fiercest some of the northerners had gained the flat summit of the embankment where they were struggling to take hudsons two standards and it was there that starbuck intervened come on he screamed and he heard his men begin the terrible shrill rebel yell as they scrambled up the slope and into the fight starbuck pulled his rifles trigger as he neared the melee then rammed the bayonet hard into a blue jacket he was screaming like a banshee suddenly feeling the extraordinary release of medlicotts death my god but he had cut the rot clean out of the legions soul there was a rebel on the ground trying to fight off a northern sergeant who had his hands around the rebels throat starbuck kicked the northerners head up then sliced his bayonet back and upward so that the blade slit the mans throat open the sergeant collapsed gushing blood over his intended victim starbuck clambered over both men and rammed the bayonet forward again men were grunting and cursing tripping on the dying and slipping in blood but the yankees were giving ground they had been trying to fight up the embankments slope and the rebels had managed to keep most of them on that forward slope and at a consequent disadvantage until the legions arrival tipped the balance the northerners retreated they went down the embankment but they were not beaten yet the woods here grew close to the railbed so close that the yankees could retreat to the tree line and still fire over open sights at the rebel position and once back among the trees they poured an immense fire at the embankment the storm of bullets drove the rebel defenders back from the crest and down into cover the bullets whistled and hissed overhead they thumped into the bodies of the dead or else ricocheted off the embankment to tear through the leaves behind every few moments a group of yankees would charge the apparently empty parapet only to be met by a sparse rebel volley a shower of stones and the sight of waiting bayonets they dont yield easily do they my god starbuck but i owe you thanks upon my soul i do colonel hudson his long hair matted with blood and his eyes wild tried to shake starbucks hand starbuck encumbered with a rifle ramrod and cartridge fumbled the handshake youre wounded colonel dear me no hudson pushed the long bloodthick hair out of his face other fellows blood you killed him remember cut his throat dear me but upon my soul starbuck im grateful grateful truly are you sure youre not hurt sir starbuck asked for hudson seemed unsteady on his feet just shocked starbuck just shocked and i shall be just dandy in a moment or two the colonel looked up at the railbed where a rock had just landed it seemed the yankees were throwing the stones back now starbuck finished loading his rifle wriggled up the bank and pushed the gun between two bodies he sighted on a blue jacket pulled the trigger and slid back to reload he had five cartridges left while most of his men were now reduced to just one or two elijah hudson was similarly short of ammunition one more attack starbuck the north carolinian said and i suspect were done for the attack came almost as he spoke it was a frantic desperate charge of tired bloodied men who burst out of the woods to throw themselves up the embankment for two days these northerners had tried to break the rebel line and for two days they had been frustrated but now they were on the very brink of success and they summoned their last reserves of strength as they scrambled up the scorched bank with fixed bayonets fire hudson shouted and the rebels last guns flamed as a barrage of rocks hurtled overhead now charge my dears charge home the colonel called and the tired men threw themselves forward to meet the yankee assault starbuck thrust with the bayonet twisted the blade and thrust again coffman was beside him firing a revolver then he glimpsed lucifer of all people firing his colt then starbucks bayonet stuck in a mans belly and he tried to kick it free then tried to twist it free but nothing would loosen the fleshs grip on the steel he cursed the dying man then felt a gush of warm blood on his hands as he unslotted the blade and pulled the rifle away from the trapped blade he reversed the rifle and swung it overhand like a club he was keening a mad noise half exultation half lamentation expecting death at any second but determined not to give an inch against the mass of men who pushed into the rebels blades and rifle stocks then suddenly without any apparent reason the pressure eased suddenly the great charge was gone and the northerners were running back into the trees and leaving behind a tideline of bodies heaped on bodies some of the bodies moving slow beneath their pall of blood others lying still and there was silence except for the panting of the wildeyed rebels who stood on the embankment they had held against the charge back now starbuck broke the silence back there might still be sharpshooters in the woods and so he pulled his men back down the embankment into cover dont leave me dont leave me a wounded man cried aloud and another wept because he had been blinded the stretcher bearers went across the railbed no one shot at them starbuck cleaned the blood from his rifles stock with a handful of oak leaves coffman was beside him eyes gleaming with a maniacal delight lucifer was reloading his revolver youre not supposed to kill northerners starbuck told him i kill who i want the boy said resentfully but thank you anyway starbuck said but lucifers only response was a look of hurt dignity starbuck sighed thank you lucifer he said lucifer immediately grinned so i aint lucy thank you lucifer starbuck said again a triumphant lucifer kissed the muzzle of his gun a man can be whatever a man wants to be maybe next year ill decide to be a rebel killer starbuck spat on the rifles lock to help clean the blood clotted there somewhere in the woods behind him a bird burst into song its quiet isnt it hudson said from a few paces away starbuck looked up is it its quiet the colonel said so beautifully quiet i do believe the yankees are gone the line had held the reverend doctor starbuck beheld a nightmare he had spent a second day with major galloways horsemen in the hope that he would have a chance to join in the pursuit of a broken rebel army he was aware that the next day would be the lords day and he whiled away the waiting hours planning the sermon he would give to the victorious troops but as the hours passed and there was still no sign of a rebel collapse the prospect of the sermon receded then in the afternoon just after the firing in the woods had died suddenly away a message came ordering galloways men to investigate some strange troops seen marching to the southwest the preacher rode with galloway they passed trampled cornfields and orchards looted of their fruit they crossed the turnpike where the battle had started two days before splashed through a stream then rode up a bare hillside to where two gaudily uniformed regiments of new york zouaves were resting on the grassy crest with their rifles stacked all quiet here the young dapper commander of the nearer regiment the th new york proclaimed and weve got a picket line in the woodshe gestured downhill to where thick woods grewand theyre not being disturbed so i guess it will stay quiet major galloway decided he would ride as far as the new york picket line but the preacher elected to stay with the infantry for a moments small talk had elicited the astonishing information that the th new yorks commanding officer was the son of an old colleague and that old colleague the reverend doctor winslow was actually the chaplain to his own sons regiment now the reverend winslow galloped across to greet his boston friend i never thought to find you here starbuck i trust i shall always be found where the lords work needs doing winslow the boston preacher said then shook hands winslow looked proudly at his son who had ridden back to his place at the head of the regiment just twentysix starbuck but in charge of the finest volunteer regiment in our army even the regulars cant hold a candle to the new york th they fought like trojans in the peninsula and your own sons theyre well i pray james is with mcclellan the reverend starbuck said the others are too young to fight then wanting to change the subject before winslow remembered the existence of nathaniel the boston preacher asked about the th new yorks flamboyant uniform which consisted of bright red baggy pantaloons short blue collarless jackets with scarlet trim a red waist sash and a crimson cap rimmed with a white turban and crowned with a long golden tassel its a copy of a french uniform winslow explained zouaves are reputedly the fiercest fighters in the french army and our patron wanted us to emulate their dress as well as their йlan patron were paid for by a new york furniture manufacturer he paid for everything you see here starbuck paid for it lock stock and barrel youre seeing the profits of mahogany and turned legs at war the reverend starbuck eyed his old friends uniform and wished that he was able to wear such finery he was about to inquire what arrangements winslow had made to fill his pulpit while he served with the army but was distracted by a burst of gunfire in the woods our skirmishers i guess winslow said when the sound had faded they were probably attacking a regiment of wild turkey we ate a couple last night and very good eating they were too the resting regiment had stirred at the sudden fusillade and some men retrieved their rifles from the stacks but most just cursed for being half woken up pulled the turbans over their eyes again and tried to go back to sleep your son said theres been no sign of the enemy here the reverend starbuck inquired wondering why the hairs on the back of his neck were suddenly prickling none at all the chaplain said staring toward the woods i think you might say weve drawn the short straw our part in the great victory is to be spectators or maybe not his last three words were prompted by the appearance of a group of zouaves at the tree line on the regiments left flank they were evidently skirmishers returning to their parent regiment and they were agitated rebels one of the men shouted rebels theyre panicking the chaplain said scornfully more of the zouaves snatched up their rifles a captain mounted on a nervous black horse cantered past the two pastors and touched his hat respectfully i think theyre imagining things chaplain the captain called goodnaturedly to winslow then put his hand to his throat and started making a mewing sound as he struggled to breathe blood began to seep through his fingers and while the reverend starbuck tried to make sense of this strange apparition he was suddenly overwhelmed by the sound of firing that had somehow taken a second or two to register on his stunned senses stunned because the hilltop was being swept by a typhoon of fire a whistling whipping terror of bullets that crashed from the tree line where appallingly regiment after regiment of rebels now appeared one moment there had been a summers peace prevailing on the warm hilltop where bees had sucked at clover blossoms then there was death and screaming and blood and the transition had been too abrupt for the preachers mind to comprehend the dying captain was jerked back from the saddle to be dragged along the ground by a foot trapped in a stirrup he cried pathetically then a great rush of blood silenced him forever the chaplain began shouting encouragement to the dazed zouaves who seemed to shrink back from the weltering rifle fire the reverend starbucks horse bolted from the unending splintering crack of rifles that outflanked the two new york regiments the horse ran north fleeing the attack and it was not till he reached the edge of the hill that the preacher was able to curb the scared animal and turn it just in time to see a line of rebel regiments appear from the far trees these were lees men who had marched one day after stonewall jackson and who were now being unleashed from the valleys and woods where they had hidden overnight they all made their devilish ululating scream as they attacked and the preachers blood ran chill as the terrible sound washed across the hilltop the reverend starbuck dragged his revolver out of its saddle holster but made no effort to fire it he was faced by a nightmare he was watching the death of two regiments the new yorkers tried to fight they stood in line and returned the rebel fire but the gray lines overlapped and decimated the zouave ranks with an overwhelming volume of rifle fire brightly uniformed men were plucked back from the new york ranks and though the sergeants and corporals tried to close the gaps the gaps kept coming faster than they could be filled men slipped away running north and east the reverend starbuck shouted at the fugitives to hold their ground but they ignored his ravings and ran downhill toward the stream the furniture makers regiment was reduced to three groups of men who tried to hold off the overpowering assault but three times their number could not have stopped this rebel surge the new yorkers died there was a spatter of final shots a scream of defiance then the flags toppled as the last stubborn defenders were overrun the hill was suddenly swarming with rebel rat gray coats and the preacher startled from his shocked immobility kicked his horse and let it run downhill among the scattered fugitives the first rebels were already firing after the running men and the reverend starbuck heard the bullets whiplash about him but the preachers horse kept running it splashed through the stream and so up into the safety of the trees on the far side the scream of the obscene rebel yell soured the preachers ears as he slowed the sweating horse all around him now he could hear that terrible scream the noise of the devil on the march and he sensed even if he did not understand that another northern army was being ignominiously beaten tears ran down his cheeks as he tried to understand the unfathomable ways of god he crossed the turnpike going back to where he had spent so long waiting to begin the pursuit of the beaten rebels but there was no sign of galloways men there nor thank god any rebels either the preacher cuffed the tears from his cheeks as he rested his horse to his right where the smoke from the burning depot still made a brown smear in the sky there was only a tangle of woods and steep valleys and it was through that broken ground he suspected that the rebel advance was being made to his left across the wider fields lay the woods where one northern attack after another had been launched toward the railbed but none of those attacks had succeeded which surely meant that the rebels still lurked among those woods while behind him the devils troops had just made carrion out of winslows zouaves on a virginia hilltop which left the preacher just one place to go he rode northeast his grief turning into a rage fit to fill all heaven what dolts led the armies of the north what strutting turkeycock fools the preacher felt a duty being laid upon him the duty to awaken the north to the poltroons who were leading its sons into one defeat after another he would go to galloways house fetch his luggage then have one of the majors servants show him an escape route north across the bull run it was time to return to the sanity of boston where he would begin his campaign that would wake a nation to its sins cannons fired in the hills their sound echoing confusedly around the sky rifles cracked the gunsmoke showing in rills above trees and streams robert lee had brought twentyfive thousand men and placed them at right angles to jacksons beleaguered line and not one yankee had known the rebels were there until the starry banners came forward above the gray lines now the rebels flank attack advanced like a door swinging shut on john popes glory and the reverend elial starbuck carried his righteous anger back toward home the sun sank slow toward the western hills nothing stirred in the woods to the east the noise of battle rolled like distant thunder but what the noise meant or where the yankees were no one knew a patrol from truslows company h was the first to cross the shellscorched strip of land into the trees but they found no yankees there the sharpshooters had gone and the woods were empty except for the litter of the abandoned northern bivouacs ammunition arrived and was handed out among the weary men some troops slept indistinguishable in their exhaustion from the dead around them starbuck tried to compile a list of the dead and the wounded but the work was slow an hour before sundown colonel swynyard rode his horse up to the railbed he was leading another horse by the reins it belonged to major medlicott he told starbuck i hear he died shot by a yankee i hear starbuck said straightfaced swynyards mouth flickered in what might have been a smile were ordered to advance and i thought you might appreciate a horse starbucks initial reaction was to refuse for he took pride in marching like his men but then he remembered the house with the limewashed stone pillar at its lane gate and thanked swynyard for bringing him the animal he pulled himself into the saddle just as the legion was stirred from its rest the tired men grumbled at being disturbed but shouldered their rifles and climbed from the railbed the wounded the surgeons the servants and a sergeants guard stayed behind while the rest of the legion formed ranks around the color guard where lieutenant coffman carried the replacement battle flag on its sapling staff starbuck took his place at the head of the regiment on medlicotts horse forward he called hudsons north carolinians advanced to the legions right colonel hudson was mounted on an expensive black mare and was now accoutred with a sword in a goldmounted scabbard hudson waved in friendly greeting as the two regiments advanced in line but once among the trees starbuck deliberately led the legion to the left and so opened a gap between himself and the carolinians he crossed the small pasture where they had checked their pursuit of the first yankee attack the day before there were still unburied dead in the field beyond the pasture was a strip of woods then a wider stretch of open farmland that was bisected by a road climbing to a far crest starbuck rode to the left of his line remember this place starbuck asked truslow should i we fought our first battle here starbuck pointed to his left the yankees came out of those trees and we waited up therehe pointed right to the ridgeand i was scareder than hell and you behaved like it had all happened before it had i was in mexico remember starbuck let the horse walk at its own pace across the old battlefield there were yellowing bone fragments in the furrows and he wondered for how many years the farmers would plow up mens bones and the bullets that put them there so what happened with medlicott truslow asked the two men were thirty paces ahead of the ranks what do your men say happened that you picked a fight with him then shot the son of a bitch starbuck thought about it then nodded just about do they mind truslow twisted a piece of tobacco from a plug and put it in his mouth some of them feel sorry for edna his wife she has children to feed but hell no they dont mind about the miller he was a mean son of a bitch hes a hero now starbuck said hes going to get his name on a statue in faulconer court house dan medlicott hero of our war of independence he crossed the road remembering when he had watched a northern army attack across these fields they were not much changed the snake fences were long gone burned to boil the coffeepots of soldiers and flecks of bone disfigured the dirt but otherwise it was just as starbuck remembered he led the legion on across the farmland angling still more to his left until rather than heading toward the eastern ridge with the rest of the brigade he was heading toward a stand of timber that topped a small ridge that lay to the north swynyard galloped up to starbuck wrong way up there he pointed eastward up the road starbuck reined in theres a place i want to visit colonel just over the hill not more than a quartermile now swynyard frowned what place the house of the man who took our flags colonel and the house of the man whose troops burned women in a tavern swynyards initial reaction was to shake his head then he had second thoughts and looked at truslows company before turning back to the two officers what can you achieve i dont know but then we didnt know what we were going to achieve when we ran to dead marys ford in the middle of the night starbuck deliberately reminded swynyard of that night and the implicit favor that the colonel owed him as a result the colonel smiled youve got one hour well be going up the road he said pointing to the right and i guess it would only be prudent for someone to take a patrol north just in case any of the rascals are lurking do you think one company will be enough plenty sir starbuck said and touched the brim of his hat to the colonel company he called to his old company follow me he borrowed a lit cigar from john bailey and lit one of his own with its glowing tip he walked the horse slowly pacing the beast beside truslow the rest of the legion climbed the gentle eastern slope toward the sound of battle that now seemed very far awayso far that none of the advancing battalions seemed in any hurry to join that distant fighting starbuck looked to his left and saw the whitepainted pillar on the road at the end of the stand of trees not far now he told truslow through these woods and in the next fields what happens if the place is full of yankees truslow asked then well go back starbuck said but when the company emerged from the trees on the ridge they saw that the place was not full of yankees instead the galloway homestead seemed deserted as the rebel soldiers walked slowly down the long slope toward the farm buildings that were set among a grove of leafy mature trees it looked a handsome house starbuck thought a place where a man could settle and live a good life it seemed to have good watered land welldrained fields and plenty of timber a black man met them at the yard gate theres no one here massa the man said nervously whose house is it starbuck asked the man did not answer you heard the officer truslow growled the black man glanced at the approaching company then licked his lips belongs to a gentleman called galloway massa but hes not here hes with the army is he starbuck asked yes massa the man smiled ingratiatingly hes with the army starbuck returned the smile but which army the black mans smile vanished instantly he said nothing and starbuck kicked his heels to ride past him any slaves in the house he called over his shoulder to the black man three of us massa and were not slaves were servants you live in the house in the cabins massa the servant was running after starbuck while truslow brought the company on behind so the house is empty starbuck asked the man paused then nodded as starbuck looked back at him its empty massa whats your name joseph massa then listen joseph if youve got any belongings in the house get them out now because im about to burn this goddamned house to the ground and if your master wants to know why tell him its with the compliments of the whores he burned alive at mccombs tavern you got that message joseph starbuck curbed the horse and swung himself out of the saddle he jumped down spurting dust from beneath his boots did you hear me joseph the black servant gazed in horror at starbuck you cant burn it sir tell your master that he killed women tell him my name is starbuck you hear that let me hear you say it starbuck sir and dont you forget it joseph i am starbuck avenger of whores starbuck declaimed that final sentence as he climbed the veranda steps and threw open the houses front door to see his father clouds heaped in the south darkening a day already declining toward dusk in the steep hills and valleys where the rebel flank attack surged forward the fading light made the rifle flames stab brighter and the smoke look grayer there was a sense that the weather must break soon and indeed far to the south on the empty earthworks that the yankees had abandoned by the rappahannock river the first drops of rain splashed heavy lightning flickered in the clouds at manassas the rebel flank attack grew ragged it had been launched across broken country and the advancing brigades soon lost touch with each other as they detoured about thornchoked gullies or around thick groves of trees some regiments forged ahead while others met yankee troops who put up unexpectedly stubborn resistance cannons cracked from hilltops canister fire shredded woodlands and rifle fire stuttered along a crooked threemile front behind the yankees was the bull run a stream deep and wide enough to be a river in any country other than america and a stream deep and wide enough to drown a man encumbered with a pack haversack cartridge box and boots and if the rebels could just break the yankees and hurl them back in panic then eighty thousand men might be struggling to cross that killing stream which boasted only one small bridge the beaten army could drown in its thousands except the yankees did not panic they streamed back across the bridge and some men did drown as they tried to swim the run but other men stood shouldertoshoulder on the hill where once a man called thomas jackson had earned the name of stonewall they stood and met the oncoming rebel troops with a cannonade that lit the hills forward slope red with the flash of its gun flames and made the valley beyond crackle with the echo of rifle volleys volley after killing volley a stinging flail of lead that ripped the gray ranks apart and held the land west of the bridge long enough to let the bulk of john popes army escape only then did the stoic blue ranks yield stonewall jacksons hill to stonewall jacksons countrymen it was a northern defeat but the northerners had not been routed lines of blueuniformed men trudged away from a battlefield where they had been promised victory but had been led to defeat and where the victorious rebels began to count the captured weapons and captured men and at joseph galloways farm on the southern bank of the bull run the reverend starbuck stared at his son and his son stared back father starbuck broke the silence for a second a heartbeat starbuck thought his father would relent for that one second he thought his father was about to hold out his arms in welcome and there was indeed a sudden expression of pain and longing on the older mans face and for that one second all the plans starbuck had ever made for defying his father should they ever meet again vanished into thin air as he felt a swamping wave of guilt and love sweep through him but then the vulnerable expression vanished from the preachers face what are you doing here the reverend starbuck demanded gruffly ive business here what business the reverend starbuck barred the hallway he was carrying his ebony stick which he held out like a sword to prevent his son from stepping further into the house and dont you dare smoke in my presence he snapped then tried to swat the cigar out of his sons hand with his ebony cane starbuck easily evaded the blow father he said trying to appeal to old ties of stern affection but he was brusquely interrupted i am not your father then what kind of a son of a bitch are you to tell me not to smoke starbucks temper flared high and fierce he welcomed the anger knowing it was probably his best weapon in this confrontation for the instant that he had seen his fathers stern face a lifetime of filial obedience had made him cringe inside at that moment when the door had swung open he had suddenly felt eight years old again and utterly helpless in the face of his fathers unforgiving certainty dont you swear at me nathaniel the preacher said ill goddamn swear where i damn well want now move starbucks anger burned bright he pushed past his father you want to pick a quarrel with me he shouted over his shoulder then make up your mind whether its a family quarrel or a fight between strangers and get yourself out of this house im burning the damn place down starbuck shouted these last words from the library the shelves were empty though a handful of account books were piled on a table you propose to do what the reverend starbuck had followed his son into the big room you heard me starbuck began tearing the account books into scraps that would burn easily he piled the scraps at the edge of the table where their flames would work on the empty shelving above the reverend starbucks face showed a glimmer of pain you have become a whoremonger a thief a traitor and now you will burn a good mans house because he burned a tavernstarbuck started tearing apart another bookand killed women they pleaded with his soldiers to stop firing but they wouldnt they went on shooting and they burned the women alive the reverend starbuck swept the pile of paper scraps off the table with his cane they didnt know there were women in the tavern they knew starbuck said starting to make another pile of torn paper youre a liar the reverend starbuck raised his cane and would have slashed it down on his sons hands had not a shot been fired inside the room the sound of it echoed terribly inside the four walls while the bullet ripped a scar into the empty shelves opposite the door he aint lying preacher i was there truslow had appeared in the open garden door i carried one of the women out of the ruins myself burned to a crisp she was kind of shriveled to the size of a newborn calf there were five women burned like that he spat tobacco juice then tossed a tin to starbuck found these in the kitchen he said starbuck saw they were lucifers this is my father starbuck said in curt introduction truslow nodded preacher he said in brief acknowledgment the reverend starbuck said nothing but just watched as his son made another pile of broken paper we kind of got upset starbuck went on on account of not fighting against women ourselves so we decided to burn this son of a bitchs house down to teach him that fighting against women aint worth the price they were whores the reverend starbuck snapped so theyre making me a bed in hell right now starbuck snarled back and you think they wont be better company than you saints in heaven he struck one of the lucifers and held its flame to the heap of paper scraps the cane struck again scattering the new heap of paper and instantly extinguishing the small flame you have broken your mothers heart the preacher said and brought shame on my house you lied to your brother you have cheated you have stolen the catalog of sins was so great that the reverend starbuck was momentarily overcome and he was forced to hold his breath and shake his head the son of a bitch drinks whiskey too truslow used the silence to add his contribution from the doorway yet the preacher shouted the word the shout intended to govern his temper and yet he said blinking back tears your lord and savior will forgive you nate all he asks is that you go to him on bended knee with a confession of faith all our sins can be forgiven all tears ran down the preachers cheeks please he said i cannot bear to think that in heaven we must look down on your eternal torment starbuck felt another great tidal surge of emotion he might have rejected his fathers house and his fathers stem religion but he could not deny that it had been a good house and an honest religion nor could he claim that he did not fear the flames of eternal damnation he felt the tears pricking at his own eyes he stopped tearing paper and tried to summon up the anger that would let him face his father again but instead he seemed to tremble on the brink of total surrender think of your younger brothers think of your sisters they love you the reverend starbuck had found his theme now and pressed it hard he had so often sworn to disown this child to cast nathaniel out from the fellowship of christ as well as from the starbuck family but now the preacher saw what a victory over the devil his sons repentance and return would make he imagined nathaniel making a confession of his sins in the church he saw himself as the father of the prodigal son and he anticipated the joy in heaven at the repentance of this one sinner yet there was more than a spiritual victory at stake the preachers anger had flared just like his sons but the father was also discovering that a year of angry denial had been destroyed by a moments proximity this son after all was the one most like himself which was why he supposed this was always the son with whom he had fought the hardest now he had to win this son back not just for christ but for the starbuck family think of martha he urged starbuck naming starbucks favorite sister think of frederick and how hes always admired you the preacher might have won the battle had he not spread his arms as he mentioned his son frederick he had intended the gesture as a reminder that frederick five years starbucks junior had been born with a withered arm but the gesture also released the battle flag that had been clasped under the preachers left arm the flag fell to the floor where it sagged out of its fraying abused string binding starbuck glad not to have to meet his fathers gaze looked at the flag he saw the silk the lavish fringe and he looked up at his fathers face and for an instant all memories of martha and frederick vanished he looked back to the flag truslow had also noticed the richness of the flags material is that a battle flag preacher he asked the reverend starbuck stooped to snatch up the flag but the violence of the motion only destroyed what was left of the string so that the banner spilt richly into the evening light its none of your business the preacher said to truslow defiantly thats our flag goddamn it truslow said its the devils rag the preacher snapped back bundling the silk into his arms he had dropped the cane to make the task easier ill take the flag mister truslow said grimly stepping forward with an outstretched hand you want this flag the reverend starbuck said then youll have to strike me down hell if i care truslow said and reached for the banner the preacher kicked at him but elial starbuck was no match for thomas truslow the soldier hit the preachers arm once but hard then took the flag from the suddenly nerveless grip you would let your father be hit the preacher turned to starbuck but the moment when starbucks surrender was just a tremble of remembered emotion away had passed he scraped another lucifer alight and put it to a page torn from an account book you said you werent my father he said brutally then ripped more pages and piled them onto the tiny fire he sprinkled the flames with powder from a revolver cartridge that he tore apart so that the small fire flared violently his father snatched up his cane and tried to sweep the burning papers off the table again but this time starbuck stood in his way for a second the two stood facetoface then a voice called from the yard johnnies it was sergeant decker truslow ran to the door yankees he confirmed starbuck joined truslow on the veranda a quartermile to the east was a ragged band of men who were watching the house they wore blue and some were on horseback and some on foot they had the look starbuck decided of a cavalry troop that had been put through hell one of the men had golden hair and a short square beard is that adam he asked truslow i guess starbuck turned to see that his father was obliterating the last vestiges of his fire truslow he said burn this damn house down while i go and tell those yankees to get the hell out of virginia and ill take the flag there was a speartipped lance pole in a corner of the room starbuck took the lance stripped it of its spearhead and swallowtailed cavalry guidon then slotted the silk flag onto the staff then ignoring his fathers angry voice he jumped down into the yard and called for a man to bring his horse he rode eastward carrying the flag adam rode to meet him and the two erstwhile friends met in the middle of the pasture next to the farmhouse adam looked ruefully at the flag so you got it back wheres the other one im keeping it we always used to share starbuck said adam smiled at the remark how are you nate alive just starbuck said me too adam id he looked tired and sad like a man whose hopes have taken a beating he gestured at the ragged band of men and horses behind we got ambushed in some woods not many of us left good starbuck turned in the saddle to see a wisp of smoke showing at a window of the house i know it wasnt your fault adam but some of us took badly to women being burned alive so we thought wed do the same to galloways house adam nodded dully as though he did not really care about the destruction of the farmhouse the majors dead he said starbuck grimaced for it seemed that he was burning the house for nothing and the son of a bitch who killed the women blythe god knows adam said billy blythe disappeared billy blythe has a way of making himself scarce when theres trouble about adam leaned on his saddles pommel and stared toward galloways farm where more smoke was showing at a halfdozen windows i cant imagine pecker giving you permission to do this he said with an obvious distaste for the destruction adam clearly had not heard about birds wound nor any of the legions other news peckers back home wounded starbuck told him and im the new colonel adam stared at his friend you your father was thrown out adam shook his head in apparent disbelief or maybe denial you have the legion he asked starbuck twitched the reins to turn his horse so the next time you want to play games with a regiment dont choose mine adam ill goddamn kill you next time adam shook his head whats happening to us nate starbuck laughed at the question were at war and your side says that houses have to be burned and goods taken from civilians i guess were matching you stride for stride adam did not even try to argue the point he stared at the farmhouse which was now gushing thick smoke from several windows truslow had clearly set about his incendiarism with an expertise that quite outstripped starbucks feeble efforts is that your father adam had seen the blackdressed figure come from the burning house send him safe home will you surely starbuck clumsily turned his horse away look after yourself now and dont interfere with us well be gone in five minutes adam nodded his agreement then just as starbuck was urging his horse forward he spoke again have you heard from julia starbuck twisted in his saddle shes well shes a nurse in chimborazo remember me to her adam said but his onetime friend had already ridden away starbuck rode back to the house where his old company had gathered outside the yard fence to watch the flames his father shouted something at starbuck but the words were lost in the roar of the fire lets go starbuck called and turned away from the burning house he did not say farewell to his father but just rode up the hill he thought how close he had come to a tearful reconciliation then tried to convince himself that there were some roads that could never be revisited no matter what lay at their ends he stopped at the wooded ridge and looked back a roof beam collapsed into the fire spewing a fountain of sparks into the evening air come on he called to the company they caught up with the brigade a mile to the east swynyard was resting the men and waiting for orders there were rain clouds in the south and a fresh wind gusting but to the west above the blue ridge mountains the sun flared bright as it dipped behind americas rim in the north an army was in full retreat while to the east and south wherever a man looked there were only rebel banners advancing in victory and now a brighter banner joined the triumph as starbuck kicked back his heels and let his borrowed horse run free so that the shining colors of the recaptured flag streamed and rippled in the breeze he rode in a curve bringing the flag back to its legion and as he turned the horse toward their ranks he raised the flag higher still standing in the stirrups with his right arm braced aloft so that the battle flags white stars and blue cross and crimson silk were made livid and brilliant by the last long rays of daylight he was bringing the bright flag home and in the sudden cheer that filled the sky starbuck knew that he had made the legion his it was starbucks legion historical note all the battles and skirmishes in the novel are based on real actions that were fought in the summer of a campaign that ended northern hopes for a swift victory in the east that year mcclellan had failed in his ambitious amphibious attack now john pope had been beaten back overland i simplified some of the events that took place in between cedar mountain and jacksons epic march around the northern flank there was an extra week of fighting in between those two events but it was very confused fighting and so i took a fiction writers liberty and simply pretended it never happened readers who would like to know the true story of the confrontation across the rapidan and rappahannock should read john hennessys splendid account of the campaign return to bull run a book that was constantly at my elbow as i wrote battle flag washington faulconers stupidity at dead marys ford is based on an exactly similar event at raccoon ford when robert toombs a georgia politician turned soldier stripped the ford of its guard on the grounds that he had not ordered the guard set and therefore the guard should not exist and on that very night the ford was crossed by a force of federal cavalry that raided the confederate lines and very nearly succeeded in capturing jeb stuart they had to settle for the famous mans hat instead stuart vowed to repay the insult which he did by capturing john popes best uniform coat at catletts station stuart offered to exchange the hat for the coat but pope a humorless man refused the offer the unfortunate toombs meanwhile was placed under arrest popes notorious general orders numbers five and seven were issued and unsurprisingly were regarded by many northern soldiers as licenses to steal they also offended robert lee grievously which is why he was so intent on destroying pope he did after the second battle of manassas bull run to northerners pope was never to hold high command again the battle is not as well known as it deserves to be jacksons flank march was a fine achievement and lees strategy thoroughly confused a pedantic northern command the train crashes at bristoe station and the sack of the federal depot at manassas all happened and the wounded civilians weary judgment on the improbable jackson oh my god lay me down did become a catchphrase in jacksons army lees victory might have been more complete had longstreet attacked on the day he arrived on popes unguarded flank rather than waiting a full twentyfour hours but the battle was still a notable southern victory and marked by at least one gruesome record the casualty rate in the th new york zouaves was the greatest in a single regiment on a single day in the whole war men entered the fight were wounded and killed a casualty rate of percent the reverend doctor winslow and his son both survived lees overall casualty rate was percent which to a country short of manpower was an ominous loss the battlefield is well preserved and a short drive from washington dc much of the ground is shared with the field of first manassas and the two share an informative visitor center where a pamphlet outlining a driving tour of the second battle is available one reason why second manassas is not as well known as it might be is that it is inevitably overshadowed by the events that followed the north has just seen its latest invasion of the confederate states of america trounced and now lee will try to exploit that victory by leading the first confederate invasion of the united states of america his army will march to the banks of the antietam creek in maryland and there not three weeks after fighting each other on the bull run the two armies will contest the bloodiest day in all american history it seems that starbuck and his men must march again
