macdonald jd criminal law attorney to cameron and the joy he brings prologue within the course of a week spanning march and april a serious untoward event in the health of three strangers two of whom lost their lives was destined to impact the lives of hundreds even thousands of people in a complicated web of causality the victims had no premonition of their individual tragedies though they were all generally healthy married men of similar ages they were engaged in totally different occupations and each had absolutely no knowledge of the others either socially or through business one was a caucasian physician who experienced a painful and debilitating athletic injury the second an africanamerican computer programmer who contracted a fulminant and rapidly fatal nosocomial postoperative infection and the third was an asianamerican accountant who suffered a ruthless executionstyle death like most people dr jack stapleton never truly appreciated the anatomical and physiological marvel of his knees until they gave out on the evening of march hed been at work as a forensic pathologist at the office of the chief medical examiner or ocme since early that morning hed commuted to and from the ocme on his beloved cannondale mountain bike without once acknowledging the contributions of his knees during the rest of the morning hed done three autopsies one of which was a complicated affair involving painstaking dissection of the tracks of multiple gunshot wounds in total hed been on his feet in the autopsy room colloquially referred to as the pit more than four hours moving by reflex to aid him in his work never once did he think about his knees and the effort expended by their various ligaments which faithfully maintained the integrity of the joints despite the considerable stresses placed on them and by the menisci which cushioned the substantial pressure exerted by the distal ends of the femurs or thighbones on the tops of the tibias or shinbones it was later toward the end of one of jacks almost nightly runs on the illuminated neighborhood basketball court that disaster struck to jacks chagrin he and several of the best players with whom hed teamed up for the evening including his friends warren and flash had not won a single game requiring them to sit out for frustratingly long periods of time before getting back in the action as the evening dragged on jack didnt need warren to remind him that he had been responsible for several of the losses by either missing easy shots or losing the ball yet warren ragged on him mercilessly jack couldnt say it wasnt deserved at the end of one game with the score tied jack had utterly embarrassed himself losing the ball and ultimately the game by dribbling off his own foot the real calamity occurred toward the end of the final game when jack took a long inbounds pass from warren with the final game again tied and the next basket to determine the outcome jack was intent on redeeming himself to his delight on what he hoped would be the final play there was only one person between him and the basket his name was spit in reference to one of his less endearing habits but more important from jacks perspective he was tall and lanky and hard put to keep up with jacks quickness money warren called out from the opponents end of the court fully expecting jack to leave spit in the dust for an easy layup after a convincing head fake to the left augmented by a rapid crossdribble jack initiated a drive to his right it began with his right leg lifting from the pavement and the right knee rapidly flexing and then extending as soon as his foot slammed down and planted itself on the macadam jack twisted his torso to the left to go around spit who was still recovering from the head fake and the crossdribble with jacks left foot now off the pavement his entire weight was transferred to his partially flexed right knee which also had to deal with the sudden counterclockwise torsion if jack had stopped to calculate the forces acting on his fiftytwoyearold knee he might have thought twice about what he was asking his heretoforefaithful anatomy to withstand although his lateral ligaments held since they effectively distributed the forces along their comparatively sizable width the situation was different for the anterior cruciate ligament which had lengthened slightly over the years as jack had aged vainly the relatively narrow band of tissue which most people referred to as gristle when encountered in a leg of lamb but which jack knew as collagen tried to keep the femur from dislocating backward from the tibia unfortunately the involved forces overwhelmed the ligament and with a popping sound it literally ripped apart and briefly allowed jacks femur to dislocate out of its socket tearing the delicate leading edges of both menisci in the process jacks right leg crumbled hurling him onto the roughsurfaced pavement where he skidded forward a few feet leaving a significant amount of skin behind one instant he was a coordinated mass of goaldirected muscle and bone the next a bruised and abraded heap prostrate on the ground wincing in pain while clutching his knee jack wasnt one hundred percent certain of what had happened but he had an idea all he could do was hope he was wrong man youre going from bad to worse warren said after hed sprinted over and assured himself that jack was basically okay warrens tone reflected half sympathy half disgust he straightened up and thrust his hands on his hips glaring down at his injured friend maybe youre getting too old for this doc you know what im saying sorry jack managed he felt embarrassed since everyone was looking at him are you done tonight or what warren questioned jack shrugged the pain had peaked then lessened considerably giving him a false sense of hope gingerly he got to his feet and gradually put weight on the injured joint he shrugged again and took a few tentative steps it doesnt feel that bad he announced as he assessed the abrasions on his left elbow and knee then he tried yet another couple of steps which seemed okay until he twisted himself to the left at that point the joint again briefly dislocated causing jack to revisit the pavement for a second time he struggled to his feet im done he remarked with equal resignation and regret im really done clearly this isnt a simple sprain like most people david jeffries had never truly appreciated the molecular marvel that bacteria represented nor the fact that whether an infection once started would be contained or spread depended on the outcome of an epic molecular battle waged between the bacterias virulence factors and the human bodys defense mechanisms he also had never truly appreciated the threat that bacteria continued to pose despite the extensive pharmacopoeia of antibiotics available to the modern physician he had been aware that bacteria were responsible for terrible scourges in the past including the black plague but that had been in the past he certainly hadnt worried about bacteria the way he worried about viruses such as hn bird flu ebola or the virus that causes aids whose threat was continually hyped by the media besides david had been vaguely aware there were socalled good bacteria that helped to make things like cheese and yogurt so when he had entered angels orthopedic hospital early one monday morning in to have his anterior cruciate ligament repaired with a cadaver graft bacteria werent one of his concerns what he had worried about was the anesthesia and not waking up after the operation was over he had also worried about the possibility hed go through the whole ordeal which a buddy had confided was painful and it wouldnt work meaning he wouldnt be able to get back to the tennis he loved as a computer programmer for a highflying manhattanbased software company david had spent as he put it a lot of hours on his butt shackled to his monitor being an athletically inclined individual from as early as he could remember he needed competitive exercise and tennis was his thing up until his injury a month prior to his surgery hed played at least four times a week hed even vainly tried to interest his two preteen sons in the game as for his injury he had no idea how it had happened hed always kept himself in good shape all he had remembered about the event was charging the net after making what he thought had been a good lead shot unfortunately his shot had not been as good as he had hoped and his opponent had followed up with a wellplaced return to davids left on the run david had planted his leading foot and twisted left to try to get to the ball but he never got near it instead he had found himself on the ground clutching a painful knee that had immediately begun to swell dramatically considering davids fulminant postoperative course one certainly could say that he should have been more respectful of bacteria within hours of his surgery relatively small numbers of staphylococci which had found their way into davids knee and the distal bronchioles of his lungs began their molecular magic staphylococcus is a common type of bacterium at any given time two billion people a third of the worlds population have them commensally residing inside their nares andor in moist locations on their skin indeed david was so colonized but the species that had gotten inside davids body was not from his flora but was rather a particular strain of staphylococcus aureus that had taken advantage of the ease with which staphylococci exchange genetic information to enhance their virulence and hence competitive advantage not only did this particular subspecies resist penicillinlike antibiotics it also carried the genes for a host of nasty molecules some of which helped the invading bacteria adhere to the cells that lined davids smallest capillaries while others actually destroyed the defensive cells that davids body sent to deal with the developing infection with davids cellular defenses crippled the invading bacterias growth rapidly became exponential reaching in hours a secretory stage at this point a group of other genes in this particular staphylococcus genome switched on allowing the microorganisms to spew out a library of even more vicious molecules called toxins these toxins began to wreak havoc inside davids body including causing what is commonly referred to as the flesheating effect as well as the symptoms and signs referred to as toxic shock syndrome david was first made aware of the gathering storm by a slight fever which developed six hours after his surgery well before the invading bacteria reached the secretory stage david didnt give the rise in temperature much thought nor did the nurses aide who duly recorded it in his digital record next he noticed what he described as tightness in his chest with his narcotic pain medicine onboard the administration of which he was able to adjust himself he didnt complain he thought these early symptoms were par for the course until his breathing became labored and he coughed up bloodtinged mucus suddenly it was as if he couldnt quite catch his breath at that point he became truly concerned his anxieties ratcheted up when he called attention to his worsening condition and the nurses responded by erupting in a flurry of anxious activity as blood cultures were drawn antibiotics were added to his iv and frantic calls were made about a possible emergency transfer to the university hospital david hesitantly questioned if he was going to be all right youll be fine one of the nurses said reflexively but that reassurance notwithstanding david died several hours later of overwhelming sepsis and multiorgan failure while en route to a fullservice general hospital like most people paul yang never truly worried about his ultimate fate yet he should have particularly around the time that david jeffries was losing his molecular battle with bacteria similar to other fellow human beings cursed by the knowledge of their mortality paul didnt dwell on the harsh reality of death even with the nagging reminder of progressively aging at a gradually quickening pace at age fiftyone he had too many more immediate concerns such as his family which included a spendthrift wife who was never materially satisfied two children in college and another soon to follow and a large suburban house with a commensurate mortgage and the constant need of major repair as if all that wasnt enough over the last three months his job had been driving him to distraction five years previously paul had given up a comfortable yet predictable and somewhat boring job at an established fortune firm to be the chief and only accountant for a promising new startup company proposing to build and run private forprofit specialty hospitals he had been aggressively recruited by his former boss who had earlier been recruited to be the startups cfo by a brilliant woman doctor named angela dawson who was just finishing her mba at columbia university the decision to switch jobs had been agonizing for paul since he was not a gambler by nature but his growing need for disposable income and the chance to make it big in the rapidly growing trilliondollar healthcare industry trumped the uncertainties and the associated risks remarkably everything had gone according to plan for angels healthcare lcc thanks to dr angela dawsons innate business acumen with the stock warrants and options paul controlled he was within weeks of becoming rich along with the other founders the angel investors and to a lesser extent the more than five hundred physician equity owners the closing of an ipo was just around the corner and due to a terrifically successful recent road show that had institutional investors drooling the stock price was just about set at the upper limits of everyones expectations with an anticipated five hundred million dollars to be raised on the first goround paul should have been on cloud nine but he wasnt he was more anxious than hed been in his entire life because he was ensnared in an epic ethical dilemma exacerbated by the series of recent corporate accounting scandals including that at enron which had rocked the financial world during the previous six or seven years the fact that he had not cooked the books was not a consolation he religiously adhered to gaap generally accepted accounting procedures and was confident that his books were accurate to the penny the problem was that he didnt want anyone outside of the founders to see the books specifically because they were accurate and therefore clearly reflected a major negativecashflow situation the problem had started three and a half months previously just after the independent audit had been completed for the ipo prospectus it began as a mere trickle but rapidly mushroomed into a torrent pauls dilemma was that he was supposed to report the shortfall not just to his cfo which he certainly did but also to the securities and exchange commission the trouble was as the cfo quickly pointed out such reporting would undoubtedly kill the ipo which would mean that all their strenuous effort over almost a year would go down the drain perhaps along with the future of the company the cfo and even dr dawson herself had reminded paul that the unexpected burn rate was a mere quirk and obviously temporary since the cause was being adequately redressed although paul acknowledged that everything he was being told was probably true he knew his not reporting definitely violated the law forced to choose between his innate sense of ethics and a combination of personal ambition and his familys insatiable need for cash the conflict was driving him crazy in fact it had driven him back to drink a problem hed overcome years ago but that the current situation had reawakened yet he was confident the drinking wasnt completely out of control since it was restricted to having several cocktails prior to boarding the commuter train on his way home to new jersey there had been no allnight binges and partying with ladies of the night which had been a problem in the past on the evening of april he stopped into his designated watering hole en route to the train station and while sipping his third vodka martini and staring at himself in the smoky mirror behind the bar he suddenly decided he would file the required report the following day hed been flipflopping for days but all at once he thought maybe he could have his cake and eat it too in his mildly inebriated state he reasoned that it was now so close to the ipo closing that maybe the report would sit around at the bureaucratic sec and not get to the investors in time that way hed have assuaged his conscience and he hoped not killed the ipo feeling a sudden euphoria at having made a decision even if he would change his mind overnight paul rewarded himself with a fourth cocktail pauls final vodka seemed more pleasurable than the previous but it might have been the reason he did something an hour later that he normally would not have done weaving slightly while walking home from the train station he allowed himself to be approached a few doors away from his house and to be engaged in conversation with two nattily dressed yet vaguely unnerving men who had emerged from a large vintage black cadillac mr paul yang one of the men had questioned in a raspy voice paul stopped which was his first mistake yes he responded which was his second mistake he should have just kept walking coming to such a sudden halt he had to sway slightly to maintain his balance and he blinked a few times to try to sharpen his mildly blurry vision the two men appeared about the same age and height with hatchetlike faces deeply set eyes and dark hair carefully slicked back from their foreheads one of the men had considerable facial scarring it was the other man who spoke would you be so kind as to afford us a moment of your time the man asked i suppose paul responded surprised by the disconnect between the gracious syntax of the request and the heavy new york accent sorry to delay you the man continued im certain you are eager to get home paul turned his head and glanced at his front door he was mildly discomfited that the strangers knew where he lived my name is franco ponti the man added and this gentlemans name is angelo facciolo paul looked briefly at the man with the unfortunate scarring it appeared as if he didnt have eyebrows which gave him an otherworldly appearance in the halflight we work for mr vinnie dominick i dont believe you are acquainted with this individual paul nodded he had never met a mr vinnie dominick as far as he knew i have been given permission by mr dominick to tell you something financially significant about angels healthcare that no one at the company knows franco continued in return for this information which mr dominick is certain will be interesting to you he only asks that you respect his privacy and not tell anyone else is that a deal paul tried to think but under the circumstances it was difficult yet as angels healthcares chief accountant he was curious about any socalled significant financial information okay paul said finally now i have to warn you that mr dominick takes people at their word and it would be serious if you dont honor your pledge do you understand i suppose paul said he had to take a sudden step back to maintain his balance mr vinnie dominick is angels healthcares angel investor wow paul said in his position as accountant he knew that there was an angel investor to the tune of fifteen million dollars whose name no one knew on top of that the same individual recently provided a quarterofamilliondollar bridge loan to cover the current shortfall from the companys perspective and pauls mr dominick was a hero now mr dominick has a favor to ask he would like to meet with you for a few moments without the knowledge of the principals of angels healthcare he told me to say that he is concerned the principals of the company are not following the letter of the law now im not sure what that means but he said you would paul nodded again as he tried to clear his alcoholaddled brain here was the issue hed been struggling with solo for weeks and suddenly he was being offered unexpected support he cleared his throat and asked when would he like to meet paul bent down to try to see into the interior of the black sedan but he couldnt right now franco said mr dominick has a yacht moored in hoboken we can have you there in fifteen minutes you can have your talk and then well bring you back to your door it will be an hour at most hoboken paul questioned wishing he had skipped the cocktails it seemed to be getting harder and harder to think for a second he couldnt even remember where hoboken was well be there in fifteen minutes franco repeated paul wasnt wild about the idea and hated being put on the spot he was a bean counter who liked to deal with numbers not hasty value judgments particularly when suffering a buzz under normal circumstances paul would have never gotten into a car at night with total strangers for an evening meeting on a yacht with a man hed never met but in his current muddle and with the prospect of being abetted in his business decisionmaking by such an important player as vinnie dominick he couldnt resist with a final nod he took a wobbly step toward the open car door angelo helped by taking pauls laptop and handing it back to him when paul was settled there was no conversation as they drove back in the direction of new york franco and angelo sat in the front seat and from pauls vantage point in the back their heads were dark motionless twodimensional cutouts against the glare of the oncoming traffic paul glanced out the side window and wondered if he should have at least gone into his house to let his wife know what he was doing he sighed and tried to look on the bright side although the interior of the car reeked of cigarettes neither franco nor angelo lit up paul was at least thankful for that the marina was dark and deserted franco drove directly to the base of the main pier and all three got out since it was offseason most of the boats were out of the water standing on blocks and covered with white shroudlike vinyl covers there was no conversation as the group walked down the pier the cold air revived paul to a degree he took in the nighttime beauty of the new york city skyline marred by the fact that in the foreground the hudson river looked more like crude oil than water the gentle waves made soft lapping sounds against the pilings and the refusestrewn shoreline a slight odor of dead fish wafted in the breeze paul questioned the rationality of what he was doing but felt it was too late to change his mind halfway out the pier they stopped at the mahogany stern of an impressive yacht with the name full speed ahead stenciled in gold letters across it the lights were ablaze in the main saloon but no one could be seen a row of fishing rods stuck out of cylindrical holders along the afterdecks gunwales like bristles on the back of a giant insect franco boarded and immediately scampered up a starboard ships ladder and disappeared from view wheres mr dominick paul asked angelo pauls unease ticked upward without seeing the investor youll be chatting with him in two minutes angelo reassured him while gesturing for paul to follow franco across the narrow gangplank with resignation paul did as he was told once on board paul had to steady himself as the large craft moved up and down with the gentle swells the next surprise was that franco started the engines which let out a deep powerful throaty roar at the same time angelo quickly dealt with the mooring lines and pulled in the gangway it was obvious that the two men were accustomed to running the craft pauls unease again ratcheted upward he had assumed his supposedly short meeting with mr dominick would take place while the boat was moored as the craft eased out of its slip paul briefly contemplated leaping off the moving boat onto the dock but his natural indecision allowed the opportunity to pass after four martinis he doubted he could have managed it even if he had decided to try especially clutching his laptop case paul peered through the windows into the main saloon in hopes of seeing his missing host he made his way over to the door and turned the handle it opened he glanced back at angelo who was busy coiling the heavy mooring lines next to several stacked cinder blocks angelo gestured for him to go inside the gradually increasing roar of the diesels made conversation difficult once the door was closed behind him paul was relieved that most of the engine noise vanished although not the vibration the decor of the yacht was tastelessly glitzy there was a large flatscreen tv with lazboy recliners grouped in front a gaming table with chairs a large lshaped couch and an impressively stocked bar he walked across the room and glanced down a few steps into the galley area beyond which was a passageway with several closed doors paul presumed they were staterooms mr dominick paul called out there was no answer paul steadied himself as he felt the engines accelerate and the boats angle of elevation increase before quickly flattening out he glanced out the window the boat had picked up speed a sudden roar turned pauls attention back to the door leading to the afterdeck angelo had come inside and he approached paul after pulling the door closed behind him in full light paul was taken aback by the extent of the mans facial scarring not only didnt he have eyebrows he didnt even have eyelashes even more startling his abnormally thin lips were retracted back to the extent that they gave the impression they could not completely close over his yellowed teeth mr dominick angelo announced extending paul a cell phone flipped open suppressing a sudden flash of resentment with the absurdity of the situation paul snatched the phone from angelo he plopped his laptop case onto the game table sat down and put the phone to his ear while watching angelo drape himself sideways across the arms of one of the lazboys mr dominick paul snapped with the intention of expressing his irritation and frustration of having been tricked into talking on a cell phone something that could have been done just as well from the backseat of the car he also intended to say that he wasnt happy about having a confidential conversation within earshot of angelo who made no motion to leave listen my good friend vinnie interrupted why dont you call me vinnie seeing as though you and me might have to work together to straighten things out at angels healthcare and before i say anything else about that i want to apologize for not being there in person that had been the plan but i had an urgent business problem that needed my immediate attention i hope you will forgive me i suppose paul began but vinnie again interrupted i trust that franco and angelo have been treating you with appropriate hospitality since im not there to do it myself the plan was for them to pick me up at the pier at the jacob javits center but im stuck here in queens tell me have they offered you a drink no but i dont need a drink paul lied he was dying for a stiff drink what i would like is to be brought back to the marina you and i can talk on the way ive already told franco and angelo to bring you back vinnie said meantime lets you and i get down to business i trust that you are now aware of the extent of my interest in angels healthcare i am indeed and thank you angels healthcare wouldnt be where it is without your generosity generosity has nothing to do with my involvement it is strictly business serious business i might add of course paul said quickly as a director through a proxy ive heard rumors there is a serious problem with shortterm cash flow is there truth to these rumors before i answer paul said looking over at angelo as he nonchalantly picked at his fingernails one of your men is sitting here within earshot is that appropriate absolutely vinnie said without hesitation franco and angelo are like family in that case i have to admit the rumors are true there is a very serious cashflow problem pauls voice had an uncharacteristic lisp as if his tongue was swollen and ive also been told that sec rules require that such a material change in the companys fiscal situation must be reported within a stipulated time frame that is also true paul admitted guiltily the required form is called an eightk and should be filed within four days and ive been further informed that this required form has not been filed once again you are correct paul confessed the form has been composed but not filed i was told not to file it by my boss the cfo how is it normally filed electronically online paul said he glanced out the window wondering why they had not changed course he felt slightly dizzy and his stomach was doing flipflops just so i understand since this report has not been filed we are in violation of sec rules yes paul said reluctantly the fact that he had been told not to file it did not resolve him of responsibility the new sarbanesoxley rules made that very clear he glanced at angelo whose presence still bothered him considering the nature of the conversation and despite mr dominicks assurances it has also been pointed out to me that not filing in a timely fashion could be considered a felony which leads me to ask if you plan to file so that neither of us are considered accessories im going to have one more talk with my boss tomorrow no matter what im going to take it upon myself to file so the answer is yes well thats a relief vinnie said where exactly is the file its here in my laptop anyplace else its on a usb drive my secretary has it paul said he felt the engine vibrations slacken looking back out the window he could see they had slowed down is there some particular reason for her having it just for a backup obviously my boss and i have not seen eye to eye on this issue and the laptop actually belongs to the company im certainly glad we had this talk vinnie said because it appears that you and me see eye to eye i want to thank you for having a moral compass we got to do the right thing even if it means temporarily delaying the ipo by the way whats your secretarys name amy lucas is she loyal absolutely where does amy live someplace in new jersey what does she look like paul rolled his eyes he had to think shes very petite with pixielike features she looks much younger than she is i suppose the most notable thing about her is her hair right now it is blond with limegreen highlights id say that is unique does she know what is on the digital storage device she does paul said aware the engines had come to a near stop through the window he could see from the distant lights along the shore that they had essentially come to a stop looking out the other direction he could see the illuminated statue of liberty was there anyone else involved in either preparing the eightk or just knowledge of its existence i dont want to worry about some wouldbe whistleblower who might be in the process of filing the damn thing before you do in order to get a few bucks claiming it wasnt going to be filed no one that i know paul said the cfo could have told somebody but i doubt it he was very clear he didnt want the information to get out terrific vinnie said mr dominick paul said i think you will have to talk to your men again about getting me back to the marina what vinnie questioned with exaggerated disbelief let me talk to one of those lumpheads paul was about to call out to angelo and give him the phone when franco noisily descended as if on cue from the bridge deck and approached paul with his hand outstretched paul was surprised at the timing it seemed that franco might have been listening in on the conversation while franco stepped away to talk angelo stood up he couldnt have been happier about the prospect of heading back to the marina even though he had to make frequent trips on the full speed ahead he had never become accustomed to being on the boat it was always at night and usually to pick up drugs from ships coming from mexico or south america the problem was that he couldnt swim and being out on the water particularly in the darkness made him more than uneasy what he needed at the moment was a stiff drink at the bar angelo took out an oldfashioned glass and poured himself a knuckle of scotch in the background he could hear franco on the phone repeating over and over yeah and okay and sure as though he was talking to his mother angelo tossed down the drink and faced back around into the room at the moment franco said consider it done and flipped the cell phone closed time to get you home franco said to paul its about time paul grumbled finally angelo silently mouthed as he slipped his hand under his jackets lapel and allowed his fingers to close around the butt of his shoulderholstered walther tph semiautomatic april pm at age thirtyseven angela dawson was no stranger to adversity and anguish despite having grown up in an uppermiddleclass family in the affluent suburb of englewood new jersey where she had enjoyed all the associated material advantages including the benefit of an extensive ivy league education armed with both md and mba degrees as well as excellent health her life on this early april night in the middle of new york city should have been relatively carefree especially considering that she had every advantage of a wealthy lifestyle at her fingertips including a fabulous city apartment and a stunning seaside house on marthas vineyard but such was not the case instead angela was facing the biggest challenge of her life and suffering significant anxiety and distress in the process angels healthcare llc which she had founded and nurtured during the previous five years was teetering on the edge of either mindnumbing success or utter failure and its outcome was to be decided in the next few weeks the outcome rested squarely on her shoulders as if such an enormous challenge was not enough angelas tenyearold daughter michelle calabrese was having a crisis of her own and while angelas cfo and coo the presidents of angels healthcares three hospitals and the recently hired infectioncontrol specialist waited impatiently in the boardroom down the hall angela had to deal with michelle with whom shed been talking on the phone for more than fifteen minutes im sorry honey angela said struggling to keep her voice calm yet firm the answer is no we have discussed it ive thought about it but the answer is no thats spelled no but mom michelle whined all the girls have them thats hard to believe you and your friends are only ten years old and in the fifth grade im sure many parents feel the same as i do dad said i could you are so mean maybe i should go live with him angela gritted her teeth and resisted the temptation to respond to her daughters hurtful comment instead she swiveled in her chair and glanced out the window of her corner office angels healthcare was located on the twentysecond floor of the trump tower on fifth avenue her private office faced both south and west with her desk oriented to the north at the moment she was looking south down the length of fifth avenue chockablock with traffic the receding red taillights appeared like a thousand radiant rubies she knew her daughter was responding to her own anger about life with divorced parents and was trying to use angela to get her way unfortunately such hurtful comments about her exhusband had worked several times in the past and had gotten angela furious but angela was determined to try to keep it from happening especially under the strain she was she had to keep herself calm for her upcoming meeting parenting and running a multimilliondollar business were often at odds and she had to keep them separate mom are you still there michelle questioned she knew shed crossed the line and already regretted her comment there was no way she wanted to live with her father and all his crazy girlfriends im still here angela said she swung back around to face her sparsely furnished modern office but i did not like your last comment one bit but you are being unfair i mean you let me pierce my ears ears are one thing but bellybutton rings are something else entirely but i dont want to talk about it anymore at least at the moment have you had supper yeah michelle said dejectedly haydee made paella thank god for haydee angela thought haydee figueredo was a gracious colombian woman angela had hired as a livein nanny right after angela had separated from her husband michael calabrese michelle was only three at the time and angela was six months away from finishing her internal medicine residency haydee had been like a gift from heaven when are you coming home michelle asked not for a couple of hours angela said im going into an important meeting you always say that about meetings maybe i do but this one is more important than most do you have homework is the sky blue michelle said superciliously angela wasnt happy about the disrespect michelles comment and tone suggested but she let it go if you need any help with any of your subjects ill help you when i get home i think ill be asleep really why so early i have to get up early for the field trip to the cloisters oh yes i forgot angela said with an exaggerated grimace she hated to forget events that were important to her daughter if you are asleep when i get home ill sneak in give you a kiss and then ill see you in the morning okay mom despite the conversations earlier tone mother and daughter exchanged heartfelt endearments before disconnecting for a few moments angela sat at her desk but the phone conversation with her daughter had reminded her of a time and an episode that had been equally as challenging and distressing as the current situation it had been when she had to deal with both divorce proceedings and the bankruptcy of her innercity primarycare practice and the fact that she had survived them gave her confidence in her current circumstance with slightly more optimism than she had had earlier that afternoon angela pushed back from her desk picked up her notes and emerged from her office she was surprised to see her secretary loren stasin sitting dutifully at her desk angela had not given the woman a thought over the previous three hours why are you still here angela questioned with a touch of guilt loren shrugged her narrow shoulders i thought you might need me heavens no go on home ill see you in the morning do i need to remind you of your meeting tomorrow morning at the manhattan bank and trust followed by your meeting with mr calabrese at his office hardly angela said but thank you anyway now you get out of here thank you dr dawson loren said while surreptitiously putting away a novel angela continued down the stark interior hallway for a multitude of reasons she wasnt looking forward to tomorrows meetings she always found it somewhat demeaning to try to raise money and now in such a desperate situation it would be that much more humiliating even worse was that one of the people she would be asking for money was her exhusband whenever she met with him regardless of the reason it almost never failed to evoke all the emotional turmoil of the divorce not to mention the vexation she felt toward herself for having married him in the first place she should have known better there had been too many subtle suggestions that he would turn out like her father challenged by her success to the point of encouraging bad behavior at the closed door to the boardroom angela paused took a fortifying breath then entered similar to her private office the interior was aseptically modern and dominated by a striking central table composed of a twoinchthick piece of glass placed on the top of a white marble ionic capital the floor was white marble tile each of the side walls to the right and left had imbedded flatscreen television monitors for powerpoint presentations the far wall was glass overlooking fifth avenue the gilded and illuminated top of the landmark crown building immediately across the street filled the starkly modern room with a reflected warm glow the round table had been angelas idea her management style emphasized teamwork rather than hierarchy and the round table was more egalitarian than the usual boardroom fare although there were chairs for sixteen people only six were occupied at the moment the cfo was by himself at the opposite end his back to the window the three hospital presidents were to angelas left the coo was a few chairs away from the cfo to angelas right the infectioncontrol professional was next to the coo purposefully none of the department heads of angels healthcare such as those from supply laundry engineering housekeeping public relations personnel laboratory services and nursing medical staff or outside members of the board were present in fact none had even been notified that the meeting was scheduled much less invited angela smiled cordially as she quickly glanced around at individual faces and acknowledged each person the expressions were mildly apprehensive except for cfo bob frampton whose fleshy face had an everpresent sleepdeprived appearance and for coo carl palanco who looked to be in a state of continual surprise good evening everyone angela said as she sat down she again glanced around the room first let me apologize for keeping you waiting i know it is late and you are eager to get home to your families so we will make this short the good news is that we are still in business angela glanced at the three presidents all of whom nodded in a restrained fashion the bad news is that our cashflow problem has gone from concerning to critical of course we felt the situation was critical a month ago but it has gotten worse angela gestured toward bob frampton who shook his head slightly as if to wake himself he leaned forward putting his elbows on the table with his beefy hands together and fingers interlocked we are rapidly approaching if not violating our eighty percent margin on our loans with the manhattan bank and trust we had to sell some bonds to make a payment to our cardiac stent provider they were threatening to cut off our supply considering how tight finances are i want to personally thank you for doing that dr niesha patrick said she was a young africanamerican woman with light skin and a scattering of freckles in a butterfly pattern across her nose and cheeks like angela she had an mba in addition to an md angela had recruited her from a large west coast managedcare company to run angels heart hospital with our ors intermittently closed our only dependable source of income has been from invasive angiography and cardioplasty without stents even that revenue would be severely impacted invasive angiography and lasik have probably been responsible for keeping us afloat angela said she nodded in appreciation toward both niesha and dr stewart sullivan stewart was the president of angels cosmetic surgery and eye hospital we are all doing what we can stewart said as much of a gold mine specialty hospitals are in the current reimbursement milieu angela said they are at a particular disadvantage when their operating rooms close but the operating rooms are now all open dr cynthia sarpoulus said defensively cynthia was a medicalschool classmate of angelas whod gone on to specialize in infectious disease and epidemiology angela had hired her when the current nosocomial infection problem started three and a half months previously cynthia was a darkcomplected ravenhaired woman with a bit of a temper angela had been willing to put up with her thinskinned and often caustic style because of her training dedication intelligence and reputation shed been the reputed savior of several institutions with infectioncontrol problems they might be open but they arent being utilized except by a fraction of our medical staff dr herman straus said angela had recruited herman from a boston community hospital where hed been a wellrespected assistant administrator a big athletic man with an outgoing personality he had a particular affinity for dealing with orthopedic surgeons that quality combined with his cornell hospital administration training made him an ideal president of angels orthopedic hospital and his record was proof of it and why is that angela asked surely they know we have been on top of this problem right from the beginning cynthia remind everyone what has been done just about everything possible cynthia snapped as if she was being challenged every or has been cleaned with sodium hypochlorite and fumigated at least once with a product called navco its a nonflammable alcohol vapor in carbon dioxide and not without considerable expense bob interjected and why that particular agent carl questioned because methicillinresistant staphylococcus aureus or its more common designation mrsa is highly sensitive to that particular preparation cynthia shot back as if it were a fact everyone should know lets not get testy angela said she wanted to keep the meeting friendly and she hoped productive we are all on the same page here no one is casting aspersions what else has been done every hospital room that has seen an infection has also been similarly treated cynthia said more important perhaps as you all know every member of the medical staff and every employee of the hospitals are cultured on a recurrent basis and those who test positive as a carrier are treated with mupirocin until they test negative also at great expense bob added please bob angela said we are all aware of the expense side to this disaster cynthia continue do you think culturing and treating the staff and employees is critical absolutely cynthia said and we might consider the same for patients as a prelude to admission both holland and finland had a particularly bad problem with mrsa and the way that they brought their problem under control was by treating both staff and patients anyone who tested positive as a carrier im beginning to wonder if we might have to do the same thing yet my real concern is that the mrsa is occurring at all three of our hospitals what does that say it says that if a carrier is responsible then that carrier must routinely visit all three hospitals consequently i have as of today ordered the testing and treating of all employees from even here at the home office who regularly visit all three hospitals whether they have actual patient contact or not anything else angela asked we have mandated aggressive handwashing after each patient contact cynthia said particularly with the medical staff and nursing personnel weve also instituted strict isolation for all mrsa patients and more frequent changing of medical staff clothing such as white coats and scrub outfits we also require more alcohol cleaning after each use of routine equipment like blood pressure cuffs weve even cultured all the condensate pans of all the hvac air handlers in all three hospitals all have tested negative for pathogens especially the strain of staph that has been plaguing us in short we are doing everything possible then why havent the doctors been admitting patients bob questioned as they are all owners they have to be aware they are taking money from their own pockets by not doing so especially if we go bankrupt i dont want to hear that word angela said having already been through that demeaning experience its clear why they are not admitting stewart said they are terrified of their patients getting a postoperative infection despite all the infectioncontrol strategies with reimbursement solely based on drgs or diagnostically related groups patients getting a postoperative infection directly cuts down on their productivity and it is productivity that determines their income besides theres the malpractice worry several of our plastic surgeons and even two of our ophthalmologists are being sued over these recent staph infections so its pretty simple despite being equity owners it makes economic sense for them to go back to university or the manhattan general at least in the short run but all hospitals are having trouble with staph carl said particularly methicillinresistant staph and that includes both the university and the general yeah but not over the last three months nor at the rate we have been seeing it herman said and despite all these efforts that dr sarpoulus has been spearheading the problem has not run its course given that we at angels orthopedic had another case late today its a patient by the name of david jeffries oh no angela lamented i hadnt heard im crushed wed been spared for more than a week like all the previous cases were trying to keep it quiet herman said as i said it unfolded late this afternoon for a few moments silence reigned all eyes switched to cynthia the expressions ranged from anger to dismay to inquisitiveness how could this happen after all that cynthia had just told them was being done with considerable funds that they did not have it hasnt been confirmed it was methicillinresistant staph cynthia snapped defensively shed been called by the hospitals infectioncontrol committee chair and briefed on the case just prior to coming to the current meeting if you mean it hasnt been cultured youre right herman said but it was positive by our vitek system and my lab supervisor says shes never had a false positive false negatives yes but not false positives good lord angela said trying to keep her composure was the patient operated on today this morning herman said anterior cruciate ligament repair how is he doing or shouldnt i ask he died while being transferred to the university hospital for obvious reasons once it was clear he had septic shock he would have been far better treated over there good lord angela repeated she was devastated i hope you realize that was a bad decision sending two patients in as many days to a regular fullservice hospital raises the risk the media might get ahold of the story i can just see the headlines specialty hospital outsources critical patient that would be a pr nightmare for us and do what we are trying desperately to avoid negatively affect the ipo herman shrugged it wasnt my decision it was a medical decision it was out of my hands how has the jeffries family taken it angela asked about the way you would expect herman responded have you spoken with them personally i have what is your sense are they going to sue angela asked at this point damage control had to be a priority its too early to tell but i did what i was supposed to do i took responsibility on behalf of the hospital apologized profusely and told all the things we have been doing and will do to avoid a similar tragedy okay thats all you can do angela said more to reassure herself than herman she made a quick note ill inform our general counsel the sooner they get on it the better bob spoke up if there had to be another postoperative infection as tragic for everyone as it is its best the patient passed quickly the cost to us is considerably less which could be critical under the circumstances angela turned to cynthia find out if the procedure was in one of the operating rooms that had just been cleaned in any case see that it is again taken care of but dont shut the whole or and find out when all the involved personnel had been cultured and if any of them had been a carrier cynthia nodded isnt there some way we can get our physician owners to up the census bob asked it would be enormously helpful we have to have revenue i dont mind billing medicare in advance if it is only for a couple of weeks the three hospital presidents looked at one another to see who would speak it was herman who spoke up i dont think theres any way to increase census especially with this new mrsa case today i dont know how my colleagues feel but orthopods are very infectionadverse because bone and joint infections have a tendency to stay around for a long time and eat up a lot of the surgeons time even in the best of circumstances ive spoken about this issue with my chief of the medical staff hes the one who clued me in ive spoken with my chief of the medical staff niesha said i got essentially the same response ditto for me stewart added all surgeons are riskaverse when it comes to infections its probably too late in any case angela said trying to recover from this new blast of bad news but bobs question gets to the heart of the reason i called this meeting first i wanted you all to hear about everything dr sarpoulus has done concerning our mrsa problem of course i wasnt aware there had been a new case id truly hoped we were in the clear be that as it may we have to somehow weather the next few weeks angela then turned to cynthia angels healthcare thanks you for your continued efforts todays events notwithstanding now would you mind leaving us for our boring financial discussion cynthia didnt respond at first her coaldark eyes regarded angela briefly then swept around at the others without a word she pushed back from the table and left the room the door closed with a definitive thump for a moment no one spoke rather headstrong bob commented finally breaking the silence headstrong but dedicated carl said shes taken this whole problem and its persistence personally i bet she thinks we are going to talk about her negatively especially with this new case ill assure her tomorrowangela said but now lets get to the crux of the matter as you all know the closing of our ipo is two weeks away the trick is how we are going to get there without any wouldbe investor or sec official finding out about our ongoing cashflow disaster weve been lucky so far despite the malpractice suits were also lucky that the problem with the staph occurred after the external audit so its impact is not reflected in our ipo prospectus i know you have all made enormous personal sacrifices no one in the top echelon has taken any salary over the last two months and that includes me weve all maxed out our personal credit i thank you for that i can assure you we have begged and borrowed from all our investors to the maximum including a quarter of a million from our lead angel investor syndicate the irony of this desperate situation is that if the ipo goes as planned the underwriters have recently guaranteed us five hundred million dollars meaning we all will be rich and the company will be swimming in cash equally as important our three hospitals proposed for miami and our three hospitals proposed for los angeles will start construction we are poised to be the first specialty hospital company to go public after the lifting of the united states senate moratorium on specialty hospital construction and we are involved in all the most lucrative specialties the timing could not be more perfect the sky is the limit we just have to get there angela paused and engaged the eyes of each of the people in the room to make sure there was no dissent no one moved or spoke angela briefly glanced down at her notes there is no blame in this situation angela asserted none of our spreadsheets that we used for forecasting even worstcase scenarios predicted such a catastrophe where all our ors would shut down essentially simultaneously with revenue at near zero and fixed costs high the burn rate on our emergency capital was enough to leave us here in the home office breathless but you know all this and with your help we have survived weve limped along withholding payment to our suppliers until it was critical were continuing to do that but still it might not be enough bob tell everyone how much capital we would need to get us through the ipo id be very confident with two hundred thousand dollars bob said as the amount drops to zero so does my confidence two hundred thousand angela repeated with a sigh unfortunately thats a lot of money and im fresh out of ideas what it comes down to is whether any of you smart people have any suggestions from your perspective the main problem of course is that all of you will have to meet payroll and with a negative cash flow continuing that is getting more and more difficult unless we help you the trouble is all our cash accounts are drawn down what about withholding paying taxes stewart suggested its just two weeks bad idea bob said with hesitation payroll tax and withholding tax are paid by wire transfer if any of you or we hold it up the bank will know because we would have to instruct them to do so instructing the bank to not pay taxes would be an enormous red flag what about going back to our lead angel investor niesha suggested im going to try tomorrow angela said im not optimistic our placement agent who found the angel investor initially has already squeezed out a quarter of a million a month ago and at the time led me to believe that well was dry yet im still going to try what about a bridge loan from the bank stewart said they know about the ipo hell it will only be two weeks with the interest weve been paying on our loans theyve been making a fortune from us you are forgetting what i said at the outset bob said i got a call friday from our healthcare relationship manager at the bank he was disturbed that wed drawn down on facility by selling the bonds to pay our stent provider they are not all that happy with us at the moment if he called even part of our loan the game would be over angela looked from one person to another at that point everybody was looking down at their feet through the glass table all right she said when it was apparent no one had any other ideas im off to the bank and then our placement agent tomorrow ill do my best if anyone has any additional ideas ill have my cell phone at all times thank you all for coming there was a scraping sound as all the chairs save for angelas were pushed back on their teflontipped legs everyone filed out with most giving angelas shoulder a reassuring squeeze in the process for a few moments she stayed where she was staring out at the gilded conical roof of the crown building across the street while thinking about her companys predicament it didnt seem fair that after all her work and anxiety she and her nascent angels healthcare empire might be brought down by some lowly bacteria at the same time she wasnt surprised in the financial world whether it involved manufacturing lightbulbs or delivering healthcare fairness was at best an afterthought money was king and shed learned that lesson the hard way vainly trying to keep afloat her primarycare practice which saw more than its share of medicaid patients it was that wrenching experience of bankruptcy more than anything else that had driven her to business school where she had excelled as a kind of revenge and where she came to realize that medical care if approached correctly could make one not just financially comfortable but truly rich with a renewed sense of resolve angela pushed back her own chair and stood up she retrieved her coat and umbrella from her office but purposefully left the notes she was holding and her briefcase on her desk she planned to retrieve them in the morning before heading over to her first meeting of the day at the manhattan bank and trust she knew that in order to get a good nights sleep and be in top form on the morrow when shed need all her wits she had to make an active effort to clear her mind by doing so under similar stressful circumstances in the past she not only felt better the following day but often viewed problems from a different perspective and had new ideas it was as if her subconscious was an active participant in her decisionmaking on the corner of fifth avenue and th street angela stood a step away from the curb and raised her hand in an attempt to hail a cab well aware that cabs were hard to come by at eighttwentyfive in the evening especially on a drizzly earlyapril night since many of the citys taxi drivers were ending their shift most of the cabs she saw had their offduty lights on the others were occupied until the previous month angela had regularly used a car service but with the account seriously in arrears shed been reduced to taking cabs just when she was about to start walking to her th street apartment a taxi pulled up to discharge a passenger the moment the man paid and jumped out angela climbed in as the cab sped toward angelas destination she took a deep breath and let it out with a huff it was only then that she became conscious of her tenseness with her arms crossed in front of her she massaged the tips of her shoulders then did the same with her temples slowly she could feel her abdominal muscles and thigh muscles relax opening her eyes she took in the lights of the city reflected in the slick wet streets there were plenty of pedestrians out many arm in arm sharing umbrellas it was at such moments between the demands of the workday and the domestic concerns involving her daughter that angela was aware of the fact that she had no social life specifically with members of the opposite sex interacting with men was restricted to workrelated encounters the rare parents night at her daughters school or sadly enough with someone in the checkout line at the grocery store the fact that it was her choice both as a driven woman and as a woman whose experiences with men caused her to question their monogamous ability didnt lessen the occasional desire refusing to give the issue more thought she pulled out her cell phone and pressed the speeddial button for home expecting to hear her daughters voice since she usually answered before the completion of the first ring angela found herself talking with haydee the nannycummajordomo as busy as angelas life was she allowed haydee to fill multiple roles wheres the terror angela questioned the appellation the terror was the way angela and haydee humorously referred to michelle behind the girls back it was humorous because it was the opposite of what they felt both women thought michelle mildly and ageappropriately willful and occasionally argumentative as evidenced by the bellybuttonpiercing issue but otherwise near perfect shes in bed and i believe already asleep should i wake her heavens no angela said feeling a mild pang of loneliness surely not after a short conversation about various domestic issues angela made an impromptu decision she concluded the conversation by telling haydee not to wait up for her as she wouldnt be home for several more hours sliding forward on the seat angela spoke to the driver through the plexiglas partition instead of going home to a sleeping daughter shed decided to go to her health club with all that was going on shed not been there for months and certainly could use a workout for mental as much as physical reasons besides she reasoned there would be people around and on top of that she could get a bite to eat in the clubs surprisingly good restaurantbar angelas athletic club was close to her apartment a block over and a few blocks down columbus avenue she found her underused membership card without much difficulty in her overstuffed wallet in short order she changed into her workout clothes and took a turn on one of the stationary bikes while watching cnn she was dismayed at how out of shape she was within five minutes she was out of breath after ten minutes she was sweating to the extent that she feared she looked like a glass of iced tea in the tropics yet she persisted on sheer willpower until she had reached her twentyminute goal dismounting from the bike angela put her hands on her hips and stood with her chest heaving trying to catch her breath for a moment it took all her concentration on top of that she was drenched her hairband which in the past had been more of an affectation than a necessity was completely soaked she imagined she looked like a wreck with her face flushed her workout gear clinging to her body and her hair a veritable mop what was so embarrassing was that the people on the neighboring bikes were all riding with such apparent ease no one seemed to be perspiring and many were able to concentrate on reading as they pedaled angela knew there was no way she could have read anything during her workout especially toward the end she picked up her towel and dried her face feeling selfconscious about her lack of endurance and bedraggled appearance she quickly scanned the faces of the other riders as she set off toward the weight room luckily for her selfesteem no one paid her any heed until she briefly locked eyes with a blond man who was pedaling furiously yet hadnt broken a sweat the rapidity with which he looked away confirmed angelas concerns about her appearance as she passed behind him she had to smile at her paranoia in point of fact she didnt care what the stranger thought angela wandered around the weight room with no particular plan using the machines randomly she was careful not to use too much weight or do too many repetitions the last thing she wanted to do was pull a muscle or sprain a joint despite the hour the room was reasonably crowded she noticed how a number of the men were checking out the women while pretending they werent reminding her how shallow some men could be taking a pair of very light free weights she positioned herself in front of a mirror and began stretching more than exercising the muscles of her upper body while she continued she appraised herself and tried to be objective her figure was still quite good and hadnt significantly changed from how it had looked in her midtwenties obviously that was due far more to genes than to effort considering how seldom shed made it to the gym while shed nurtured angels healthcare her belly was flat despite her pregnancy her legs had good definition and her tush was firmer than she deserved all in all she was content with her appearance except for her hair angels healthcare had been embroiled in the current mrsainduced catastrophe only a month when she found a few stray gray hairs her mother had gone gray early so she shouldnt have been so surprised but it had bothered her to the extent that shed secretly gotten a rinse at the local pharmacy and used it several times although the gray had disappeared shed worried that some of her natural sheen had gone with it and now as she looked at it in the healthclub weight room mirror she was convinced angela suddenly made a brief but exaggerated expression of utter horror in the mirror as a way of mocking herself in the final analysis she was not a vain person accomplishment was what interested her not appearances are you all right a voice asked angela turned and looked up into the face of the blond man with whom shed briefly locked eyes in the room with the stationary bikes he was somewhere in his midforties reasonably handsome and probably equivalently intelligent he had bright blue eyes cropped hair and an insouciant engaging smile he was wearing a tshirt that said make my day im quite okay angela said after her brief assessment of the stranger why do you ask i thought there for a minute you were about to cry angela laughed heartily when shed made her mocking expression in the mirror shed momentarily forgotten she was in a room with a bunch of secretly attentive males why are you laughing really a minute ago while you were doing your curls you looked like you were about to break down in tears it would take too long to explain time is not a problem for me how about a drink after we finish our workouts and you can explain after that who knows with a wry smile angela regarded the man standing next to her it had been a while since she had experienced such a rapid unabashed comeon under normal circumstances she would have merely smiled and walked away in her current mood some repartee and companionship had an uncharacteristic appeal at least for an hour or so after all she was trying to clear her mind i dont know your name angela said knowing full well she was opening the proverbial door chet mcgovern and yours angela dawson tell me do you pick up women frequently here at the club all the time chet said actually it is the reason i come as often as i do the exercise itself is too much like work angela laughed again she appreciated both honesty and a sense of humor it seemed that chet mcgovern had both you can drink while i eat angela said im famished youve got a deal lady forty minutes later after the two had showered they sat across from each other in the combination barrestaurant the bar was packed behind the bar was a flatscreen tv televising a baseball game that everyone ignored the level of the background chatter was like a bunch of feeding seabirds angela was sensitive to the noise since she hadnt been in such an environment for years she had to lean forward over her grilled salmon salad to hear i asked what kind of work you do chet repeated you look like a model oh sure angela scoffed with comments like that she knew for certain she was with an individual who thought of himself as a pickup specialist really chet persisted what are you twentyfour or twentyfive thirtyseven actually angela said resisting the temptation to be sarcastic never would have guessed it not with a figure like you have angela merely smiled such comments were fun to hear even if less than sincere if not a model what kind of work do you do im a businesswoman angela said without elaborating and to turn the conversation away from herself she quickly added and how about you movie star it was chets turn to laugh then he leaned forward and said im a doctor then he sat back from angelas perspective hed assumed a decidedly selfsatisfied smile as if she was supposed to be impressed what kind of a doctor angela asked after a pause md or phd md and boardcertified whoopdedo angela thought sarcastically but didnt communicate as a businesswoman what do you actually do i suppose id have to admit i mostly spend my time trying to raise money as unpleasant as that is startup companies are like plants they constantly need water and sometimes it takes a lot of water before they bear fruit thats quite poetic how close is the company you work for away from bearing fruit very close actually were two weeks away from going public two weeks that must be very exciting right now its more anxietyproducing than exciting i need to raise about two hundred thousand dollars to shore up our liquidity to get to the ipo chet whistled through his teeth he was impressed and gathered that angela had to be a rather highlevel executive is the company going to be able to do it i try to be optimistic especially since the investmentbanking gurus promise the ipo will be a sellout maybe you as a boardcertified physician would like to invest we can certainly make it worth your while with interest or equity or both we do have a lot of physician investors more than five hundred to be exact really chet questioned what kind of company is it its called angels healthcare we build and run specialty hospitals i suppose that means you know something about doctors you could say that angela agreed sadly im not as liquid as id like at the moment chet said sorry no problem if you change your mind give us a call well chet voiced obviously wanting to change the subject are you single or married or somewhere in between back to the comeon angela thought all at once she didnt care to keep up her side of the conversation shed been amused but suddenly she felt tired which had been the goal she wanted to go home divorced she said and then added what she thought would be a turnoff im divorced and i live with my tenyearold daughter who is home sleeping i guess that rules out your apartment chet said im single very single actually and i have a terrific apartment just around the corner how about a nightcap and see your etchings i suppose sorry ive got both my daughter and the two hundred thousand dollars to think about angela waved to one of the waiters and motioned for the check ill take care of the check chet said magnanimously no you wont angela said with a voice that brooked no disagreement im afraid i used you in a way as penance i insist used me chet questioned with a confused expression what do you mean it would take much too long to explain and ive got to get home chet acted a tad desperate as angela signed the check to her house account how about dinner tomorrow night he suggested when shed finished thats very generous of you but im afraid i cant take the time im not sure what to expect at the office tomorrow but it would give you a chance to explain how you quote used me chet said i certainly dont feel used and ive truly enjoyed meeting you if ive offended you i apologize i promise i wont be so flippant its just an act mildly surprised at chets willingness to reveal what seemed to be vulnerability angela stuck out her hand as she got to her feet while shaking hands she said ive enjoyed your company i mean that maybe after the ipo we can have another drink or even a dinner id like that chet said regaining his aplomb and it will be my treat its a deal angela said knowing that now it was her turn to be the one less sincere april am listen dr jack stapleton said with uncamouflaged irritation im lucky to have gotten on dr wendell andersons schedule hell he does all the knees for all the highpriced athletes in the city there has to be a reason and the reason is hes obviously the best if i cancel for this thursday i might not get back on the schedule for months the man is that busy but you only tore your acl a week ago dr laurie montgomery said with equal emotion obviously im not an orthopedic surgeon but it stands to reason that operating on your knee which has been so recently traumatized is taking added risk for gods sake your knee is still twice its normal size and your abrasions havent completely healed the swelling has come down a lot jack said did the doctor suggest you have the surgery this quickly not exactly i told him i want it asap and he turned me over to his scheduling secretary oh great laurie said mockingly the date was set by a secretary she must know what shes doing jack contended shes been working with anderson for decades now thats an intelligent assumption laurie said with equal sarcasm another reason i dont want to cancel is that i was lucky enough to be assigned as andersons first case if i have to have surgery i want to be scheduled as the first case the surgeon is fresh the nurses are fresh everybodys fresh i remember when i was doing surgery back when i was practicing ophthalmology i would have wanted to be my own first case and where is this angels orthopedic hospital laurie questioned irritably she ignored jacks attempt at humor ive never even heard of it its north and not too far away from the university hospital on the upper east side its relatively new i dont know exactly when it opened but less than five years ago anderson told me for the patients its like checking in to the ritz which you can hardly say about either university or manhattan general he likes it because the doctors run the show not some bureaucratic administrator in the same amount of time they can do twice the number of cases damn it jack laurie complained she turned away and glanced out the side window of the taxi at the rainswept new york city streets to say that jack could be stubborn was putting it mildly and when she was irritated she considered bullheaded to be much closer to the truth when theyd first started working together as forensic pathologists at the office of the chief medical examiner for the city of new york shed thought his wild bike riding to and from work and his brutish outdoor basketball playing with kids half his age were somehow charming but now twelve years later and married to the man for less than a year she considered such risktaking behavior by a fiftytwoyearold to be juvenile and even irresponsible now that he had a wife and a hopedfor child to consider if truth be told she wanted to delay his surgery not only to reduce surgical risk but also because she couldnt help believe the longer he stayed away from commuting on his bike and street basketball the more chance hed give it up altogether i want to have my surgery thursday jack said as if reading her mind i need to get back to my normal exercise routine and i want an intact husband you could be killed carrying on the way you do theres lots of ways to be killed jack responded as medical examiners we both know that better than most put it off for a month laurie pleaded im having the surgery jack said its my knee its your knee but we are supposed to be a team now we are a team jack agreed lets drop the subject we can talk about it tonight if you insist jack gave lauries hand a squeeze and she squeezed back knowing jack as well as she did she took his willingness to suggest that they could bring the subject up again as a small victory when the traffic light changed at the corner of th street and first avenue the cabbie made a wide lefthand turn and pulled to the curb in front of a dated sixstory blueglazed brick building with aluminummullioned windows wedged between nyu medical center on one side and the bellevue complex on the other they had arrived at the office of the chief medical examiner or ocme where laurie had worked for sixteen years and jack twelve although jack was older forensic pathology had been a second medical career for him after a large hmo had gobbled up his private practice back when hmos were in their heyday somethings brewing jack commented ahead of them were several tv news vans parked at the curb interesting deaths attract reporters like honey attracts flies i wonder whats up i think of reporters more like vultures laurie commented as she got out curbside then reached back into the taxi to extract jacks lengthy and awkward crutches they feed on carrion are more destructive of evidence and can be a hell of a nuisance jack paid the driver while he gave laurie credit for a more apropos and clever simile out on the street he took the crutches got them poked into his armpits and started toward the stairs i hate taxis he murmured under his breath they make me feel so vulnerable thats a strong statement laurie scoffed coming from a person who thinks commuting on a bike and challenging the city traffic is appropriate as expected there were a halfdozen reporters in the ocme reception area busily chatting and feasting on takeout coffee and doughnuts several tv cameras were perched on the aged magazines on the coffee table the reporters briefly glanced at laurie and jack as they traversed the room jack could move quickly on the crutches since he could put weight on the injured knee without a lot of pain he could have done without the crutches but he didnt want to take any chance of reinjury marlene wilson the receptionist buzzed laurie and jack into the id room before any of the reporters recognized them within the id room were two groups of people occupying separate sides one group was six hispanicappearing individuals of widely mixed ages they looked enough alike to be members of the same family two were children and were wideeyed in the spooky alien environment three youngish adults were whispering to an elderly matronlyappearing woman who intermittently dabbed a tissue against her eyes the second group was a couple who could have been husband and wife and who like the hispanic children appeared like deer caught in headlights laurie and jack passed through a third door into a separate room that housed the ocmes communal coffeepot it was here that the medical examiner on call for the week went through the cases that had come in overnight and decided which cases needed to be autopsied and who out of the eleven doctors on staff would do the case laurie and jack almost always arrived early mostly at jacks insistence since laurie was a night person and more often than not had trouble getting up in the morning jack liked to get in early to cherrypick through the cases requesting the most interesting the other doctors didnt mind because jack always did more than his share as compensation dr riva mehta lauries office mate who had started at the ocme the same year as laurie was sitting at the id room desk behind various stacks of large manila envelopes each representing a different case she nodded and smiled a greeting at jack and laurie there were two other individuals in the room both sitting in vinyl club chairs and concealed behind newspapers with steaming mugs of coffee within arms reach laurie and jack knew who was behind the daily news it had to be vinnie amendola the mortuary tech who had to come in prior to the other techs to help in the transition from the night shift to the day shift frequently he worked with jack because jack also liked to get a jump on the day down in the pit neither jack or laurie knew who was hiding behind the new york times but they soon learned when jacks crutches clattered to the bare wooden floor as he tried to lean them up against one of the other two club chairs in the room the noise was sharp not too dissimilar from the sound of a gunshot the new york times dropped and exposed the surprised tense and chronically sleepdeprived face of detective lieutenant lou soldano by reflex the detectives right hand shot inside the lapel of his rumpled jacket with his gravystained tie loosened and the top button of his wrinkled shirt unbuttoned he had a decidedly disheveled appearance dont shoot jack said holding up his hand in mock surrender jesus lou complained as he visually relaxed as was often the case he sported a heavy fiveoclock shadow it was apparent hed not been to bed that night considering the reporters out in reception i suppose we shouldnt be surprised to see you jack said how the hell are you lou as good as can be expected after spending most of the night out in the harbor its not something id recommend lou had been lauries friend initially laurie and lou had even dated after solving a case together but their brief romance hadnt worked out when jack had come on the scene and ended up dating laurie lou had been a strong advocate of their relationship hed even been part of their wedding the previous june they were all good friends laurie went to lou and briefly touched cheeks before heading to the coffeepot jack sat in a club chair next to lous and elevated his bum leg on the corner of the desk laurie called out to ask if jack wanted any coffee jack gave her a thumbsup sign whats up jack asked lou since lou had become a strong advocate of the contribution medical forensics played in homicide cases he was a frequent visitor to the morgue although he hadnt been there for more than a month from experience jack knew that when he did come there was a high probability it would be an interesting case the previous day jack had had three routine autopsies two natural deaths and one accidental thered been little challenge lous presence augured that things might be different its been a busy night lou said there are three homicides i need help with from my perspective the most important one is a floater that we hauled out of the hudson river do you have an id on the victim jack asked laurie came over and put jacks coffee mug down he mouthed a thankyou nope not a clue at least so far are you sure it was a homicide absolutely he was shot in the back of the head at close range with a smallcaliber bullet sounds straightforward from a medical forensics point of view jack said with some disappointment but not from mine lou said the body is that of a welldressed asian man not some street person what scares me is that this might be an organized crimerelated hit we know theres been some friction between the established crime syndicates and some upandcoming asian russian and hispanic gangs particularly in regard to recreational drugs if some kind of crime war over territory breaks out a lot of innocent people get killed im hoping you or laurie could find something some kind of break so we can nip this in the bud before all hell breaks loose ill do my best jack said what else the next ones a sad story a detective sergeant in special fraud and a good guy has a daughter who has been arrested for killing her goodfornothing boyfriend with a baseball bat last night his name is satan thomas if you can believe it shes been a disaster for the detective since she was a preteen always hooking up with the dregs for boyfriends and into drugs and you name it anyhow she denies killing the guy and says the boyfriend was using the baseball bat to trash the apartment she even claims he came after her which hed done in the past by the way satans delightful family is camped out in the waiting room you mean hed been physically abusive to her apparently she claims that when she fled he was still busting up the place did it look like he died of blunt trauma oh yeah im afraid it looks like he got bashed in the forehead with the bat jack rolled his eyes sounds bad for your detective friend and even more so for the daughter jack felt depressed two out of three autopsies were going to be straightforward reluctantly he asked for the details on the third case this one is similar to the last but its the girl who got whacked she too was in an abusive relationship according to her parents the barlows who are also still in the waiting room apparently sara barlow and her boyfriend got into a row over the fact she didnt clean the apartment to his liking he admits he slapped her around but claims that when he left to calm down she was fine just bawling and saying shed do better when he gets back he claimed she was lying across the bed with her face and hands purple purple blotches or her whole face one of the patrolmen who responded to the scene insisted the boyfriend said the whole face but when the patrolman viewed the body all he saw was what he described as purple bruises what about the hands he didnt say did you see the body i did i happened to be in the area because of the detectives daughters case so i went over and jack questioned just looked like bruises to me too i was convinced he beat her up good what about the hands i guess they could have been somewhat blue what are you thinking im thinking this case might be interesting jack said as he reached for his crutches and got to his feet how about we do it first im more interested in the floater lou called after him i might not be able to stay awake for all three so id appreciate the floater first jack approached the desk riva was still going through the cases suggesting it was going to be a busy day laurie had a couple of envelopes on her lap she was sitting in the club chair next to vinnie who was still behind his paper remembering the reporters in reception jack called back to lou asking which of the three cases had brought the reporters to the ocme so bright and early short of possibly the floater jack had a hard time imagining any of the three being particularly newsworthy in a city the size of new york sad violent events were all too common none of the ones ive talked about lou called back the media is salivating about a death in police custody in the bronx of a man called concepcion lopez its going to be one of those excessiveforce brouhahas im afraid what i was told was that the guy went ballistic with an overdose of cocaine jack merely nodded thankful lou wasnt encouraging jack to do it police custody cases invariably were political disasters which jack found trying no one was ever satisfied with the report always claiming a coverup ill see you downstairs lou said getting up out of his chair with some effort i want to stop in sergeant murphys cubbyhole and see if a missingperson complaint has been filed for john doe have you come across lous john doe floater jack asked riva riva was immediately able to put her finger on the case file since it was on top of the pile of apparent homicides she handed it to him how about two bluntinjury cases jack asked the names are thomas and barlow riva had to hunt for these cases in the stack which was uncharacteristically high ugly night in the big apple jack commented youd think people could solve their differences more amicably riva smiled politely at jacks weak attempt at humor it was too early in the morning to respond verbally she found the folders and handed them over as well mind if i do these cases jack asked not at all riva said in her soft silky voice she was a petite gentle indian american with dark skin and even darker eyes who is going to do the police custody case jack asked the chief called and said he wanted to do it riva said since i was on call i guess ill have to be the one to assist him my condolences jack said although dr harold bingham had an encyclopedic knowledge of forensics helping him on a case was always an exercise in frustration control no matter what you did as the assistant it was never right and the case invariably dragged on interminably jack was about to wake vinnie up from his sports statisticsinduced trance when laurie looked up from her reading in contrast to jack who was content to skimread the case material prior to the autopsy she liked to go over it in exquisite detail jack felt that too much attention to detail initially prejudiced his ability to keep an open mind while laurie felt that not going over the history increased the chances shed miss something theyd argued over the issue but had finally agreed to disagree i think you should read this laurie said in a serious tone extending a case toward jack i think you will find it personally disturbing oh jack questioned he read the victims name david jeffries which he did not recognize his brows knitted in confusion over lauries comment and tone as he slid out the contents of the envelope what do you mean personally disturbing just read the pas investigators note laurie suggested pas were physician assistants who worked as forensic investigators it was the ocmes policy that pas visited the scenes when indicated rather than forensic pathologists the chief medical examiner dr harold bingham felt strongly that it wasnt an efficient use of the mds time despite his recognition that in some cases a site visit was crucial to determine the mechanism and manner of death it took only a few sentences for jack to understand david jeffries had died of a fulminant postoperative staphylococcus infection following an anterior cruciate ligament repair due to a particularly nasty type of staph called methicillinresistant staphylococcus aureus or mrsa considering the argument he and laurie were having over jacks upcoming surgery it seemed coincidentally relevant even if it involved another hospital i know what is going through your mind jack said but it aint going to change my mind ive already taken into consideration the risk of postoperative infection fearmongering is not going to work but this coincidence has to give you pause laurie said she knew it would certainly give her more than pause if the situation were reversed and she was slated to have the surgery frankly it doesnt jack said first im not superstitious and second i specifically asked dr anderson what his postsurgical infection rate was he told me that the only postoperative infections hed had over his entire career involved compoundfracture repairs which are a totally different situation besides this case youre showing me involved university hospital jack tried to return the file to laurie but she wouldnt take it if youd read further youd see thats not the case what do you mean jack asked he felt himself getting irritated about the surgery issue all over again laurie could be like a dog with a bone which he found frustrating at times although he knew people often accused him of having the same trait the patient had had his surgery eleven hours earlier at angels orthopedic hospital not university hospital the reason he ended up at the university hospital was to treat his septic shock and fulminant staphylococcal pneumonia really jacks eyes went back to the pas note although he trusted that laurie would never make such a thing up he had to read it himself this has to worry you laurie said the fact that they had to transfer a critically ill patient at all doesnt speak very highly for the angels orthopedic hospital what kind of hospital outsources its dirty laundry the patient apparently died in the ambulance thats crazy new treatments for septic shock require specialized personnel jack said he was distracted by what he was reading the rapidity with which the patients infection progressed was shocking jack as the ocmes putative infectiousdisease guru from having made several what he called lucky diagnoses on cases of infectious disease ten years ago couldnt help but be impressed in fact he started to wonder if mr jeffries had had a more truly infectious disease like rocky mountain spotted fever was the infectious agent unequivocally proved to be staph aureus jack asked he tried to remember what other known diseases caused such a rapidly fulminant course not by culture but by a monoclonalbased automate diagnostic system both the incision site and the lungs tested positive for methicillinresistant staph and interestingly enough it was a strain associated with what they call communityacquired staph not the kind of antibioticresistant staph that has been plaguing hospitals over the last ten or fifteen years which means the patient probably brought the bug in with him rather than acquired it in the hospital could be laurie agreed but theres no way to know doesnt this bother you at all i mean the victim was roughly your age had suffered the same injury and was going to have the same operation at the same hospital it would sure make me think twice thats all i can say to be honest a postoperative infection had been one of my concerns jack said maybe even the biggest which is why i asked dr anderson about his record and why i have been using antibacterial soap ever since the accident im going to be damn sure ill not be bringing any bacterial hitchhikers into the hospital if i can help it jack flicked the back of vinnies newspaper hard enough to startle the man quit it vinnie groused when hed recovered from his shock and saw who was the culprit please god dont let the selfproclaimed super forensic sleuth insist on breaking the rules by starting early vinnie added sarcastically and with seeming disrespect in point of fact there was enough mutual respect between vinnie and jack to allow for such teasing banter and technically they were breaking the rules by decree from chief bingham autopsies were supposed to start at seventhirty sharp although they never did jack was always early thanks in part to vinnies willingness to cut short his coffee break while all the other medical examiners including laurie were always late because bingham or the deputy chief calvin washington were rarely there to enforce the edict the supersleuth wants the super mortuary tech down in the pit jack said to the back of vinnies paper defiantly vinnie had gone back to his reading laurie asked riva if she could do david jeffriess autopsy of course riva said but its going to be a busy day youll have to take at least one more do you have a preference sure laurie said absently she was back to rereading david jeffriess history come on vinnie jack called leaning on his crutches at the doorway leading into the communications room vinnie had become reabsorbed in his paper im here a voice called out the day can now officially begin all eyes turned to the door leading out to the main part of the id room even vinnie who was passiveaggressively avoiding jack lowered his paper to see who had arrived it was chet mcgovern jacks office mate have you guys left anything mildly interesting hell id have to camp here overnight to avoid getting your rejects after ditching his coat on an empty chair he stepped behind riva to paw through some of the folders jokingly as if a schoolmarm riva hit his hand using a footlong wooden ruler youre in a good mood sport jack said whats the occasion how come youre here so early i couldnt sleep i met a woman last night at my health club whos an impressive businesswoman i had the feeling shes a ceo or something i woke up this morning early trying to figure out how to get her to go out with me ask her laurie suggested oh sure in case i hadnt thought of that and she said no sort of chet said well ask her again laurie said and be direct sometimes you men can be rather vague to protect your fragile egos chet saluted as if laurie were his superior officer come on you lazy goodfornothing jack said after returning to where vinnie was sitting and snatching his paper out of his hands vinnie scrambled after jack who managed to keep the newspaper away from vinnie until they reached the clerical room beyond communication there was a brief tugofwar amid laughter the battle for the newspaper over jack gave vinnie the john doe case file and asked him to put up the body meaning prepare the body for the autopsy meanwhile jack stuck his head into sergeant murphys closetlike nypd office the aging amiable cop looked up from his computer screen hed been assigned to the ocme forever jack was fond of the man as was everyone else murphy was one of those rare individuals who managed to get along with everyone jack admired the trait and wished some of it could rub off on him over the years hed become progressively intolerant of perfunctory bureaucrats with mediocre administrative or professional skills and he was unable to hide his feelings as much as he tried in his mind there were too many such tenured people hiding out in the ocme have you seen detective soldano jack asked he was here earlier but left to go down to the morgue sergeant murphy said did he ask you about the unidentified floater that came in last night he did and i told him the only missingperson report filed overnight was for a woman jack thanked the sergeant and managed to catch up to vinnie whod summoned the back elevator downstairs jack found lou in the locker room already suited up in a tyvek coverall which had replaced the far more bulky protective moon suits except for known exceptionally infectious cases as jack quickly changed into scrubs lou couldnt help but notice the swelling and discoloration of jacks injured knee that doesnt look so good lou commented are you sure you should be doing these posts actually its gotten better jack said i just have to baby it until thursday when its scheduled to be repaired thats what the crutches are for i could do without them but using them is a constant reminder youre having it operated on so soon lou questioned my exbrotherinlaw had an acl tear and he had to wait six months before having it fixed the sooner i have it the better as far as i am concerned jack said as he climbed into a tyvek coverall the quicker i get back to my bike and hopefully my bball the saner ill be the competition and the physical exercise keep my demons at bay now that you remarried are you still tormented by what happened to your family jack stopped and stared at lou as if he couldnt believe lou had asked such a question im always going to be tormented its just a matter of degree jack had lost his wife of ten years and two daughters aged ten and eleven to a commuter plane crash fifteen years earlier what does laurie think of you having surgery so soon jacks lower jaw slowly dropped open what is this he questioned with obvious irritation is this some kind of conspiracy has laurie been talking to you about this behind my back hey lou voiced raising his hands as if to fend off an attack calm down dont be so paranoid im just asking trying to be a friend jack went back to finishing his suiting up im sorry to jump on you its just that laurie has been on my case to postpone my surgery since it was scheduled im a little touchy about it because i want the damn thing fixed understood lou said with hoods in place and tiny batterypowered fans recirculating the air through highefficiency particulate air or hepa filters the two men entered the windowless autopsy room which had not been upgraded for almost fifty years the eight stainlesssteel autopsy tables bore witness to the approximately five hundred thousand bodies that had been painstakingly disassembled to reveal their forensic secrets over each table hung an oldfashioned springloaded scale and a microphone for dictation along one wall were formica countertops and soapstone sinks for washing out intestines and along another wall were floortoceiling glassenclosed instrument cabinets the contents of which looked like something that should have been in a house of horrors next to them were backlit xray view boxes the whole scene was awash in a stark bluewhite light coming from banks of ceilingmounted fluorescent fixtures the illumination appeared to suck the color out of everything in the room especially the ghostly pale corpse on the nearest table while vinnie continued the preparations by getting out instruments specimen bottles preservatives labels syringes and evidence custody tags jack and lou went to the view box to look at the wholebody xrays that vinnie had put up one was anteriorposterior the other was lateral after checking the accession number jack gazed at the films then he said i think you are right right about what lou asked it being smallcaliber jack said he pointed to a cylindrical halfcentimeterlong translucent defect within the lower part of the skulls image composed of metal bullets totally absorb xrays and since xrays are viewed as negatives the image appears in the color of the background illumination twentytwocaliber would be my guess lou said moving his face close to the film i think youre also right about it being executionstyle jack said from its position in the films its undoubtedly lodged in the brain stem where a professional killer would aim lets take a look at the entrance wound with vinnies help jack rolled the corpse on its side first jack took a digital photo then with his gloved hand he separated the hair covering the point where the bullet entered the victims head since the victim had bobbed around in the hudson river most of the blood had been washed away its a nearcontact wound jack said but certainly not contact since its a circular not a stellate defect he took another photo how far away lou questioned jack shrugged by the looks of the stippling id say somewhere around twelve inches noticing the position of the entrance wound in relation to the bullets position on the xray id guess the perpetrator was behind and above the victim maybe with the victim seated thats seemingly confirmed by slightly more stippling below the entrance wound than above more weight to it being executionstyle id have to agree jack took some measurements of the position of the wound and another photo with a ruler in close proximity then with a scalpel he dislodged some of the embedded soot from within points of stippling he put the material in a specimen tube finally he took additional photos before motioning for vinnie to allow the body to roll back into a supine position what do you make of these deep slices across the thigh lou asked pointing to two parallel sharp cuts in the anterior aspect of the right thigh jack took a photo before inspecting the wounds and palpating them they were certainly made by a sharp object he said looking at the clean edges theres no skin bridges id guess they are propeller injuries and id be willing to bet they were postmortem i dont see any extravasated blood within the tissues do you think the victim could have been run over after being thrown from a boat jack nodded but something more subtle caught his attention moving down to the ankles he pointed out some oddly shaped abrasions what is it lou asked im not sure jack said he went over to the counter and hefted a dissecting microscope detached from its base bracing his elbows on the edge of the table he studied the subtle abrasions well lou questioned im going out on a limb jack admitted but it looks as if his legs might have been tied with chains theres not only abrasions but also suspiciously shaped indentations occurring after he was dead or before whatever it was it was after he was dead i dont see any blood in the tissues here either it could have been he was chained to a weight and supposed to sink and stay sunk somebody could have screwed up could be jack said ill take a photo even though it probably wont show up if this was a screwup it could be important to keep it quiet lou said how come if it is an organizedcrime war there will be more bodies id want them to all come to the surface our lips will be sealed jack said hey cant we move this along vinnie complained at this rate with you two longwinded old farts carrying on were going to be here all day jack let his arms go limp at his sides and stared at vinnie as if shocked are we keeping the super mortuary tech from something more important he questioned yeah a coffee break jack switched his gaze to lou and said see what i have to put up with around here the place is going to the dogs he then reached up adjusted the overhead microphone and began dictating the external examination laurie slipped david jeffriess file back into its envelope it included a case worksheet his partially filledout death certificate his inventory of medicolegal case records two sheets for the autopsy notes a telephone notice of his death as received by communications his completed identification sheet the pas investigative report his lab slip for an hiv test and the slips indicating that the body had been weighed fingerprinted photographed and xrayed she had read the material over several times as she had done with her second assigned case juan rodriguez but it was jeffries she was more interested in feeling appropriately prepared she pushed back from her desk and headed toward the back elevator fifteen minutes earlier shed called down to the mortuary office and had had the good fortune to get marvin fletcher she was pleased and recognized his voice instantly as he was her favorite mortuary tech he was efficient intelligent experienced eager and always in a good mood laurie had an aversion for those techs who were moody such as miguel sanchez or those who always seemed to be moving at halfspeed such as sal dambrosio she also was not fond of the sarcastic blackhumor repartee in which some of the other techs indulged when she briefly described david jeffriess case warning that it involved an infection and asking for the body to be put up for an autopsy marvins response had been simply no problem give me fifteen minutes and its a go as laurie rode down from the fifth floor to the basement morgue level she thought of what she was going to find on jeffries according to the pas report the man had had all the symptoms of a toxic shocklike syndrome high fever an obvious wound infection at both incision sites diarrhea with abdominal pain vomiting severe prostration low blood pressure unresponsive to medication low urinary output rapid heart rate and respiratory distress with some bloodtinged mucus laurie shuddered at the thought of how quickly the man had succumbed and how virulent the bacteria had to be she also couldnt keep herself from worrying about the case being a negative omen involving as it did the exact same surgery jack was facing even the same knee jack had blithely dismissed the coincidence but she couldnt it made her more committed than ever to talk jack into at least delaying his surgery she even saw a bright side to david jeffriess tragedy maybe if she found something different or unexpected at the post it could help her change jacks mind which was why she had requested the case generally she tried to avoid cases involving fatal infection shed never admitted it to anyone but they made her uneasy yet as she approached the locker room she acknowledged that she felt more eager and keyed up about doing the case than she had ever felt about doing another laurie changed quickly first into scrubs and then putting on her disposable protective gear although the newer gear was less burdensome and limiting than the old moon suits she occasionally groused about the equipment like everyone else but on this occasion dealing with a fatal infection she was pleased to have it she carefully cleaned off the plastic face mask even slight smudges bothered her and turned on the fan before pulling the contraption over her head then prepared she pushed into the pit stopping just inside the door she surveyed the scene four tables were in use the nearest supported the corpse of an extremely pale asianamerican male three people were grouped around the head the scalp of which had been reflected forward and the skullcap of which had been removed the bloody brain glistened in the raw light although laurie couldnt see any faces through the plastic face masks she guessed it was jack lou and vinnie since they had started first the next table also had three people working and as laurie viewed them her face flushed shed forgotten that the chief dr harold bingham was expected he rarely came to the autopsy room as most of his time was spent in administrative duties or testifying at highprofile trials it was easy to pick him out not only because of his almost square silhouette but because of his harsh baritone voice that suddenly reverberated throughout the tiled room he was giving one of his impromptu lectures about how his current case reminded him of one of his innumerable previous cases as he was carrying on a slight figure standing on a stool opposite him who laurie surmised was her office mate riva was actually doing the work for her reward bingham intermittently interrupted his monologue to offer negative comments about her technique the next two tables had a pair of people working at each laurie had no idea who they were the fifth table contained the corpse of an africanamerican male standing at the head of the table a figure she assumed was marvin waved toward her and over the sound of binghams raucous voice he called out were set to go on table five dr montgomery binghams head snapped around toward laurie making her wish she could disappear the overhead light glinted off his plastic face screen blocking a view of his face so she could not anticipate his frame of mind dr montgomery you are a halfhour late ive been going over my cases for this morning sir laurie said quickly and as deferentially as possible she could feel her heart rate bump up laurie had struggled with authority figures since childhood i also needed to speak with cheryl myers to get some missing data cheryl myers was a pa whom laurie had slipped into the investigators office to see after leaving the id room although cheryl had written a generally good note for the construction death lauries second case laurie had noticed that the distance from the building the corpse had ended up after the fatal tenstory fall was not included as laurie had assumed cheryl had obtained the figure but had mistakenly left it out of the report all that is supposed to be done before seventhirty bingham snapped yes sir laurie said not interested in arguing unlike jack laurie generally followed rules reflexively however the one mandating that autopsies start at seventhirty sharp she generally ignored since it conflicted with her belief that it was more important to know the case prior to doing the post in an attempt to preclude any more conversation with bingham about the issue laurie stepped directly up to jacks table and asked loudly how his case was going stellarly jack quipped except the inconvenient fact that the patient died the only bad side is that it has been dragging on wed have made significantly more progress if there was any decent help around here screw you vinnie said if you two old windbags hadnt carried on like youve been doing we could be up having coffee by now gentlemen binghams voice called out ill have no disrespect nor profanity in the autopsy room lest she incite any further comments from jack and subsequent retorts from bingham laurie quickly headed toward marvin and her own case as she passed binghams table she cringed for fear of being called over but luckily bingham had been distracted by what he called a catastrophic mistake on rivas part as she dissected the neck are you going to need anything special marvin asked as laurie came up abreast of the fifth table as prepared as laurie was she generally knew in advance when special needs were required for a case a good supply of culture tubes laurie said as she surveyed david jeffriess corpse for fiftyone years of age the man appeared to have been in good physical condition there was no excess fat in fact his muscles particularly the pectorals and quadriceps had the definition of a much younger man laurie grimaced behind her plastic face screen besides the obvious infection at the surgical sites on either side of the right knee there was a sprinkling of small pustules all over his body which given the time would have turned into abscesses or boils even more striking were areas of desquamation particularly on his pelvis with the skin sloughing in relatively large sheets are you looking at his hands marvin asked laurie nodded what caused his skin to peel off like that staph makes a lot of toxins one of them causes skin cells to separate from their neighbors ugh marvin said laurie nodded again shed seen staph infection before but this was the worst anyway to answer your question about culture tubes marvin said i got plenty did you get a good supply of syringes as well yup all right lets do it laurie said as she pulled down the suspended microphone want to check out the xray i put it up just in case laurie stepped over to the view box and gazed at the film marvin followed and looked over her shoulder our xrays are mainly for foreign bodies and fractures laurie said even so you can certainly appreciate the pneumonia and how diffuse it is it looks like the lungs are filled with fluid hmmm marvin said xrays were a mystery to him he couldnt understand how doctors could see what they did in the foggy image laurie went back to the body and completed the external examination after making sure the endotracheal tube was where it was supposed to be in the trachea she pulled it out it had been placed by the doctors to ventilate him when he had begun to have trouble breathing she cultured the bloody mucus adhered to it turning to the multiple iv lines she made sure they were also properly placed and after doing so pulled them out and cultured them as well medical examiners insisted such tubes be left in place to be sure that they played no role in the patients death she also cultured the pus issuing from the surgical site once the external exam had been finished and dictated laurie began the internal with the standard yshaped incision starting at both shoulders meeting at the midline and then extending down to the pubis she worked quietly shunning the usual banter she normally exchanged with marvin who was an eager learner for a time marvin stayed quiet as well correctly sensing lauries awe at the virulence of the microbe that had played such havoc throughout david jeffriess body it wasnt until laurie lifted out the heart and lungs and put them in the pan he was holding that he broke the silence shit man he commented this baby weighs a ton i noticed laurie said i think well find both lungs full of fluid after she removed the lungs and weighed each separately she made multiple slices into them like fully soaked sponges a mixture of edema fluid blood necrotic tissue and pus emerged ye gods marvin said thats ugly have you heard of the term flesheating bacteria yeah but i thought people only got that in their muscles this is a similar process but in the lungs and much more lethal its official name is necrotizing pneumonia you can even see beginning abscesses laurie pointed to minute cavities with the tip of the knife you guys look like you are having way too much fun jack said after silently coming up along lauries right side laurie let out a short sarcastic laugh that was enough to briefly fog her face screen she gave a quick glance at jack before holding up the exposed cut surface of the lung for him to see if you call seeing the worst case of necrotizing pneumonia fun then marvin and i are having a blast jack used his gloved index finger to assess the turgidity of the lung section pretty bad id have to admit shows you what can happen if you smoke too many cuban cigars jack laurie said ignoring his attempt at humor why dont you stay with us for a few minutes i think you should see the full extent of this postoperative infection this poor individual was being literally and rapidly digested from the inside out this might be the worst or best advertisement for not having elective surgery ive ever seen thanks for the invite but ive got two more cases to do before lou conks out jack said besides i know how your mind works especially with your notsosubtle reminder the victim had surgery meaning i know you have an ulterior motive for your kind invitation visavis my thursday plans so ill let you two have all the fun with a little wave he started to leave what about your first case laurie asked mindful of lous interest what did you find not a whole bunch we recovered the twentytwocaliber slug for whatever thats worth lou says its a remington highvelocity hollowpoint but he could just be trying to impress me the things a bit mangled from penetrating the guys skull there were also some abrasions and indentations on his legs suggesting hed been chained perhaps attached to a weight i think he was supposed to sink which suggests he was thrown overboard out of a boat not dumped into the water on shore lou thinks thats important otherwise the guy was healthy except for a slight cirrhosis of the liver after jack limped off marvin asked what jack had meant about her having an ulterior motive were having a disagreement about when he gets his knee repaired laurie said without elaborating now lets get back to work what have you got arnold besserman asked working at the next table hed overheard laurie and jacks conversation arnold had been at the ocme longer than any of the other medical examiners although jack dismissed him as long in the tooth outdated and haphazard laurie was friendly with him as she was with most everyone else do you mind me interrupting certainly not laurie said sincerely his stepping over to her table was what made working in the communal autopsy room enjoyable and stimulating for her quite an amazing case laurie said take a peek at this lung ive never seen such dramatic nosocomial necrotizing pneumonia and it apparently developed over less than twelve hours impressive arnold agreed as he looked at the cut surface of david jeffriess lung let me guess its a staph infection am i right you hit it on the nose laurie was impressed ive had three similar nosocomial cases over as many months with the last one about two weeks ago arnold said maybe not quite as bad at least not all of them but bad enough mine were from a methicillinresistant strain coming from outside the hospital but which apparently had hybridized with bacteria coming from within the hospital thats exactly what my case apparently is laurie said even more impressed the strain is called communityacquired mrsa or camrsa to distinguish it from the usual nosocomial hospitalacquired mrsa or hamrsa i remember reading about it laurie said someone had a case five or six months ago of a football player who picked it up in the locker room and had an infection that ate away a lot of his thigh that was kevins case arnold said kevin southgate was another senior me whod joined the ocme only a year after arnold had as the old guard arnold and kevin stuck together like a team although opposites in their politics both were infamous around the office for constantly conspiring to take as few cases as possible it was like they were working halftime fulltime i remember when he presented the case at thursday conference laurie said other than the informal but effective giveandtake in the autopsy room the formal thursday conference with its required attendance was the only other opportunity for all of the citys nineteen mes to share their experiences laurie for one lamented this situation because it hampered the ocmes ability to recognize trends she had complained about it but without coming up with a solution the issue had died with the ocme doing more than ten thousand cases a year there wasnt time for more interaction and there were no funds to hire more forensic pathologists than the one they had hired that year the camrsa bug is scary as this case of yours aptly demonstrates arnold said its been a miniepidemic outside the hospital like kevins football player and even tragically enough some young healthy children getting scrapes on the playground now it seems to be going back into the hospital thats the bad side the good side is that it is sensitive to more antibiotics but the antibiotics have to be started immediately because believe it or not being more sensitive to antibiotics has given the strain added virulence not making the complete line of defensive molecules for antibiotics like the hamrsa strains these communityacquired strains are able to spend more time and effort making a soup of powerful toxins to enhance their virulence one of them is called pvl which im sure has played a role in your case here pvl toxin chews up the patients cellular defenses particularly in the lungs and initiates an overwhelming and perverse release of cytokines which normally help the body fight infection do you realize that as much as onehalf of the destruction you are seeing in the lung sections you are holding comes from the victims own completely overstimulated immune system you mean like the cytokine storm they are seeing with people dying from hn bird flu laurie asked the thought went through her mind that she would have to suggest to jack that he might need to adjust the opinion he had of besserman he was embarrassing her by how much more he knew about mrsa than she exactly arnold said im afraid im going to have to do some serious reading about all this laurie admitted thanks for all the information how is it that you are such an expert arnold laughed youre giving me too much credit but a month or so ago kevin and i got interested in the issue because of several cases we each had we kinda challenged each other to learn about it its a good example of the genetic versatility of bacteria and how quickly they can evolve laurie struggled to rein in her mind which was bouncing from one topic to another she looked down at the turgid nearly solid slice of lung she was holding she knew pathological bacteria were making a comeback but what she was facing in terms of pathogenicity seemed beyond the pale so the cases you mentioned earlier were necrotizing pneumonia she asked just like this case appears to be that would be my guess but id be even more certain if i looked at the microscope section of your case id be glad to take a peek laurie nodded and kevins cases were the same as yours very much so were his nosocomial also of course they were nosocomial but also involved the communityacquired strain the same as mine why didnt you bring this up at thursday conference well frankly it was not that many cases and everyone is aware of the burgeoning problem of staph particularly antibioticresistant staph were the involved hospitals fairly evenly distributed around the city no they were all here in midtown manhattan i mean there could have been cases in queens or brooklyn since they would be sent to their respective borough morgues what hospitals here in manhattan i cant remember the exact breakdown from individual institutions but all six came from three specialty hospitals angels heart hospital angels cosmetic surgery and eye hospital and angels orthopedic hospital laurie stiffened it was as if arnold had slapped her none from manhattan general or university or any of the other big city hospitals nope does that surprise you yes and no laurie said taken aback by such a coincidence there were a lot of hospitals in new york city it begged the question why just three did you contact the hospitals or look into the situation at all i mean why just those three hospitals kevin and i thought it coincidental so yes we looked into it to a degree i also asked for cheryl myerss help as well i called the angels orthopedic hospital and spoke to a very nice woman whose name escapes me at the moment id gotten the name from the hospital administrator the individual i spoke with chaired the interdepartmental infectioncontrol committee was she helpful absolutely she said the hospital was well aware of the problem and had hired an infectioncontrol professional or at least the company that owned the hospital did so i called this individual whose name i cant forget was dr cynthia sarpoulus was she helpful well i suppose at least to an extent what do you mean she wasnt terribly cooperative although i suppose she was stressed and defensive under the circumstances my assumption was that her employer angels healthcare which is the name of the company had put the burden on her anyway she essentially told me to butt out and that the situation was well under control thank you very much you know the attitude im sure to her credit it sounded to me that she was on top of the problem against managements objections according to her she had insisted all the ors in all three hospitals be closed which also according to her had everybody on her back she then had all the ors fumigated by an alcoholbased agent which is what is recommended shed also instigated a rigorous handwashing regimen on top of that shed had the entire staff tested as potential carriers and those who tested positive treated i have to say i was impressed they surely werent sitting around wringing their hands thanks for the information sorry to take so much of your time laurie said my pleasure arnold said would you mind if i came up to your office later and got the names of the cases youve mentioned not at all i might still have a couple of the case files you can also borrow the notes i made about camrsa if youd like and you can talk with kevin back when we were working on this i think he also called over to one of the involved hospitals but i dont remember if he told me what he learned after arnold had stepped back to his table laurie looked over at marvin who had patiently waited through the whole conversation that was incredible she said what that hes sweet on you no silly what he said hes not sweet on me thats not the chatter around the morgue its generally accepted both southgate and besserman would throw themselves in front of a subway train for you nonsense laurie said although hearing she was even remotely the source of gossip made her uneasy she never liked being the center of attention which was why she had such trouble talking in front of a group by the time laurie had finished with jeffries shed found far more pathology than she had expected every organ was grossly involved with obvious destructive infection or at least inflammatory swelling within the heart she found beginning infectious vegetations on the valves in the liver there were incipient abscesses as well as in the brain and kidneys suggesting the victim had had a massive bacteremia there were even ulcers in the gut attesting to the ease with which the bacteria spread how long to the next case laurie asked as she and marvin finished suturing the giant autopsy incision encompassing both david jeffriess chest and abdomen as little time or as much time as youd like marvin said if you want a coffee break ill stretch it out actually if you dont mind ill call you when i want to do it among other things i want to see if cheryl myers is here and catch her before she goes out on a case then ill take my time marvin said give me a call when you want to start make sure you leave a note for whoever releases jeffriess body to inform the funeral home that a serious infection is involved and precautions should be taken on her way out of the autopsy room laurie briefly stopped at jacks table ah the doomsayer jacked quipped at recognizing her forsooth vinnie take heed shes surely here to terrify us with the grisly horrors of her nosocomial surgicalsite infection case despite vinnies reflective face mask she could see him roll his eyes she felt similarly on occasion his creative but oft irreverent black humor was not amusing after being married to him for almost a year she now saw such behavior as defensive and a way to avoid what he was really thinking i do have to talk with you about my case laurie admitted there are some additional facts you should know how could i have guessed jack questioned mockingly but it can wait until you are more receptive praise be to the lord wheres lou he literally fell into a deep sleep leaning against the autopsy table between cases i thought it best he head home lest one of the mortuary techs mistake him for a corpse which case are you doing now laurie asked to change the subject sara barlow and its a hell of a lot more interesting than the john doe floater how so see the obvious bruises on the face and the upper arms obviously shed been beat up a lot over time but do you think any of them could have been fatal as the police assumed probably not but were there any on the anterior chest laurie asked she couldnt see because the chest walls were butterflied open from a case she had when shed first started at the ocme she knew that blunt injuries that one would not expect to be lethal could be if they occurred on the chest any reason to suspect commotio cordis nope chest was clean what if i tell you there was extensive pinkish pulmonary edema injected eyes and sloughing of the tracheal epithelium whats your presumptive diagnosis laurie asked with a sigh sometimes she found jacks forensic guessing games tedious and this was one of them what if i told you our clever pa janice jaeger found a mixture of rather strong open cleaning products in a glassenclosed shower stall with a bucket of water and a damp cloth earlier when she had viewed the body she noticed the knees of the womans jeans were wet and the victim was not wearing any socks or shoes id have to know if the cleaning products contained hypochlorite which many do and if others contained acid which a lot do and if she had ignored the warning not to mix them and did bingo jack said chlorine gas the first chemicalwarfare agent used in world war one did her in not her boyfriend its amazing to me how many people blithely ignore product warnings anyway lou will be pleased it is not another homicide he has to worry about not unless the boyfriend was the one who insisted she use the deadly products and use them together now thats a twist i hadnt even thought of jack admitted well you boys enjoy yourselves laurie said as she headed toward the exit she felt no pleasure at having guessed the right answer to jacks quiz she would have been much happier if he were not in such a distractingly playful mood whether real or feigned it amazed and irritated her that he didnt see or was purposely ignoring the corollary between her case and his proposed surgery instead of leaving jeffriess specimens for the staff to bring up to the appropriate labs as was the normal routine laurie took them herself she wanted to talk to both the head of microbiology agnes finn and the head of histology maureen oconnor to try to move things along but first she stopped on the first floor and went into the pas office knowing they were often out in the field laurie was pleased to find cheryl myers still at her desk can i help you with something else cheryl questioned she was a striking africanamerican woman who wore her hair in tight beadencrusted cornrows she was part of the old school at the ocme in fact shed been working there long enough to put her two boys through college i hope so laurie said earlier i was speaking with dr besserman about some infection cases at three hospitals run by a company called angels healthcare he said he asked you to look into it do you recall are you talking about the mrsa pulmonary cases those are the ones did you make a site visit no what he asked me specifically was to obtain hospital records so i merely called and spoke to the medical records department in each hospital it was easy to get the charts because angels hospitals have their medical records computerized the material was emailed over i didnt need to make a visit were the hospitals cooperative very cooperative i even got an unsolicited call back from a very helpful woman by the name of loraine newman who is she she is the chairperson of the orthopedic hospitals infectioncontrol committee dr besserman mentioned her laurie said he commented on how genial she was as well why did she call back just to leave her name and directdial number in case i needed anything else she said she was very concerned about the problem she told me that prior to the mrsa outbreak theyd had no nosocomial problems to speak of she said the situation was keeping her awake at night to tell you the truth she sounded a little desperate did she mention a cynthia sarpoulus not that i can recall who is she ive just posted another case of mrsa that came in from angels orthopedic hospital laurie said ignoring cheryls question id like loraine newmans phone number not a problem cheryl said with a few clicks of her computer mouse she had it on her screen i need some other numbers laurie said the cdc in atlanta has an mrsa program as part of its national healthcare safety network id like you to get me a name and phone number of one of its epidemiologists id also like you to call the joint commission for accreditation of healthcare organizations and get me a name and number for someone in surveillance of mandated hospital infectiouscontrol programs ill do my best cheryl said the name of my case is david jeffries laurie continued id like his hospital record that will be easy cheryl said but im not sure i understand who it is you want to talk to at the joint commission could you give me a better idea the joint commission requires hospitals to have infectioncontrol committees for accreditation what i want to find out is whether there is any policing of these committees and whether any reporting of outbreaks is required between formal inspections i know this is a bit unusual laurie said but im pressed for time im happy to help cheryl said goodnaturedly laurie left the forensic investigators office and went to the stairs avoiding the back elevator shed started the day with a selfish desire to talk jack out of his imminent surgery now she was worried about his wellbeing maybe even his life among herself besserman and southgate there were seven cases of fatal mrsa necrotizing pneumonia within three months at three hospitals one of which jack was scheduled to enter and all run by the same company and worse yet these cases were occurring despite what besserman had described as aggressive infectioncontrol measures although laurie was the first to admit that she didnt know too much about epidemiology she knew enough to wonder if there might be a lethal unknowing mrsa carrier like a kind of typhoid mary in the angels healthcare organization who was inadvertently spreading mrsa as he or she went from hospital to hospital in the course of his or her job laurie wanted a lot of information and as stubborn as jack was she wanted it fast if she hoped to influence his mindset the next stop was microbiology which was part of the laboratory complex on the fourth floor laurie found the taciturn sinewy microbiologist agnes finn in her small windowless office of all the employees of the ocme agness appearance was the most stereotypic for working in a morgue from central castings point of view her grayishyellow coloring contributed it was as if she never saw the light of day yet of all the supervisors laurie found agnes to be the most helpful by far always willing to go out of her way it was as if she had no life outside the ocme laurie sat down and explained the situation which elicited from agnes a minilecture on mrsa including everything besserman had to say and then some she explained in detail how staphylococcus was such a pluripotent microbe and perhaps the most adaptive and successful human pathogen when you think about it from the bacterias point of view agnes said it is truly a superbug capable of killing someone in a frightfully short time while the same strain is able to merely colonize an individual usually just within the nares this is a convenient location for the bacteria because every time the carrier puts his or her finger in their nose their fingers are contaminated from where it can be spread to the next person is there an estimate as to how many people are so colonized absolutely at any given time a third of the worlds population carries staph thats about two billion people good lord laurie said are there many strains of mrsa besides the hospitalacquired and the communityacquired very many agnes said and they are evolving all the time in peoples noses and elsewhere like moist skin surfaces where they exchange genetic material how are the strains differentiated in the laboratory many ways agnes said antibiotic resistance is one but thats not particularly sensitive considering everything youve said thats correct the more sensitive methods are all geneticsbased the simplest and most commonly employed being pulsefield gel electrophoresis and the most complete being full genotyping in between there are a number of other sequence typing techniques all based on pcr what can you do here in microbiology only the simplest antibiotic resistance if needed where can the more complicated be done the state reference lab can do the pulsefield gel electrophoresis as for more specific typing the cdc is the best bet they are actually building a national library of mrsa strains so they can give you a lot of information they encourage submissions of isolates and they can do it all of course dr lynch in our dna lab over in the new highrise can do the various genetic typing but we wont be able to tell you much about the specific strain which of the genetic tests is the fastest im up against a time constraint truthfully i dont know what i do know is that our standard culture and antibiotic sensitives take twentyfour to fortyeight hours hospitals can do it much faster using monoclonal antibodybased methods interesting enough such machines came out of work for nasa laurie shook her head she was humbled before today i thought i knew a reasonable amount about staph but i was sorely mistaken we all have to keep learning agnes said philosophically what do you want to do about these specimens youve brought in ill take one over to ted lynch in the dna lab id like one for you to culture and the rest can go to the reference lab im also going to want to get some frozen samples from some of dr bessermans and dr southgates cases to compare id like to know if they are from the same strain im concerned about an unsuspecting carrier particularly after what youve told me let me know the cases you are interested in ill try to expedite the process as for ted lynch youll have to leave it to me to provide him with a pure culture for his dna analysis with her head in whirl laurie hurried out of the lab and headed toward the faster front elevator as she hit the up button repeatedly in vain hope of speeding up the elevators arrival she tried to plot the course of the rest of her morning the first stop was going to be maureen oconnor in the histology lab where laurie intended to beg for david jeffriess lung sections to be processed into slides as quickly as possible laurie didnt care about the rest of the slides at the moment just the lung since she had in mind to make some large photomicrographs if the pathology appeared as bad as she fully expected it would she thought they would make terrific powerpoints for the argument she intended to wage against jack to get him to cancel his acl repair laurie boarded the elevator and pushed the button for the fifth floor she looked at her watch it was close to ten exiting she literally ran down the hall into histology and arrived mildly out of breath uhoh ladies maureen scoffed in her heavy brogue i seem to sense another acute emergency from miss montgomery errr thats mrs montgomerystapleton wholl volunteer to tell her this time her patient is already dead there was general laughter from the women who worked in histology thanks to maureens good humor it was a happy environment even laurie found herself smiling despite her anxiousness like most humor there was truth in maureens comment laurie and jack were the only pathologists on the me staff who on occasion felt they needed a rapid turnover with their microscope slides all the others were content to have them in due course maureen listened to lauries request and explanation and promised to do them herself within minutes laurie was back in the hall she hurried down to arnold besserman and kevin southgates office as she knocked the door swung open on its own and laurie leaned inside the interior of the office reminded laurie of the two mens polar political leanings as the archconservative arnold had a desk that was the picture of neatness with a single cardboard tray of slides on one side of his microscope and a new yellow legal pad on the other both were aligned perfectly parallel to each other along with a precisely sharpened pencil southgates side of the room was the opposite with slide trays unfinished case files lab reports and all manner of other documents piled on both his desk and file cabinet leaving only a small arc of cleared horizontal space directly in front of his chair a vast clutter of postit notes hung from the shade of his desk lamp like so much spanish moss it was a wonder to laurie how the two men got along so well and for so long after leaving a note on the door for either man to call her laurie went down the hall knocking at the other medical examiners doors to do a quick survey of their recent mrsa experience no one was in his office which was entirely understandable since the morning was the busy time in the pit although shed not seen george fontworth paul plodget or his newly hired office mate edward gonzales edward was a gifted forensic pathologist who was a product of ocmes own program and new york university momentarily thwarted in scaring up more mrsa cases at the ocme laurie retreated to her own office suddenly remembering arnold bessermans comment about queens brooklyn and staten island all of which had their own me offices she realized her conclusion that there had been no fatal mrsa cases in any of the other city hospitals during the last three months or so was premature with her rolodex open laurie first called dick katzenburg the chief of the queens office hed helped laurie in the past by coming up with cases that matched the two series of cases she had become deeply involved with as the call went through laurie recalled that both those previous series of hers had surprisingly turned out to be homicides which no one suspected even she the remembrance briefly stimulated the thought that the manner of death of her current series might not be accidental especially considering that a third of the worlds population was colonized with staph organisms at any given time the queens me office answered and laurie asked for dick while she waited she tapped her fingers nervously she hoped hed be available which she thought was a reasonable expectation in his role as chief of the satellite office administrative duties often kept him at his desk and out of the autopsy room as the time dragged on she got out a fresh legal pad and with the phone in the crook of her neck she drew multiple vertical parallel lines creating a checkerboard matrix in which she planned to add information about the mrsa cases as she learned it with her two previous series it had been the matrixes that had given her the insight shed needed hoping for a similar outcome she wrote david jeffries on the top row to the left of the indent line dick came on the line apologetic for keeping her waiting after a bit of social chatter laurie asked if they had seen in the queens office any mrsa nosocomial infections over the last three or even four months we have indeed dick said without hesitation they werent my cases they were thomas ashers i remember them because they were fairly ugly meaning necrotizing pneumonia the victims who were all healthy people didnt have a chance their histories reminded me of the stories of the influenza epidemic in on the spur of the moment laurie felt a pang of selfish disappointment the fact that other hospitals in the city were experiencing the same problem as the angels healthcare institutions would undoubtedly dilute the cases impact on jack do you know if they occurred at one hospital or at a number of hospitals laurie inquired just one it was an orthopedic hospital why do you ask laurie sat up straighter in her chair what was the name of the hospital angels something i think angels orthopedic hospital they were all orthopedic cases a slight crooked smile turned up the corners of lauries mouth instead of losing strength the potential success of her argument with jack notched upward there have been some cases here as well laurie said including one i autopsied today im going to look into it even though i was told the hospital has been aggressively proactive in dealing with the problem let me know if i can help can you give me the names laurie could hear the familiar sound of dicks keyboard a minute later he said philip moore jonathan knox and eileen dimalanta laurie quickly added them to her matrix have all three been signed out yup so you can access them in the database id still like to see the case files hospital records if you have them and also a tissue sample so i can have the strain accurately typed if it hasnt already been done ill bring what i have over for thursday conference id prefer you messenger them over today im under a time constraint how so a personal commitment laurie said not wishing to elaborate next laurie called jim bennett in brooklyn and margaret hauptman in staten island although margaret had had no mrsa cases jim had had three like dick two were necrotizing pneumonias like the others and were from the same hospital but another one was fatal mrsa toxic shock syndrome secondary to a fulminant endophthalmitis a massive infection inside the victims right eye which had quickly followed a routine cataract extraction hanging up the phone laurie added carlos suarez matt collord and kayla westover to her rapidly growing matrix laurie was now convinced that something was wrong something was very wrong april am rodger naughton will be with you shortly the priggish secretary said would you mind taking a seat from angelas perspective the woman seemed more like an automaton than a real person as many times as angela had been to rodgers office she expected some small gesture of familiarity rather than cool indifference and although angela had anticipated the reception from having experienced it so often in the past it still added to her discomfort for as long as angela could remember she had been an independent person loath to ask people for favors always determined to do whatever it was herself as she grew older this characteristic extended to asking for money yet there she was sitting in the columned splendor of the manhattan bank and trust with her metaphorical tin cup forced to beg for a loan the only bright side was that rodgers personality was quite the opposite of miss dartons from their first encounter angela had found him to be friendly helpful and all around remarkably simpatico under different circumstances she would have looked forward to seeing him but not today from the moment shed awakened through getting michelle off to school amid the continuing bellybuttonpiercing debate through talking with the lead counsel about the previous days mrsa death and through reassuring cynthia sarpoulus that no one blamed her for the continuing infection problem angela had tried to come up with a strategy to talk rodger into giving her a sizable personal loan or giving angels healthcare a commercial loan unfortunately shed been unsuccessful in coming up with any ideas short of getting down on her knees and begging as dire as the situation was shed do it if she thought it would help mr naughton will see you now miss darton said the only change in her expression was a slight lift to her eyebrows and a flutter of her eyelids feeling like she was headed to the principals office after having been nabbed committing an infraction such as smoking a cigarette in the girls room angela headed into rodgers office angela rodger called out with alacrity as he bounded out from behind his desk with his hand outstretched so glad to see you this is a treat normally i have to deal with your cfo not that i dislike bob frampton he is very much a gentleman but if i had my druthers id prefer to deal with you directly now dont you tell him that he laughed as he shook angelas hand vigorously and guided her toward a seat facing his desk angela sat and observed rodger as he returned to his tufted leather highbacked desk chair he was a handsome boyish man with a carefully groomed appearance he had fine closely trimmed blond hair and pale blue eyes his position at the bank was one of several healthcare relationship managers as a business with no discernible ceiling to its growth healthcare was of great interest to banks in general and to the manhattan bank and trust in particular when angela had come to the bank five years previously to arrange for angels healthcares first construction loan she had been assigned to rodger over the ensuing years rodger had worked with the company as its liaison with the bank earning considerable money for the bank in the process during this time angels healthcare had built three multimilliondollar hospitals which had been veritable cash cows until the recent mrsa outbreak it was this reality that angela planned to emphasize and hopefully exploit how is your daughter rodger asked with sincerity rather than merely to make conversation other than some preteen angst shes okay angela said while her mind struggled with how to begin the quest for yet another loan and yours she knew rodger had a girl a year older than michelle but that was the extent of her knowledge of the mans private life shes struggling with the same issues im learning that teenage daughters can be a handful angela remembered her own teenage struggles all too clearly it was during that stressful middleschool interval that her problems with her father had come to a head never to be truly resolved angela rodger said im assuming you are here today about the call i made to bob your cfo i want to reassure you it was pro forma bank policy the margin on angels healthcare loans comes to my attention automatically when it nears a specific point the problem of course is the bridge loan we arranged a little over a month ago combined with the recent sale of bonds from your companys management account it is bank policy that i as your relationship manager make the call rest assured i am not calling any of the companys loans i appreciate that angela said groaning inwardly his comments although solicitous in trying to put her at ease had the opposite effect rodger was in effect telling her that angels healthcare had no more credit regardless angela cleared her throat and added but your call to bob was not the reason for my visit oh rodger said he leaned back in his chair how can i help you i know you are aware of our upcoming ipo angela began its scheduled closing is just a little more than two weeks away so we are in the quiet period meaning i cannot divulge any specifics let me just say that we have been assured the ipo will be successful im happy for you rodger said an underwriting guarantee wow congratulations may be a little premature the shortterm problem which prompted our need for a bridge loan a month ago has cost considerably more to fix than we had predicted we need another bridge loan but only for three weeks the interest doesnt matter and we can pay it up front rodger leaned forward his chair squeaked he rubbed his forehead and breathed out through puffedup cheeks then he looked across at angela he suddenly looked tired and even a little sad what kind of money are you talking about two hundred thousand is what wed like but well settle for what you could arrange you are asking for the impossible rodger said he took a deep breath when i said your companys loans were nearing the margin i was not completely forthright they are at the margin im afraid you are fully drawn down on facility cant you make an exception angela asked she hated to plead but had no other choice you have been working with us for almost five years you understand current medical economics you know how well we are positioned we will be the first specialty hospital company to go public after the senatorial moratorium was lifted this past october you know that we will be tapping into an almost limitless amount of guaranteed revenue because of the way healthcare reimbursement favors procedures you also know angels healthcare is going to mushroom into a very big company and you know manhattan bank and trust will continue to be our bankers with you as our relationship manager i give my word ill even put it in writing what about your personal assets rodger asked i can get you a home equity loan ill facilitate it myself i can have the money for you that will not work angela said interrupting ive already maxed out the equity in all my personal assets including my jewelry everything for a few minutes silence reigned in rodgers office the only sound was a ticking tiffany desk clock a narrow beam of sunlight streamed into the room a million motes of dust danced silently in its glare rodger sat back and spread his hands in the air he shook his head im sorry i cannot authorize a loan with no collateral its not that i dont want to its just not in my power to do so im sorry angela i admire you greatly as a doctor a businesswoman and a fine human being i just cant do it what about someone higher in the banks hierarchy surely someone can authorize such a loan especially considering the money the bank has made in the short run and will be made over the long haul ill try rodger said without a lot of enthusiasm ill send the request up the ladder to my superiors will you recommend it angela asked i will recommend they consider it rodger said skirting the question thank you angela said she stood managed a halfsmile and shook hands with rodger across his immaculate desk it was then that she noticed the sole framed photograph on the desk was of a young girl there was no family shot nor a wife i should tell you that even if the powers that be were to approve the loan it would surely take several weeks to go through the process im sorry angela please dont take it personally if it were my prerogative i would do it in a second angela headed for the door five minutes later she was on the street trying to hail a cab to ride downtown even though the outcome of the meeting was as she had anticipated it still depressed her of the two meetings shed scheduled that morning the one shed just had with rodger had at least been cordial the next one with her exhusband michael calabrese probably wouldnt be they almost never were although angela truly loved and treasured her daughter often she was regretful that the child tied her inexorably to continued and sustained contact with a man she wished shed never met much less married of course shed made the situation worse by allowing him against her better judgment to act as her fledgling companys placement agent back when she was initially founding angels healthcare the collaboration did not happen by forethought sharing custody required continual contact and michael had used the opportunity to quiz angela about her experiences getting her mba although michael had been in the securities business with morgan stanley since graduating from columbia where hed first met angela he never got a graduate degree his curiosity about angelas mba experience had been a combination of genuine interest and also a kind of jealousy like her father michael had been challenged by angelas medical degree especially when his friends would tease him that she was the brains and he was the brawn even though they were divorced angelas getting an advanced degree in business the arena he claimed as his area of expertise had reawakened the negative feelings of insecurity that her scholarship engendered discussions would invariably turn into mutual irritation until the day angela described a business plan she was creating as an exercise for one of her courses when she finished the description michael had been so impressed that hed encouraged her to actually do it as a real company he told her he could get seed capital from what he called his unique clients he never explained what he had meant by unique clients but angela had reason to believe he was not merely bragging michael by that time had left morgan stanley to form his own boutique placement firm in that capacity he often worked with his former employer morgan stanley on ipos and was doing very well for himself encouraged by michaels urging angela had gone to several of her professors who were also intrigued by her business plan and she used their contacts to found angels healthcare true to his word michael raised a portion of the seed capital from his clients and even found the eventual angel investor as a syndicate of the same clients which ultimately committed fifteen million plus a recent bridge loan convertible into stock at their discretion however the true success came from angelas efforts which raised the rest of the seed capital during her mba she had moonlighted at university hospital and like a born saleswoman had culled a group of eager university physician investors who interested a number of colleagues who interested more doctors from other institutions in a rapidly selffulfilling process not only did all these physician investors contribute money but once the hospitals were built they also brought in the patients in droves which was in essence the critical factor in the business plan and the source of the companys success angela climbed out of the cab in front of a large marbleandglass office building not too far from ground zero michael shared office space with a number of other independent financial wheelerdealers each had their own private offices but shared common areas and secretarial services it was a convenient relationship for all since they got better quarters and services than they would if they were on their own michaels office had an impressive view of the hudson with the statue of liberty standing midriver on her postage stampsized island across the river loomed apartment buildings in new jersey michaels door was ajar and since the shared secretary was at a considerable distance angela merely walked in her ex was on the phone leaning back in his chair with legs crossed and his feet perched on the corner of the desk his jacket was hung over the back of his chair his tie was loosened and the top button of his shirt was undone he was the picture of casual ease without interrupting his conversation he motioned for angela to sit on the couch angela took off her coat laid it across the arm of the couch stashed her briefcase on the floor and sat down on the coffee table directly in front of her were the usual masculine appurtenances including a decanter filed with an amber fluid several cutcrystal oldfashioned glasses and a polished mahogany humidor with a flush inset humidity gauge on the wall was a flatscreen tv with stock prices trailing along the lower part of the screen and silent talking heads above just seeing her former spouse made her heart speed up but certainly not due to attraction although she had to admit he was darkly handsome his features were angular and rugged and his anthracitecolored hair was slicked back one hand held the phone the other gestured wildly in the air as his conversation progressed he was obviously trying to convince someone of something angela had met him when she was a junior and he a senior at columbia university and he had swept her off her feet she thought he was exactly what she was looking for he was undeniably masculine a good student somewhat of a rebel outspoken seemingly honest popular with and patriotic to his buddies new and old passionate and outspoken about his attraction to her romantic with little gestures like specialoccasion flowers and particularly importantly to her not afraid of showing emotion in short he was the opposite of her father a personality profile angela demanded in anyone she might consider for a longterm relationship she even appreciated his bluecollar background and his confirmed allegiance to his highschool friends few of whom had gone to college it suggested he had good values the only chink in the picture was that one night michael had admitted that his domineering father had not spared the belt in his maniacal goal that his sons attend an ivy league university since the modus operandi had worked for michael although not for michaels older brother angela didnt pay heed to the old proverb the ends do not justify the means although she should have in a big ugly way it would prove to be prophetic all right all right michael said finally while waving his free hand in the air as if batting away a pesky insect get back to me he positioned the phone receiver several inches over its cradle and let it drop god some people are such assholes angela wisely held her tongue so michael said rising up to his full sixfootthree stature whats up he came around the desk grabbed a side chair swung it over to the coffee table and mounted it backward with his arms crossed and resting on the chairs back he regarded angela with a wry challenging smile that unfortunately evoked enough unpleasant memories that angela scrapped her initial plan of restricting the conversation to her companys desperate need for cash and then leaving instead she said first lets clear the air about some minor issues okay whats your idea of minor issues why on earth would you give permission to our tenyearold daughter to get her belly button pierced before talking to me about it the kid wants it why not and thats enough of a reason for her to do it angela asked with uncamouflaged disbelief just because she wants it she told me all her friends have them and you believed her why shouldnt i its kinda a fad angela instinctively knew it was a waste of everyones time to continue the conversation michael had never been much of a parent nor much of a husband only after they had gotten married did angela learn that michael had a very bluecollar idea of matrimonial duties in his mind his role was to come home from work sit in front of the tv and keep the family updated on current events particularly in the sports world and that was on those nights when he didnt have to meet his friends supposedly for workrelated dinners in lower manhattan gone were the romantic gestures and compliments angela became pregnant and put up with their failing relationship vainly hoping the birth of the supposedly longedfor child would turn michael back into the person hed been during the courtship but michelles arrival only made angelas life more difficult as she desperately tried to balance graduate medical training in internal medicine with the rigors of parenting a newborn michael had refused to help except in very superficial ways he even openly prided himself for never having changed a diaper such duties were simply below the dignity of a young hotshot rapidly rising investment banker listen angela said trying to keep herself as calm as possible lets not argue but i assure you all her friends do not have them and theres always the risk of infection they can have problems with infection yes indeed but the point is that when something like this comes up and you think there is any chance i might feel strongly about it talk to me before making a decision fine michael said with a roll of his eyes okay you made your point about the piercing issue what else you implied there was more yes there is angela said trying to think of the right words i want to let you know under no uncertain terms that your telling michelle that it is my fault you and i are divorced is unacceptable trying to get michelle to take sides in a problem that is between you and me is not okay you have to stop hey i didnt file for divorce you did michael said i didnt want to get divorced who files for divorce has nothing to do with cause angela snapped it was your behavior that got us divorced so i got drunk and hit you i said i was sorry what are you perfect i wasnt the one having affairs and you got drunk and hit me more than once i wasnt having affairs i was just blowing off steam a lot of the guys do it especially when their wives are off to the hamptons in the summer it doesnt mean anything its just booze and entertainment we live on different planets angela said but i didnt come here to argue the past is the past for us except for michelle and angels healthcare for michelles sake dont talk about whose fault the divorce was you can think one way and i another just dont mess up her head pointing fingers all i say to her is that it just didnt work out i dont try to influence her relationship with you thats totally between you and her all right michael said with another roll of his eyes ultimately he didnt care from his perspective his current life was far better than his life when they were married but at the time it had bothered him that angela had the gall to file and embarrass him hed never expected it none of the other guys got divorced hell some of them had known steady girlfriends and even allowed themselves to be seen in public with them what we really need to talk about is angels healthcare angela said i hope youre not here to tell me that accountant of yours filed the damn eightk no thats not why im here angela said with a shake of her head i havent seen him yet today i was in the office only briefly before going to the bank then coming down here but why are you asking me if he filed you assured me you knew someone who could talk to paul yang and there wouldnt be a problem true michael said simply so what is it that you want to talk about i need to raise more money if i dont im not certain we are going to make it through the ipo with our current cash flow you have to help youre not serious im very serious what the hell happened to the quarter of a million i raised for you a month ago it was more than a month thats one hell of a burn rate its not all gone but yes it is a rapid burn rate a sizable portion went out to suppliers but the real draw is keeping three hospitals open with very little revenue but you told me last time you were here that you were dealing with an infection problem which was soon to be under control you said that your revenue stream would quickly recover it hasnt happened why the hell not michael demanded when i was here last our ors were closed apart from loss of revenue the cost of containing the infection was four times our estimate but things are looking up the ors are now open but our census is low except for a few stalwart individuals our doctors are still gunshy things will turn around rather quickly but not soon enough michael ran a nervous hand across his forehead and gazed out at the placid expanse of the hudson river angela watched him and knew him well enough to recognize true anxiety he did not like what he was hearing he was upset a month ago when shed come with her woes and he was more upset now not only had he committed a lot of his clients money to angels healthcare hed committed a lot of his own not to mention his working relationship with morgan stanley who hed convinced to be the underwriter for the ipo michael looked back at angela he nervously licked his lips what kind of money are we talking about here my cfo says wed be confident with two hundred thousand holy shit michael exclaimed leaping off his chair to pace his office tell me you are joking he said suddenly stopping and staring at angela with an expectant expression tell me youre highballing me as a psychological ploy im telling you straight this is too serious a situation to be joking or playing games what the hell is your crackpot cfo doing with all the cash michael it is expensive to run three hospitals youve seen our books salaries alone are enormous and the costs dont stop just because the revenue does the eye hospital and the heart hospital are producing some cash but the ortho hospital is producing almost none weve let a few people go but we are limited unless we want to call attention to our cashflow problem which we dont many of us havent taken any salary for months im getting more than a bad feeling here yesterday you call me about the problem with the accountant today you pop in asking me to raise another two hundred grand whats it going to be tomorrow wait a minute angela said youre the one who offered to help with the accountant when the issue arose a week ago you said you had people who could convince him that filing the eightk wasnt necessary angela waited for a moment before continuing we only need the money for three weeks tops angels healthcare will then be swimming in cash even taking into account the obscene amount we have to pay morgan stanley dont begrudge morgan stanleys take they are the ones assuming the most risk here and from what you are saying its even more than they think go back to your clients offer them whatever you need to i tried the bank and i pleaded with rodger but its a no go i cant go back to my client michael said decisively suggesting that there was no room for discussion client i thought it was clients angela said she was confused hed always said clients and used the word syndicate she was certain its really one client michael said reluctantly why cant you go back to him surely he doesnt want to risk his generous payoff with as much stock and options as he controls thats what i said when i went back for the quarter of a million tell him again i assume hes a smart man tell him exactly what i told you that the ors are open he is a smart man especially about money if i go back to him at this point hell know we are desperate we are desperate whether it is true or not it is a bad negotiating position he might demand to take controlling interest it was now angelas turn to stare out the window at the river the idea of losing control of her company was anathema after all her effort yet what other options did she have for a brief moment she thought about going back to the practice of medicine and giving up the entrepreneurial lifestyle but the thought was shortlived she was realistic enough to know that the freedom her current lifestyle afforded her at least prior to the current cashflow problem had become addictive she couldnt help but recall her disastrous experience with her primarycare practice and the realities of the current healthcare reimbursement which was totally out of her control also she reminded herself that if nothing else she was persistent she wasnt going to give up now that she was fifty yards from the finish line after a tenmile race let me talk to your client directly angela said breaking the silence she had suddenly redirected her attention to michael whod sat back in his chair a few dots of perspiration had appeared along his hairline oh yeah sure michael mocked as if it was the most ridiculous suggestion she could possibly make why not if he has any questions he can ask them directly instead of through you i can reassure him with all the experience ive been having im getting good at convincing investors my client has made it abundantly clear he only wants to talk to me about investment issues oh come on michael im not going to steal your client dont be so paranoid its not me who is paranoid its him just so you understand the situation theres several shell companies between him and his position in angels healthcare as well as with several other pending deals why so much secrecy is there something here youre not telling me im only following his orders is he your major client in most of your placement deals lets just say hes a big player i cant be more specific angela eyed her ex this need for secrecy added to her general unease although she truly didnt know why it was apparent that michael had no intention of enlightening her further instead of pressing him she said why dont you raise the money from someone else make it a sweet deal to one of your other clients its too short a time frame for that theres no one i know whom i could approach then what about yourself ive already maxed out all my equity me too what about your jet its pledged to the hilt hell its been on one hundred percent charter as well angela threw up her hands and stood well theres not much more i can say or do im afraid all our fates are in your hands michael you are our placement agent for better or worse michael breathed out noisily maybe i can come up with fifty grand he said reluctantly after everything hed all but promised people if this ipo stalled he knew hed be in deep trouble and not just financially thats a start angela said i cant say it will guarantee success but it will be much appreciated what do you want as compensation twelve percent as a loan but convertible at my discretion to one hundred thousand dollars of preferred stock jesus christ angela murmured then in a normal voice added ill have bob frampton call you as soon as i get back to the office when can we expect to have access to the cash in a day or so michael said distractedly he was already trying to think of how hed manage to cobble together the funds he had not been joking when he told angela he was maxed out although he did have some gold futures hed kept out of the mix for a disaster he reasoned that this might be the disaster ill be at the office putting out fires if you have any bright ideas angela said as she got her coat and briefcase she looked back at michael before leaving hed gone back to staring out the window as she walked to the elevator she vaguely thought that michael was his own worst enemy she also thought of the proverb that you can take the boy out of the country or in this case his old neighborhood but often you could not take the country out of the boy especially since michael had moved back to his old neighborhood after the divorce to angela michaels story smacked of a greek tragedy michael was a smart welleducated handsome and often charming individual who had the potential to be successful on many fronts yet he had a tragic flaw he was a prisoner of his past when he had unknowingly absorbed indelible and ultimately harmful allegiances attitudes and values thinking in this vein about michael angela couldnt help but reflect for a moment about herself as a realist she knew that she too carried some emotional baggage from her past and her current life was far from serene as she boarded the elevator she wondered if she too had a tragic flaw that could explain how she had gone from a very idealistic firstyear medical student to where she currently was begging for money from a man she despised to prop up a nascent financial empire april am laurie couldnt remember the last time she had been so keyed up moving quickly she left paul plodgets office after speaking with him and edward gonzales shed again hit pay dirt the first time had been a halfhour earlier with george fontworth an me whod been with the ocme for almost as long as arnold and kevin hed provided her with four mrsa cases hed had over the last three months and now shed learned paul had also seen four mrsa cases over the same time period and edward one although one of pauls cases was from manhattan general a tragic case of a previously well fiveyearold girl whod developed rapidly fatal necrotizing pneumonia from a boillike lesion obtained at a local playground all the others were from an angels healthcare hospital first there was a jonathan wilkinson whod died of necrotizing pneumonia after a triple coronary bypass second was judith astor who died of toxic shocklike syndrome after a facelift and third was gordon stanek who died of necrotizing pneumonia after a rotatorcuff repair edwards case was leroy robinson who passed away from necrotizing pneumonia after the repair of an open wrist fracture walking quickly enough to briefly skid on the highly waxed vinyl floor laurie stormed into her office after sitting down she pulled herself toward her desk and reached for her rapidly expanding matrix to add pauls and edwards cases remind me if asked never to do another case with our beloved chief riva said turning around toward laurie it was a common joke around the ocme to express such sentiments after working with bingham riva had come up to the office between cases to make a few workrelated calls for a moment she watched laurie diligently work wondering why her office mate hadnt even greeted her it was so unlike laurie hey riva called out after several minutes had ticked by what are you doing lauries head bobbed up she apologized belatedly realizing her rudeness ive stumbled onto something quite extraordinary like what riva asked dubiously she knew laurie to be a passionate woman who loved her work and who frequently became excited over problematic cases sometimes it was appropriate and sometimes not there has been a miniepidemic of nosocomial mrsa thats gone essentially unnoticed i wouldnt say its gone unnoticed riva said its been happening for a decade or more not only in this country but internationally as well didnt it start in britain let me phrase it differently within the last three and a half months or so theres been a number of very severe mrsa inpatient infections resulting in rapid death all occurring at three hospitals owned by angels healthcare just those three hospitals thats it except for one i uncovered five minutes ago that happened at manhattan general all the others have been at the three hospitals how many cases are you talking about laurie looked back to her ballooning matrix and silently counted what she had recorded ive got twentyone so far but i have yet to talk with chet our deputy chief or jack for that matter are these cases of necrotizing pneumonia involving this newer communityacquired mrsa most of them laurie said a few of the others are described as toxic shock syndrome in those cases there is extensive lung inflammatory damage from the bacterial toxins and from the overproduction of cytokines by the deceased but the infection itself is elsewhere as for the involved strain its been the communityacquired mrsa in those cases where ive seen the case files the problem is i have yet to see too many case files then you have twentythree not twentyone how so laurie asked she looked back at her matrix and started to recount because i have had two riva explained it was three months ago and maybe a week or two apart swivelling around in her chair riva took down a small bound notebook from her bookshelf above her desk unlike any of the other medical examiners riva kept a longhand chronological journal of all her cases on several occasions laurie wished she had thought of doing the same in it riva added personal observations and feelings that were inappropriate for the official report it was more like a diary than a mere casebycase compendium after rapidly flipping the pages riva came to the respective entries she quickly read them before raising her eyes to meet lauries you definitely have twentythree one of mine was from angels orthopedic hospital and the other from angels cosmetic surgery and eye hospital can i see laurie asked eagerly riva handed over the journal and pointed to the two entries laurie read rapidly as an exceptionally thorough pathologist riva had recorded the name of the hospital and even the specific strain of mrsa involved in both cases she had written it as camrsa usa mw sccmeciv pvl laurie looked at riva in the few case files ive seen the bacteria wasnt so specifically typed was there some reason it was in your cases i had it subtyped riva explained like you i was impressed with the pathology in the lung more for general interest i sent an isolate of each case to the cdc because id read they were looking to obtain mrsa samples for their mrsa library do you have any idea what all the alphanumeric acronyms mean not a clue riva admitted if you read further youd see id promised myself id look it up but unfortunately like a lot of good intentions i never did it was the cdc surprised that the strains were the same despite coming from different hospitals i dont believe i mentioned there were two hospitals involved laurie nodded but the fact that the two strains were exactly the same bothered her considering what agnes had told her about how easily staphylococcus exchanged genetic material she felt pleased that shed asked cheryl to get an appropriate contact with someone involved with mrsa at the cdc as it would give her an opportunity to ask the question directly to someone particularly competent you wrote in your journal that you obtained hospital records laurie said do you still have them probably riva said they came in as email attachments i usually save those just for this kind of situation riva turned to her computer keyboard and began typing laurie picked up her own phone and called down to cheryl myers luckily she was still at her desk rather than out on a site visit laurie apologized in advance before telling her she needed quite a number of additional hospital records from the angels healthcare hospitals not a problem cheryl said just email me the names i did save the hospital records riva said when laurie hung up her phone laurie got up and looked over rivas shoulder fantastic laurie said i guess i can access that from my computer whats the file name within a few minutes laurie had longstrome and lucentes hospital medical records on her screen of all the mrsa cases that had come in to be autopsied over the last four months these were the first hospital records she had arnold besserman had provided her with several of the ocme case files he still had in his office but he couldnt put his finger on the hospital records well ive got to get downstairs and do my next case riva said laurie waved over her shoulder preoccupied by printing out the documents dont you have another case as well riva asked oh shit laurie said with her burgeoning interest in the mrsa cases shed forgotten it was embarrassing to think that marvin was patiently waiting youre preoccupied riva said im sure i can get someone else to do it ill do it laurie said while she didnt want to take time away from her current project she felt guilty about not doing her share if you see marvin down there tell him ill be calling him shortly with a final nod riva disappeared leaving the door ajar laurie went back to her computer and made the final click to load the second document into the printer queue knowing shed have to wait five or ten minutes for the two documents she went back to her matrix adding rivas cases when she was finished she leaned back it was a sizable list certainly bigger than the two matrixes shed made in the past now she had to decide how to label the columns some of the information she thought appropriate was intuitive such as age sex race doctor date hospital diagnosis type of surgery predisposing factors anesthesia and staph type laurie then drew more vertical lines next to the ones shed already drawn she knew she needed little space for things like age and sex and more for predisposing factors and diagnosis when she was finished she made sure there was room for more columns and it was for that reason she was pleased to have the hospital records she knew that by going over them shed come up with more categories satisfied with her progress laurie leaped up from her desk with the intention of dashing to the computer room only to collide into jack as he appeared in the doorway both were surprised but more so for laurie who let out an involuntary yelp in the process of grabbing lauries upper arms jacked dropped the case files he was carrying as well as his crutches my god jack joked what is there a fire in here laurie pressed a hand to her chest it took a few breaths before she could talk im sorry she managed i guess im preoccupied and in a hurry i heard as much about the preoccupied part jack said i ran into riva getting off the elevator she said youd come across something that you found particularly interesting but didnt elaborate whats up have you had any mrsa cases in the last three months or so with pulmonary involvement you have to give me more of a clue what you are asking you know im not good with acronyms methicillinresistant staphylococcus aureus laurie said uhoh is this a setup isnt mrsa what your acl case had this morning it is laurie admitted she started to bend down to retrieve jacks case files and crutches jack who was still holding onto lauries upper arms restrained her and then bent down to gather his belongings i cant recall having any mrsa ever he said while straightening up how about chet now he might have it seems to me i heard him talking on the phone about staph with miss smiles agnes finn whether it was mrsa or not i have no idea thanks for the tip ill have to ask him so its obviously mrsa that has you so preoccupied and in a hurry its certainly the preoccupied part but the reason im in a hurry is because i forgot ive got another case to post poor marvins been waiting for several hours riva mentioned the case as well she said she offered to have someone else do it she said you didnt take her up on the offer although she sensed that you wanted to laurie let out a small laugh thats sensitive enough on her part to be almost scary then let me do it jack said im done with all my cases and from what riva said the post itself should be straightforward i mean its going to be plain blunt trauma with the poor guy falling ten stories onto concrete you dont mind laurie questioned maybe you should give it another thought riva mentioned to me earlier that there are three stakeholders who are very interested in the case all three want a different manner of death no matter what you come up with two other people are going to be disappointed thats not your favorite kind of case i think i can handle it well then ill take you up on the offer but theres one important fact that didnt get in the pas report which i got from cheryl and which might be important it was the distance from the building that the body landed it was twentyone feet sounds like i might have to dust off my highschool physics jack said now that we have that settled why are you preoccupied about mrsa its not that it is new its been a big problem in hospitals for some time or shouldnt i ask you shouldnt ask laurie agreed not until i get more information then ill sit you down for a convincing powerpoint presentation why do i have a bad feeling about the goal of this supposed presentation because you are worried im going to change your mind fat chance laurie im having my knee fixed come thursday well see laurie said confidently come on ill ride down in the elevator with you i need to pick up some material i just had printed as they walked down the hall toward the elevator laurie asked jack about his previous case the last of the three homicides lou was interested in shed heard lous description that morning about the detective sergeants daughter and the baseball bat its a good one jack said manipulating the crutches like a pro it was another opportunity for our pas to shine steve mariott noticed there were no footprints in the copious amount of blood on the floor i mean in and of itself it doesnt mean a whole lot but it made him look at the scene a little closer than he might have otherwise which turned out to be key the victims forehead was bashed in with even a bit of brain tissue extruding but the overall shape of the wound wasnt concave like youd expect a bat to cause i made a mold of the injury and its tramline you mean its more like having been caused by a sharp edge laurie questioned as they boarded the elevator exactly jack said grabbing both crutches in one hand so he could press the button for the basement laurie leaned over and hit the button for the first floor the ocme printer was in the computer room which was part of the administration area steve had noticed a bit of blood on the castiron edge of a granite coffee table hed even taken a picture of it as well as the bat i think satan thomas in a drunken drugaddled stupor fell while trashing the apartment and hit his forehead on the edge of the coffee table to prove it ive sent one of the daytime pas back to the scene to get a mold of the tables edge thats terrific laurie said lou is going to be pleased i think the girlfriend is going to be the most pleased the door to the elevator opened laurie gave jack a quick hug and thanked him for volunteering to do her case ill think of a way you can pay me back jack said with a wink and a smile after the elevator door closed laurie hustled down the main corridor toward the office printer in the computer room she was determined to take advantage of this unexpected free time with the hospital records of rivas two cases she planned on working more on her matrix by creating more categories and filling in the boxes she could what laurie was interested in was finding some hidden commonality among the cases which could explain the sudden cluster laurie also wanted to get in touch with cheryl myers if cheryl hadnt called her already and get the phone contacts laurie had asked for she wanted to call the cdc and the joint commission but mostly she wanted to call loraine newman in the back of her mind laurie had begun to believe that a visit to the angels orthopedic hospital and perhaps even angels healthcare was in order even though such excursions were discouraged by the chief ten years earlier laurie had been called into the chiefs office and chastised for making a similar site visit bingham felt strongly that visiting scenes was the province of the pas not the mes but under the circumstances she felt justified even impelled and not just to bolster her argument against jacks surgery her intuition was telling her that there was something vaguely unsettling about this series of mrsa cases that went beyond the typhoid mary theory adding to her unease were the results of jacks two cases that morning the manners of death of which turned out to be the opposite of what was expected accidental rather than homicidal such surprises reminded her that it was always important to keep an open mind about the manner of death even the most talented forensic pathologist could be fooled laurie now began to question if the current series of mrsa cases involved something more sinister than the assumed manner of death therapeutic complication a relatively new death designation championed by bingham to replace accidental in a hospital setting keeping in mind her two previous series one fifteen years ago and the second two years ago whose manners of death had been assumed to be accidental and natural respectively but whose ultimate determination shockingly turned out to be homicidal laurie could not dismiss the possibility that the current series could be the same knowing that shed be ridiculed if she gave voice to her intuitions laurie was aware that she had to see if there was any real evidence to bolster her suspicions and she had to do it quickly april am angela removed her coat and draped it over her arm as she exited the elevator on the twentysecond floor of the trump tower and briskly walked down toward angels healthcare during the ride uptown from michaels office shed been able to use her blackberry to respond to all her emails and was reasonably confident she wouldnt be overwhelmed when she got to her office she wondered how people had functioned preinternet she acknowledged her secretary loren who was on the phone as angela passed by inside her office she was about to hang up her coat when she stopped doing a double take there was a large clearglass vase of luxurious red roses perched on the corner of her desk they stood out in bold relief in the sparse white decor after finishing with her coat and curious who could have sent the flowers and why she looked for a note there was none to be found now even more curious about the flowers she leaned out her doorway she had to wave to get lorens attention whats with the flowers angela mouthed silently loren was still on the phone from overhearing bits and pieces of the conversation angela could tell it was the union representative whod been persistently trying to organize the angels healthcare hospitals there was no way angela wanted unionization but with everything else going on she didnt have the time or the patience to deal with him so it fell to loren to hold him off loren put her hand over the receiver im sorry they came with a card its here on the corner of my desk she nodded toward the envelope angela picked up the envelope and got a finger under the flap once it was open she slid out the card it said simply regards from the used one what the hell angela murmured she turned the card over but the back was blank curious but overwhelmed with all she had to do she simply slid the card back into the envelope shed think about it later tapping lorens shoulder angela motioned for her to again cover the receiver with her hand and then said tell him ill meet with him in three weeks go ahead and schedule an actual appointment that should satisfy him then call bob frampton and carl palanco tell them to come into my office asap and wheres the afternoon schedule loren pulled out the schedule for the afternoon meetings and handed it over angela retreated back into her office closing her door seated at her desk she looked at the schedule most of the everyday issues of running each of the hospitals was delegated to the department supervisors but they reported to their respective hospital presidents as well as to a department head in the angels healthcare home office and those individuals in turn reported to carl palanco as the coo and ultimately to angela as the ceo by perusing the schedule angela could gauge what the rest of the day would be like shed been booked to see the general counsel most likely about the previous days mrsa death and how to stave off a lawsuit the riskmanagement committee chair for the same reason and the patient safety committee chair after that she was to travel over to the angels orthopedic hospital to attend the hospital medical staff meeting the final scheduled meeting would be back at her office with cynthia sarpoulus so that the infectiousdisease professional could give angela a briefing of what she had learned and what she had planned to do about the previous days mrsa death of all the meetings the medical staff meeting was the most important it would afford angela a chance at least at the orthopedic hospital to impress on the doctors the vital importance of upping their patient census despite the minor setback the jeffries case represented the only way the revenue stream would turn around is if the surgeons did surgery angela was aware more than anyone that the success of the specialty hospital depended exclusively on the doctor owners admitting their paying patients meaning those patients with insurance either private or medicare or those patients with adequate wealth the specialtyhospital business as per angelas business plan was not interested in medicaid or charity cases or for that matter any cases where cost might exceed revenue angelas phone jangled under her arm it was loren informing the boss that the cfo and coo had arrived send them in angela said putting aside the afternoon schedule the two men dramatic opposites in outward appearance and mannerism came into the room carl palanco bounded in snatched one of the four modern straightbacked chairs from where it stood against the far wall positioned it in front of angelas desk and sat himself down his expression and constant motion suggested hed had eight cups of coffee in contrast bob frampton moved as if in oil and everything about his face suggested a desperate need for a good nights sleep yet despite their contrasting miens laurie knew them both to be equivalently clever and resourceful which was why she had strenuously recruited them at the outset to be her key employees it took bob long enough to move a chair next to carls that angela had been tempted to leap up and do it for him but she stayed in her seat and the thought gave her insight into her own hyper state she wondered if she appeared as highstrung as carl anything happen this morning that i should know about apart from the emails you men have sent me angela asked to start things off carl looked at bob both men shook their heads ive met with the heads of supply nursing laundry engineering housekeeping and laboratory services to talk about a deeper cut in expenses over the next few weeks carl said ive gotten some creative ideas i applaud the initiative bob said but at this point any efforts in that regard are too little too late as far as the ipo is concerned im afraid bob is right angela said i had to do something carl explained i couldnt just sit in my office and do nothing and come what may an emphasis on costconsciousness is a good mindset for our central department heads to have for the future i mean its hardly wasted effort angela nodded keeping a rein on expenses was particularly key for hospital profitability as holding companies of hospital chains had learned to great advantage over the last few decades a large part of angels healthcares profitability at least prior to the mrsa problem was due to angelas business plan of building three specialty hospitals at the same time and centralizing things like laundry supplies housekeeping engineering laboratory services and even anesthesia each hospital had a head or chief of these various services but they all answered to the department head in the companys home office how about your morning bob asked angela any luck marginal angela admitted as you mentioned last night were seriously drawn down on our credit at the bank after selling the bonds the good news is that rodger naughton assured me he was not going to call any of our loans the bad news is that he cannot authorize a loan without collateral which i expected on the other hand hes sent the additional loan request up the ladder but from his attitude i think we have to assume its a lost cause what about your exhusband bob asked as was the case with all the key employees bob was aware that their placement agent had been married to angela but divorced a year before she founded angels healthcare although initially hesitant about the relationship bob had accepted it hed expressed a preference for a more direct relationship with a blueribbon investment bank but had been won over by michael calabreses ability to come up with an outstanding angel investor during their mezzanine round of raising capital i was able to get him to commit another fifty thousand of his own money angela said she did not mention how demeaning the meeting was bravo carl said its a bit short of what i would feel comfortable with bob said i did my best getting him to put in the extra money was like squeezing water from a rock did you discuss the terms bob asked oh yeah you dont think michael calabrese would offer that kind of money without rewarding himself what did you offer i didnt offer he told me angela said and went on to explain the terms whoa bob commented hes being rather generous with himself it cant be helped under the circumstances angela said call him and draw up the documents i want that money in our account before he changes his mind i happen to know how fickle he can be will do bob said typing himself a note on his blackberry okay thats it angela said placing her palms on her desk as if she were about to stand up except i want to make sure everyone who knows about the mrsa death yesterday understands that the less said about it the better id like to keep it away from the medical staff as much as possible ive reminded all the hospital ceos carl said i also spoke to pamela carson in public relations good angela said anything else there is one thing i just remembered bob said he straightened himself in his chair paul yang hasnt come into the office today has he called in sick angela asked she felt her general anxiety rise another notch no i left a message on his cell and also emailed him but he hasnt gotten back to me i dont know where he is is that odd for him angela asked while she debated mentioning michaels possible role of course its odd hes usually so methodical i even called his wife she said he didnt come home last night or even call good god angela said has she called the police no she hasnt hes done this before although not for a number of years hed had a drinking problem which had led to some odd behavior his wife told me hed been out of sorts of late and had gone back to having a cocktail or two on his way home i never knew he had a drinking problem angela said she did not like to be blindsided about any angels healthcare employees particularly key employees i kept it out of his record bob said i should have told you when i recruited him but he and i had worked together for something like six years and hed been clean good god angela repeated raising her eyes to the ceiling for a moment now we have to worry about a drunken binge by our accountant whos been threatening us all with filing an eightk what else can go wrong she took a deep breath before looking back at bob i know he was struggling with his conscience bob said thats why i called you about him yesterday to keep you in the loop up until then he hadnt mentioned the problem for over a week id thought it was a nonissue apparently hed read an article about the sentencing of the enron and worldcom people i told him what id told him before namely that our not filing the eightk is justifiable were not trying to perpetrate a fraud by bilking people out of their savings or retirement funds which is what the sec rule is about in fact just the opposite were creating capital for people after you called me yesterday about him i called michael because when you had originally brought the issue to my attention i had discussed it with him i thought with his ipo experience he would have a suggestion of how to handle the problem and he did he said he knew someone who could talk to him and put his mind at ease by convincing him that filing the eightk wasnt necessary in our situation was it a corporate attorney i have no idea i didnt ask but i find myself wondering if talking with michaels acquaintance could have had anything to do with pauls not coming to work today its possible but i bet the reason for his being incommunicado is more prosaic like he got himself blotto and is currently sleeping it off in a fleabag hotel is there any way we could find out if he filed the eightk angela asked hesitantly not that i know of bob responded well just have to wait and see if the shit hits the fan he laughed humorlessly if you think of a way let me know angela said it would be best if we know sooner rather than later so we can prep our general counsel well be forced to come up with a rational explanation of why we didnt file earlier maybe you should start giving it some thought bob bob nodded what about pauls secretary carl asked has she heard from him not that i know of bob said maybe we should ask her angela said reaching for the phone whats her name amy lucas carl said angela asked loren to call amy lucas and have her come by asap angela glanced at her watch it was twenty after twelve meaning there was a chance amy lucas would be at lunch whats the occasion for the flowers carl asked when i saw them i hoped it had something to do with your morning attempt at raising capital i wish angela said to tell you the truth i have no idea who sent them or why wasnt there a card bob asked there was a card angela said but it wasnt helpful she reached for the envelope slipped out the card and handed it across the desk carl took it and both men glanced at it what does the used one refer to carl asked not a clue angela admitted you dont think it could have anything to do with paul yang do you both men shook their heads carl handed the card back angela puzzled over it for a second and then her phone rang it was loren saying miss lucas had arrived send her in angela said tossing the mysterious card to the side loren opened the door allowed the secretary to enter then pulled the door shut amy lucas was a waiflike woman in her midtwenties her features were delicate and her complexion was pale marred by a sprinkling of acne across her cheeks her frizzy blond hair with its limegreen highlights was pulled back from her face and held with a large tortoiseshell clip adding to her youthful almost preteen mien was a simple shirtdress buttoned all the way to her neck her hands were clasped in front of her evincing her nervousness angela introduced herself since shed never before met the young woman and thanked her for coming so quickly no problem amy said i know who you are good and of course you know these gentlemen amy nodded but didnt respond verbally to put you at ease we called you in here to ask you a couple of questions about your boss paul yang in her own hyper state angela wasnt certain but it seemed to her that her attempt at putting amy at ease had failed the womans hands previously clasped were now working at each other the question of whether paul and amy might have had or were having an affair popped unbidden into her mind from bobs statement about pauls past what kind of questions amy asked her eyes quickly jumped back and forth to all three individuals in the room have you seen him today no amy said inordinately quickly in angelas estimation has he called or contacted you in any way amy shook her head did he say anything last evening about not coming in this morning no angela looked at bob and carl and paused in case they had a question when they didnt respond angela redirected her attention to amy do you know what a securities and exchange commission form eightk is i think so has paul yang had you fill one out recently yes about ten days ago was it filed i dont know i didnt file it he told me specifically not to file it did you type it on your workstation monitor no he wanted it on his laptop only i see angela said is the laptop in his office no he always takes it with him so he took it last night in particular yes like every night angela glanced at the men again but they didnt ask any questions thank you for coming by amy angela said youre welcome amy responded after a moments hesitation she turned and headed for the door amy angela called out when you hear from paul yang please let one of us know of course amy said and then disappeared well angela said that was a little strange how so carl asked she seemed overly nervous id be too getting a summons to the corner office carl said maybe so angela said my main concern is that there is a completed eightk resting in pauls laptop which the missing man presumably has with him it doesnt surprise me bob said it speaks to his methodicalness just because its in his laptop doesnt mean hes going to file it well i hope he turns up soon angela said i suppose thats it for now both men got up and returned the chairs to their original positions against the wall remember to call our fearless placement agent to get the loan asap angela said as they filed out bob waved over his shoulder to indicate hed heard and let me know the instant either of you sees or gets in touch with paul yang will do the two men voiced as the door closed behind them angela sighed and looked out the window she wished shed not had any coffee that morning with everything else that was going on her usually pleasant buzz was magnified a hundred times over her phone rang suddenly and she literally jumped she took a deep breath to calm herself when she picked up the phone loren told her that rodger naughton was on the line angelas pulse quickened this call from rodger was either very good news or very bad meaning he was either letting them know that the bank would give them the desperately needed bridge loan which would be terrific or informing them that the bank was calling in one or more of their current loans which would be an unmitigated disaster angela thought the chances were higher that it was the latter with significant trepidation she pressed the button below the blinking light and said hello as optimistically as she could manage sorry to bother you rodger said no bother angela assured him she had to restrain herself from demanding straight off whether he was calling with good news or bad i just wanted to call and say it was terrific to see you this morning well it was nice seeing you angela said with confusion it seemed a strange way for the conversation to begin i also wanted to convey how sorry i am that i cannot be more receptive to your shortterm cash needs i understand angela said her confusion deepening i have as promised passed it up through the channels its all that i can ask there was a pause angela gritted her teeth expecting the worst i have a request rodger said this might be out of bounds so i apologize in advance but i wonder if youd be willing to meet with me for a drink after work we could go to the modern which i find particularly pleasant is this business or social angela asked with surprise purely social rodger said the unexpectedness of the request took angela completely by surprise except for the brief and uncharacteristic reflection on her lack of a social life the previous evening angela was too busy to think such thoughts thats very flattering angela said at length coming from the credulous side of her personality but then from the more powerful experiencebased cynical side she added but what would your wife think of such a meeting im not married oh angela responded feeling somewhat guilty the image came to mind of the single photo of his daughter on his desk my former wife decided that having a boring banker husband and a demanding child was a burden on her preferred lifestyle so she departed to greener pastures with half my assets ive been divorced with full custody about five years now angela instantly related personally to rodgers situation and felt even more guilty about her reflex cynicism concerning his motives his matrimonial history seemed uncannily similar to her own barring the custody issue angela could only wish that she had full custody im sorry i was so flippant angela said i assumed you were just another male in a midlife crisis thats understandable im sure you are hit on on a regular basis thats hardly the case but i have learned to be skeptical so can i look forward to seeing you when you might be free it could even be tonight and at your convenience as you can guess from my visit to your office this morning this is not a good time so im afraid i must decline but i appreciate your thinking of me and perhaps after the ipo if you are still inclined id love to have a drink and the modern would be fine i havent been many places over the years i suppose i fall into that sad and narrow category of the hyper narrowminded workaholic businessperson chasing and being chased by the almighty dollar i hardly think thats the case rodger said having a preteen daughter and you not having a spouse obviates that but well stay in touch and good luck to angels healthcare thank you a bit of luck would certainly help angela replaced the receiver she could hear disappointment in rodgers voice which flattered her on one hand and saddened her on the other especially hearing her own description of herself for a brief moment she lamented how shed morphed from the person she was when shed entered medical school to the person she was now having abandoned committed altruism for equally committed but far less noble entrepreneurialism angelas fleeting reverie was cut short by her insistent phone its discordant jangle rudely yanked her back to the exigencies of her companys plight with more than a tinge of resentment she snatched up the phone loren told her there was a dr chet mcgovern on the line who wanted to speak to her whats it about angela demanded while she tried to place the doctor in one of the three angels hospitals he wouldnt tell me loren said for a second angela flirted with the idea of telling loren to ask the man again what he wanted and if he refused to tell him to angela caught herself and refused to even finish the thought profanity had been part of her rebellion in college but shed grown out of it mainly because michael had used it to such irritating excess with more than five hundred physician investors there was no way for angela to remember all their names that reality and the need for the doctors to be encouraged to admit more patients meant angela swallowed her pique and took the call she assumed it would be about the mrsa death the previous day and prepared herself mentally to describe everything being done to avoid any more infection in the future first i want to make sure the flowers arrived the caller said angelas gaze shifted to the roses and their mystery all at once it dawned on her she was speaking with the chet mcgovern shed had the casual drink with the previous night at the club and had used to clear her mind and perhaps satisfy her transitory need for some sort of social contact especially with a member of the opposite sex the flowers arrived angela said thank you it was most unexpected i hope they mean you have forgiven me that goes without saying chet responded which brings me to the reason for the call i thought it over and after finding a spare two hundred thousand in my night table ive decided to invest in angels healthcare there was a slight pause really angela questioned with her mind momentarily stalled between what she knew was reality and what she wished to be reality chet laughed hey im making a joke i wish i had a spare two hundred gs but such is not the case oh angela said she wasnt laughing i have a sneaking sense you didnt find that so funny what is the real reason for the call angela asked there was a new edge to her tone i was speaking with a couple of my colleagues one of whom is a very savvy woman i told them about meeting you last night and being turned down for dinner tonight she told me to ask you again and to be direct even if it meant putting my fragile ego on the line angela smiled in spite of herself so youre admitting you have a fragile ego absolutely sometimes it takes me days to recover with that said im reasking you to dinner tonight to stave off a depression angela couldnt help but laugh you are persistent im not sure thats accurate calling up like this and asking for more abuse is not my style well your honesty and humor have intrigued me though i didnt like the joke about the two hundred thousand it was like you were mocking me absolutely not chet said i wasnt joking about the need for shortterm capital and that is honestly why i cannot accept your gracious offer i truly am distractedly busy i wouldnt be good company even if i had the time well im disappointed but my ego is still intact thanks to your diplomacy i tell you what if you are suddenly successful with your moneyraising or depressed you are not call me ill be available at a moments notice when the call ended angela spun around in her chair looking down the length of fifth avenue clogged with traffic the unexpected dinner invites from two seemingly charming but different men one obviously social and the other an apparent homebody were remarkably unusual and unsettling in the way they made her question her choices and her lifestyle causing her to wonder again about how shed gotten sidetracked in her life in a moment of insight she sensed that the combination of the government reimbursement rules that caused her innercity primarycare practice to go bankrupt and the demoralizing experience of divorce from michael had worked to undermine her value system shed become jaded success from business as measured by wealth and its trappings had trumped notions of altruism charity and apart from her daughter the pleasures of interpersonal intimacy angela swung back around to face her desk and the problems besieging angels healthcare pushing the flowers away from her work area angela moved the afternoon schedule to center stage a moment later loren brought in a sandwich and a coke while she ate angelas mind switched back to the new problem about paul yangs whereabouts and the laptop with the k file it was like missing a loaded grenade with its pin half out with that thought in mind angela reached for her blackberry to email michael about what he might know of pauls failure to show up for work as her thumbs danced across the miniature keyboard she applauded the ability the instrument gave her to communicate without having to talk to the man it meant she could get the information she wanted without the aggravation shed otherwise have to endure once the message had been composed she was about to send it when she had a second thought she was well aware of michaels background and childhood and at times had had unsettling questions about some of his friends and their current lifestyles including his socalled clients but shed never asked because at the time she didnt want to know now as she was about to send the message to michael she had a similar feeling and wondered if she wanted to know the answer to what she was asking vaguely sensing she might not she saved the message as a draft and put the blackberry aside shed deal with the issue later april pm michael calabrese was in a foul mood from an amalgam of fear and anxiety as he pulled his black mercedes suv alongside a row of parked cars and then backed into an empty spot from where he was parked he could see the entrance to the neapolitan restaurant on corona avenue in corona queens corona was the next town over from rego park where hed grown up in a largely italian neighborhood a lot of people thought all the italians in new york lived in little italy in manhattan but it wasnt true they had all moved out many to long island including michaels grandfather ziggy whod started the family masonryandtile business in rego park michael eyed the restaurants entrance and tried to think of a strategy for his upcoming meeting the restaurants fame extended as far back as the s when it was the favorite nighttime hangout of the lucia organization it had continued with the dubious association over the years with some ups and downs but mostly downs until mayor rudolph giuliani managed to discourage a lot of midlevel mafioso bosses from schmoozing at night in manhattan and at that point it had enjoyed a remarkable resurgence its revival had continued with vinnie dominick having chosen the joint to be his haunt when he was selected as the local lucia capo as a sign of the times the competing vaccarro crime family had chosen a considerably newer establishment two blocks down the street the vesuvio as their rendezvous both organizations believed it made sense to open a handy avenue of communication with the asians russians and hispanics coming in and jockeying for some of the action the only problem of course was that paulie cerino the titular vaccarro head was still in the slammer so communication wasnt what it should have been in a fit of unbridled rage michael pounded his steering wheel repeatedly while yelling shit over and over again hed experienced temper tantrums since he was a child and back then theyd gotten him into more than his share of fights and a number of beatings from his father yet there was a positive side once the energy was expended hed calm down and could deal with the bothersome issue at hand as hed matured hed learned to control his outbursts until he was alone except when hed been married to angela as suddenly as he had started pounding the steering wheel he stopped spoiled bitch he grumbled thinking about angela shed been his bane from the moment theyd gotten married up until then shed been a doll but within weeks of the big ceremony at saint marys church he was no longer good enough the way he was she wanted him to do this and she demanded he do that and she resented his going out even for business dinners in short she wanted him to change and he had no intention of changing for a spoiled uppermiddleclass jersey girl whod gotten everything shed ever wanted by snapping her fingers as far as the divorce settlement was concerned he didnt want to go there in his current state of mind whenever he thought about it it made him furious for nothing but causing him grief she walked away with the west side triplex apartment and a ridiculous amount of child support and now as the final twist of the knife shed sucked him into this business with angels healthcare that might be putting his life at risk of course he couldnt fault himself as a business plan it was terrific as she had explained to him the government in its infinite wisdom had created a system via medicare and essentially adopted by all health insurance companies that paid doctors vastly more money for doing procedures than they paid for taking care of people in general the trick then was to recruit a host of physician investors to fund the construction of private hospitals which did only procedures and avoided all the moneylosing ventures such as running emergency rooms and taking care of the uninsured or the chronically ill such a scenario took advantage of a loophole in the law that generally prevented doctors from referring patients to their own facilities such as laboratories or imaging facilities because it was thought that when physicians owned a share in a whole hospital they were very small cogs in a very large wheel what it all meant was that for the doctors it was like a kickback which encouraged them to admit their paying patients since they got paid for doing the procedure and then got paid again from the hospital according to their small percentage ownership for the real owners who held the majority of stock it was an unbelievable cash cow this was why michael had committed so damn much of his own assets and so much of his clients capital and how hed talked morgan stanley into underwriting the ipo everything had gone according to plan to such an extent that michael had pooled most of his remaining personal assets just six months ago and committed the capital to angels healthcare to strengthen his position before the ipo process started as any financial analyst knows diversification is key as an investment strategy yet michael was so certain about angels healthcare that hed allowed himself to violate the cardinal rule and now he was paying bigtime in terms of anxiety his problem was that he hadnt understood the scientific details or the potential economic consequences of the infection problem that had started three and a half months ago in the angels hospitals now he did he also knew all too well how vinnie dominick hated losing money michael glanced back at the entrance to the neapolitan it was deceivingly serene with plastic flowers stuck in the fake window boxes even the brick facade was fake it was fiberglass sheets there was no coming and going of patrons because the restaurant wasnt open for lunch except for vinnie and his close minions for the owner it was a small price to pay for the right to do business and in the evenings he did a land office business except for sunday when it was closed and all the wiseguys spent the mandatory day with wives and family michael checked himself in the rearview mirror and smoothed his hair which he purposefully wore in the same style as did vinnie dominick theyd known each other since elementary school where vinnie had been one year ahead of michael as far back as the fourth grade vinnie had dominated the playground of ps by dint of his fathers position in the lucia organization even the sixthgraders gave way from that time on michael had tried to copy vinnie even during their highschool years at saint marys since no particular strategy had come to mind as to how to handle the conversation with vinnie michael reluctantly decided hed just have to wing it because ultimately everything depended on vinnies mood if he was in a good mood the ordeal might be a piece of cake if he wasnt anything could happen climbing from his suv michael had to wait for the traffic before crossing corona avenue when angela had left his office more than an hour earlier after delivering her depressing news about angels healthcares bleak liquidity michael had reluctantly decided that he had to talk with vinnie if worse came to worse and vinnie was blindsided by the potential loss of the organizations money michael would have to literally disappear and without money of his own that would not be easy although he knew vinnie was not going to like what michael had to say today he was confident the worst case would be having to suffer a lambasting followed by a threat of some kind with that mildly reassuring thought in mind michael had phoned vinnie to ask for a meeting and vinnie had invited him to the restaurant entering the restaurant michael had to push aside a heavy drape that protected nearby tables from the draft of the open door then he had to let his eyes adjust to the dim interior to the left was a long bar and a lounge area with a fake fireplace in the middle of the room was a sea of varioussized tables all the chairs were upside down on the tables to facilitate the cleaning crews activities to the right were a series of six red velvetupholstered booths which were considered the most desirable tables two of them were occupied at the first were franco ponti angelo facciolo freddie capuso and richie herns michael knew them all from saint marys of all of them franco ponti was the one who scared michael the most it was common knowledge that he was vinnies main enforcer angelo wasnt as well known to michael as he had socialized in another group in high school but his appearance was enough to make michael shiver freddie was the most familiar and richie the least though both were essentially lackeys vinnie at the next table waved michael over sitting with him was carol cirone vinnies girlfriend for years with her bleachedblond bouffant skintight white sweater and string of pearls she looked like a caricature from west side story but no one kidded her about it at least not in front of vinnie mikey vinnie called get over here have you eaten michael passed the table with the hired hands hey guys he said to be respectful they all nodded but didnt speak vinnie took his napkin from his shirt collar pushed out of his side of the banquette stood up and gave michael a hug michael hugged back but felt awkward knowing the news he was bringing was not going to make vinnie happy with one hand resting on michaels shoulder vinnie gestured toward his lunch companions you know carol of course of course michael said michael took the demurely extended hand and gave it an equally demure shake sit down sit down vinnie repeated as he regained his seat in contrast to his diction his voice was more cultured than one would expect considering his line of work and when he lost his temper which was not infrequent it didnt change a characteristic michael found unnerving michael slid in on the opposite side pinning carol between himself and vinnie how about some spaghetti bolognese vinnie suggested and a glass of barolo its ninetyseven and out of this world michael agreed to everything rather than start out on the wrong foot vinnie hadnt changed much since high school where hed always wowed the girls his nickname was the prince his features were full and well sculpted like michael he favored the tailored look and dressed in a suit and tie every day also like michael he prided himself that he weighed the same as he did in high school and worked out regularly to maintain his physique so how are our investments going vinnie asked when it came to business vinnie didnt waste a lot of time michael had been doing business with vinnie for more than a decade it had started small when michael had joined morgan stanley and come to vinnie with the idea of laundering the lucia organizations take from drugs loansharking gambling clubs fencing extortion rings hotcar rings and hijacking mostly from kennedy airport michael had proposed to use the money as venture capital for ipos through a series of shell companies and the relationship had proved remarkably beneficial to both parties michael not only laundered the money but often doubled it whereas previously vinnie had to pay for such a service with everincreasing capital available as vinnie had become more and more comfortable michael had been able on amicable terms to leave morgan stanley and establish his own boutique investmentbanking firm to be truthful michael said in response to vinnies direct question theres a problem i need to talk to you about oh really vinnie questioned with the deliberately calm soft voice that made michaels hackles rise im afraid so michael said his voice had a quavering quality that he hoped only he could hear carol honey vinnie said could you excuse us mikey and i need to talk im not finished with my spaghetti she whined carol vinnie said in a slightly lower tone and looking at her askance oh all right carol responded throwing her napkin on top of her plate but where am i supposed to go wherever you like doll freddie or richie can drive you after watching carol depart michael regained his seat and again faced vinnie who stared him down michael inwardly squirmed i hope this trouble isnt about angels healthcare because if it is im getting a bad feeling vinnie said at length michael cleared his throat and was about to speak when the waiter appeared tableside with a steaming plate of spaghetti a glass and flatware sensing the tension the waiter quickly laid out the place setting poured wine into the glass and disappeared it is about angels healthcare michael admitted angels healthcare needs more money to keep the doors open the problem has been getting rid of the bacteria the bacteria required shutting the ors which turned off the revenue spigot thats the same story i heard a month ago vinnie said although his voice stayed calm his eyes reflected his rising ire my recent loan was supposed to cover expenses until the ipo that was my understanding as well until my ex told me differently an hour ago michael said with the idea of transferring responsibility to her why didnt it happen the ors stayed closed longer than expected keeping revenue down and the disinfecting process cost more than expected are the ors open now yes but it will take a few weeks for the doctors to trust that the problem is over is it over yes thats my understanding your understanding about how much money was needed missed the mark what makes you think your understanding about the infection problem is any more accurate i dont know michael said with a shrug i can only relate what im told how much money is needed to get through the ipo i was told two hundred thousand vinnie went back to drilling michael with his eyes michael flinched first and glanced down at his food under the circumstances he didnt know which was more disrespectful eating or not eating the last thing he wanted to do was irritate vinnie over manners vinnie could be touchy about such issues eat vinnie said breaking the silence michael wasnt hungry but he picked up a fork and struggled to twirl a mouthful of spaghetti im not at all happy about all this vinnie said he leaned forward menacingly im starting to feel like your lackey first you come to me for money next its about an accountant who wants to blab to the feds about the negative cash flow and now its more money when does this end i never expected any of this michael said in his defense but its still a great investment trust me i wouldnt have committed your money if it wasnt ive even hocked just about everything i own to maximize my own position in all honesty i dont care about your money vinnie said i care about the money im responsible for i dont want it to be lost id have a lot of explaining to do the money is not going to be lost michael said decisively even though he wasnt as sure as he sounded worst case is the ipo is postponed i dont want that to happen and im doing my part ive already kicked in an extra quarter of a mil im also dealing with the accountant issue you havent spoken to him michael asked with alarm oh ive spoken with him even franco and angelo have spoken with him hes not being cooperative i wouldnt say that im absolutely sure hes not going to file its just his secretary is an unknown quantity who unfortunately has a copy of the potentially troublesome report it seems we have to talk with her as well id never thought of that michael admitted good idea he was relieved the last thing he needed was the resurgence of a problem hed thought had been solved although michael liked doing business with vinnie he didnt want to know where the money came from or any of the details of vinnies operations michaels imagination was enough which was why he was as nervous as he was in the current imbroglio the point is mikey im certainly doing my part vinnie continued and id like you to do yours if more money is needed to get angels healthcare though the ipo it comes from you but michael started no buts mikey vinnie said calmly interrupting michael weve known each other for a long time but this is business i want this ipo to go through youve been a good salesman and have raised my expectations if the ipo doesnt happen as youve described im going to blame you and well no longer be friends at that point youll be dealing exclusively with franco michael tried to swallow but couldnt his throat had gone dry instead he reached for his untouched glass of wine and took a sizable swig detective lieutenant lou soldano looked at his watch it was almost onethirty in the afternoon which explained why his stomach was growling after leaving the medical examiners office that morning sometime after eight hed driven home to his apartment on prince street in soho and passed out on his couch hed been so exhausted that he didnt even make it into his bedroom when hed awakened at noon all hed had was coffee while he shaved and showered at that point hed called the ocme he was curious about what jack had found on the two homicides whose autopsies lou had skipped jack was still in the pit and unavailable so lou asked to be connected to the nypd liaison sergeant murphy lous biggest concern was the apparently ganglandexecuted unidentified floater what he wanted to know was whether murphy had any leads as to the identity through missing persons there hadnt been any calls about a missing asianamerican male which made lou even more curious one way or another lou was becoming progressively interested in the case in hopes of trying to prevent more bodies from popping up in addition to the way the individual was shot the fact that he had been tossed far out in the harbor strengthened lous conviction that the homicide was organized crimerelated in the spring summer and fall such bodies were invariably buried in the woods upstate in the winter when the ground was frozen they were tossed into the river or if the perpetrators were more resourceful into the harbor or even out beyond the verrazano bridge with his stomach growling lou began to look for a fastfood outlet he was in his old pdissued chevy caprice he had a sentimental attachment to the car as the only connection to his previous life since he was divorced and both his kids were in college my god johnnys sub is still here lou said out loud catching sight of the joint on his left he snapped on his turn signal and quickly slowed only to be blasted by a car horn six inches from his vehicles rear lou rolled his window down and motioned for the irate driver to pass him all the time trying to maintain his composure eventually the guy took the hint and still leaning on his horn passed lou as he did so he gave lou the finger some things dont change lou murmured philosophically he was in the familiar environment of corona in the borough of queens not only had he grown up in the immediately neighboring rego park but when hed been assigned to the organized crime unit of the nypd after having been a patrolman for three years hed spent a lot of time in queens both because he knew the area and because there was a lot of organized crime going on during the six years hed spent in the unit hed been promoted to sergeant and then to lieutenant when he switched to homicide lou made the turn into the restaurants parking area the establishment itself was a mere stand in the middle of an expanse of macadam patrons had to park go up to the window and order when the appropriate number popped up the patron had to hike back to the window and then eat the footlong sub in his car lou could remember patronizing the place in high school when he got his first jalopy fifteen minutes later lou couldnt have been happier as he indulged both his appetite with his old favorite sub called johnnys meatball extravaganza and his nostalgia it warmed his heart to remember coming to johnnys late at night with gina pantanella during his senior year of high school hed parked way in the back had the same sub and then got laid the other reason lou was content was that johnnys was directly across the street from the neapolitan from his years in organized crime he knew the restaurant was the de facto office of vinnie dominick who ran the queens arm for the lucia family lou knew that the fragile equilibrium between the traditionally competing crime powers in the area namely the lucias and vaccarros was being challenged mainly by new asian gangs in flushing and woodside lou had it in his mind to find out if this situation had anything to do with the floater and he zeroed in on vinnie dominick because vinnies counterpart in the vaccarro organization paulie cerino was in the slammer but it wasnt vinnie who lou was going to approach but rather one of his flunkies freddie capuso back when lou was still working organized crime hed recruited freddie as an informer and lou still had something to hold over the kid serendipitously lou had discovered the boy was living a dangerous duplicitous life as a kind of double agent although ostensibly working for vinnie he was passing information to paulie sometimes real sometimes misinformation at the time lou had wondered how the kid could sleep at night because if either side had known what he was up to he would have simply disappeared probably feeding the fish out beyond the verrazano bridge lou wasnt certain freddie still worked for vinnie or if he was still alive but he intended to find out he guessed vinnie was around because there was a black cadillac doubleparked in front of the restaurant the only trouble was that it was a vintage model which lou doubted was vinnies style all at once lou stopped chewing someone emerged alone from the restaurant for a second lou thought it was vinnie because of the hairstyle and the clothes lou was confused because vinnie would never come out by himself but then as the man ran across the street directly at lou lou saw that it wasnt vinnie it was someone lou didnt recognize but who was acting suspicious he was either nervous or afraid as he fumbled with his remote while repeatedly glancing up and down the street and back at the restaurant a second later he was in the car then pulling out into the street where he made an illegal uturn before accelerating with screeching tires in the direction of manhattan lou tried to get the tag number but he wasnt fast enough all hed managed was v and the fact that it was a new york plate lou looked back at the restaurant half expecting one of vinnies men to come bursting out the door in hot pursuit but it didnt happen all was serene lou relaxed back into his seat and took another bite of his sub while he chewed he pondered what the meeting was between vinnie and the vinnie lookalike that had made the stranger as nervous as hed seemed to be lou guessed it was about money and considering the guys clothes and the fact that he drove an suv lou suspected it had to do with gambling and if it did and the guy owed vinnie big money he was in a lot of trouble vinnie and his counterparts didnt tolerate people owing them money for very long if they did the whole house of cards would collapse thinking such thoughts made lou wonder if that was the story with the floater maybe it wasnt indicative of an incipient syndicate war but merely the elimination of a deadbeat all of a sudden lou again stopped chewing a new black cadillac sedan with heavily tinted windows appeared stage right and proceeded to pull up behind the older model in the next instant lou tossed his sub to the side scattering bitesized meatballs on his cars front passenger seat he was out of the door in a flash and across the street as the driver of the cadillac was rounding the cars rear for once luck was on lous side since the driver was freddie capuso and he was alone freddie my friend lou called out freddie stopped and turned as lou came up to him as soon as he recognized lou his face blanched nervously he looked around especially over to the nearby restaurant door gosh lou effused how long has it been freddie old boy the last time lou had seen freddie he was a scrawny kid who artificially held his arms out from his body as if he were musclebound now he was a man well sort of holy shit lieutenant what the hell are you doing here just having a sub across the street for old times sake i used to go there when i was in high school and then i see you pull up what a coincidence nice to see you freddie said quickly but i gotta go not so fast lou said he wrapped a restraining hand around freddies upper arm while lous other hand was holding on to his holstered gun lou knew these people were nasty and unpredictable you could get me killed if im seen with you freddie blurted i could have you killed with a single phone call my friend i just want to talk to you for two minutes my car is across the street in johnnys parking lot lets hightail it over there and we can talk out of sight freddie looked around lou over toward johnnys as if he didnt believe lou and then back at the neapolitans door the longer you put this off the more chance youre taking lou said he gave freddies arm a tug in the direction of lous caprice it didnt take long for freddie to realize that he didnt have a choice he nodded and quickly crossed the street lou followed freddie all the way to the front passengerside door freddie opened it quickly but took one look at the tiny meatballs tomato slices and onion rings fanned out on the seat and said im not sitting in that mess lou glanced around freddie to see what he was referring to i can understand your reluctance lou said he closed the door and opened the back he motioned to freddie to enter then climbed in after him make this fast freddie commanded as if he had a say in the matter ill try lou said ignoring freddies bravado first up whos the current local capo for the vaccarros ive been out of the loop his name is louie barbera but hes only a temp because paulie cerinos supposedly getting out on parole really lou commented hed not heard the rumor about cerino what the hell are you bothering me for with that kind of question freddie grumbled you could learn that from any number of people how do vinnie and louie get along freddie merely laughed is it that bad lou asked vinnie made hay right after paulie got sent up especially with drugs the vaccarros want their old territory back what about the asians hispanics and russians they are getting to be a pain in the ass for everyone all three groups mainly the asians bringing in drugs from the east rather than south america it was rumored there was an apparent hit last night lou said finally getting around to the point do you know anything about it he purposefully didnt want to give any of the details freddies eyes flicked over toward the restaurant door in a nervous fashion which for lou was a giveaway from his years of experience he guessed skinny freddie knew something i dont know anything about no hit freddie said unconvincingly come on dont make me threaten and dont make me call vinnie for old times sake okay i know there was a hit last night but thats all i know about it please dont drag this out i dont know who it was honest all i know it was some guy who was going to rat what was the victim going to rat about and to whom who knows are you pulling my chain here or what honest im telling you all i know which is close to zilch vinnies upset about something but i have no clue he doesnt talk about such things except to franco ponti lou eyed the hopeless kidturnedman in one sense he felt sorry for him because lou was sure he was going to end up in a dumpster some night hed been playing two ends against the middle but wasnt intelligent enough to carry it off over the long haul in another sense lou was angry with him because like all these other misfits the shithead was abetting a tiny group of people who made all italian americans look bad all right lou said after a pause i want you to find out who this guy was who got whacked i dont want a war breaking out between the lucia and vaccarro factions which is what im worrying about theres no way for me to find out any such thing vinnie is tightmouthed if i asked him anything hed know something was screwy dont ask him ask franco that would be worse than asking vinnie you know the guys crazy figure out a way lou said he reached across freddie and opened the door april pm lauries eyes were glazed over as she stared blankly out of the taxis side window as it raced northward on second avenue she was totally preoccupied with her mrsa series which had started out as a possible way of convincing jack to postpone his knee surgery but which had morphed into something else entirely she still intended to use the issue with jack but now she sensed there was a wider significance and the possibility electrified her her conception of the role of the medical examiner was to speak for the dead to help the living suddenly she saw her current series as a means to do just that if she could figure out why these mrsa deaths were occurring in such a cluster she could presumably save potential victims thinking in such a vein had a disheartening aspect why hadnt the ocme picked up on the problem sooner laurie pondered the question for a moment before guessing the reason a low index of suspicion which laurie assumed would have influenced her too concerning david jeffries had the personal aspect not intervened laurie knew that as many as ten percent of all patients entering the hospital come away with a hospitalacquired infection meaning about two million patients a year resulting in nearly ninety thousand deaths in the united states alone of these infections about thirtyfive percent were staph many of which were mrsa in short the problem was just too common to cause much of a stir especially with bacteria on the rise a sudden crash jolted laurie from her reflections had she not had her seat belt on her head would have hit the ceiling sorry the cabbie said glancing at laurie in his rearview mirror to see if she was okay potholes from the winter laurie nodded she appreciated the apology as unexpected as it was but not the driving style maybe you could slow down she suggested time is money the turbaned driver answered knowing the futility of trying to influence the taxi drivers mindset laurie went back to her musing she was on her way to the angels orthopedic hospital which was sited on fifth avenue on the upper east side and surprisingly enough approximately directly across central park from where she and jack lived over the previous two hours shed been frantically busy and despite a mild fear for her life in the cab she appreciated the forced respite and time to organize her thoughts that the ride offered shed finally been able to meet with arnold besserman and kevin southgate and had gotten the names of their six cases and four of the six case files and hospital records arnold had even given her the personal monograph hed written on mrsa which laurie had quickly read laurie now knew more about the bacterium than shed ever known even more than she had just before taking her forensic pathology boards for which she had crammed in her old collegiate style with all sorts of esoteric facts including some about mrsa and other staph organisms as agnes had said staphylococcus aureus was an extraordinary and versatile pathogen with the accession numbers of arnolds and kevins cases plus those of george fontworth laurie had relayed them all to agnes finn laurie wanted agnes to retrieve their frozen samples for culture and subtyping just as she was already doing with lauries case that morning and rivas cases laurie thought it was important to see how closely they all matched laurie had then made some important phone calls with the numbers cheryl had gotten for her first she called loraine newman at the angels orthopedic hospital laurie found her as accommodating as both arnold and cheryl had described the woman graciously agreed to a meeting that very afternoon at twothirty next laurie had called a woman at the cdc by the name of dr silvia salerno who was associated with the cdcs national library of mrsa strains that had been formed to identify genetic patterns in the subtype in hopes of influencing prevention and control strategies in addition she was part of the cdcs webbased national healthcare safety network and had been the person to whom riva had been referred it was she who had had rivas isolates subtyped if i am not mistaken they were a communityacquired mrsa or what we call camrsa silvia had said when laurie had asked if she remembered the cases let me look it up okay here it is camrsa usa four hundred mwtwo sccmeciv pvl now i remember it very clearly that is a particularly virulent organism maybe one of the most virulent weve seen particularly with the pvl toxin do you recall dr mehta mentioning that her two cases came from two separate hospitals i dont i assumed it was the same institution it was definitely two hospitals does that surprise you it suggests the two individuals knew each other or they each knew a third person meaning you believe these were not nosocomial infection technically for an infection to be considered nosocomial the patient has to have been in the hospital for more than fortyeight hours but thats only a technical definition i mean the patients could have gotten them from the hospital of course the definition is more for statistical reasons than scientific but getting such an infection within twentyfour hours of admission would suggest to me that they were part of the patients own flora laurie described her series all of whose victims had died of mrsa within twentyfour hours and of those whose subtyping was available had died of communityacquired mrsa which silvia said backed up her contention that the bacteria were most likely brought in by the patients regardless silvia had specifically said she was interested in the cases and had been surprised not to have heard of the cluster offering to help in any way she could she took lauries directdial office number and promised to get back to her after shed asked around to see if anybody at the cdc had heard about the outbreak shed also promised to have a second look at rivas samples to determine if they were the exact same strain or merely close finally laurie had called the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations cheryl had not been able to get her a specific person to talk with and after laurie had been switched around numerous times each time being given the name of someone else who could supposedly help her she had given up defeated for the moment by the bureaucratic mindset arriving at her destination the taxi pulled up to the curb and stopped and laurie handed over the fare and the tip as she climbed from the cab she looked up at an impressive modern highrise of greentinted glass held in place by vertical ribs of green granite the name angels orthopedic hospital was inscribed into a pedimentshaped marble lintel over the front doors a liveried doorman stood on the sidewalk a sloping driveway led to a receiving dock a service entrance and a multistory parking garage in the rear the interior was even more impressive it was more like walking into a ritzcarlton than a hospital exactly as jack described that morning the floor was a mixture of hardwood and marble and the information booth looked like a concierge desk with two uniformed men sitting side by side in suits and ties but what caught lauries eye more than the decor was the lack of people there was no hustle and bustle like a normal hospital other than the two men at the information booth there were only two people in the large lounge area sitting opposite each other on opposing elegantly upholstered couches laurie went up to the information booth and received the full attention of both gentlemen she asked for loraine newman mentioning her name and that she had an appointment certainly maam one of the men said he picked up the phone and after a brief conversation directed laurie to a pair of interior doors to the left of the bank of elevators miss newman is waiting for you in administration laurie followed the directions and pushed through the designated doors the administration area was more utilitarian than the lounge area but still sumptuous compared to any hospital laurie had ever been in it was a wide long room with glassenclosed offices on either side each fronted by individual secretarial desks most all the desks were occupied but it didnt appear that much work was being done only a few of the secretaries were typing into their monitors while most were chatting in subdued tones one of the secretaries caught sight of laurie and asked if she could help her but before laurie could respond a glass door to an office opened and an energetic woman wearing a white coat over a brown turtleneck sweater and skirt called out to her she introduced herself as loraine newman before ushering her inside let me have your coat loraine said she was lauries height and build and even approximate age but had different coloring compared to lauries blond complexion please take a seat she said as she placed lauries coat on a hanger and hung it inside a small closet laurie sat down and loraine went behind her desk and did the same ive never met a medical examiner loraine said with a smile im awed by what you guys do we dont get out much laurie said most of our scene work is done by our forensic investigators she inwardly winced recognizing bingham would surely not appreciate what she was doing how can i help you loraine asked i suppose you are here because of yesterdays unfortunate mrsa death that and more laurie answered i did the autopsy on mr jeffries this morning the extent of his infection was dramatic to say the least especially how quickly it consumed him you have no idea how upset we are and not only about the tragic loss of a life of an otherwise healthy man but also because it has occurred despite our making maximum effort to prevent it i heard from one of my colleagues the efforts that you have been making i imagine it must be discouraging especially since you have apparently had eleven such cases discouraging is not a strong enough word did you find out anything at autopsy that might help us when you called i was hoping that was going to be the case im afraid not laurie admitted then why did you come over laurie squirmed in her chair although the tone of the question was far from hostile laurie found herself questioning exactly why she was compelled to make the visit and for a moment felt foolish i didnt mean to put you on the spot loraine said sensing lauries discomfiture its okay laurie said after i did the autopsy this morning i found out essentially by accident about all the other cases occurring over the last three and a half months i just felt i had to do something im afraid the ocme has let you and the rest of the city down by not being aware of the outbreak its part of our job not to let something like this fall through the cracks i appreciate your sense of responsibility but in this case i dont think it matters we certainly have been aware and believe me we have done everything possible and when i say everything i mean everything including the hiring of a fulltime infectioncontrol professional and as the chairperson of this hospitals interdepartmental infectioncontrol committee i personally jumped on the problem from day one weve had input from everyone including our medical staff nursing engineering laboratory you name it our committee has met just about every other week since the first mrsa case we even shut down our ors for a time and halted all surgery and invasive procedures so i heard laurie said i dont have much training in epidemiology but there are several things about this outbreak that bother me such as laurie took a moment to organize her thoughts she was afraid she might sound naive since she truly only had the basics in epidemiology for one thing it has continued despite all your efforts at control secondly many of them are like jeffries primary pneumonias which i believe is unique for staph third they have apparently been occurring in only angels healthcare facilities you do know that your sister hospitals are experiencing cases as well of course ive had multiple meetings and frequent communication with my counterparts at our heart hospital and at our cosmetic surgery and eye hospital i was also the one who strongly encouraged angels healthcares ceo dr angela dawson to hire the mdphd infectioncontrol professional to coordinate our efforts specifically because the problem was happening in all three of our institutions is that dr cynthia sarpoulus thats correct why do you ask i recall one of my me colleagues mentioning her name he spoke to her a month or so ago shes one of the leaders in our specialty and coauthored a major text on hospitalinfection control programs i was sure that when i heard shed been hired wed be out of the woods but it hasnt happened it hasnt happened loraine agreed well back to my amateur concerns laurie said id hardly call you an amateur doctor loraine said with a smile please continue an hour or so earlier i talked with a doctor at the cdc shed had the opportunity to subtype the staph from two of your cases that occurred more than a month ago at different hospitals using rather sophisticated genetic typing they proved to be the same she promised to confirm that with tests of even higher specificity and get back to me to my informally trained epidemiological brain and contrary to what she thinks it suggests to me a carrier is involved a carrier who visits both hospitals do any of the angels healthcare personnel regularly visit all your hospitals wow loraine remarked she laughed in a fashion that indicated she was impressed are you teasing me about not having epidemiologic training just the required exposure for my pathology residency laurie said we have definitely considered a carrier to be the source of the problem in fact so much so that we have repeatedly cultured everyone medical staff service personnel and particularly those individuals who regularly visit all three of our hospitals one of the ways that our ceo founder conceived of keeping expenses down was to have centralized services like laundry engineering laboratory nursing and food service each service has a department head whose office is at angels healthcares central office but who travels on a regular schedule to all three hospitals these people have been tested repeatedly for the exact reason youve suggested has anybody tested positive absolutely about twenty percent positive which is what one would expect in the normal population in fact slightly more on the medical staff and everybody who tested positive has been treated with mupirocin until they tested negative did any of them test positive for the communityacquired mrsa oh yeah quite a few do you know if the subtype was the same as what killed your patients our subtyping was by a vitek system and only for antibiotic resistance and yes some were the same antibiotic resistance is not particularly sensitive in terms of differentiating substrains im aware of that but since we treated anyone positive for staph we didnt think it mattered maybe so laurie said did you have any of the isolates typed by the cdc no we didnt why that was a decision made by the home office i suppose because we were treating everyone who was positive as i said so that characterizing it more served no purpose also we were already instituting every known infectioncontrol procedure did you let the cdc know you were experiencing this mrsa outbreak we did not how about the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations did you notify them no we didnt the jcaho only needs to be notified if our overall infection rate goes above four percent over our designated surveillance period which is what laurie watched loraine hesitate as if laurie had asked a state secret you dont have to tell me if you feel uncomfortable laurie added i dont even know why im asking and i dont know why im hesitating anyway it is a year interval but your rate could be above four percent if you considered the last three months its possible loraine agreed but ive not stopped to figure it out how about the new york city board of health laurie asked i presume you let them know of course loraine said and the city epidemiologist dr clint abelard has made several site visits he was impressed with everything we were doing and didnt have any suggestions which is not surprising since we had tried everything very interesting laurie commented she felt better about coming for her visit since loraine hadnt ridiculed her about any of her thoughts at the same time she was reluctant to mention any of her more outlandish ideas how about a tour your hospital is truly elegant and not like any other ive ever seen sure loraine said without hesitation we all are quite proud of it especially since we are all owners really laurie questioned how so our ceo dr dawson gave all the employees a little stock when we signed on its not much but there is a certain symbolic value actually that might change for the better in the near future the company is scheduled to go public in a few weeks if all goes well our tiny amounts of stock could actually be worth something well ill say a little prayer for the ipo thanks loraine said the rumor is that it is going to do very well can we do the tour now laurie asked certainly loraine said she stood and opened the door leading to the area occupied by the secretaries laurie followed what is it youd like to see loraine questioned as they left the admin area and emerged into the main lounge its fancier than other hospitals but otherwise basically the same but no emergency room right no emergency room were a surgical hospital we dont want beds taken up with medical patients how about an intensivecare unit not an intensivecare unit per se if that kind of care is needed we can isolate part of the pacu or postanesthesia unit if the pacu is too full we send patients to the university hospital it saves a lot of money im sure it does laurie agreed but the idea of a surgical hospital not having a fullfledged icu bothered her they paused out in the main lobby area standing in front of the elevators i cannot help but notice how quiet it seems to be laurie said there are so few people thats because our census is very low which has been progressive since the mrsa problem began of course the worst was when the ors were completely shut down during that period we had the entire hospital staff including the president disinfecting everything but the ors are open now yes they are open now except for the or where mr jeffries was operated on was he the only case done in the room yesterday no he wasnt there were two others after mr jeffries and they are well perfectly fine loraine said i know what you are thinking it has us baffled as well since your census is low does that mean some of your staff doctors are choosing to do their surgery elsewhere im afraid so what about dr wendell anderson hes one of the brave ones or should i say loyal hes still operating here on a regular basis laurie nodded while fantasizing about tying jack to the bed during his sleep wednesday night more than ever she did not want him to have his operation what is it youd like to see loraine repeated how about starting out with your hvac system loraine did the equivalent of a double take are you joking im serious laurie said are the operating rooms and the pacu on a separate system from the main part of the hospital absolutely loraine said this is a stateoftheart facility the hvac for the operating rooms is designed to change each ors air every six minutes there would be no need to do that for the whole hospital even the laboratory area has its own system although not with that kind of flow id still like to see it laurie said particularly the or system well i dont see why not they boarded a waiting elevator loraine pressed the button for the fourth floor she explained that the second floor was for outpatient services the third was the or and pacu as well as central supply and the fourth was for the laboratory and engineering engineering included hvac and the supply of various gases for the ors and bedside all the floors higher than the fourth were for patient rooms the very top floor was a special vip section which had slightly larger rooms and more expensive decor the service she insisted was the same are all the angels healthcare hospitals similar laurie asked essentially identical as will be the six hospitals slated soon to be constructed three each in miami and los angeles my word laurie said simply she was impressed with the edifice but bemoaned that its luxury represented the enormous amount of money essentially being stolen on an ongoing basis from fullservice hospitals like university or even general which were already struggling to make ends meet angels healthcare like other specialty hospitals was interested only in the paying patients with acute problems not the uninsured or the chronically ill not only that the fortunes being made by the businessmen owners were also being sucked out of the healthcare system and unavailable for patient care here we are loraine said as the elevator door opened engineering is to the left in contrast to the elegant fivestar hotel decor of the lobby the fourth floor was the epitome of hightech minimalist design everything was gleaming highgloss white and the hallway was spotless the womens shoes clicked on the composite flooring and the sound echoed off the bare walls there were no pictures no bulletin boards only closed white doors the only color came from citymandated institutional exit signs with red letters at either end of the lengthy corridor i think i know why you are interested in seeing our hvac system loraine said as they walked really laurie questioned she wasnt entirely sure herself what she knew of hvac was the little shed absorbed while the renovation of her and jacks brownstone had been under way you are thinking of airborne route of infection which is another suggestion as far as i am concerned you are not the epidemiological amateur you profess to be but let me reassure you we have considered it also and we have tested the water in the condensate pans for staph aureus on multiple occasions including just this morning after yesterdays tragedy have any of the tests been positive no none loraine said emphatically staph is not considered an airborne pathogen but that did not stop us from considering it and even though the tests were negative weve drained all the pans and treated them i didnt think staph was spread by the airborne route either laurie said but the fact that a number of the cases seemed to have been primary pneumonias suggested the route of infection had to be airborne i cant argue with that loraine said at least not from an academic perspective but i can from a practical one i chair an interdepartmental infectioncontrol committee which is just as its name suggests interdepartmental we have people from all departments such as nursing food service engineering and so forth currently our representative from the medical staff is a surgeon and when we were discussing the possibility of the staph being spread via the airborne route and believing the hvac would be involved he set us straight on an important fact patients undergoing endotracheal or laryngealmaskairway anesthesia which all do in our hospitals when they have general anesthesia neve breathe operatingroom air the air they breathe always comes from the pipedin source they never breathe ambient air laurie questioned there went her only theory as to how the mrsa victims were getting sick never loraine confirmed loraine stopped at one of the closed doors an eyelevel white plaque with incised black letters said engineering its going to be a little loud in here she warned laurie nodded as loraine pushed open the heavy insulated door once inside laurie scanned the large utilitarian highceilinged room the walls and ceiling were concrete a tangled web of piping some insulated and some not snaked out of various multicolored tanks and hung from the ceiling much larger ducts did the same after exiting or entering air handlers the size of small cars each of which was mounted on rubber shocks anything in particular youd like to see loraine shouted which handlers service the ors laurie shouted back loraine led laurie down the relatively narrow walkway between the meticulously maintained equipment halfway to the opposite wall loraine stopped and patted the side of one of the air handlers this is the one the coolant comes from the condensers on the roof and the hot water comes from the furnaces in the basement how do you access the condensate pan this access door loraine yelled she grabbed the handle and had to pull hard to break the suction when the door opened they heard a whistling noise laurie stuck her head into the opening and the wind wildly tossed her hair in all different directions she had to grasp it to keep it out of her face thats the condensate pan down there loraine shouted while pointing over lauries shoulder to the base of the machines innards laurie nodded she was interested because she knew airconditioning condensate pans were a frequent source of airborne outbreaks such as legionnaires disease she turned her head downstream into the mouth of the efferent duct where she could see a mesh screen is that a filter laurie yelled there are two loraine answered she closed the door to the coils and it snapped shut she took several steps forward there were two vertical slitlike openings she pointed to the two of them with both index fingers the first is a standard filter for relatively largesized particles the second is a hepa filter for particles down to the size of viruses and to anticipate a question we have on multiple occasions tested the hepa filters for staph only twice did we get a positive result was it camrsa laurie questioned it was but it was not meaningful why because the hepa filter stopped it whats that access door beyond the hepa filter thats the cleanout port of the efferent duct we have all the ducting cleaned once a year after about six feet the efferent duct split like the tentacles of a squid into multiple smaller ducts each going to a separate or the pacu and surgical lounge laurie could tell because each was labeled with an incised formica plaque same as the main duct each had a cleanout port when were the ducts cleaned last when the ors were shut down laurie nodded looking down toward the end of the walkway between the equipment she saw another door where does that door lead another hvac room pretty much the same as this one except that it also houses our electrical generators beyond that is a doorway into a vestibule with a pair of service elevators and a back stairwell laurie nodded again and then walked back to the other side of the air handler that served the ors similar to the efferent side there was a cleanout port for cleaning the return duct she then looked back at loraine and shrugged her shoulders i cant think of any more questions its a very impressive system and thanks for the lecture on air handlers you seem to know your stuff part of our training in hospital infection control included learning more than we wanted to know about heating and ventilation loraine yelled she then pointed back the way theyd come as soon as the heavy insulated door closed behind the women the silence of the seemingly empty hospital enveloped them like an invisible blanket laurie tried to fix her hair which at the moment gave her the appearance shed been out riding in a convertible id like to see a patient room laurie said provided you have the time i dont want to monopolize your afternoon with as few patients as we have currently i certainly have the time how about david jeffriess room i think its being thoroughly cleaned we can look in but im sure housekeeping will be there then another room will be fine five minutes later laurie stood in one of the standard rooms in keeping with the fivestar hotel decor in the lounge area the room was equivalently decorated and furnished the bed and the rest of the furniture were hardly the usual hospital issue the television was a flatscreen model which was set up without extra charge to have blueribbon cable service as well as internet access there was even an upholstered couch that unfolded into a bed in case a family member wanted to stay over but what impressed laurie the most was the bathroom oh my goodness she said as she glanced in it was done in marble and had a second flatscreen tv do you have trouble getting some patients to leave its far better than my bathroom i can assure you of that with no specific reason to visit the room laurie made a mild show of inspecting the position of the vents in the room for the hvac system there were several high near the ceiling and several low near the baseboard it was the same in the bathroom i guess thats it laurie said any other part of the hospital youd like to see well laurie said hesitantly having had her rather vague but pet theory that the mrsa victims were being infected in the or trashed by a combination of the presence of the hepa filter and even more so by learning the patients undergoing general anesthesia never breathed ambient air laurie was convinced her site visit was a complete bust from the standpoint of solving the mystery of the mrsa outbreak she certainly hated wasting any more of loraines time even though the woman was graciously accommodating even to the point of seeming to enjoy giving the tour laurie could tell she was proud of the institution you are not keeping me from anything loraine said guessing the reason for lauries hesitation if thats the case then i suppose i wouldnt mind seeing the or area particularly one of the ors itself well have to change into scrubs i do it every day as they retraced their steps back toward the elevators laurie noticed the paintings lining the walls were real oils and not prints while they waited for an elevator laurie glanced at the nearby nursing station behind it was a bank of hightech flatscreen monitors enough to serve every room all were dark four nurses and an orderly were relaxing at the station three were in desk chairs the other two sitting on the desk itself there was intermittent laughter they are acting as if there are no patients on this floor laurie said there arent loraine responded thats why i brought you here knowing how expensive it is to run hospitals id hazard that the cfo whoever he or she is must be sweating bullets that i dont know luckily it is not my responsibility and i dont often talk with the bigwigs has anyone lost their job i dont believe so a number of people have taken a voluntary leave of absence but the administration is counting on the low census turning around immediately our ors are all back online except the or david jeffries was operated on in it wasnt open for today while its being thoroughly cleaned but it will be open tomorrow laurie was tempted to ask if the morrows patients scheduled for that particular or would be told of david jeffriess fatal experience but she didnt it would have been a provocative question to which laurie already knew the answer too often patients were denied information that they had the right to know if the concept of informed consent was to be truly honest the decor of the or floor and the or suite itself except for the doctors lounge looked to laurie as she expected a nasa building to look aseptically functional it was also like the hall above all white with the same composite floor the walls however were tile in contrast the doctors lounge was mostly soothing green and also in contrast to the rest of the hospital there was a lot of activity in the or area because the day shift was leaving and the evening shift arriving the womens locker room was equally lively loraine gave laurie a set of scrubs and directed her to a locker while both women changed laurie overheard a short conversation loraine had with an acquaintance who was going off duty loraine asked her if thered been many cases that morning it was slim pickings the woman said im afraid everyone is getting a bit bored with all the sitting around we were only running two out of the five rooms five minutes later laurie and loraine pushed into the or and the double doors swung closed behind them cutting off the chatter from the surgical lounge to lauries left was a blank or scheduling blackboard which suggested there were no cases under way to lauries right was the or desk fronted by a chesthigh countertop behind which laurie could see just the tops of two hooded heads beyond the or desk was the open doorway into the pacu the central corridor stretched out approximately eighty feet to a far wall loraine advanced to the desk and the two women seated behind looked up dr sarpoulus loraine said she was surprised to see her infectioncontrol superior i didnt know you were here is there some reason you should know cynthia questioned with an edge to her voice well no i suppose not loraine responded she switched her attention to the other woman whose nametag read mrs fran gonzales or supervisor fran i have a guest here who wanted to take a peek at our or loraine motioned for laurie to step up to the counter and loraine introduced her as a new york city medical examiner before fran could respond cynthias head popped back up shed returned to studying the or scheduling log which she and fran had been busily doing before laurie and loraine had appeared you are a medical examiner she questioned with even more edge to her voice than when shed spoken with loraine i am laurie confirmed what the hell are you doing here im ah laurie began but hesitated she was taken aback by cynthias tone and challenging glare laurie couldnt help but remember arnolds description of the woman as not being terribly cooperative as well as defensive and essentially telling him to butt out the last thing laurie wanted was some sort of a confrontation knowing she was to a certain extent overstepping her bounds by making the site visit steve mariott the evening pa had visited the hospital the night before after jeffriess death had been called into the ocme well cynthia questioned impatiently i autopsied a case this morning of a patient whod been operated on yesterday here at angels orthopedic hospital and who had died of an exceptionally aggressive mrsa infection we are well aware of that thank you very much cynthia snapped laurie glanced briefly at loraine who appeared as surprised as laurie when i canvassed my colleagues i discovered youd had a number of similar cases i thought it was appropriate to come over here and see if i could help cynthia laughed cynically and just how did you think you could help have you been trained in epidemiology infection control or even in infectious diseases my training is in forensic pathology laurie said defensively my exposure to epidemiology has not been extensive but my understanding is that in an outbreak of this sort one of the first things that should be done is to accurately subtype the organisms im boardcertified in internal medicine with a subspecialty in infectious diseases and have a phd in epidemiology as far as your comment about subtyping you are correct but only if such information is needed to decide on a targeted method of control in our situation it wasnt needed since our ceo insisted that we use a global control strategy our interest was not in saving money by restricting ourselves to a target approach i spoke with one of your colleagues a number of weeks ago after hed autopsied one of our mrsa cases i assured him we were well aware of the problem and aggressively engaged in solving it and thanked him for the call thats all well and good laurie said with her own dander rising having had the dubious honor to autopsy the unfortunate individual this morning i can say with some conviction that you have been unsuccessful in your control efforts that might be the case but we surely dont need interference your job is to tell us cause of death and anything else we might not know pathologically the fact of the matter is that we are well aware of both the cause and mechanism of death and we are doing everything humanly possible to control this unfortunate outbreak what is it you wish to accomplish by visiting the operating room what do you want to see to be totally honest i dont know laurie said but i can assure you that there have been thousands of times that site visits have either helped or been crucial in a forensic investigation mr jeffries is officially a medical examiners case and i am dutybound to investigate it fully which in this case means viewing the scene of his proximate cause of death odds are he was exposed to the bacteria that led to his demise in the operating room where hed had his surgery well see about that cynthia said getting to her feet ill have you talk with someone with considerably more authority than i i insist you wait outside in the surgical lounge i will be right back without another word or even a glance over her shoulder cynthia walked quickly to the double doors and departed laurie and loraine exchanged another surprised and confused glance im sorry loraine said i dont know whats come over her its certainly not your fault she is under a lot of pressure fran the or supervisor said shes been intense from the first and its only gotten worse shes taking the whole problem very personally so try not to do so yourself dr montgomery shes even been at my throat on occasion who is she going to fetch loraine questioned mr straus the hospital president i have no idea fran said lets go back to the lounge loraine suggested to laurie i think that might be a good idea laurie said she felt anxious from an adrenaline surge engendered by the unexpected confrontation and its potential consequences as they walked loraine added dr sarpoulus has always been uptight as fran suggested are you sure you want to stay she was very rude ill stay laurie said with some misgivings what motivated her was the hope of being able to smooth things over with someone more rational than cynthia sarpoulus leaving on an unpleasant note certainly would not be helpful if she had additional questions and there might even be a complaint made about her visit laurie specifically wanted to avoid such a possibility back in the surgical lounge laurie accepted some coffee and crackers from loraine as busy as shed been shed skipped lunch and was famished so it was the ceos decision not to characterize more fully the staph strains involved in the outbreak i guess loraine said i thought it had been cynthias decision but i guess not laurie had more questions but her thoughts were interrupted by cynthias reappearance by her expression her mood had not mollified her sharply defined full lips were pressed firmly together and she walked with obvious determination behind her came a man and a woman the woman was of medium height with blemishfree pale skin aristocratic features and a helmet of short thick hair she was dressed in an elegant business suit and walked with a decidedly commanding resoluteness while still managing to exude classic femininity the man was her antithesis not only in gender but in his general appearance and the way he moved he wore a rumpled plaid wool jacket with leather elbows the kind that laurie had always associated with academia instead of resoluteness he projected an air of wariness with his pale eyes constantly on the move as if he were in a potentially hostile environment dr montgomery cynthia said triumphantly may i present dr angela dawson the ceo of angels healthcare and dr walter osgood department head of clinical pathology i believe you should direct your comments to them what seems to be the trouble angela demanded from her tone it was obvious lauries presence was not to her liking im afraid i have no idea laurie said as she got to her feet since they were nearly the same height she and angela literally saw eye to eye loraine scrambled to her feet if there is any fault concerning dr montgomerys presence surely it is mine she said dr montgomery called me after she had autopsied mr david jeffries she asked to come to the hospital for a visit as part of her investigation i invited her she only asked to see our or hvac system in the engineering spaces a typical patient room and the or itself i didnt see any problem in that i suppose i should have run it by mr straus beforehand as president of the hospital that would have been wise angela agreed it would have saved us this embarrassment then turning to laurie she said you do understand that this is private property i understand laurie said but david jeffries is a medical examiner case and by law i have subpoena power for documents and whatnot and to visit the scene in order to investigate fully the cause and manner of death there is no doubt legal recourse for you to carry out your duty but barging in here is not one of them someone has already visited us from your office the previous evening and was shown appropriate hospitality i will be very happy to discuss this with the chief of the ocme dr harold bingham whom i have had the pleasure of meeting on several occasions laurie felt a chill descending her spine despite knowing she ultimately had the legal right to make the visit the very last thing she wanted was for bingham to be dragged into this ridiculous brouhaha over nothing especially since she knew from past experience hed probably side with the hospital thank you for your industriousness angela continued im sure your motivation was to help us but as you can imagine this problem has taken a terrible toll not only on some of our patients but on our institution and frankly we are inordinately sensitive to the crisis when i call dr bingham i will mention that we are not averse to you or anyone from the ocme visiting our or but we will require a warrant and that whoever is designated be tested as a carrier for mrsa as part of our attempt to deal with this horrible problem we insist that everyone entering the or suite be clean i had not thought of that laurie said with a touch of guilt never once did it cross her mind that she could be a carrier herself especially from having autopsied an individual just that morning who was chockfull of the bacteria we on the other hand are extremely aware of it but the point is we are not trying to limit your investigation at the same time we are certain your visiting our or would not be enlightening in the slightest the epidemiologist for the new york city board of health dr clint abelard who is a public servant like yourself has inspected our or on two occasions and found nothing of course he wasnt allowed in until it was assured that he was not an mrsa carrier i wasnt aware an epidemiologist had been involved until i got here laurie said obviously hes much more qualified than i im sorry to have caused any misunderstanding i hope i havent inconvenienced you too much you havent dr sarpoulus dr osgood and i were here attending the monthly medical staff meeting its not as if we had to come all the way from our home office im pleased theres one other point i wanted to make you have questioned our decision not to accurately subtype the particular strains of the involved mrsa causing us such havoc to explain ive asked dr osgood to accompany me to meet you i know dr sarpoulus has alluded to the reasons but dr osgood can explain it better as he is boarded in both clinical pathology and microbiology its important for you to understand we have done every possible thing in our power to rid ourselves of this problem anything else would be irresponsible fifteen minutes later angela and cynthia were in a cab heading south on fifth avenue walter had stayed behind to meet with the orthopedic hospitals laboratory supervisor angela and cynthia had ridden in silence with angela staring out the side window of the taxi and noticing that the trees of central park had the very first suggestion that spring was around the corner but angela was thinking less about nature and more about her problems with angels healthcare which seemed to grow with each passing day the last thing she expected at this late date was a problem with the medical examiners office the concern was publicity which had been a worry from the start back when the mrsa cases first occurred shed made it a point to contact the chief medical examiner to convince him that they were on top of the problem to the extent of having reported it to the new york city department of health and encouraging the epidemiologist to come to the hospital angela turned to cynthia what was your take on that medical examiner did she strike you as an independent sort absolutely why else would she come out and visit our hospital when there was no mystery about the cause of death i didnt like her there while were trying to keep a lid on this affair thats why i came down to get you i thought it was something you should handle im glad you did i considered her a threat the moment i laid eyes on her i dont know exactly why but she struck me as very focused and driven and to compound it very intelligent did you see how she made eye contact most people caught in a similar circumstance would have been cowed to some degree she did the same to me cynthia said i definitely challenged her the moment i heard she was a medical examiner she worries me angela admitted if she manages to get any of this mrsa problem into the press it will certainly come to the attention of institutional investors as part of their due diligence if that happens more than likely the ipo will have to be postponed or if its not it certainly wont be successful i think you did a terrific job talking to her you think so really i do first you mixed just enough condemnation and commendation threat and praise to put her off balance second your warning about calling her boss definitely affected her negatively i dont think she will be making any more visits whether announced or not and finally you made her understand that there are a number of people working on solving the problem who have much more epidemiological training than she has im sure she feels shed fulfilled her responsibility i hope you are right angela said not fully convinced im sure i am i was impressed you were brilliant you really played her like a violin angela shrugged she wasnt so sure her intuition was telling her the opposite and that dr laurie montgomery was going to be a problem angela wondered if she should talk to michael about her but then after another short session staring out the taxis window angela suddenly pulled her cell phone from her louis vuitton bag slipped it open and speeddialed her secretary loren get me dr harold binghams number to cynthia she said i want to be totally certain dr laurie montgomery behaves dr walter osgood was nervous the whole time hed been talking with his supervisor of the angels orthopedic hospitals clinical laboratory simon friedlander he kept thinking about the surprise visit from the woman medical examiner hed explained to her why hed advised not to bother testing the mrsa to determine their explicit subtype the woman had nodded repeatedly as if shed understood yet he sensed she hadnt agreed it was subtle but definite and it worried him when hed finished the meeting with simon which had been stressful because of his nervous preoccupation with dr laurie montgomerys visit walter asked if he could use simons office to make a private phone call sitting at the mans desk he noticed a family photo one of simons sons was the same age as walters only child before making his call walter picked up the framed photo so he could see the boys image more clearly he was an obviously healthy child with a shock of unruly blond hair and a purposefully silly but happy expression walter fought off a sudden surge of sadness anger and envy he put the photo back down closed his eyes and took a deep breath to rein in his emotions involving the unfairness of life at the moment his son was far from healthy having been diagnosed with a rare severe form of hodgkins disease requiring what his health insurer deemed experimental treatment at the moment walters son had no hair and had lost a quarter of his former weight opening his eyes walter took out his wallet and extracted a small piece of paper with a single phone number with a washington dc area code it was supposed to be for emergencies only and he debated if this qualified making a sudden decision he picked up the receiver and dialed on the other end the phone rang a number of times and walter wondered what hed say if he got voice mail just when he thought the phone wouldnt be answered it was a deep wary voice said what is it there was no hello this is walter osgood walter began but he was immediately cut off are you on a landline i am hang up and call this number the voice said he rattled off a phone number and hung up walter rapidly wrote the number on the edge of an envelope addressed to simon he then dialed the number the same voice immediately answered you were not supposed to call me unless there is an emergency is that the case how do i know what constitutes an emergency walter snapped as far as im concerned if it isnt now it will be what is it a new york city medical examiner by the name of laurie montgomery came to the angels orthopedic hospital asking questions why is that an emergency shed autopsied a patient whod died yesterday from mrsa she wanted to go into the or and had even been up in the engineering spaces so what thats easy for you to say i dont like it the next thing it could be in the papers whats her name again dr laurie montgomery from the office of the chief medical examiner what are you going to do i dont know but ill keep you informed and you do the same the line disconnected walter glanced at the receiver as if it could answer his question then he lowered it into its cradle the strangest part was that he didnt even know the mans name walter carefully erased the phone number hed written on the envelope on simons desk before walking out into the lab lauries taxi was now speeding south on second avenue toward the ocme and running the lights but instead of concern about her safety other than being certain her seat belt was secure laurie was obsessed with her surprising visit to angels orthopedic hospital nothing had been as shed expected the edifice was far more luxurious than shed imagined and the cast of characters had run the gamut from congenial to rude and the ceo of angels healthcare whom she never expected to meet was definitely in the latter category laurie wondered if the woman would act on her thinly disguised threat to call bingham under new york city law a medical examiner definitely has the right while investigating a case to do what is needed to protect the public and visiting an or where there had been eleven infectious deaths over three months would certainly fall into that category if anything the visit had only intensified her urge to talk jack out of his surgery at least until the mrsa mystery had been solved although angela dawson had expressed a remorse for the toll the outbreak had taken on their patients she seemed just as concerned about the institution itself it was as if the two were equivalent which shocked laurie she could not believe that under the circumstances the hospital was continuing to do surgery that the reduced revenues were on a par with lost lives the ceo had been introduced to laurie as a doctor which laurie had assumed to be medical doctor but now she thought it must be phd not md it just didnt seem possible for her to be otherwise she tried to focus on the outbreak but the contradictions were confusing although she knew the airborne spread of staphylococcus was possible it wasnt common mainly because staph cannot be aerosolized like anthrax or other airborne bacterial threats staphylococcus remains viable for a very short time outside a warm moist nutrientrich environment and when a few errant molecules did land within someones nose or mouth it behaved itself admirably and almost never caused problems yet in her series of mostly primary pneumonia it had to have been airborne and it had to have been a large dose but that meant the patients had to have been exposed in the operating room to a relatively large amount of the pathogen the trouble with that scenario was that the hvac system was outfitted with hepa filters that caught viruses a hundred times smaller than bacteria and even if a few got through the air in the or changed every six minutes on top of that the patients undergoing general anesthesia never breathed the ambient air in short laurie told herself it was impossible her series could not happen either naturally or purposefully we are here at your destination maam the cabbie said through the plexiglas divider laurie paid the fare and still in a semitrance from the staphylococcus conundrum climbed from the cab and mounted the steps of the ocme once inside she was surprised to see marlene still at her post arent you supposed to be off duty at three laurie questioned my relief called in to say she was going to be a few minutes late marlene said in her soft southern accent laurie nodded and headed toward the id room door excuse me dr montgomery im supposed to tell you when you come in that dr bingham wants to see you in his office asap laurie felt her face flush intuitively she knew that angela dawson had to have already called and complained about her visit with lauries longstanding aversion to confrontations with superiors she was not looking forward to being called on the carpet if that was what was about to happen it wasnt that she felt guilty in any way it was her fear of losing control of her emotions such a reflex response had started when she was a preteen and had never entirely gone away at that time she had suffered a horrific confrontation with her autocratic father who had unjustly blamed her for her older brothers death from a drug overdose since that awful episode it was as if her response to confrontation was hardwired and beyond her control as she approached binghams secretary mrs sanford she could feel the involved synapses firing and setting herself up for the fall you are to go right in mrs sanford said laurie glimpsed the secretarys face as she passed by the womans desk in hopes of getting a hint of what to expect but mrs sanford seemed to avoid eye contact shut the door dr montgomery bingham bellowed from behind his massive and cluttered desk laurie did as she was told the chiefs use of such formality suggested the worst sit down he said equally forcibly laurie sat she could tell her face was flushed but she had no idea how obvious it was she hoped it wasnt what bothered her the most about her reflex emotionalism was the concern that people would interpret it as a sign of weakness laurie knew she was not a weak person it had taken a while for her to be sure of it but now that she was sure it rankled her that she couldnt control behavior that suggested otherwise im disappointed in you laurie bingham said with a slightly more mellow tone im sorry to hear that laurie said although there was a slight quaver to her voice she felt encouraged shed managed to hold back any embarrassing tears you have been so dependable of late whats happened im not sure i understand your question i just got off the phone with a dr angela dawson she was furious that you showed up unannounced at one of her private hospitals demanding entry into unauthorized areas she even threatened to call the mayors office having overcome her emotions for the time being laurie allowed a more appropriate irritation to emerge in her mind bingham should have been commending her resourcefulness and supporting her rather than siding with a businessperson who was obviously more concerned about her institution than her patients well bingham demanded impatiently understanding that it was as important to control her anger as her tears laurie calmly explained why she had gone to the hospital and what she had learned about the mrsa deaths that were occurring at angels healthcare hospitals despite commendable infectioncontrol efforts she told bingham that she hadnt arrived unannounced but had been invited by the chairperson of the infectioncontrol committee who had been hospitable and happy to give laurie a tour bingham harrumphed into a partially closed fist he studied laurie with his rheumy eyes he was laurie thought partially mollified by hearing the other side of the story how many times have i or dr washington told you that it is ocme policy that the pas do the footwork and that you as a medical examiner stay here and do the cases several times laurie admitted ha bingham barked without exaggeration it has to be more like a half a dozen times we have worldclass forensic investigators you are to utilize them let them slog through city hospitals and crime scenes we need you here if you are not busy enough i can rectify that im busy enough laurie averred thinking about all the cases she had outstanding waiting for additional information to come in then get back to work and get more cases signed out bingham said with a ring of finality and stay away from angels healthcare hospitals with the matter taken care of he reached into his in box and pulled out a handful of letters that needed his signature laurie stayed in her seat bingham ignored her as he began to read the first letter sir laurie began may i ask you a few questions bingham looked up his face registered surprise that laurie was still seated in front of him make it fast i couldnt help but be surprised you werent more taken by the number of these mrsa cases that i mentioned and the fact that the how and the why have not been determined frankly i am mystified and concerned they are obviously therapeutic complications bingham said the how i have no idea although i know several epidemiologists are working on it and the number well i knew there were quite a few but i was not aware it had reached the twenties how did you hear about them from two sources first from dr dawson several months ago she wanted me to know that shed contacted the department of health and had the city epidemiologist on the case then from a surgeon friend of mine hes one of the investors in the company as well as on the angels orthopedic staff in fact he had been doing most of his affluentpatient cases there before this mrsa problem started hes been keeping me abreast of the situation because a year or so ago hed talked me and calvin into picking up some of the founders stock what laurie demanded you are an investor in angels healthcare certainly not a heavy investor bingham said when my friend jason recommended it because he had learned it was going to go public i had my broker check it out he thought it looked promising he actually took a larger stake than i lauries jaw slowly dropped open she stared at bingham with astonishment whats got into you bingham questioned why are you acting so surprised specialty hospitals are serving a need im shocked laurie admitted do you know this dr angela dawson i cant say i know her id spoken with her as i just mentioned and even met her at a mayoral function shes very impressive why do you ask is she an md or phd shes an md she has her boards in internal medicine laurie was even more taken aback you have a strange expression laurie what are you thinking im thinking it is a little weird for you to be essentially ordering me to stay away from angels healthcare hospitals when you are an investor and there is a problem going on the web of capillaries on binghams nose dilated i resent the implication he boomed out i dont mean to sound insubordinate laurie added quickly im actually thinking of your best interests it might be best for you to recuse yourself you better be careful young lady bingham snapped patronizingly while pointing one of his thick fingers at laurie lets get this straight im not in any form or fashion restricting your investigation of your case especially not for my investment im just telling you not to go to those hospitals yourself angering politically connected people and putting me in a difficult situation all im saying is to use the forensic investigators to do your legwork as ive been telling you for years are we clear on this quite clear laurie said but id like you to know that my intuition is telling me there is something decidedly odd going on maybe so bingham reluctantly agreed he was clearly more irritated now than when laurie had first arrived now get out of here and get back to work so that i can get back to mine laurie did as she was told but before she could open the door bingham called out actually its my recollection your intuition has always been right so keep me informed and for gods sake stay away from the press ill do that laurie promised there had been a few times in the past when she had unknowingly leaked confidential information to the media in the elevator on the way up to the fifth floor laurie couldnt decide if she was pleased with herself for holding back her tears or disgusted with herself for provoking bingham she was leaning in the direction of the latter it had served no purpose whatsoever to accuse him of impropriety she didnt believe it herself her response had been from shock that her own chief was supporting an organization whose ethics seemed questionable at best with both her emotional and her rational brain in turmoil laurie bypassed her office for jacks she needed a little reassurance from having been abused by bingham and the powerful and politically connected angela dawson but jacks desk chair was disappointingly empty wheres jack laurie asked chet whose eyes were glued to his microscope he hadnt heard her come in hes out on one of his field trips chet said looking up from his work meaning you know jack the more controversy the better he posted a case where the three involved stakeholders are at each others throats over the manner of death it was a construction worker at a highrise site who fell ten stories onto concrete i know the case laurie said whats he up to as irritated as laurie had made bingham she hoped jack would be discreet a virtue he often ignored how should i know he said something about reenacting the crime but short of his jumping off the building himself i have no idea what he meant when he comes back tell him i was looking for him will do chet said agreeably laurie was about to leave when she remembered to ask chet about his mrsa case right chet responded jack had mentioned you were interested in it so i got it out he pulled himself along his desk with his chairs casters squeaking shrilly enough to make laurie wince he grabbed a case file from the top of his file cabinet and handed it to her the name was julia francova terrific laurie exclaimed im glad you still had it she slid out the contents to make certain it was another angels healthcare case whats the big interest i had a similar case this morning laurie explained there have been quite a few over the last three months or so twentyfour to be exact it hadnt appeared on anyones radar screen since the cases have been widely distributed among the staff including cases in queens and brooklyn i didnt know about any others chet admitted nor did anyone else im looking into it and im psyched there is something weird about these cases and im going to figure it out if it kills me ive already managed to provoke our fearless leader let me know if i can help the reason i still have the case is that ive been waiting for the cdc to get back to me before signing it out dont tell me you sent an isolate for subtyping laurie questioned while trying to keep her excitement in check i did i sent a sample to a dr ralph percy i got him through the cdcs central switchboard thats more than terrific ill call dr percy for you and ill put the results in the case file it will save you a step eager to add yet another name to her matrix laurie again tried to leave this time chet called her back i took your advice you gave me this morning and called my new lady friend this afternoon chet said and what happened i was shot out of the sky and i was as direct as you suggested i be i put my ego out there on the table but she blew me off i had even sent some flowers to soften her up but no luck was she rude no actually im exaggerating she was pretty nice about it even though i stuck my foot in my mouth with my opening ploy she had confided to me the evening before that she was desperately trying to raise a couple of hundred thousand dollars for the company she works for i started the conversation by saying id found the money in my bedside table and i wanted to invest bad strategy obviously she said she felt i was mocking her i think i would have felt the same laurie agreed how did you leave things openended i gave her my cell phone number shes not going to call laurie said with a wry chuckle thats asking too much youd be making her feel like the aggressor you have to call her back and apologize for your supposed joke you mean i should call her back after she shot me down twice if you want to go out with her you have to call if she didnt want you to call she would have said so when do you think i should do it whenever youd like to see her its up to you do you think i should call her back again today i mean isnt that a little too pushy i wasnt a party to your conversation laurie said but you said you left things openended theres a slight risk she might be perturbed but i think the chances are better than even shell be flattered call her take a chance laurie said as she backed out into the hall obviously you want to see her what do you have to lose the rest of my selfesteem oh baloney laurie said heading toward her office chet put his hands behind his head and leaned back staring up at the ceiling he felt indecisive yet he trusted lauries counsel she was smart intuitive and above all female with sudden resolve he tipped forward got out the postit note on which hed written the number of angels healthcare and placed the call he wanted to do it quickly before he lost his nerve as on the previous call he had to go through the operator to get angelas secretary then after identifying himself appropriately he was put on hold while he waited he debated whether to be humorous or serious but ultimately decided to be merely straightforward when angela finally came on the line he simply told her that hed been thinking of her and had just had another conversation with his colleague whod again urged him to call when angela didnt immediately respond chet quickly added i hope im not annoying you i was reassured that wouldnt be the case she said there was always a small risk but that in all likelihood youd be flattered when i told her i had given you my cell number she laughed and said you wouldnt call it sounds to me that your colleague is socially astute im counting on it chet said anyway im calling for two reasons the first is to apologize for my earlier insensitive attempt at humor thank you but an apology is not necessary actually i overreacted because i am a bit desperate and preoccupied your apology is accepted whats the second reason for your call i thought id ask you out to dinner again i promise it will be the last time but you have to eat and perhaps a break from your routine will give you some fresh insight to where you can find the capital you need your persistence is indeed flattering angela said with a chuckle but i really am wickedly busy but i appreciate the call especially since i imagine as a doctor you still have a waiting room full of patients that might be true chet said slipping into his defensive humor but they are all dead really angela questioned she assumed there was humor involved but didnt get it i dont understand im a medical examiner chet answered it was supposed to be funny actually im free anytime this evening starting now what i have left to do i could always come back later to finish do you work here in manhattan i do ive been here for twelve years i know its not as sexy as being a brain surgeon but in my book its intellectually more challenging every day we learn something and see something weve never seen before neurosurgeons pretty much do the same thing every day truthfully doing craniotomies day in and day out would drive me batty i suppose the company you work for employs clinical pathologists chet trailed off unsure how angela was responding to his line of work in his experience women were either fascinated or turned off there was little middle ground unfortunately angela didnt respond to his last sentence which was purposefully a half question for a moment there was a pause which progressively made chet uncomfortable he worried hed made a faux pas by bringing up his medical specialty are you there angela chet questioned yes im here angela responded so you work at the ocme under dr harold bingham thats correct do you know him to a degree do you also work with a dr laurie montgomery i do in fact she just left my office its funny you should ask she happens also to be my social adviser you know i just remembered something angela said to change the subject just a few minutes before you called id had a call from my daughter she called from her best friends house shed been invited to stay for dinner and was asking if she could i said yes does that mean that you might be rethinking your evening plans chet questioned trying not to get his hopes up it does angela said maybe you are right about a change in routine and you are certainly right about the need to eat today i only managed a sandwich on the run does that mean youll join me for dinner why not angela said as a declarative statement not as a question for the next few minutes they discussed a time and place at angelas suggestion they decided on the san pietro on th street between madison and fifth chet had never heard of it but angela told him it was one of those bestkept new york secrets she said shed make a reservation for sevenfifteen and chet agreed with alacrity april pm it had not been a good day for ramona torres age thirtyseven mother of three children ranging in age from five to eleven her husband had awakened her at the first blush of dawn in order to drive her to the angels cosmetic surgery and eye hospital for her surgery it was so early that she had to wake the children to say goodbye once at the hospital he had had to drop her off at the posh entrance where the doorman had relieved her of her overnight bag she had waved as he pulled away to return home to the bronx and see that the children had their breakfast before school she really would have preferred that hed come in with her to lend moral support ramona had always had a general fear of hospitals but her fears had been significantly magnified during her last hospitalization by the difficult delivery of her youngest child the rocky postpartum course during which she had almost died had required emergency surgery although it had been carefully explained to her after the fact that the venous embolism shed suffered had not been anyones fault and that everything had been done to avoid such a complication ramona had still blamed the hospital even ramonas husband an attorney had been unable to change her opinion such that when ramona had entered the hospital that morning her heart had been beating faster than usual and the perspiration dotting her forehead had not been from being too warm as ramona had changed out of her clothes and donned the traditional hospital garb in the samedaysurgery area she had been tense and had tried to hide her trembling from the nurses and nurses aides if someone had asked her what she was afraid of she wouldnt have been able to tell them although suffering another venous embolism would have been high on the list also on the list was undergoing anesthesia the idea of another person no matter how well trained being in control of whether she lived or died was enormously unsettling mistakes happened and ramona did not want to be another mistake as a medical secretary she had had more than enough knowledge of all that could go wrong with such a mindset ramona had almost changed her mind about having the surgery while she had waited on the gurney in the admitting area but then her vanity had intervened with her last child shed experienced a significant weight gain which had never melted away as it was supposed to in fact it had substantially worsened to the point that ramona herself admitted she was obese although ricardo her husband had never said anything about being disenchanted she knew he didnt like it she didnt like it herself especially when her oldest javier said it embarrassed him since ramona had struggled to restrict her caloric intake she had reluctantly decided on liposuction which a friend had had with great success hoping for a similar result ramona had visited her friends plastic surgeon and shed been scheduled after a threeandahalfhour operation ramona had awakened vomiting and as unpleasant as that had been things got progressively worse the only high point had been a quick visit with ricardo whod taken time off from the office to visit when ramona had been moved from the postanesthesia unit to her luxurious room hed not been able to stay long which ramona did not regret because shed been remarkably uncomfortable shed not been able to find a position that didnt aggravate her pain and her painkillers which she could selfadminister seemed to have no discernible effect whatsoever then a halfhour after ricardo left shed suffered a shaking chill the likes of which shed never experienced it started in the core of her body and then spread out to the very tips of her fingers alarmed at such a development and with her teeth chattering shed immediately called the nurse who had responded quickly with a blanket the nurse also had taken ramonas temperature and recorded it as degrees a respectable fever its not uncommon the nurse had said with an extensive liposuction like yours its as if you have a very large wound even when all you can see are the small incisions on your skin ramona had been content with that explanation until the moment when more disturbing symptoms emerged all at once she was aware of a vague feeling of pressure in her chest an urge to cough and a sense that she couldnt quite get a full breath of air if ramona had not had the experience with venous embolism after her last delivery she might not have panicked as she did she reached for her call button and pressed it repeatedly mrs torres you only have to ring once the nurse admonished as she quickly came into the room and arrived at ramonas bedside ramona explained her symptoms and her fear of having a pulmonary embolism the nurse rapidly retook her temperature which had climbed only a tenth of a degree and retook her blood pressure which was mildly lower am i having an embolism ramona anxiously asked i dont think so the nurse said but im going to call your surgeon just the same at that moment ramona coughed which she had been trying to avoid because any movement aggravated the postoperative pain when she coughed and expectorated into a tissue she saw something that alarmed her even more it alarmed the nurse as well the considerable mucus was bloody through and through and not merely streaked april pm it had been one of those frustrating days for detective lieutenant lou soldano the only positive thing that had happened was learning from jack that his detective sergeant friends daughter was apparently off the hook as far as being charged for murder and likewise for the boyfriend in the other case but in the case lou was really into hed gotten nowhere he still had no idea who the asian floater was even after a lot of effort he didnt even know for sure whether the guy was american after his powwow with freddie capuso where he learned that the victim was whacked because he was about to rat about something lou had driven back to headquarters where he sought out sergeant detective ronnie madden in organized crime ronnie had not heard about the hit so he couldnt add anything instead hed given lou some background on louie barbera including the fact that as a cover he ran a restaurant in elmhurst called the venetian ronnie confirmed freddies opinion that relations between the lucia and vaccarro organizations were hardly copacetic but a turf war was not imminent lou then went to missing persons to see if they had made any headway identifying the victim they hadnt and lou got the impression they were waiting for a missingperson report to come in and do their work for them lou tried to suggest that it might be important to be a bit more proactive but it got him nowhere lou had even forced himself to go over to the fbi which he was generally loath to do he hated the way they acted superior as if they thought of themselves as the aristocrats and the pd as a bunch of ignorant commoners in contrast to missing persons they had yet to be alerted about the case lou tried his best to do that but they said theyd prefer to hear about it through official channels meaning leave us alone because were too busy to look into your particular lowbrow pet project at this point lou got the idea of going back out to queens to visit louie barbera as he drove over the queensboro bridge he admitted to himself that hed become fixated on a single case to the detriment of all the others he had pending but it was his personality to do so whenever he got involved in a task which he thought would be easy but wasnt he took it personally such was the case in the current situation and as he got off the bridge and into queens he was doggedly committed to finding out the who the why and the wherefore of the asian floater come what may lou found the venetian on elmhurst avenue without difficulty it was part of a relatively new strip mall sandwiched between freds dvds and genes liquor store lou parked in the small lot in front of the strip two cars down was the traditional black cadillac which made lou smile the midlevel wiseguys made an attempt to be nondescript so as not to stand out and then they all drove the same vehicle it didnt make sense although in this particular instance it gave lou the encouragement that louie barbera was available the first thing lou noticed when he walked in were all the black velvet paintings of venice hed recalled such paintings in italian restaurants when he was growing up but hadnt seen any for some time he also noticed that all the tables had redandwhite checked tablecloths which was also a throwback the only things the venetian lacked were the old chianti bottles with candles and several years worth of drippings clinging to the sides were closed a voice said out of the gloom there was very lowlevel illumination and coming in from the sunshine lous eyes had to adjust when they did he could make out five men playing cards at a round table espresso cups dotted its surface ashtrays were overflowing i assumed so lou said im looking for louie barbera i was told i could find him here for a moment all five people sat like statues finally one of them who was directly facing lou said who are you detective lieutenant lou soldano of the nypd im an old friend of paulie cerino lou thought he saw the group stiffen at his announcement but it could have been his imagination i never heard of him the same man said well no matter lou said are you louie barbera i might be id appreciate a moment of your time with merely a nod from louie the four men seated with him stood up two went to the deserted bar the other two moved over to the wall opposite the bar everyone had taken their playing cards with them louie gestured toward the seat directly opposite him and lou sat down im sorry to interrupt your game lou said eyeing the mans ordinary clothes and overweight body he obviously wasnt at the same level as vinnie dominick no matter why are you looking for louie barbera i want to ask him a question like what like whether theres any more than the usual animosity between the lucia people and the vaccarro people and why do you want to know theres a rumor on the street that thered been a professional hit last night now when something like that goes down and the victim happens to be associated with one of the two families hostile feelings can boil over resulting in a major blowup we at the nypd dont mind if you professionals bump each other off but we get aggravated when innocent people get hurt then wed have to come out here and clean things up am i making sense youre making sense louie conceded but i dont know anything about any hit are you sure i mean i have your best interests in mind its always better to keep the peace for your real line of work and for mine too im a restaurateur what do you mean my real line of work lou thought for a minute he was tempted to tell the bozo sitting in front of him that an identity game was a pitiful waste of time but he thought better of it he coughed into his closed fist and then said then let me put it this way are you sure all your waiters busboys and kitchen help are going to show up today particularly those of asian extraction louie leaned back and called over to the men lounging on the bar stools hey carlo has the whole staff checked in today everybodys accounted for carlo said there you go lieutenant louie said lou stood up and took out one of his business cards he placed it on the table in case you suddenly hear something about the hit give me a call he then headed for the door a few paces away he turned back into the room id also heard a rumor that paulie cerino is getting out on parole give him my best we go way back ill do that louie said as soon as the door closed the four hoodlums returned to the table taking the same seats they had vacated earlier carlo paparo was seated directly to louies right he was a muscular man with large ears and a pug nose he wore a black turtleneck under a gray silk sports jacket and black slacks did you know that clown carlo asked id heard of him from cerino but id never met him paulie hated him so much he loved him apparently theyd butted heads for so long theyd come to respect each other hes got balls just showing up like this none of the cops in jersey would do such a thing without a partner and backup swat team waiting outside louie had been recruited from bayonne new jersey to fill in as boss for the vaccarro queens operation in bayonne hed run a similar but smaller enterprise when hed made the transition hed brought over his most trusted underlings including carlo paparo who had been with him the longest brennan monaghan arthur macewan and ted polowski tuesday and thursday afternoons they played penny ante unless there was something big going down have any of you guys heard anything about vinnie dominick and his pack of assholes knocking anybody off everybody shook his head i think we ought to check it out louie said the detective is right we dont want any trouble with the police nosing around just when were about to jack up operations especially cops from downtown most of the local guys we can handle but even that might change if the big boys come causing trouble how do you propose to check it out we could contact that skinny freddie capuso brennan suggested it would cost a few bucks but he might know who got bumped off hell know shit carlo said half the time we used him it turned out he gave us crap hes just a damn gofer i think we should tail franco ponti for a few days louie said if vinnie needs somebody whacked he always uses franco and if theres to be more killing id like to know sooner rather than later whos getting bumped off the lucias are causing enough trouble in general i dont want them ruining our expansion plans itll be easy to follow franco with that ancient hog he drives around arthur macewan said giving everybody a good laugh francos car was famous in the neighborhood with its blackandwhite foam dice and a picture of him and his then girlfriend maria provolone at the senior prom hanging from his rearview mirror its the tail fins that crack me up ted polowski said whats it from the nineteen fifties you know im liking this idea of tailing ponti better and better louie said while thinking over his own suggestion remember last year when we were wracking our brains about how they get their drugs into the city and never figured it out we never thought of tailing ponti carlo said knocking his forehead with the heel of his hand how come we were so stupid i mean we tried everything else maybe this little episode will have an unexpected payoff louie said not knowing how prophetic his comment would turn out to be when should we start carlo asked my mother god rest her soul always said dont put off until tomorrow what you can do today yeah yeah carlo said because today is yesterdays tomorrow brennan arthur and ted smiled wanly like a lot of louies pet sayings theyd heard both of the proverbs one too many times time is money louie said raising his eyebrows teasingly he knew his minions found his adages sappy all right carlo said well have to do this in shifts ill start who wants to come along ill come brennan said keep me posted louie said april pm armed with yet another mrsa case from chet laurie retreated to her office still marveling that a series of infections were occurring despite the fact that it was impossible for them to be doing so and it made her wish shed studied more epidemiology during her training silently she reiterated to herself the primary reason it couldnt be occurring first off the patients were all seemingly healthy and healthy people usually could deal with a small number of staph being introduced into their nose or mouth ergo for primary pneumonia to occur there would have had to have been a large enough dose of staph introduced in a relatively short time to overcome the patients natural defenses but as laurie had learned that very day the hvac systems of the angels healthcare hospitals were designed so that such a scenario could not happen above and beyond the fact that staph cannot be aerosolized it was impossible for there to be a sudden surge of airborne bacteria in a room whose air intake was through a hepa filter whose air was changed every six minutes and whose occupants were tested clean for mrsa and who were all wearing surgical masks from an epidemiological and scientific perspective laurie became progressively concerned that the mrsa problem in the angels hospitals could not be caused naturally and that understanding led her to the more unsettling notion that the outbreak had to be deliberate then suddenly laurie had an idea there was one person in the or who could conceivably manage to cause the pneumonias and that was the person giving the anesthesia with control of the airway and often ignored the anesthetist or the anesthesiologist could conceivably manage in some devilish fashion to introduce secretly enough viable staph deep into the respiratory tree to cause the fatal pneumonia with a sense of urgency laurie snapped up her matrix and was immediately relieved the matrix was at an early stage but even with the small number of entries she had she saw that there were different anesthetists and different anesthesiologists but then she had another thought what if it wasnt a single person but rather a cabal of anesthetists or anesthesiologists who were involved in some sort of vicious contract dispute with angels healthcare but the second shed conceived the conspiracy theory she dismissed it as the product of how desperate she was to find an explanation she even mocked herself for entertaining such a ridiculous paranoid hypothesis and she immediately vowed not to confess to anyone especially jack that she had thought of such a thing and after shed returned to rationality she realized the hypothetical bad guys couldnt be anesthetists or anesthesiologists because a number of the cases were not primary necrotizing pneumonia but rather fulminant surgicalsite infections resulting in toxic shock syndrome having run out of ideas laurie went back to expanding her matrix and filling in the blanks when shed first walked into her office there was a note from cheryl stuck on her monitor screen that indicated that most of the records laurie had requested from the various angels hospitals were in her email inbox and that the rest should arrive the following day laurie had also found the packages sent from the me offices in brooklyn and queens containing the files of their six cases and in a separate envelope the case files of the two missing cases of besserman and southgate which had not been in their office when laurie had gotten the four others laurie went into her email and scrolled through all the hospital records cheryl had amassed for her one by one she queued them up and sent them to the printer down in administration for ease of reading she wanted hard copies next she organized the cases by hospital considering case files and hospital records she had a lot of information which made her wonder if she should computerize her matrix although the idea had merit she decided to stick with the simple legalpad variety for the time being when she thought shed allowed enough time to pass she made a rapid trip down to the computer room and retrieved the stack of printed hospital records on the way back up in the elevator she noticed it was nearing five and wondered if and when jack would be returning as she got out on the fourth floor to stop in and see agnes in the microbiology lab she pulled out her cell phone to make sure it was turned on in case jack called it was conceivable he might be closer to home than to the ocme on his field trip as chet had called it and head home afterward rather than return to the office were making headway agnes said laurie had caught her in the process of putting on her coat to go home it had been another of her normal tenhour days agnes went over everything she had done which included reaffirming that all the cases in lauries series were definitely methicillinresistant staphylococcus aureus she then ticked off where she had sent david jeffriess samples for more definitive subtyping the state reference lab the cdc and ted lynch in the ocme dna lab she advised laurie that the cdc would be more efficient than the state reference lab and that laurie could expect to hear from them in two to three days four tops agness comment about the cdc reminded laurie that she had meant to call dr ralph percy about chets case but a glance at her watch suggested she might be too late after quickly thanking agnes for everything she was doing laurie dashed up a flight to save time since shed not gotten the number from chet she had to call directory assistance for the main cdc switchboard when the cdc operator connected her to the doctors line laurie got voice mail damn she murmured before dr percys outgoing message had terminated the doctor had already left for the day and laurie was irritated at herself for not having called the moment shed returned from chets after the beep laurie gave her name her directdial number the patients name and the fact that she was interested in the mrsa typing hed done for dr chet mcgovern then as an afterthought she mentioned she was a medical examiner and a colleague of dr mcgovern whats going on riva asked shed returned to the office while laurie had retrieved her printed documents and had overheard lauries voicemail message its been one busy day laurie complained i wanted to talk to someone at the cdc but hes left for the day theres always tomorrow riva said i hope you are not trying to aggravate me laurie said such a patronizing comment reminded laurie of her mother oh no if anything i was trying to calm you down you look frazzled i know youve been preoccupied most of the day thats an understatement laurie said she then told riva what shed been up to all day and why she wanted to talk with the doctor from the cdc what about the woman at the cdc i dealt with riva suggested did you call her i did she was helpful and said shed get back to me why not try her im certain shed have access to chets case good idea laurie said she had silvia salernos number on a postit stuck to the edge of her monitor as the directdial connection went through she glanced at her watch it was now significantly after five once again she got voice mail on this occasion she didnt leave a message since the woman had already agreed to call her back laurie hung up the phone and shook her head two for two riva said lightly they must have a curfew at the cdc laurie laughed rivas comment about the worldrenowned cdc amused her as unlikely as it was and laughing for possibly the first time all day made her realize how tense she was riva stood up and took her coat from behind the door i think i will follow the cdcs example and head home working with bingham this morning on the police custody case exhausted me oh yeah laurie said as preoccupied as ive been i forgot to ask you what the outcome was not good for the police or the city riva said although it could turn out to be a windfall for the family the hyoid bone was fractured in several places so there was obviously excessive force the only good part is that bingham will take over the inevitable political and legal fallout thats true riva said we pathologists can only say it was a homicide whether justified will be up to a jury with her coat on riva said goodbye but before she left laurie asked if there are any more mrsa cases over the next week while youre assigning cases would you give them to me i certainly will riva said before leaving laurie turned back to her desk with the three stacks of case files from the three angels healthcare hospitals and the stack of printed hospital records over the next three minutes she combined the case files with their hospital records there were still a few hospital records missing as cheryl had indicated putting her matrix in front of her laurie picked up david jeffriess hospital record and began reading as she read she filled in the boxes that shed not been able to do without the hospital record since she still felt the operating room had to be where he was infected she read through the anesthesia record paying attention to the detail when she did so she came up with some additional categories that she had not thought of earlier namely the or room number how long the operation took duration of time spent in the pacu and which drugs were given in the pacu reading through the nurses notes she found the names of the scrub nurse and the circulating nurse with a ruler she made more vertical lines to create boxes for this additional information when she finished with david jeffriess hospital record she reached for another it happened to be one of paul plodgets patients a fortyeightyearold man named gordon stanek like jeffries he was a patient of angels orthopedic hospital and as shed done with jeffries she used the hospital record to fill in the boxes of her matrix as shed noticed earlier with rivas two cases the anesthesiologists were different unsurprisingly she recorded that the other people involved with the patient including the surgeon and the nurses were also different as was the operating room itself even the anesthesia was different although both patients had general anesthesia the agents employed were different there was also a difference in the way the anesthesia was administered jeffries had had an endotracheal tube while stanek had had a laryngeal mask airway laurie sat back and glanced first at her matrix then at all the case files and hospital records it was going to be a long process in the end what she hoped to find was some kind of commonality they all shared laurie was about to pick up another hospital record when a rhythmic thumping coming from the hallway caught her attention it was low in pitch and distant and had the building not been as quiet as it was since it was after five laurie might not have heard it straightening up in her chair laurie cocked her head to try to hear better although the beat stayed the same it was becoming progressively louder it was as if someone was beating on the floor with a rubber mallet and coming closer and closer irrational fear spread through laurie like a jolt of electricity the thought of jumping up and slamming and locking her door flashed through her mind yet she was frozen in place hey sweetie jack said as he appeared in the doorway and proceeded into lauries office on his crutches leaning over he gave her forehead a kiss youll never guess what ive been up to he leaned his crutches up against rivas file cabinet and sat down in her chair ive been having a ball he added and started to explain but then stopped in midsentence when he looked closer at lauries expression he leaned forward and waved his hand in front of her face hey hello anybody home laurie batted his hand away as quiet as it is around here you and your crutches scared me she said not sure for the moment if she was more relieved or miffed how did i do that jack asked with confusion because laurie started to say but then realized with some embarrassment how ridiculous it was for her to have been frightened by the sound of jacks crutches on the corridors vinyl floor she guessed it was a symptom of how overwrought she was im sorry jack said laurie reached out and gave his knee a pat you dont have to apologize if anybody is to blame i am ive had one hell of a day no matter jack said regaining the excitement with which he had arrived i wanted to tell you what ive been doing for the last couple of hours id like to hear laurie said but you see all these case files and these printouts of hospital records on my desk of course i see them jack interrupted its hard to see your desk underneath them but first let me tell you about the case you passed up i think we should talk about these cases on my desk laurie said in a minute jack snapped then in a more normal tone he said god youve got such a onetrack mind youre the one to talk about a onetrack mind laurie thought but did not say sometimes jack could be a lesson in patience control im the visitor im the one who came to you so my story goes first okay fine laurie intoned in frustration anyway thanks for passing up the rodriguez case youre welcome laurie said insincerely the cause of death was straightforward as im sure you assumed it would be i mean the victim a construction worker fell ten stories onto concrete from a building under construction can you get to the point laurie complained jack stared at laurie for a beat youre in a crummy mood no im just a little impatient to talk about something which with due respect i think is more important okay okay jack said so as not to hear about this for a week tell your story no i agreed for you to talk first so finish just pick up the pace jack smiled wryly before continuing the internal exam showed all sorts of blunttrauma injury including detached heart ruptured liver and bilateral compound fractures of the femurs but i knew that wasnt going to help with the manner of death so i visited the scene i hope you didnt cause your own scene laurie quipped because i did a site visit myself and inadvertently caused a scene which has bingham spitting bullets not diplomatic me jack said actually everyone had a ball what i did was fill a plastic body bag with sand courtesy of the contractor so that it was the same weight as the victim then up on the tenth floor i hope you didnt climb ten stories on your injured knee laurie interjected no jack said as it if was totally out of the question they took me up in the construction elevator up there i checked where the guy was working when he fell ironically enough he was putting up temporary guardrails with a guy down on the ground with a stopwatch we first rolled the bag off the ledge like what would happen if mr rodriguez had accidentally fallen and do you know how far away from the building the bag ended up i cant imagine six feet and it took two and a half seconds when we heaved the body bag off as if he were pushed or leaped on his own accord guess where it landed in twopointsix seconds please just tell me your story twentyone feet on the nose pretty cool huh it proves it wasnt an accident what if he stood at the edge of the building closed his eyes and took a baby step wouldnt happen he wouldnt want to hurt himself by hitting the building on the way down youre sure of that i am i thought about it myself once a few months after the plane crash oh laurie merely said it was an area she didnt want to revisit at the moment jack still struggled with depression on occasion im going to sign the case out as suicide do you know why i cant guess laurie said why despite her initial pique she was interested why not homicide he could have been pushed or thrown because on external exam he had healed scars across both wrists hed attempted suicide before this time he used a more efficacious and guaranteed method very interesting laurie said with questionable sincerity now can i speak of course jack responded but i think i know what you are going to say do you laurie questioned with a touch of superciliousness you are going to tell me by the looks of all these case files that there has been a surge at angels orthopedic of mrsa postoperative infections and that i have to cancel my surgery or at least reschedule it for some indeterminate later date am i close you are right on the nose laurie said but smarty pants i think you should hear the details cant we do it over a bite to eat somewhere along columbus avenue i want to tell you now laurie insisted these mrsa cases are truly a mystery in my opinion what is happening actually cannot be happening either naturally or intentionally jacks eyebrows raised when laurie mentioned the idea that the mrsa was being spread intentionally he asked her if she truly thought it was possible when she said yes he didnt dismiss the idea out of hand laurie had a track record of ferreting out several equally bizarre situations some years earlier that everyone else had dismissed okay lets hear the unexpurgated version and i promise not to interrupt first laurie handed over her unfinished matrix and then went on to tell jack everything she did that day and everything shed learned and everything that was pending she finished up with there shouldnt even be a discussion whether or not you should proceed with your operation you shouldnt plain and simple well im sorry that blowhard bingham gave you a hard time i think your visit to the angels orthopedic hospital should be a source of commendation certainly not the opposite im intrigued myself by all you have told me except for your final conclusion now dont argue with me laurie had tried to complain i let you speak without interruption so let me have the same courtesy i have been proactive today anticipating your attempting to change my mind so ive learned some things as well first off these mrsa infections in your series are not technically nosocomial since they are not within the time period of fortyeight hours thats true laurie agreed but that definition is more for statistical purposes the fortyeighthour limit is because infections within that time very often are from organisms carried in by the patient and that will undoubtedly turn out to be the case with your series and my reason for believing that is twofold one is because of what you have learned in your investigation namely that the contamination cannot be occurring naturally or by intention ergo it is being brought in by the patients secondly the cases all seem to be communityacquired mrsa which by definition comes from the community or in other words from outside the hospital can i say something now laurie questioned if you must the camrsa or communityacquired has definitely shown up as a problem in hospitals and thats been over a number of years at an everincreasing rate that may be so but i believe the fact that the bug is the camrsa exclusively lends more credence to my theory but be that as it may i also called dr wendell andersons office and spoke to his scheduling nurse thinking of you i asked her whether it would be possible if i put off the surgery to again be scheduled at the seventhirty slot she said it would be up to the doctor because he always starts at eightthirty or nine and that he was doing me a favor by coming in early on thursday well then lets delay it laurie said i dont want to delay it thats the point yet i wanted to ask in case i changed my mind but i didnt why not laurie demanded with obvious irritation at jacks intransigence because the sooner it gets done jack growled the sooner ill be on the bike and on the bball court jesus christ laurie exclaimed throwing up her hands in frustration how can you be so foolishly stubborn ill tell you how jack snapped back before i hung up with andersons secretary i asked her to have anderson call me back which he did within the hour i put the questions to him very directly first i asked him if he knew about the mrsa in the angels hospitals he said he did and he admitted there was a significant mystery to it because he told me all the infectioncontrol mechanisms that the hospital had instituted at great expense he said infections had decreased but were still occurring at a muchreduced rate he also told me that he had himself instituted some control measures above and beyond what the hospital was doing what were they on his own cases he insists the anesthesiologist give supplemental oxygen maintain the patients body temperature and even monitor and maintain glucose levels has he had any recent postoperative infection laurie asked incisively im glad you asked that question jack said smugly although i know its an egotistical sore point with surgeons i asked him directly if he had surprisingly enough he said hes only had three postoperative infections in all his career and all three had been open compound fracture repairs meaning the cases were dirty to begin with also all three were at university hospital not angels orthopedic so hes not had an mrsa case well i dont know what the bacteria was involving his cases at university but the point is hes had no infection problem at angels laurie stared off she could sense she was losing the argument i even went a step further jack said i asked him from one doctor to another if he would go ahead and have the surgery as scheduled given the timing in relation to my injury and the fact that angels is struggling with an mrsa problem jack paused for maximum impact and laurie was forced to say she wanted to know he said in a heartbeat he would do it and furthermore he said he wouldnt operate at angels if he didnt feel that confident he said the only thing he would personally do was use an antibiotic soap for several days before the procedure when i admitted to already doing that he said id be fine he also said that when i go in for my preop bloodwork tomorrow that he would arrange that i be screened for mrsa and that if i turned out to be a carrier he would insist i be treated and that the operation would be delayed the last thing he said was that hed see me thursday morning at seventhirty am and id be back on my bike in three months and playing bball in six laurie looked over at her pile of cases and hospital records she felt a mixture of frustration anger and despondency jack had certainly made some cogent points especially talking directly to his surgeon who was highly regarded and rather famous for operating on celebrity athletes yet still laurie could not help but feel it was a wrong decision to proceed with the surgery under the circumstances it would be okay if it were an emergency but as elective surgery it still seemed crazy to her come on jack said standing up and touching her shoulder in the process as if she were in molasses laurie got to her feet jack handed her matrix back to her i still think you should proceed with investigating this series there has to be an explanation and i for one would certainly like to hear it laurie nodded took the matrix and tossed it casually onto the rest of the debris on her desk jack wrapped his arms about her and hugged her thanks for caring he said laurie hugged back i love you jack said i love you too laurie said april pm so how are we going to work this angelo asked franco he and franco were in francos car having pulled over to the left side of fifth avenue between th and th streets there was a row of massive concrete urns sitting on the sidewalk presumably for protection of the trump tower from wayward vehicles the commercial entrance to the building was behind them forcing one of them at any given time to be looking back over his shoulder to keep the area under observation thats a good question franco answered this isnt the easiest assignment ive ever had wheres that description again angelo handed over the sheet of paper your turn to watch the entrance franco said facing forward he quickly reread the description i guess we will have to rely on the hair i cant even imagine what blond with limegreen highlights will look like it sounds almost scary i think the size issue will tip us off at least initially angelo said it was easier for him to look back while sitting in the front passenger seat its hard to see the hair color with the angle of the sun and theres a lot more people coming out i guess its quitting time if we dont see her soon im going to start worrying weve missed her that wont bother me angelo said i have a nagging feeling about this hit oh come on you pessimist franco said enjoy the challenge of it by the way where are the daterape pills and the gas you got from old doc trevino the pills are in my pocket and the ethylene is on the floor of the backseat along with the plastic bags that stuff is unbelievable how fast it works two seconds the person is out well we sure cant use the gas here in broad daylight well maybe it isnt so broad anymore of course not but it might come in handy if she kicks up a fuss once we get her in the car i dont want to be forced to shoot her in the car hell no franco said not on my upholstery let me see the pills angelo reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out a lettersized envelope which he handed to franco franco squeezed the ends of the envelope together and looked in at the contents there were ten small white pills nestled in the bottom crease how many of these things do you have to use franco asked doc said just one all you have to do is plop it into a cocktail and twenty minutes later you can pop it to her how come he gave us so many beats me maybe he thought we could have fun with the others franco tipped the envelope and poured half of the pills into his hand then he dropped them into his jacket pocket and handed the envelope back to angelo if we use one tonight and it works maybe ill give it a try sounds like it would be a great evening angelo said teasingly viagra for you and rohypnol for your honey refusing to be baited franco said i think one of us should walk down there to the entrance and get a better look at each and every one coming out there would be less chance of missing her thats not a bad idea angelo agreed but what are we going to do when we see her we cant strongarm her with all these people around what about your ozone park police badge youve always said it works wonders it does but not always in a crowd people are emboldened when other people are around she could yell and scream and theres lots of cops in the neighborhood ive noticed im amazed they havent approached us to leave youve spoken a bit too soon here comes one now franco glanced back over his shoulder a burly policeman with a strikingly large gut was heading toward them carrying a pad of traffic tickets in his hand franco looked at angelo and back at the policeman in ten seconds the cop would be at the door ill jump out franco said you drive around the block why dont i jump out because im in charge franco said make sure your cell phone is on and most importantly dont wreck my car franco climbed out onto the sidewalk good evening officer he said the policeman arrived just as franco reached full height theres no parking or standing the cop said as he eyed franco and then bent down to look in at angelo hes just dropping me off officer franco said as he also bent down to wave goodbye to angelo angelo had slid across the bench seat to be behind the wheel franco closed the door lovingly hey the officer called out suddenly as angelo started to pull away angelo stopped with his heart racing your seat belt the policeman yelled thank you officer angelo said in a tense voice after putting down the window halfway francos heart had raced as well with definite relief he smiled at the policeman then walked north toward the trump tower commercial entrance amy lucas looked over at the clock high on the wall across from her desk with utter relief she saw that it was finally fivethirty her normal quitting time the day had been a mixture of anxiety and tedium the anxiety had been getting called into the ceos office and being questioned about paul shed never even met the ceo before much less been called into her office although she suspected it would be about paul she wasnt entirely sure there was always the concern about being fired not that shed done anything to deserve it but more because she couldnt afford to be fired financial need evoked a kind of paranoia and her finances were being strained by her contribution toward keeping her mother in an assistedliving facility each month was a struggle to stay in the black pauls absence had also been the source of anxiety shed been working for the man for about ten years and had moved with him from their previous job to angels healthcare about five years ago when hed not shown up by ten that morning amy feared something was wrong because paul yang was generally very precise and methodical like most accountants unless he had been drinking that was the worry as the day wore on and he didnt appear or call she came to believe he was on one of his binges like hed had before the move to angels healthcare and it saddened her back then it had been difficult because shed had to make excuses for his absence on a regular basis and even on one occasion rescue him from a fleabag motel after the motel incident hed seen the light and overnight he became thankfully motivated to stay away from alcohol only amy knew hed gone to aa meetings and had kept it up for years now shed hoped hed stay away from alcohol for good but now fivethirty in the afternoon she was certain hed relapsed if it was true as she expected it was that hed gone back to alcohol she blamed the stress hed been under regarding the stupid k form and the ballyhoo about whether or not to file it she knew he was upset about it because he had specifically told her so but he didnt tell her why he was so agitated amy wasnt an accountant and had never even gone to secretarial school she was pretty much selftaught although she did take appropriate courses in high school and was exceptionally good with the computer sometime after she had typed the k on pauls laptop he had called her into his office and then as if there was a great conspiracy afoot gave her a usb drive which contained the k file i want you to keep this hed whispered just put it someplace safe on a separate file is the securities and exchange commissions website but why shed asked dont ask just keep it unless something happens to me amy could remember looking into his eyes he was being so melodramatic that shed thought he was joking with her because he did have a sense of humor but he apparently wasnt joking because he dismissed her and never mentioned the usb drive again now as she was ready to leave for home she opened her bar and took out the usb storage device and looked at it as if she expected it to communicate with her she couldnt help but wonder if pauls absence fulfilled his request for her to file the k when hed given her the charge hed never described what he meant by unless something happens to me certainly going on a binge qualified as something happening to him but amy wasnt confident she slipped the drive back into its side pocket and closed her purse her last thought before leaving was whether she should call his home shed considered doing it off and on all day but wasnt sure if she should shed even considered calling one of his old girlfriends whose number she still had but she decided not to do it since hed had no contact with her for five years as far as she knew with a sigh her indecision was such that she thought it better to do nothing than to do something that might make the situation worse with that thought she turned off her desk lamp and left the office what the hell is going on carlo said with a shake of his head he was mystified i havent the slightest idea brennan said carlo and brennan were in carlos black gmc denali pulled over to the right side of fifth avenue at grand army plaza just to their right was the pulitzer fountain with the statue of a naked abundance in all her glory carlo and brennan had picked up franco and angelo the moment theyd emerged from the neapolitan restaurant at a safe distance in johnnys parking lot they had joked about the two lucia enforcers trying to decide which one was the weirdestlooking to them franco looked like a hawk with his narrow hatchetlike nose and beady eyes while angelo looked like someone from a horror movie with his extensive facial scarring what a pair carlo had commented as hed put his sub sandwich down on the center console and put his car in gear tailing the two had been easy since francos car stood out from the crowd with its erect tail fins and whiterthanwhite sidewall tires the only problem spot had been getting on the queensboro bridge since they had missed a traffic light and francos car had driven out of sight after a short period of anxiety they had been able to catch up to their quarry thanks to the traffic light on the manhattan side of the bridge from there they had proceeded to fifth avenue without a problem until franco had suddenly pulled to the side a bit beyond the commercial entrance to the trump tower francos parking had been so precipitous that carlo had had to drive by and make a right at th street and go around the block that maneuver had also caused a bit of concern about losing them until theyd returned to fifth avenue and saw francos car still standing where it had been for the next thirtyfive minutes carlo and brennan had stayed where they were next to naked abundance alternately watching francos car with a pair of binoculars brennan had thoughtfully brought along they couldnt see much just two silhouettes having an active conversation from the looks of their intermittent hand gestures while they waited they finished the sandwiches theyd gotten at johnnys without knowing where they were going or how long it would take theyd jumped at the chance to haw some food the stakeout had gradually become boring until both men sat up a little straighter when the nypd officer had appeared and closed in on the car whats going down carlo had questioned brennan had the binoculars at the time i dont know theyre just talking let me see carlo said he took the binoculars from his colleague who was lower in the organizational hierarchy carlo and brennan had known each other for years from living in the same neighborhood and attending the same high school francos walking toward us carlo said as he continued watching through the binoculars uhoh brennan said urgently angelo is driving away what should we do lets stick with franco carlo said hes stopped at the trump tower entrance my guess is hes waiting for someone to come out of the building what about angelo i could get out and stick with franco while you tail angelo carlo shook his head my bet is angelos just going around the block lets stick where we are im starting to think theyre planning on snatching someone thats crazy with all these people around not to mention the cops i cant argue with you there carlo said and then quickly added i think he sees who he is after he just tossed his cigarette into the gutter who is it a man or a woman brennan questioned he eyed the binoculars and had to resist an urge to grab them away from carlo after all hed had the sense to bring them along i think it must be that girl with the green coat shes taking a cab and he is too i bet hes pissed because angelos not in sight carlo tossed the binoculars into brennans lap and put the denali in gear what are we going to do brennan asked while searching for franco and the girl god the girl looks like shes twelve what could franco and angelo be after her for it doesnt make much sense uhoh the girls got a cab and is about to leave franco high and dry should we try to follow her or stick with franco well stick with franco you dope brennan pulled his eyes from the binoculars and cast an angry look at carlo he didnt like being called a dope well lucky for franco hes caught himself a cab as well hang on were off to the races you must be joking the taxi driver said twisting around to look at franco sitting in the backseatfollow that cab thats the first time ive actually heard that outside of the movies are you for real man or is this a joke its no joke franco said keep that cab in sight and you got yourself a twentydollar tip the driver shrugged and turned back to drive a twentydollar tip was well worth a little extra effort franco bounced around in the backseat and had trouble handling his cell phone giving up for the moment he struggled with the seat belt instead once he got that secured he wasnt being thrown about quite as much especially since the car had steadied to a degree once it had gotten up to speed it was still relatively hard to dial the number because the driver was weaving in and out of the lanes where are you franco demanded the moment angelo answered im stuck in traffic on sixth avenue going north where are you in a cab heading south on fifth the bird has flown okay as soon as i can ill head south franco flipped his phone closed he was irritated at himself for two reasons he should have had some sort of a plan when the girl or woman whichever she was appeared more important he should have insisted they take angelos humdrum lincoln town car for their evening activities instead of his babied cadillac the idea of angelo wrecking his car or even denting it in new york citys rushhour traffic made him sick were coming up on the cab in question the driver said proudly want me to pull up alongside no franco said quickly just stay behind the two taxis made good progress down fifth avenue catching the lights franco began to wonder if paul yang gave them the wrong information about her living in new jersey of if she did whether she was going out on the town for the evening which would complicate things francos fears were dispelled near the new york public library when amys taxi suddenly braked and turned right franco relaxed a degree sensing they were headed toward the port authority bus terminal flipping open his phone franco called angelo where are you he demanded as hed done previously im just turning south on seventh avenue angelo said where are you were heading west im pretty sure were going to the bus terminal but ill know better once we hit eighth avenue what are you going to do i dont know especially not knowing if you are going to be in the area i suppose i have to follow her into the terminal and get on the bus with her yeah well lucky you screw you franco said he regretted not thinking faster when the cop came up to the car he should have had angelo get out instead if i dont hear from you sooner ill call you when im at the bus station okay i hope this is worth it its worth it franco said theres millions at stake franco flipped his phone closed as they came to the traffic light at eighth avenue as he expected they turned right a minute or so later he tossed the fare plus some change and an extra twenty dollars through the opening in the plexiglas divider and jumped out before the taxi had come to a complete stop amy was already entering the terminal as usual during rush hour the terminal was a sea of people tailing amy was easy in one respect and hard in another the easy part was her strange hair color which was like a neon light the hard part was her height if franco didnt stay directly on her she disappeared out of sight within seconds suddenly a problem reared its ugly head one that franco had failed to anticipate amy got into a line to purchase a ticket but franco had no idea where she was going as the ticket line quickly moved forward franco panicked he thought about pushing ahead and just standing to the side when she ordered her ticket so he could overhear where she was going but he dismissed it out of hand he didnt want to call attention to himself because he didnt want her to recognize him later just another face in the crowd was not a problem but doing something out of the ordinary right next to her was quite another story franco was the fourth person behind amy and when it was her turn at the ticket window he strained forward in an attempt to hear but it was futile as she retreated from the ticket window she had her ticket in her hand and she passed within several feet that was when franco realized there was yet another problem amy was walking away and there were three people in front of him panicking again trying to keep amy in sight he pushed ahead saying excuse me im going to miss my bus do you mind several of the people grudgingly let him pass the third however stood his ground i dont want to miss my bus neither pal the man said his face was coated in a fine white dust suggesting he was a plasterer or a painter unaccustomed to being opposed and worried about losing amy franco felt a surge of anger well up inside him controlling himself with some difficulty he said i cant miss my bus my wifes having a baby without a word and with obvious irritation the painter reluctantly stepped aside and motioned for franco to go before him where you going dad the agent said having overheard francos statement for a second franco froze with everything going on he hadnt thought about his needing a destination frantically his mind tried to remember some place in new jersey any place and luckily hackensack popped into his consciousness he didnt know why hackensack but was thankful nonetheless he told the agent the name of the town and while getting out a twentydollar bill he glanced back over his shoulder amy was a distance away being engulfed by a crowd at the base of an escalator she disappeared quickly franco paid then ran for the escalator when he got there he pushed ahead using the same line that had worked so well at the ticket window once he got to the top he frantically searched the area and was immediately relieved to see amy waiting in line alongside a number bus with her petite face buried in a new york daily news with a sense of relief on one hand and a new worry on the other franco went to the end of the line the new problem was that his ticket wasnt for the number bus despite being out of breath franco called angelo and found out that angelo was just outside the bus terminal ill be on a one sixtysix bus franco said trying to cover the phone with his hand find out the buss route once it gets out of the lincoln tunnel because i have no idea then drive over to jersey yourself ill keep you posted where amy and i are and obviously when we get off try to get as close as possible so when we do get off we can end this circus ill give it my best shot meanwhile you got any more pictures of maria provolone in this hog of yours to keep me company up yours franco said and flipped his phone closed he didnt like angelo razzing him about maria his one true love whod been shot and killed their senior year in high school by a rival gang at last the line began to move franco wasnt as concerned about the ticket discrepancy as hed been about having no ticket at all and he was proved to be right the bored driver making his umpteenth run just took the ticket without checking it as he did with all the passengers franco moved down the center aisle he saw amy almost immediately shed taken a window seat in the middle of the bus and was back into her newspaper by coincidence the seat next to her was vacant for a second he thought about sitting next to her and engaging her in conversation but he quickly nixed the idea on this kind of job surprise was critical instead he took an aisle seat several rows behind her the bus didnt leave for another fifteen minutes making franco wish hed had an opportunity to grab a paper himself instead he had to just sit there at least he had the opportunity to plan the rest of the evening it wasnt easy because what was to happen depended on what amy lucas did at the other end of her bus ride he knew worst case would be if a companion picked her up ultimately that could mean he and angelo might have to ice two people which doubled the opportunity for trouble when the bus finally closed its door and pulled away from the loading platform it had to wend its way within the terminal until exiting onto a multistoryhigh ramp that dove down directly into the lincoln tunnel the good part was that ramp avoided the clogged city streets the bad part was that he was going to be significantly ahead of angelo thanks to the gentle rocking the soothing drone of the engine and the overheated bus interior franco was practically asleep by the time the bus burst forth into the glory of the new jersey twilight rousing himself he asked his seatmate where the bus went the man gave franco a confused questioning glare before asking you mean the end of the line yeah i guess franco answered i know it goes to tenafly because my sister lives there ultimately where it goes from there i dont know how long does it take to get to tenafly id guess a little over an hour franco thanked the man he was hoping amy wasnt going to tenafly or beyond the idea of spending that kind of time on the bus with fifty or so apparently depressed people smelling of wet wool was daunting to keep himself occupied he went back to musing about what would happen when amy got off the bus somehow hed have to approach her and get her involved in a conversation probably by talking to her about her boss since there had been nothing in the newspapers his disappearance had gone essentially unnoticed and apparently unreported except of course by the fish although he didnt have angelos police badge he could pose as an authority perhaps even someone from the sec he didnt know if the sec had investigators like the police but he assumed theyd have to at least it was a plan giving credence to such a plan was that he and angelo were dressed to the nines both appreciated elegant clothing almost to a competitive level both leaned toward brioni and were that evening as usual decked out in their brioni splendor franco couldnt help but believe that such attention to their appearance gave them an aura of credibility mulling over confronting amy made him think about calling angelo but he decided to wait he didnt have anything to report and angelo was undoubtedly about to get into or was already inside the tunnel going back to amy again he thought that the best thing he could do was talk her into entering a public place so they could talk more easily and wait for angelo and a bar fitted that description with the added benefit of them being able to have a drink reflexively franco slipped his hand into his pocket and reassured himself that the daterape pills were where he put them the question then arose if he should try to get one in amys drink before angelo got there or after there was no doubt in his mind that timing was paramount glancing out the window franco noticed they had left the main highway leading from the lincoln tunnel and were now heading north on city streets franco reached for his cell phone where are you at the twentyone club having a nice dinner angelo said sarcastically im stuck in traffic im not even into the tunnel yet good work franco said with equal sarcasm did you find out where the number one sixtysix bus goes not exactly someplace in bergen county thats up around the george washington bridge and beyond call me when you are out of the tunnel franco replaced the phone in his inner jacket pocket and then tried again to settle back the second he did the bus made its first stop several people got off but not amy franco sat up straighter worried that if he did happen to fall asleep he might miss amy getting off and all their effort would be for naught if that were to happen franco could just hear vinnies reaction twenty minutes later francos phone shocked him into full wakefulness since it was on buzz mode and was against his chest in his jackets inner pocket it was angelo whod finally made it into the tunnel and out the other side should i take the first exit angelo asked frantically suggesting he was rapidly approaching it have you looked at the goddamn map of course then take the first exit and come north for chrissake and hold on franco leaned over toward his seatmate once again and asked if he knew what town they currently were in then franco put his cell back to his ear the gentleman im sitting next to believes weve just entered cliffside park so get your ass up in this neck of the woods francos seatmate smiled cordially when franco stole a glance in his direction which made franco nervous he always wanted to keep his interaction with people to a minimum when on a job when the man tried to start a friendly conversation franco was vague and ended it gracefully as soon as he could ten minutes later francos seatmate disturbed franco by tapping him on the shoulder my stop is next he said and motioned to stand up franco got up to let the man pass as the man reached the aisle franco asked what town it was ridgefield the man said indifferently franco sat down and called angelo to give him a quick update on his progress that means im about fifteen to twenty minutes behind as if answering a prayer ten minutes later amy stood up and the bus began to slow quickly franco pulled out his cell and leaned across the aisle and asked the woman passenger if she knew what town they were stopping in she said she didnt know but the man next to her said it was palisades park franco hurriedly gave a call to angelo its palisades park bending down as the bus came to a stop he saw a street sign broad avenue palisades park got it angelo said franco moved forward other people got up as well blocking franco from amy by the time he got out onto the street he panicked because he didnt see amy in either direction momentarily confused he ran to the end of the bus thankfully he saw her on the other side of the street walking south it was a commercial area with a medley of lighted shops and a number of people bustling in various directions franco hustled across the street and rapidly bore down on the unsuspecting amy after the sodden warmth of the bus it seemed excessively cold causing him to turn up his jacket lapels ms amy lucas franco called out a few steps behind the young woman in francos estimate there was just the right amount of passersby to keep amy at relative ease amy stopped and looked up into francos face she took a wary step back as franco approached to arms length away from her im sorry to bother you maam franco said imitating a very old tv show hed enjoyed but i need to ask you a few questions what about amy asked she looked from side to side nervously your boss paul yang amys demeanor changed from guarded to solicitous in a blink of an eye is he all right where is he hes in federal custody maam he wanted us to contact you amys expression now changed from solicitous to concerned why is he in custody and why did he want you to contact me i dont know anything excuse me maam franco said low and authoritative i believe you do there is the very serious issue of the eightk which i have been led to believe a copy of which is in your possession either at your home on your person or in your desk at work amys expression changed to something akin to a scared rabbit but to her detriment she didnt flee im an sec investigator so i believe you can understand why we need to talk i guess so she said without enthusiasm it is rather cold perhaps there is a public place where we can talk and you will feel comfortable talking to a stranger amy glanced around the immediate area how about a bar its a place people can talk more privately than most other places it is our hope you are not pulled into this unfortunate serious legal problem theres petes across the street amy said pointing do you go there often franco asked from where they were standing it looked like a local dive just what he wanted but not if she were a known customer i never go there its considered to be kinda a rough hangout i think it will work fine let me call my partner investigator facciolo franco pulled out his cell phone and connected to angelo agent facciolo he said trying to hold back a smile i have the witness in front of me shes being cooperative we are going into a bar to talk the bars name is petes on broad avenue palisades park the nearest cross street is franco took the phone from his ear and asked amy what the nearest cross street was amy pointed a block ahead see those concrete balustrades on the sides of the road thats route fortysix franco repeated the information to angelo and then rang off he pointed toward the bar and he and amy ran across the street from francos point of view the bar was perfect despite its miasma of stale beer the lighting was low and the music rather high as it pounded out mostly rap the joint was not crowded with only five people sitting at the bar nursing drinks and a dozen or so in the rear playing pool to the right were a series of empty wooden booths franco guided amy over to one booth being careful not to touch her he was pleased and amazed that she was being so cooperative he couldnt help but think that basing the interview on her missing boss had been a stroke of genius once they were seated across from each other franco put down his lapels he rubbed his hands together rapidly it seems cold for this time of year amy merely nodded she was terrified that she was about to be arrested and angry at paul for putting her in such a situation im sure they arent going to let us sit here without drinking something what would you like and ill tell you what i wont tell anybody if you wont im not supposed to drink while on duty but id love to have a cocktail amy was not a big drinker but she did like vodka on occasion it calmed her down and if there was any time she needed to be calmed down it was at that moment i guess ill have a dirty vodka martini she said shyly that sounds terrific franco said still rubbing his palms together to generate heat i think we have to order them from the bar i dont think theres a waitress so ill be right back at the bar franco ordered the martini then a neat bourbon for himself the burly whiskered and tattooed bartender gave franco a good stare nice duds he said before mixing amys drink and then reaching for the bourbon to pour francos while the bartender was so occupied franco surreptitiously dropped one of the daterape pills into amys drink he did it by palming the small white pill and then releasing it as he picked up the glass by its rim after the bartender filled francos glass he asked if franco wanted to run a tab franco responded by placing a twenty on the bar which he had had in his other hand keep the change he said back at the table he slid amys drink toward her and checked his watch he wanted to see how long it was before the pill took effect despite the music they could talk reasonably well since the sides of the booth were shoulder height and shielded out some of the higher notes although certainly not the jarring bass the problem that franco now had to face was thinking up enough things to talk about while at the same time bolstering his story that paul yang had been arrested and was being held incommunicado after about ten minutes franco was running out of innocuous questions on the positive side he began to sense that amys speech was becoming slurred and her movements when she picked up her drink were becoming wobbly next it appeared her eyelids were becoming heavy requiring her to make an extra effort to keep them open what about the eightk franco asked in truth he didnt have the slightest idea what an k was despite having overheard vinnies talk with paul the previous evening what ablout it amy questioned inserting an inappropriate l into about she took another sip from her cocktail which she was certainly doing rapid justice to after she put her drink down franco noticed her torso was now starting to wobble slightly even when she was not moving her extremities for all practical purposes she was beginning to act as if shed already had two or three drinks where is it franco persisted right here in my trusty old purse amy said tapping her bag repeatedly why dont you give it to me sure why not amy said her hand wandered in the air before she was able to seize the bag with some difficulty she got the inner zipped compartment open and then handed the usb storage device to franco franco turned the device over in his hand then pulled it open hed never seen one out of the corner of his eye he saw angelo come into the room a few of the people at the bar turned and gaped at him angelo stared back with what franco guessed was rising fury angel had learned to deal with his facial deformity and the reaction it evoked but not with people he deemed to be the dregs of society such as a handful of winos in a dumpy tavern franco stood up slipping the usb drive into his jacket pocket in the process agent facciolo were over here for a second franco feared he would have to step over and drag him back to the table but angelo finally broke off and approached the table on his own fucking scumbags angelo voiced looking back over his shoulder yeah well theyre jealous of your brioni jacket yeah sure angelo growled this is amy lucas franco said as he motioned toward amy then he put his arms on angelos shoulders and this is agent facciolo who i told you about oh dear amy said with a wince while looking up at angelo im so sorry youve burned your face has she had one of dr trevinos specials just one and only a little more than ten minutes ago terrific angelo said lets give her another one it looks like shes finished her drink if we give her another one she might pass out hey dont you remember that was the idea what is she drinking ill get it and we can blow this shithole i want to finish this job its aggravating me wait franco said restraining angelo let me get it i dont want you shooting up this joint because of those drunks at the bar fair enough angelo said ill stay here with this beautiful young lady franco pulled angelo a step away from the table and cupping his hand over his mouth whispered were sec agents so act according yeah sure angelo said he sat down next to amy and she moved in to accommodate him it was only fifteen minutes later when it was evident to franco that amy had had quite enough and was enjoying herself perhaps even a little too much franco had seen the bartender look over on several occasions when she laughed it was a highpitched squeal franco looked across at angelo and motioned toward the door with his head and angelo nodded his wheres the black beauty franco asked just around the corner angelo said then to amy he said ill be back in a moment hon franco watched amy sip her drink why do you do that with your hair amy shrugged and then laughed its fun before i did it nobody noticed me franco stared across the table amy was now evincing slight intermittent jerky motions just to keep herself sitting upright a few minutes later angelo came back the cars right outside come on amy franco said giving her arm a tug i havent finished my drink amy said with an exaggerated expression of sadness she laughed i think youve had enough franco responded he motioned to angelo and together they got her onto her wobbly feet with both men supporting her she walked out of the bar with a little difficulty they got her into the backseat sit with her franco said if it looks like shes going to throw up get her head out the window as they positioned amy in the backseat with her head in the far corner and with the window down they didnt notice the man who came out of the bar he was dressed in casual hiphop gear with a long illfitting sweatshirt and a yankees baseball hat on backward without stopping to watch franco and angelos antics he walked north up broad avenue are you ready franco asked looking in the rearview mirror all set angelo said amy now had her seat belt on and her face practically out the window angelo was supporting her head with his outstretched hand amy herself was passed out cold after checking the map for the fastest route back toward hoboken franco made a uturn in the middle of broad avenue and accelerated south for a time they drove in silence it was angelo who spoke up first i certainly hope vinnie appreciates all this effort driving in the city during rush hour was bad enough but it was nothing compared to getting into the tunnel and then out here in new jersey i mean it was a bitch i would have traded places in a heartbeat franco said commuting day in and day out on a bus like the one i was on is a nightmare they didnt talk again until they pulled into the marina franco drove to the same place he had the night before and parked at the base of the main pier he turned out the headlights as it was the previous night it was completely dark both men got out of the car and converged at the driversside rear door as they opened it amys head sagged to the left okay baby angelo said time to rise and shine he poked his head into the vehicle and released the seat belt with that accomplished they got amy out of the car she doesnt weigh much does she franco commented when her boss last night said she was small he wasnt joking with relative ease they walked amy out the pier the cold air off the river revived her to a degree and she actually helped them so they didnt have to support her entire weight the only relatively difficult part was getting her across the narrow gangplank and into the stern of the boat what should we do with her while we get under way angelo asked well she hasnt gotten sick so lets put her into one of the forward cabins i dont want her getting up and just falling overboard wait here and hang on to her while i turn the light on in the main saloon and below it was a little more difficult moving amy on the boat than it had been on the open pier but they managed to get her into a cabin and draped her over a bed with her feet still on the floor just in case she did get sick they spread towels under her head when they were finished they stood up and looked down at the woman suddenly franco bent over grasped the lapels of amys coat and rudely ripped it open the buttons flew off in various directions and clattered to the floor you know something he said if you dont look at the hair and you ignore the zits shes not bad what do you say we did give her a daterape drug angelo said as his scarred lips twisted into a halfsmile we shouldnt waste things yeah it would be like the stem cell and frozen embryo hassle i mean if youre going to flush them down the toilet why not use them franco and angelo regarded each other their respective smiles broadened until they laughed okay franco said once were under way well flip for who goes first you got a deal man with more alacrity than theyd shown all evening franco and angelo went back up on deck franco continued up to the bridge deck while angelo disembarked to handle the mooring lines by the time angelo had the bowline free and tossed onto the bow franco had the diesel engine purring like a contented cat angelo ran back and loosened the stern line from its massive dockside cleat just as he was about to toss it into the stern his eye caught a glint of light back along the pier in the area of the fuel pump for a second angelo stared into the darkness when it didnt recur he assumed it was a brief reflection of the light issuing from the full speed ahead on the fuel pumps glass gauge cover angelo tossed the mooring line onto the boat scampered across the gangplank and pulled the gangplank aboard all clear he shouted up to the bridge deck as the yacht began to move out of its slip angelo went around and pulled in the thick white bumpers as he did so he was caught in the reddish glow of the running lights that franco had just turned on brennan hovered behind the fuel pump for longer than he thought necessary he didnt want to take any additional chances he was worried that while he was trying to make out the name of the yacht hed caught angelos attention the problem had been that in the corner of his field of vision brennan had seen angelo suddenly stand bolt upright and stare directly toward him for a beat brennan realized after the fact that it was possible for light from the yacht to reflect off the front of his rather large binoculars when the sound of the yachts engines had receded enough that he was reasonably sure hed not be seen brennan hazarded a glance around the pump and saw the full speed aheads running lights close to two hundred yards beyond the end of the pier believing there was no way he could be seen at such a distance he jogged back down the pier past francos car and then all the way up to the rear of the marinas parking lot he didnt see carlos black denali until he was almost upon it he quickly climbed into the front passenger seat he was out of breath well carlo demanded brennan held up his hand to give himself a few deep breaths they took her onto a yacht brennan managed since weve come to a marina thats not all that enlightening especially since you thought they drugged her in the bar im sure they drugged her brennan shot back he didnt like being ordered around by carlo they had to practically carry her out of the bar okay okay dont take offense you should do some of the running around if you dont trust me i said okay they drugged her carlo said do you think this ridiculous shenanigan was just to pork her i mean this has been a lot of effort theres certainly enough broads out in queens so that they didnt need to come all the way out here in the sticks it cant be just to get laid brennan said disparagingly whats the matter with you are you stupid for a moment the two men stayed quiet the strain of the evenings activities had gotten to them finally carlo spoke we shouldnt be busting each others balls this has not been a picnic like i thought it would be with that said we have to come up with something to tell the boss they made the effort to take the yacht out i cant imagine theyd bother if they just planned on getting laid nor would they make such an effort with a chick that certainly wasnt special we are missing some major piece of information you really didnt hear anything they said back at the bar brennan glared at carlo okay okay you already said you didnt its too bad though it was the perfect opportunity the music was too loud it was boom boom boom brennan said while repeatedly slapping his fist into his open palm i couldnt hear myself think much less someone elses conversation maybe they took the boat out so after they finish with her theyll just dump her into the drink that seems like a weak explanation to me brennan said suppressing the urge to make a stronger value judgment he knew that one of the benefits of a daterape pill if that was what they probably gave her was that the woman remembered zilch well we cant follow them anymore tonight unless they come back give me a break brennan thought but did not say instead he said thanks to my binoculars which i brought along i think i know the name of the boat i mean i couldnt see it too well and it was bouncing up and down but it looked like full speed ahead carlo turned to brennan hey that might be something barbera would like to know oh really brennan questioned silently and sarcastically sometimes he truly wondered how carlo had gotten to where he was in the organization carlo got out his cell phone and called louie barbera when barbera was on the line carlo gave a quick description of their evening so far louie was instantly taken aback his first question was the name of the business where the girl worked but unfortunately carlo and brennan had no idea louie then asked them if by any slim chance they knew the name of the boat we think it is full speed ahead it was dark and hard to see but brennan brought along some binoculars and that was what it looked like brennan nodded to acknowledge carlos giving him the credit you guys are doing a good job louie said that could be very interesting information as far as i know no one is aware vinnie dominick is hiding a yacht in new jersey it could be the answer to how hes getting his drugs these days what do you want us to do hang out and see when they come back and whether the girls with them or not if its early enough go back to the trump tower i want a list of the businesses with office space somethings going on with one of those businesses and id like to know what it is carlo disconnected with louie and turned to brennan did you hear weve got to sit tight thanks for giving me credit about the boats name hey you deserved it what do you say we go find some coffee who knows how long these dorks will be out for their romantic cruise thats the best idea youve had today brennan said well franco asked when angelo came back up onto the bridge deck franco had the big boat up to a reasonable speed so that it was just planing he could have gone considerably faster but there was no need and the diesels made a tremendous earsplitting roar when they were pushed much faster she said she liked me better because your dick is so small franco took a playful swing at angelo which angelo easily evaded earlier franco had won the coin toss and while angelo piloted the boat hed gone down to have his way with the unconscious amy after that it had been angelos turn how far are we going to go angelo asked he looked out at the new york city skyline to the left and the jersey shoreline to the right in the middle distance ahead was the illuminated statue of liberty about the same as last night did you get the chain out not yet they rode in silence for a short while until angelo said what are we going to do why are you asking were going to do just what we did last night shoot her and throw her overboard why bother to shoot her franco took his eyes off the water in front and regarded angelo in the halflight of the bridge shed be still alive when we tossed her into the drink so what franco shrugged it doesnt seem right throwing her into the water alive its not human so you think you are human is that it franco franco redirected his attention to the water in front he saw some running lights of a boat off the starboard side on a course across their bow he backed down the engines and the boat slowed quickly what the hell are you driving at franco questioned angrily are you trying to play with my mind somehow hell no angelo exclaimed jeez calm down im just asking because actually i feel the same way its just not right throwing her in without icing her first but that makes me wonder if were two old softies hey speak for yourself franco this is a discussion not an argument in comparison with the wiseguys of old particularly the enforcers like us were pussycats what the hell are you talking about i saw a movie once about what it was like when the real bosses were in control when one of the musclemen of the day took someone out to knock em off like were doing they tied the person to a chair and put their feet in cement and while the cement dried the person being knocked off could think about what was soon to happen now those guys were the real baddies not like us youre out of your freakin mind maybe but someday id like to have a chance to do it besides it would be easier and faster today with stuff like quickset and the like on the market well i can tell you one thing for sure were not going back to home depot tonight so you can have some fun and games april pm angela hurried out onto fifth avenue from the commercial entrance to the trump tower and merged into the heavy pedestrian traffic heading south she had to wait for the light at th street and glanced at her watch she was already late for her scheduled sevenfifteen dinner with chet mcgovern it seemed that lately she was always running and always late the pressure was unrelenting she knew she shouldnt be taking the time to dine formally but the coincidence of having had a confrontation of sorts with dr laurie montgomery and being persistently asked to dinner by one of the medical examiners colleagues on the same day was too much not to take advantage of angela was concerned that laurie montgomery could be the biggest current threat to the secrecy angels healthcare had managed visavis the mrsa problem and its cashflow consequence angela needed to know how big a threat when the light changed angelas mind went back to her other problems paul yang still had not returned and just before leaving the office angela had checked with bob she thought he would have called if the accountant had contacted him but angela wanted to be sure it would have been nice to be able to cross off one of her concerns at the same time angela was checking with bob about paul yang she had asked him if all had been arranged with michael about the extra fifty thousand bob had said everything had been taken care of except the money itself which he hoped would be wired in the morning the last thing angela had had to take care of before she left the office was a blowup between cynthia sarpoulus and herman straus the president of angels orthopedic hospital cynthia demanded to keep david jeffriess or closed for another twentyfour hours while herman wanted it available it was his contention that there had been four operations after jeffries which had had no infections and the or had been fastidiously cleaned cynthia on the other hand wanted to wait a day to check it again before giving it a green light under normal circumstances the chief operating officer carl palanco would have handled the problem but mercurial cynthia had threatened to quit meaning angela had to step in to mediate angela did not want to lose their infectioncontrol professional with mrsa still a potential threat at th street angela turned left and hurried her step despite all the current problems and pressures she resigned herself to at least enjoy the meal even if it was like everything else she was doing in the line of work after all on the positive side it was one of her favorite restaurants coming through the front door and then the inner door she peeled off her coat and gave it to the coat check person approaching the hostess desk she expected to see one of the owners of which there were two although she didnt know for certain she suspected they were brothers the one whom she expected to see since he acted as the maitre d was the elegant italian male with the omnipresent and superbly fitted italian suit crisp white shirt bold italian silk tie with matching pocket square and luxuriously dark rather long and flowing hair the other was the tough nononsense italian male exuding testosterone who could have played the part of a mobster he dressed considerably more casually yet commanded significant respect tinged with a touch of fear he usually hung out behind the small bar and when angela stepped farther into the room she caught sight of him in his usual location when he caught sight of her he waved and greeted her by name prior to the disastrous mrsa problem angela had patronized the restaurant nearly on a weekly basis but it had been for lunch not dinner she quickly surmised the brothers probably rotated evenings since the power lunch was the establishments forte one of the waiters recognized her as well he was a youthfulappearing italian with a pervasive smile who also greeted her by name with a grand gesture he pointed her toward the front corner table and said your guest has already arrived standing behind the table chet waved and smiled a greeting as angela approached she sized him up shed forgotten his engaging nonchalant smile as well as his boyish appeal she never would have suspected he was a physician and certainly not a medical examiner during her medical training pathology had not been her favorite course she couldnt help but wonder why anyone would choose to make a career of it when she reached the table chet surprised her by stepping out and giving her a hug she limply hugged back after all this was business even if he didnt know it thanks for coming out knowing how busy you are thanks for having me im not sure i would have gotten much dinner had you not been so persistent as i said you have to eat they sat down first things first chet said this is my treat i think im going to get the best of this exchange angela said she knew that in keeping with its quality san pietro was not inexpensive they engaged in superficial banter for a time after which angela signaled for the waiter she was committed to having a short evening the youthful smiling waiter came over and rattled off an impressive description of more than a dozen appetizer specials and more than a dozen entree specials then he handed out the menus that was incredible chet whispered to angela how does he remember all that after they had made their selections including a bottle of brunello they went back to their conversation as had been the case the night before angela found chet an extremely facile conversationalist and she couldnt help but enjoy his humor and refreshing candor he was as he openly admitted an irrepressible lothario yet by admitting it so freely it seemed to erase its usual tawdry shallowness once again as was the case the previous evening and in spite of all the pressure she was under she began to enjoy herself of course the wine significantly helped as it was truly delicious to the point of making her feel a bit guilty she imagined the bottle was pricey as the conversation proceeded and not wanting to be rude by essentially delving into her true interest for coming out to dinner namely to find out about laurie montgomery she took advantage of chets openness by asking him why he chose medicine and why forensics you want the expurgated version or the truth chet said flashing one of his playful smiles the truth angela said with exaggerated forcefulness she took another sip of the heavenly wine most people like ninetyeight percent go into medicine because they are truly motivated to help people not me i had no idea what i wanted to be until about the eighth grade what happened one of my friends whom i thought of as somewhat of a nerd i mean he was the chairman of the chess club suddenly decided he truly wanted to be a doctor and for the standard reason and do you know what happened i cannot wait to hear overnight he became really popular with the girls i couldnt believe it it was like a metamorphosis even the girl i was trying to date stacey cockburn suddenly wanted to date herbie dick really those were the names im not joking angela suppressed a laugh so suddenly i wanted to be a doctor chet continued and it worked two weeks later i took stacey to the saturdaynight dance but was the motivation enough to make you actually study medicine it was for me id always liked biology so medicine wasnt generally contrary to my interests and having a real sense of direction at that age was somehow reassuring and my parents and sisters were wild about me being a doctor because in a small midwestern town the doctor is still considered a rather respectable individual okay angela said but why forensics i suppose because i like puzzles and i like to learn new things for me thats what forensics is all about also in medical school i sensed i wasnt all that good with patients especially when they were alive angela smiled and nodded she could understand to a degree philosophically what he was saying but not the part about having to do the autopsy itself okay its your turn chet said why did you choose business angela hesitated for a moment thinking how she cared to answer her first inclination was to brush the question off by offering some pat answer but a combination of chets forthrightness her recent misgivings about her motivations and even perhaps the wine made her want to be frank i guess i should ask you the same question you asked me she said do you want the stereotypical version or the honest one the honest one for sure actually i never wanted to be a businesswoman at least not until about five years ago what did you want to be i wanted to be a doctor no shit chet questioned as a wry uncertain smile appeared on his face no shit angela echoed and i was part of the herd i was part of the ninetyeight percent you mentioned i truly wanted to take care of and hopefully cure people it might sound overly sappy but i even had it in mind to bring medicine into the inner city like a kind of modernday dr livingstone how come you didnt do it i did do it angela said i went the whole nine yards i did a residency in internal medicine got my boards and opened a practice in harlem chet sat back and put his fork down he was momentarily at a loss for words hed sensed from the moment hed begun talking with angela at the health club that there was something special about her but he never would have guessed she was a doctor the shocking news challenged his selfesteem since being an md and a highlevel businesswoman certainly trumped his being only a doctor but at the same time the news fanned his interest in angela are you surprised angela asked chet looked as if a cannon had gone off next to him im flabbergasted why i dont really know chet stammered im surprised myself angela admitted but perhaps my motivations for medicine werent quite as altruistic as ive always believed oh chet voiced he leaned forward why not part of the reason i wanted to go to medical school and i suppose to take care of people because thats generally what you do after you graduate was to get back at my father really really angela repeated in truth of fact she was as surprised by her statement about her father as chet was it wasnt that the idea hadnt vaguely occurred to her in rare moments over the years but rather because shed never truly visited the issue forgive me if im being too personal chet said readjusting himself in his seat why would you want to get back at your father for some reason i guess i just assumed you experienced an idyllic childhood in all outward appearances it was angela said she was again surprised at herself as a private person she was admitting things shed admitted only to a few close girlfriends while in college and it was important for my father that it appeared that way but our perfect little family had its secrets angela paused unsure if she wanted to go on i hope im not boring you are you sure you want to hear this oh come on chet complained im fascinated and if it is a concern for you i give you my word that whatever you feel comfortable telling me will go no further i appreciate that angela said she took a sip of wine thought for a moment and then said regrettably my father abused me not in any sexual sense but rather in an emotional sense of course i had no idea of this as a child it was only after id matured to whatever degree i have when i was very young i was the apple of my fathers eye i remember it very well and i was crazy about him but with my fathers guarded emotions and reliance on appearances the cost for me and for my mother for that matter was absolute petlike allegiance as long as i was his little automaton darling doll everything was pictureperfect the problem was that i was slowly growing up and the moment i expressed any autonomy by being my own person he turned away from me and dropped small comments about me abandoning him which made me feel horribly guilty for a time i tried desperately to please him but invariably id disappoint him as my interests turned progressively away from home and more toward my friends and school my poor mom who had remained entirely allegiant perhaps suffered the most because he seemed to become bored with her and had the stereotypic midlife crisis complete with affairs and alcohol of course he never took responsibility he blamed both my mother and myself for his need to act out claiming no one cared about him for some reason which ill never understand my poor mom stayed with him until he divorced her for a younger woman im sorry for you chet said its tragic that people like your father can be their own worst enemies obviously your father should have been proud of your accomplishments not feel threatened by them but how did this influence your wanting to go to medical school my father was a dentist quite a successful and good one actually but he had in one of his rare flashes of honesty admitted hed wanted to be a doctor but had been unable to get into medical school to please him back when i was only ten or eleven i told him i would go to medical school which wasnt entirely a surprise since one of my favorite child games was being a nurse or a doctor which at the time i thought was the same thing you were just being clairvoyant year by year the two fields are coming closer and closer the major difference now is nurses work harder and doctors are paid more angela smiled but was preoccupied by her own story she had never before expressed it even to herself quite so succinctly so part of your motivation to go to medical school was to spite your father chet asked i think it was a part it was like a personally rewarding way to get a kind of revenge my getting an md challenged him to the extent he skipped my graduation i dont know if i can quite buy this theory in its entirety chet remarked why the fact that you subsequently did an internalmedicine residency one of the most demanding took a lot of commitment im still not practicing and why is that actually because my practice literally went bankrupt i ran up a considerable debt because the medicaid reimbursement was either slow or nonexistent and the medicare too low to cover the shortfall wow chet said my life in comparison with yours has been a walk in the park as a child growing up my most emotionally draining moment was when some older kids kicked in the face of my halloween pumpkin my folks are still together my father came to every athletic event and graduation i ever had from kindergarten on up with that kind of stable background how come youre such a casanova i hope you dont mind me asking especially since i dont know its true you seemed so at ease when you approached me last night and your repartee seems so polished chet laughed its all an act im always nervous on the inside and worried about being rejected calling me casanova gives me more credit than i deserve casanova was successful im usually not although once i do go out with a woman a half a dozen times or so i find myself yearning for the chase whether it represents a problem or not i dont know it started in medical school when i had to work as well as go to school i didnt have time for a real relationship because a real relationship takes time chet shrugged so the seeds were planted back then well that sounds honest honest yes admirable probably not id like to say i just havent met the right woman but i cant because i usually dont hang around long enough to find out have you ever had a longterm relationship oh yeah practically all the way through college my girlfriend and i had plans for her to follow me to chicago where i went to medical school but at the last minute she ditched me for somebody here in new york im sorry alls fair in love and war maybe that episode affected you more than you give it credit for maybe chet said then to change the subject back to her he said you mentioned you were divorced do you want to talk about that angela hesitated normally she avoided talking about her divorce not only because she was by nature a private person but because the whole sad affair could still infuriate her even after six years yet since chet had been so open and she herself had already related even more private matters she suppressed her usual reticence and said at the very end of medical school i was like a teenage girl swept off my feet by a man who i thought was the antithesis of my father sadly that was not the case he too was ultimately threatened by my medical degree he also had affairs and worst of all developed a penchant for hitting me ouch chet said with a wince domestic violence is intolerable and inexcusable unfortunately we see more of it in the morgue than people realize the waiter suddenly appeared and whisked away their plates then asked if they cared for dessert chet looked across at angela im not a big dessert person she confessed nor i said chet but a cappuccino would hit the spot ill finish the wine angela said pointing to the bottle the waiter happily poured it and took the empty bottle away okay chet said sitting back in his chair your innercity practice went bankrupt when was that two thousand one angela said hopefully that year will be my nadir i mean it couldnt get much worse my medical practice went bankrupt and i got divorced two ugly experiences that i dont recommend for anyone its the one year i would not like to live over again i can well imagine so how did you make the transition from private medical practice to a company executive by the way what is your position some sort of medical adviser im the founder and the ceo chets wry smile reappeared and he shook his head in disbelief you are a trip founder and ceo im awestruck how did that happen the bankruptcy was a humiliating disaster but it did have one saving grace it impressed upon me the detrimental power that economics plays in medicine i mean i was somewhat aware before my bankruptcy but not the extent i was after anyway i had an idea to try to do something about it but medical school taught me nothing about medical economics in fact i knew nothing about economics or business which medical care has unfortunately become a slave to so i went back to school and got an mba at columbia chet put his head back and slapped a hand to his forehead thats enough he pleaded i cant take any more youre making me feel too blasted inadequate youre kidding of course i suppose he admitted but lady you have one hell of a cv the waiter came and served chets cappuccino i have a question for you angela said suddenly realizing shed been so engrossed in their conversation that shed not yet touched on the issue that had brought her out to dine shoot chet responded i wanted to ask you about dr laurie montgomery what would you like to know would you characterize her as a persistent getthejobdone person or would you think of her as laidback the former for sure in fact id characterize her as one of the most persistent people i know both she and her husband a few of the other mes think of them as such compulsive workers that they make the rest of us look like slackers angela felt the muscles in her gut tighten she had hoped and expected chet would say something to mitigate her worries not fan them i actually met her today it wasnt under the best of circumstances we have had an outbreak of postoperative methicillinresistant staph that has bedeviled us for a month or so and which has required us to go to extraordinary effort to control even to the point of hiring a fulltime epidemiologist and infectioncontrol specialist laurie mentioned the problem chet said she also reminded me that i had posted one of your cases oh she did yes she came by my office to pick up the case which id done a number of weeks ago and was still waiting for some lab results she had just done a similar one this morning i guess both cases came from one of your hospitals did she say what she was going to do about it if anything i mean we are already doing everything in our power i personally have authorized our infectioncontrol person free rein well you can relax because laurie specifically said she was going to solve your problem if it kills her angelas throat went dry she took a sip of wine did she use those exact words absolutely suddenly angela wanted the evening to be over although she had enjoyed herself more than she would have imagined prior to talking about laurie montgomery she now had a problem that could not wait without concern of its precipitousness she put down her glass folded her napkin and placed it on the table she then made a show of looking at her watch how is it i sense our most delightful evening is over chet said with a touch of melancholy i was hoping youd be willing to walk one block north for a drink at the elegant saint regis king cole bar not tonight duty calls angela said lets get the check and how about we split it oh no chet said this is my treat i made that clear at the beginning okay if you insist and if youll pardon me i have to get back to the office theres a call i must make angela pushed back her chair and stood chet did the same the unexpectedly precipitous end to such an enjoyable evening flummoxed him well talk soon angela said extending her hand which chet shook i hope so chet said with a final smile angela threaded her way across the room got her coat from the coat check and after casting a final glance and wave toward chet hurried out of the restaurant chet slowly sat down his eyes caught those of the waiter who shrugged in sympathy april pm michael flipped his cell phone closed and gritted his teeth he was in the lavatory on the mezzanine floor of downtown cipriani in soho before hed fled to the restroom from the intimate private club on the second floor to escape the pounding disco music hed been with two of his buddies entertaining three chicks from new jersey his phone had buzzed and since it was angela hed taken the call but unable to hear hed fled to the john now he wished he hadnt with great restraint michael resisted the temptation to pound the graffiticovered wall which was smart since the wall was lath and plaster not plasterboard fuck michael shouted as loud as he could within the confines of the small room the expletive careened around the walls in an explosion of acoustical energy making michaels ears ring in protest he gripped the sides of the only sink and tensed his muscles as if he were about to rip it off the wall slowly he let his eyes rise up and stare at himself in the mirror he looked terrible his productcoated hair was standing on end as if ten thousand volts of electricity had gripped his body and his eyes looked like those of dracula he then breathed out he was furious but under control his bitch of an ex had just thrown another problem at him as if he were some pissant lackey if he werent already in up to his eyeballs he would have simply told her with glee to go screw herself but that was not possible he had to handle it and the only way was to go out to queens and again grovel at vinnies highly polished wingtipped feet suddenly giving in to his urges he pounded the wall but he was smart enough to use his palm not his fist so that the force of the blow was delivered over a wider area still his hand tingled when he pulled it away even calmer after the blow he opened his phone with trembling fingers he punched in vinnies private cell phone number it was the phone vinnie carried with him night and day tell me you are calling me with some good news for a change vinnie said in the overly calm voice michael feared michael remembered a time that vinnie had used that very same voice when he dismissed a guy then as soon as the fellow was out of sight vinnie merely nodded to franco who also left and that was the end of the guy who was never seen again i got to talk to you michael said with as much equanimity as he could muster tonight vinnie questioned serenely in the background michael could hear festive chatter and the sound of frank sinatra crooning a sure indication that vinnie was still at the neapolitan the sooner the better michael said sorry to bother you and i wouldnt have done so it if wasnt important well suit yourself mikey but dont dillydally the later it gets the less tolerant i am for screwups if thats what you are coming to tell me michael put himself in high gear he dashed back to the club which was all but empty save for his two friends and the three jersey girls since it didnt start to rock until after eleven he told them he had an important meeting but that hed be back he then dashed down the fireescape stairs that were used as the entrance to the club jumped in his mercedes parked across the street and motored off since he was so far downtown he took the williamsburg bridge and then the expressway all the way to th street in corona in just slightly more than twenty minutes he had the neapolitan in sight michael had calmed down significantly during the short drive hed even pondered what plan b might be if vinnie simply refused to help as hed done that morning michael couldnt come up with any likely alternatives meaning he had to convince vinnie that he had to help such reasoning may have been well and good while michael had been in the car but now that he was crossing the street and about to confront vinnie his fears came back with a vengeance just outside the door he stopped trying to think up an appropriate intro vaguely he thought hed try to appeal to vinnies vanity which was at least a big target with that thought in mind michael went through the door and slipped through the curtain the restaurant was filled with birthday party revelers the ceiling was clogged with balloons and streamers were everywhere the tiny dance floor was littered with confetti and a large banner hung behind the bar with the words happy birthday victorio vinnie was at the same table as he was in the afternoon with carol at his side michael did not recognize his other friends frank sinatra was still droning away when michael looked at vinnie he did a minor double take he couldnt help but be buoyed vinnie was laughing so hard his eyes were apparently tearing michael stayed rooted where he was in hopes of catching vinnies eye but after five minutes it was apparent it wasnt going to happen with reluctance michael started off in vinnies direction he recognized a few people but most everybody else was a stranger michael couldnt help but notice that neither franco nor angelo seemed to be present although he did see freddie and richie at the bar as he neared the table he finally caught vinnies eye and he was pleased that vinnies smile did not falter vinnie introduced everyone and michael dutifully shook hands around the table then vinnie excused himself waved for michael to follow and walked deeper into the restaurant waving at some of the guests and shaking hands with others they then walked quickly through the kitchen which was in a mild panic to get out the entrees in the far back of the kitchen was a door to an office vinnie went through without hesitation paolo salvato the owner looked up from his desk in surprise paolo my friend vinnie intoned would it be an imposition if we used your office for a few moments paolo stood up not at all he hustled out from behind the desk and disappeared into the kitchen pulling the office door closed in the process okay mikey vinnie said turning to michael whats this new problem that couldnt wait until morning michael started by saying it was the kind of problem that only vinnie could deal with that was the attempt at appeasing vinnies ego then michael hurriedly outlined what angela had told him namely that there was a woman doctor a medical examiner to be precise who had suddenly taken it upon herself to solve the problem of the bacteria that had been causing the problems at the angels hospitals michael added that this was a very unfortunate development in that this doctor could go to the media and the ipo would be dead he finished by saying that someone uniquely persuasive had to talk with her and convince her it was in her interest to cease and desist to michaels relief vinnie didnt respond negatively nor did his expression change while michael had run through his quick summary but when michael was through in the most unexpected manner vinnie cocked his head to the side and with an impenetrably wry smile asked by any chance is the doctors name laurie montgomery it is michael replied with amazement and not a little confusion oh what a tragedy vinnie said clapping his hands in delight do you know this individual oh yes vinnie said calmly miss montgomery and i have a history she caused me one hell of a blowup with my wife over her brothers funeral home and also got me indicted and thrown in prison for two years id say that means we know each other but do you know who has had even more trouble than i have had with this bitch i cant guess michael said he was astounded and thankful at this unexpected but fortuitous situation angelo fifteen years ago she was responsible for his face getting so badly burned he almost died vinnie fumbled in the side pocket of his jacket and tried to pull out his cell phone in his haste the phone seemed to resist when he finally got it free he quickly made a call franco answered vinnie put the phone on speaker how are you two guys doing enjoying the cruise were having a ball franco said the first part of the evening was a pain in the balls but the second part has made up for it the fish have been fed terrific vinnie said is angelo there hes right here put him on angelos unique voice came through the phones speaker since he could barely oppose his lips his bs ds ms and ps had a distinctive muted quality angelo vinnie said what if i were to tell you that dr laurie montgomery you remember her dont you instead of answering angelo merely laughed in a decisively mordant fashion what if i were to tell you she is endangering an important deal of ours and that you and franco need to talk some sense into her like you boys did yesterday with mr yang angelo laughed again but this time with obvious glee id tell you that you wouldnt even have to pay me id do it for free provided i could do it my way guess what frankie boy just sang that song a few minutes ago here at the neapolitan it appears that youre going to get your wish vinnie disconnected he put his arm around michaels shoulder and guided him back through the kitchen seems that this is your lucky day too the eightk problem has been put to bed and you can stop worrying about laurie montgomery not bad for a nights work michael merely nodded that hed heard he was speechless twenty minutes later after having a glass of wine at vinnies table he sat in his car still marveling at the unpredictability of life april pm adam williamson was nestled into his range rover like a hand in a perfectfitting cashmerelined leather glove ludwig van beethovens remarkable ninth symphony had been playing for the last hundred or so miles and the astonishing final choir was about to begin adam had the volume almost full blast so the sound was as if he were seated in the center of the berlin philharmonic orchestra as the choir suddenly commenced adam sang along in german his voice drowning out the professional singers it was so moving that adam could feel goose pimples spread over his back and down his extremities it was nearly orgasmic with almost precise timing the last few notes of the symphony died away as adam completed a wide threehundredsixtydegree righthand turn that culminated in a row of toll booths blocking the entrance to the lincoln tunnel leading from new jersey to new york after paying the toll he entered the tunnel a bach cd was the next selection and the sounds of the fragile strings and harpsichord were the perfect foil for the brooding drama of beethoven and adams fingers began to play lightly on the steering wheel in time to the music it had been a pleasant drive from washington dc up to new york city but adam was now eager to arrive and eager to carry out his mission he knew very little about his target and that was the way he preferred it a fact that his handlers appreciated in his current line of work too much knowledge served only to complicate the issue all he needed was a name an address of either work or home and a few photos if no photo was available then a description would suffice on those missions where there was no photo and only a description he always allowed himself more time adam was not the kind of person who brooked mistakes so the setup invariably took longer and this current mission happened to be one of the nophoto types so he had reserved three full days on the outside chance he might have difficulty with the id the range rover emerged from the tunnel into the very heart of midtown manhattan adam had not been back to new york since hed come home from iraq as he headed north up eighth avenue he observed the city dispassionately which was hardly strange since in his current persona he viewed everything dispassionately when he was young even while in college hed come to the big city on numerous occasions with great excitement at first with his family and then alone and even on occasion with his fiancee but now as he drove north along eighth avenue with its tawdry shops it seemed as though it had been in a previous life and in some respects it had been adam had been a totally different person back then in fact he labeled his life as bi and ai meaning before iraq and after iraq bi adam williamson had been a rather reserved gentlemanly quietly intelligent young man with cleancut good looks whod fit into his upperclass new england life in an exemplary fashion hed gone to a respected boarding school had learned and respected good manners and had gone to harvard as did his father and his grandfather and back ad infinitum back to when the mayflowers long boat had scraped ashore in plymouth massachusetts the beginning of the interim between bi and ai hadnt been a nativity but rather the horrific event of which had jolted adams comfortable and predictable world akin to one of the planets being knocked out of its orbit at the instant the first plane crashed into the north tower of the world trade center adam had been brushing his teeth in the harvard business school dorm where he was dutifully learning the ins and outs of business as preparation ultimately to assume control of the family owned financial company against his parents wishes as well as his lawstudent fiancees adam insisted on volunteering for the military in a sudden burst of messianic zeal to do his part for america and democracy as a natural athlete whod been an allamerican lacrosse player as well as a polo devotee combined with a personality that motivated him to approach everything he did with one hundred percent effort once in the military which hed previously known nothing about he became fixated on becoming a member of the special forces and in keeping with his personality even that wasnt enough and he wasnt satisfied until he became a member of the delta force adam had enjoyed the training and reveled in its difficulty as if the training in and of itself was helping the cause of democracy but the real thing meaning actual combat came as an utter shock because adam was far more cerebral than physical on his second night mission in iraq he was forced to kill with a knife another living breathing human being and his reaction shocked and shamed him the experience had triggered a transcendental guilt and sadness which he hid from his squadmates to overcome what he construed as a weakness and a failing he went out of his way on subsequent missions to kill over time and with equal horror and relief he came to accept what he was doing as well as accept that hed been metamorphosed into a true killing machine with little or no emotional response it wasnt something he was happy about or proud of it was just what he thought was expected of him adam turned right at columbus circle and the bach brandenburg concertos seemed so apropos with the sudden appearance of central park with its lacy budding trees providing a welcome relief from the hard angular and mostly concrete city adams route was to take him along central park south all the way to madison avenue where hed turn north at that point it was a matter of going around the block to arrive at his destination the hotel pierre a new york city landmark from the gilded age the pierre had been the hotel adam had stayed in ever since hed visited the city as a small child all the way up to and including when he was in business school on this trip hed insisted on staying there to his handlers chagrin his primary handler in particular had tried to get him to stay in some less vigilant surroundings and where hed have his range rover instantly at his disposal but adam had insisted he was curious if hed feel any nostalgia he didnt think he would it was as if his experiences in iraq particularly the covert missions has sucked all the emotion out of him from both witnessing and participating in the kind of atrocities that before iraq bi he couldnt have ever imagined and most disturbing of all hed come to enjoy what he was doing even the killing his iraq experience came to a disastrous conclusion it happened during an illfated covert action that went horribly wrong he and the rest of his team had ended up being decimated by misdirected friendly fire which he and his colleagues had called in although hed not been killed as were his squadmates adam had had a leg broken and had been rendered unconscious in such a vulnerable state hed been taken hostage by the very people he and his team had been sent to kill or capture despite supposed preparatory training as a pow adam was unprepared for his ordeal as a captive he leg was never appropriately attended to and was a source of constant pain but worse he was tortured by repeated episodes during which he was certain he was about to be shot or beheaded although it had been explained to him as a common psychological response called the stockholm syndrome he was shocked when it happened to him after several months he began to identify with his captors and their twisted ideology hed even made a tape that was shown on al jazeera satellite tv in which he lauded the insurgents cause and cast aspersions on the united states motives for the iraq intervention his mind had been so twisted that when his release was eventually brokered by an fbi negotiator for the secret exchange of a number of insurgent detainees he didnt know whether to rejoice or bewail his release and ultimate repatriation intuitively hed known he could never return to his former life it was simply out of the question adam turned left on st street and halfway down the block pulled over to the pierres entrance marquee the doorman tipped his hat and opened the range rovers door checking in sir adam merely nodded as he climbed out of the car following the doorman to the cars rear adam insisted on taking the tennis bag which contained the tools of his trade the moment the doorman opened the hatchback the small overnight bag he allowed to be carried for him will you be needing your vehicle this evening the doorman asked as he held open the hotels door adam nodded again fine ill keep it right here at the door the doorman said as he gestured toward the registration desk directions werent necessary for adam as the lobby had barely changed over the twenty or so years he had intermittently stayed at the hotel pausing at the flowerbedecked center table in the middle of the carpet adam let his eyes take in the familiar surroundings including the raised sitting area to the right and mostly nineteenthcentury english furniture as hed expected he didnt feel anything the scene evoked no emotion whatsoever it was like his memories were of someone elses life the checkin was dispatched with commendable speed after which the receptionist called for a porter saying hector this is mr bramford from connecticut would you show him to his room by the way mr bramford weve given you a very nice park view bramford was one of the several identities adam carried on this particular mission along with all the associated documentation his handlers in washington ran a discreet riskmanagementsecurity firm with branches in major cities around the world and adam worked for them for special operations as an independent contractor the clients for the current mission all former lawyers and politicians had contacts in the highest levels of government so obtaining the identities had been relatively simple this way mr bramford hector said pointing toward the elevators the interior of the elevator was unique in regard to its french style and adam remembered it the moment he stepped in its frivolousness as well as its cleanliness stood in such sharp juxtaposition to his war experience that he marveled it could exist on the same planet as iraq and as he rose up in the fussy decor the sheer contrast of the total situation made him think back to his release from captivity at that time hed been picked up in the scrubby battlescarred desert dressed only in a soiled pair of boxer shorts and limping on a deformed leg within hours hed been airlifted to germany where his leg was rebroken and reset and he began treatment for what was called a posttraumatic stress disorder variant under the psychiatrists guidance adam made considerable strides in dealing with his anxiety his inability to concentrate his joylessness and his difficulty sleeping he had had less success with generating any interest whatsoever in returning to any semblance of his former life which included resurrecting his relationships with his family his familys business his fiancee or harvard business school he also had had no success in adjusting to the loss of the camaraderie of his delta force colleagues and the unique and addictive risk of making a kill adams psychiatrist had become frustrated by what she considered adams lack of progress until she suggested a new strategy namely for adam to embrace what hed been morphed into from his military experience rather than attempting to suppress or ignore it it was even she as an alexandria virginia resident who had introduced adam to the founder and ceo of risk control and security solutions which was extremely receptive to the combination of his special forces training and his experience of having been a pow to protect his identity they worked out an employment relationship which didnt show up on their books in return they paid him extremely well the pierre elevator reached the correct floor hector allowed adam to disembark first then pushed ahead to open the door to adams room he gave adam a rapid tour of the room including how to navigate the hotels simple entertainment systems and the location of the minibar then he backed out of the room obsequiously clutching adams tip for a few minutes adam stood in front of the window that gave out onto central park the most apparent object was the skating rink brightly illuminated in the center of the parks mostly dark expanse he then turned back into the room he took his tennis bag from his shoulder and unzipped it inside was a selection of favorite firearms carefully wrapped in towels and tape he took each out unwrapped them and checked to make sure they were all in the same working order as they had been when he had packed them when he was satisfied that his arsenal was unscathed by the drive he pulled out a single sheet of paper from an inner zipped pocket on it was the targets name a brief and probably useless description and the rather odd address of the office of the chief medical examiner of the city of new york april pm it doesnt look good dr tom flanagan said it doesnt look good at all dr tom flanagan was one of eight intensivists employed by university hospital at great cost to supervise care in the intensivecare unit or icu he was either there at the unit or on call he was speaking to dr marlene ravelo who was boardcertified in internal medicine and infectious disease and who ran the university hospital department of infectious disease unfortunately i agree dr ravelo said they were standing at the foot of ramona torress bed in a special isolation cubicle off the main icu room on the right side of the bed was dr raymond grady a pulmonologist he was busy adjusting her positivepressure ventilating machine in an attempt to give adequate volume it was becoming difficult he glanced at the readout for the central venous pressure and the other one for the pulmonary wedge pressure were not ventilating her very well he called across the bed to dr phyllis bohrman the cardiologist consult theyd called she was watching the ecg on another monitor next to her was the chief resident in medicine marvin poole its pretty clear why dr bohrman said look at that last chest xray the lungs are full of fluid lets look on the bright side dr flanagan said were getting a lot more practice handling sepsis with septic shock than usual with these angels healthcare patients thats true dr ravelo agreed but it would be nice to save one of them now and then we cant be faulted having had a liposuction this individuals surgical site infection covered a significant percentage of her bodys surface area lets not forget what i believe is necrotizing pneumonia dr ravelo said do you think the pneumonia is a result of seeding by her surgicalsite infection or do you think it is primary i mean isnt primary staph pneumonia rather rare it is but the time interval seems strange werent we told the pulmonary symptoms preceded the symptoms of cellulitis that was what was on the record its very strange especially considering last nights case was so similar although the surgicalsite infection was so much smaller okay guys and girls dr flanagan called out pulmonary function is heading south to antarctica cardiac function is going in the same direction so that the blood pressure is in the basement theres no longer any urinary output so that tells us whats happening in the kidneys and the liver is not doing what it should be doing thank you all for your hard work but weve clearly lost the battle dr flanagan and dr ravelo turned and walked back to the central desk where they got ramona torress chart to write their final notes do you think we should have done anything differently dr ravelo asked as they took seats side by side dr flanagan shook his head we followed the newer protocol to a t so i dont think so hell we gave her everything weve got including the activated protein c and corticosteroids equally as important you changed the antibiotics the instant we knew we were again dealing with mrsa so we can be confident we had the right cocktail and remember her apache ii score was off the charts when she arrived so we didnt have much to work with why cant we get angels hospitals to send these patients sooner thats a damn good question what im guessing is these patients infections develop just too damn quickly postsurgery i mean this woman was operated on just this morning at seventhirty am in her chart it says the first nonspecific symptoms started a little after four pm thats one hell of a rapid course with all the nasty toxins potentially at staphylococcuss disposal its understandable id be willing to put some money on this patients bug to have the pantonvalentine leukocidin or pvl gene does it surprise you that the angels hospitals are having so many mrsa cases dr flanagan asked yes and no staph is the most common surgical site pathogen and whereas mrsa comprised only two percent back in the nineteen seventies today it is sixty percent and rising all the time actually what bothers me most about these cases is the whole specialty hospital dilemma they dont have the resources for this kind of case and they have to outsource it in fact in one specialty hospital i think it was also an orthopedic hospital a patient had a heart attack and you know how they dealt with it no they called nineoneone you are kidding dr ravelo blurted in total disbelief they didnt have any doctors on duty can you believe it did the patient survive i dont think so thats a travesty i agree but what can you do are you aware of the specialty hospital debate in general i know a little about it i suppose its one of the advantages of being in academic medicine we dont have to get so involved in various privatesector squabbles i would not be so sure it might eventually influence our salaries the biggest problem most people see in these private specialty hospitals is that they are only interested in the cream of the patients ie the healthy wellinsured who come in to have a quick procedure and then are out its really a moneymaking machine because they get paid the same as the university gets paid but because they dont have icus like ours or an er like ours which are not moneymakers their costs are significantly less i heard the government had a moratorium against them for a while was that the reason no dr flanagan said the government was against them for a time actually from late to late because the specialty hospitals involve some level of physician ownership to guarantee a continual flow of patients there is an existing ban in medicare law for physicians to refer patients to medical service organizations in which they have ownership interest like imaging centers or clinical laboratories or the like but there is a loophole as far as a whole hospital is concerned ownership in that situation was not banned because it was thought that in a whole hospital there would be little risk of a conflict of interest but a specialty hospital is not a whole hospital dr ravelo said indignantly they only do a very limited number of services exactly yet it is by claiming they are a whole hospital that they are taking advantage of the loophole why was the moratorium lifted then i havent the foggiest idea there were a number of hearing on the issue in which all these points were clearly raised most people familiar with the debate whod either attended the hearings or read about them thought for sure the moratorium should be sustained and actually strengthened because the existing moratorium was only against new specialty hospitals getting medicare provider numbers which are necessary for reimbursement what happened suddenly the moratorium was lifted with little explanation my guess is that it was a behindthescenes lobby competition with the lobbyists from the ama pitted against the lobbyists for the aha or american hospital association and the fah or federation of american hospitals i guess the doctors spent more money than the hospital admin groups thats awful everything comes down to money im embarrassed for our profession well its not all bad patients generally like specialty hospitals and for routine procedures they are certainly more comfortable maybe we should ask ramona torres dr ravelo said maybe shed have an opinion about which is best a specialty hospital and its comforts or a truly fullservice hospital if shed been here from the start from our statistics she would have had a significantly higher chance of surviving her infection good point dr flanagan said a very good point april pm hey asshole carlo called while giving brennans shoulder a sudden forceful shake brennan whod fallen asleep and had slowly slipped down in his seat until his knees were pressing against the dash overreacted to being awakened so roughly by sitting bolt upright frantically he searched the immediate area outside the windshield for a beast or foe as soon as he heard carlo begin to chuckle in the darkness of the cars interior he became oriented to time place and person and just when he was about to say hed had quite enough of carlo for one night carlo pointed out something beyond the windshield i think our charges are returning to port carlo said front and center hed spent a year and a half in the armed forces before earning a dishonorable discharge hed hated the regimented experience but he still indulged in the phraseology on occasion brennan had to squint into the distance beyond the pier a sliver of a moon had arisen over the new york city skyline throwing a limpid line of reflections toward them across the hudson river brennan and carlo were still in carlos denali parked high on the hill at the very back of the marinas parking lot waiting for franco and angelos return i dont see them brennan said hardly had the words escaped his mouth before a sizable yacht silently slipped through the moons reflection okay i see a boat how do you know its them how many boats have we seen go in and out tonight you still dont know its them brennan said as he raised his binoculars with the magnification the boat looked ghostly as it slipped through the mist suspended over the waters surface arent they supposed to have some lights on how do i know what are we going to do were going to sit here and watch them leave and see if they are still accompanied by the young lady then we are going to take a look at their boat it seemed to take forever as the boat backed into its slip and franco and angelo made it secure when it was finally done the two men walked along the pier toward dry land carlo put down his window even from the distance carlo and brennan could hear that franco and angelo were carrying on as if theyd been to a party they were laughing as they climbed into francos finned cadillac slammed the doors and drove away it must have been quite a boat ride at the girls expense carlo commented as he started the car what a couple of pigs it doesnt make much sense i wonder who she was why all the effort she certainly didnt look like anything special it doesnt make sense to us but maybe louie can make sense out of it carlo said then turning to brennan he asked did you bring your locksmiths tools i always do lets take a quick look around the inside of the full speed ahead if you can manage the door and the alarm system ill manage them brennan said confidently two of brennans skills were lock picking and understanding electronic equipment including alarms and computers hed gone to a technical school for electronics after hed been kicked out of regular high school carlo reparked in approximately the same place francos car had been he took a flashlight from the dash before he and brennan walked out the pier they proceeded in silence listening to the waves softly lapping against the pilings when they got to the gangplank of full speed ahead carlo hesitated he looked back at his vehicle i hope they didnt forget something and come back want me to run back and move the car carlo shook his head lets just keep a sharp eye out for headlights wed have a lot of warning its not like this is the only boat on the pier they boarded the yacht quickly start on the door carlo said ill keep an eye out posh boat brennan said then he stopped what do you think this stack of cinder blocks is for three guesses and the first two dont count lunkhead brennan looked back at the cinder blocks and suppressed a shiver at the thought proceeding on to the glazed double doors leading into the yachts interior he got out his set of tiny locksmiths tools he didnt have much light but he didnt need much lock picking was a skill done mostly by feel what do you think carlo asked he was sitting on the gunwale at the very stern where he had a good view of the approach into the marina as well as the entire parking lot a piece of cake brennan said two minutes later he had the lock open but had to deal with the primitive alarm system with that taken care of he called to carlo carlo used his handheld light to quickly scan the interior of the main saloon he pointed to the glasses on the bar so they were drinking explains their mood what if we find the girl what are we going to do well have to improvise his light found the steps and the gangway forward after taking another look up at the entranceway into the marina which he could barely see thanks to the neighboring boat which was almost as large as the one they were on carlo led the way down the stairs and into the galley and dining area moving quickly to avoid being out of sight of land they crossed the galley into the gangway leading forward carlo briefly tried each door but the staterooms were all empty and undisturbed until they came to the last one in it the queensized bed cover was in disarray as was a towel on its surface id say this was the scene of the crime carlo said he shone the light around the room which was otherwise totally shipshape the girls gone thats what we came here to find out so now lets blow they rapidly backtracked carlo didnt feel comfortable until he had a reasonable view of the marina and the parking area at the boats stern all was serene he turned back to brennan i just had an idea how easy would it be to hide a tracking device on this yacht easy brennan said what kind of tracking device are you interested in one that records exactly where the boats been or one that tracks in real time and you can watch where the boat goes the second one carlo said warming to the idea no sweat we can put a thing about the size of a deck of cards someplace here on the boat and then set up a situation where we can follow it on the internet good lets run it by louie first ah come on angelo pleaded its not that much out of the way but its going to midnight and im exhausted franco said they were in the lincoln tunnel heading back to new york city where franco was intending to drive directly across manhattan to connect with the queens midtown tunnel i want to stop at the neapolitan franco continued the party will be breaking up soon and id like a chance to make sure vinnie understands the secretary is history its only twenty blocks out the way i just want to see if she still lives in the same place because if she does the job will be a piece of cake you cant believe how much im looking forward to getting some revenge ive done two stints in the slammer for that bitch got coldcocked by her damn boyfriend and shes the one responsible for my face looking the way it does franco glanced over at angelo in the halflight of the car hed become accustomed to angelos horrific facial scarring he wondered if it were his own face would he ever get used to it what would it take angelo said ten minutes fifteen at most okay okay franco said reluctantly twenty minutes later francos big black car was creeping along th street with angelo bent down to see the buildings facades the last time hed been there had been ten years earlier but the experience had been burned into his memory hed been certain hed remember the building but it wasnt happening which one for chrissake franco demanded hed made the decision to sacrifice the time because hed momentarily felt sorry for angelo but the rationale was wearing thin with angelo taking so freaking long merely to pick out the right building earlier angelo had assured him there wouldnt be a problem there it is angelo exclaimed suddenly he pointed are you sure franco questioned he looked at the building angelo was pointing at it was brick in a mild state of disrepair exactly like the buildings on either side how can you tell trust me i can tell as angelo climbed out of the car franco called after him to remind him that their visit was only a quick reconnoiter angelo waved over his shoulder to indicate hed heard angelo glanced up at the top of the building lights were on in the fifthfloor apartment dr laurie montgomerys had been the apartment in the back b angelo pulled open the outer door and stepped into the foyer as soon as he did he remembered his crazy partner tony ruggerio blasting away in that particular foyer at a woman who both of them thought was laurie montgomery but who turned out to be someone else partnering with tony had been a frustrating handicap for angelo but hed had no choice in the matter until the guys recklessness got him killed hoping for pay dirt angelo checked the names alongside the buzzers and mailboxes to his great disappointment the name for b was martin soloway having keyed himself up to such an extent angelo felt a momentarily paralyzing letdown but then he remembered that he knew where she worked and his mindset took a rapid aboutface only to be halted by the very real possibility that after twelve years she might have switched jobs as well as apartments in a mood hovering between unbridled anticipation and abject despondency angelo returned to the car and climbed in although the retracted scarring of angelos face restricted his range of facial expression franco had learned to interpret subtle small changes he knew instantly that angelo was dejected shes no longer there franco questioned no longer there angelo confirmed he then told franco his concerns that she might have left town hey buck up shes got to be here she wouldnt be causing trouble if she wasnt although there wasnt a lot of facial movement franco could tell that angelos mood had changed for the better april am angela had had difficulty falling asleep shed tried reading but after several hours shed given up instead she tried the tv which usually put her to sleep within ten minutes but on this occasion was no better than the book while struggling to pay attention to the latenight talk show her mind kept reverting to her major worries the capital shortfall paul yangs apparent binge with a prepared k sitting in his laptop a mere click away from submission to the sec and dr laurie montgomerys potential of turning the mrsa problem into a publicrelations disaster either by discouraging doctors and patients to use the angels hospitals or by alerting the sec to a major problem which had major financial consequences angela finally gave in and took an ambien she knew shed been reverting to the crutch of using a hypnotic drug too frequently over the previous few months but she felt it was warranted of all the people at angels healthcare she was the only one who could be trusted to keep the ipo on track in the current crisis to do that she needed her wits which certainly required sleep as had been the case in the recent past the tiny white racetrackshaped tablet worked its wonders and angela fell into a deep albeit drugged sleep with disturbing dreams the worst dream was about being forced to move along a narrow ledge on a horrendously high and otherwise perfectly perpendicular cliff although not knowing exactly why she had to get to the other side of the cliff or there would be a catastrophe the ledge became progressively more and more narrow and within sight of her goal her foot slipped off the edge although she was able to grasp the edge with her hands she was unable to haul herself back up onto the narrow ledge gradually her fingers and arms tired and she slipped off and fell into the abyss angela awoke with her heart racing relieved to be alive although she could understand the origin of the theme of the dream she wondered where the idea of being on a cliff had come from although not looking forward to the cold marble floor of the bathroom she had no choice so she eased out from under the covers to keep her spot as warm as possible she tried to be quick just as she tried to keep her mind a blank what she was worried about was not falling back asleep she guesstimated shed only slept for about five hours unfortunately angelas fears became a reality although she still felt exhausted and even drugged to a degree she could not quiet her mind which ignored her orders and quickly went into high gear it was going to be a busy day first she wanted to reassure herself that michaels fifty thousand had been wired into the companys account next she wanted to hear from bob if paul had resurfaced and more important if he had filed or not by fourthirty angela acknowledged that more sleep no matter how necessary was out of the question reluctantly she got up and on her way to the kitchen she stopped at her daughters door after briefly wondering if it was worth waking her angela pushed open the childs door with enough illumination spilling in from the nightlight in the hall she could see michelles familiar form with her dark luxurious hair pulled back from her angelic face in the dim lighting her flawless skin seemed to radiate supernaturally from within for a moment angela stood there looking down at her daughter as only a parent can do she felt a surge of love that eclipsed by a millionfold all the heartache and venom associated with michael the ignominy of the bankruptcy and the anxiety of all the current problems with angels healthcare it was a way for angela to reorganize her priorities as she considered what was really important and as she did so she thought about the previous evening after the fact far more than during her dinner with chet mcgovern shed realized she enjoyed herself in a way shed not anticipated although shed agreed to go for utilitarian purposes namely to find out whether laurie montgomery was a real threat shed relearned that honest conversation and general interaction with an apparently healthy man could be selfrevealing shed never had such a frank discussion about her motivations with anyone including herself as quietly as shed entered michelles room she left pulling the door shut but not closed exactly as she had found it michelle had always needed a bit of light as a connection to the real world cutting through the darkness of her room advancing into the kitchen angela quietly readied the espresso machine haydees bedroom and bath were off the kitchen and angela didnt want to disturb her as she waited for the light to indicate that the machine temperature and pressure were up to the proper level angela went back to her musing about the dinner experience with chet mcgovern what she had admitted to him about going to medical school partly to get revenge against her father was not particularly flattering what she failed to tell him was how much she had enjoyed medical school particularly the clinical years and even more so how much she had loved medical residency although most of her contemporaries had found residency training a grind she truly thought of it as the crowning experience of her life a perfect combination of service and learning the coffeemaker light indicated that it was ready angela loaded one of the sealed capsules tightened the handle into the unit and turned it on she grimaced at the noise in the stillness of the apartment as the coffee ran into the cup angela reminisced about individual episodes shed had with patients and families during her residency and during the year shed had her private practice they ranged from the sublimely joyous to the sublimely sad but always uniquely human then she found herself comparing how shed felt after a day of practicing medicine to how she felt after a day working at angels healthcare and acknowledged how fundamentally different the rewards were with medicine it was deeply personal at the end of the day she could almost always revel in the fact that she had helped at least a few people in the most direct way possible with business it was more vague and had to do with accomplishing something even if it was difficult to define exactly what it was although it invariably had something to do with money angela took her coffee back to her study it was her favorite room in the apartment with one entire wall of floortoceiling bookshelves complete with a ladder that was attached to a track across the bookshelves face angela had loved books as a child and was proud that shed never thrown one away at the desk angela got out a legal pad and began writing down the problems she was currently facing and what she would try to do about them that day when she wrote pauls name down she thought about the man having an alcohol problem which she hadnt known about from the standpoint of a ceo it made her angry that the information had been kept from her and she was surprised bob had done so but then thanks to her recent reflections about her medical training she thought about the problem from a physicians point of view and remembered how difficult all addictions could be angela then wondered if the company should pay for inpatient rehab which might be important if he was truly relapsed she wrote the idea down it was an issue that should be considered after the ipo when angela wrote dr laurie montgomerys name down she paused there was little she could do about that problem it was in michaels hands for whatever that was worth the previous evening when shed called him to tell him the disturbing news about lauries apparent personality and the fact that she had voiced that she was going to solve the angels healthcare problem with mrsa if it killed her hed said that hed do something about it immediately knowing him as well as she did she had no idea whether he was telling her the truth or just placating her for the moment with her intuition telling her loud and clear that laurie montgomery was the biggest threat to keeping their infection problem out of the media since the problem began there was no time to delay with all the trouble and effort they were going through with the cashflow problem it would be tragic if the ipo stumbled from the work of an overenthusiastic medical examiner angelas eyes strayed over to her telephone and then on to the tiffany desk clock it was fourthirtyfive in the morning hardly the time for a personal call yet she was so certain of lauries threat potential that she seriously debated calling from sore experience she knew michael sometimes partied to such an hour even five am on numerous occasions when they were married talking herself into making the call angela justified it because of the importance of starting some sort of offense against laurie and because michael deserved it all those times hed stayed out to such an hour hed return and wake her with his drunkenness and sometimes even michelle with a certain vengeful glee angela dialed the number as the number rang she fully expected his voice mail especially since he had caller id and she had a private line to her surprise he answered sounding mildly intoxicated this better be important he said slurring his words michael its angela there was a pause in the background angela could hear a womans voice with a heavy new jersey accent complaining and demanding to know who was calling in the middle of the night did you hear me angela demanded now that shed awakened him she felt a tad guilty but she was determined not to show it for chrissake its fourthirty in the fucking morning its fourthirtyfive to be exact im concerned about the dr laurie montgomery issue i called you about last night i said id take care of it have you i told you id take care of it and i did its over its done so go back to sleep how are you so sure as i was told she has a reputation of being very persistent its not going to matter how persistent she is my client actually knows her personally he said hed be happy to talk with her and hes confident shell be amenable to his position what i gathered was that the doctor owes my client bigtime michaels explanation didnt make too much sense but his assuredness did angela thanked him and told him to go back to sleep april am laurie had been awake for a while she didnt know exactly how long when she finally looked at the clock by then it was quarter to five an hour before jack would be getting up to shower and an hour and fifteen minutes before he would come back and drag her out of bed that was the normal routine and the fact that she was already awake spoke volumes about her mental state laurie was a night person along about ten oclock when jack was finding it hard to hold up his eyelids laurie would usually get a second wind she loved to read at night and would stay up after midnight engrossed in a novel more often than she liked to admit always to deride herself the following morning and vow never to do it again now as she lay there fully awake and staring up at the dark ceiling she knew exactly what the problem was she was depressed it wasnt a major incapacitating depression which shed never had but could imagine was like but rather a nagging melancholy that she was inexorably being set up for a major disappointment shed always wanted a child from as early as she could remember and she always thought of herself as a motherinwaiting through her long medical training which shed blamed for not having had the time to find a spouse then shed fallen in love with jack and had to deal with his guilt over the loss of his family and whether or not he could commit to another but that was now behind them and they were trying to have a family but over the last year it hadnt happened despite temperature charts and careful monitoring of her cycles the problem as she saw it was her age now that she was in her forties every month that went by she was terrified that her chances of naturally conceiving had sunk and now jack was insisting on having an operation which would take him out of commission for god knew how long and not only that he was choosing to have it at a time when he was putting himself at significant risk laurie rolled over on her side facing jack and propped herself up on an elbow she gazed at his profile the picture of tranquility lying on his back with one arm casually thrown onto the pillow behind his head she did indeed love him but his obstinacy could drive her to distraction as was the case with the surgery issue for the life of her she could not understand how he could dismiss the data and believe it was prudent to have the procedure recognizing that more sleep was not in the cards laurie got out of bed with her bathrobe and slippers on she padded into the study they had made facing out onto th street it was just becoming light she looked down from the window onto jacks beloved basketball court wishing it would suddenly disappear then she turned back to the partners desk her side was piled high with the mrsa case files and hospital records of the twentyfour cases along with her uncompleted matrix shed hauled all the material home with the intention of working on it the previous evening but she hadnt done it and now that she was awake early she thought she would take advantage of the time but before even sitting down she recognized she felt the same as she had the night before her despondency kept telling her that her efforts were in vain jack was just going to do what jack wanted in the kitchen laurie made herself some coffee sitting down at the breakfast table she began thinking about the process of in vitro fertilization and how jack would respond to the ideaalthough it would be a natural progression theyd not discussed it in truth laurie had been afraid she knew that jacks agreement to have children was more to please her than something he intrinsically wanted to do to lauries surprise and despite being unable to fall back asleep in bed she fell asleep at the kitchen table as evidence of how tired she was what woke her was jack standing in the doorway completely naked with his hands on his hips and an exaggerated expression of confusion on his face what the hell are you doing snoozing in the kitchen he asked i couldnt sleep laurie said conscious of the irony jack advanced into the room and put a hand on her shoulder if you are still fretting about this surgery ill promise you ill be fine oh yeah sure laurie said sarcastically as if you have control why do you have to be so headstrong look whos talking well if the situation was reversed i sure as hell wouldnt be taking the kind of gamble youre planning on taking hey jack said weve been through this remember lets agree to disagree i have to go over to the hospital this morning on the way to work for a quick preop blood and urine test get the mrsa swab i told you about and have a quick chat with the anesthesiologist thats why im up early why dont you come along witnessing all such preparation maybe youll feel better laurie thought for a moment about the suggestion at first she thought she didnt want any further association with jacks surgical plans as a way of protest but rethinking the issue she didnt want to cut off her nose to spite her face on this visit shed be invited as a spouse of a patient so she wouldnt be blamed for making an official me visit laurie couldnt help but feel that if the mrsa cases werent intentional then it had to be some sort of systems error involving all three hospitals and if there was any chance of her guessing what such an error could be shed have to have opportunities to visit which jack was obviously affording okay ill come laurie said with such sudden decisiveness that jack was mildly taken aback wonderful he said lets hit the shower and be on our way franco awoke but opened only one eye his cell phone was ringing but before he answered it he looked at his radio alarm to see the time it was fivefortyfive accompanied by an extended string of blasphemy and expletives he snaked a hand out from beneath the covers and put the phone to his ear yeah he said with a tone that would let the caller know he was not happy about being disturbed at such an hour the only reason he answered was because it might be vinnie lets get a move on angelo said but lets not take your boat lets take a van with a few more carefully chosen expletives franco reminded angelo what time it was i know its early angelo admitted but when i got back to my apartment last night i called the me office i asked about dr laurie montgomery and was told she still works there i also asked what time she comes into work in case we can snatch her i know these people work long hours youre too damn eager franco complained vinnie wanted it done yesterday dont you remember yeah i remember franco said reluctantly okay lets meet up at the neapolitan ill get the van the neapolitans not going to be open oh youre right angelo youre too into this slow down its when youre all keyed up that mistakes are made like forgetting that nobodys at the damn restaurant until after ten youre right i am keyed up but you would be too if you was me i tell you what ill pick you up at your apartment at sixthirty okay you can still pick me up at the restaurant franco said he didnt want to be without his car later on in the day theres always a place to park right in front as early as it is he disconnected and threw his feet out from under the blankets he sensed it was going to be a long day trying to tamp down angelos zeal especially since knocking off a public servant who worked in a reasonably secure environment was not going to be a walk in the park adam williamson answered the phone on the first ring especially on a mission he slept like a nervous cat always prepared to leap up at the slightest provocation mr bramford it is six oclock as you requested the weather is expected to be cloudy with a possible shower and with a high temperature of sixtytwo degrees adam thanked the operator and immediately called room service for a full breakfast of juice eggs bacon fried potatoes and coffee on missions like this one he never knew when hed have a chance to eat again on a stakeout of the targets home or place of work to help him his handlers always provided commercial plates in the particular state the operation was to take place along with lettering on the range rovers doors on this occasion it was an interior design and antiques store on th street called biedermeier heaven with a contented feeling that all was in order adam stepped into the shower ever since returning from iraq it was only at times like this that he felt whole he was on a mission and all was going according to plan the only way it could have been better was if he were doing it with several of his fellow delta force buddies whod been with him on his last fateful military mission of course the apogee was yet to come that was when he made the kill laurie stayed a few steps behind jack as they entered angels orthopedic hospital it was significantly busier at sixfifteen in the morning than it had been at twothirty the previous afternoon as jack went to the information booth laurie stayed close although she had a legitimate reason for being there she was not interested in causing any sort of confrontation such as what might happen if she had the misfortune of running into either angela dawson or cynthia sarpoulus loraine newman probably would have been a different story but even she might feel obligated to call the others if she saw laurie after all they were her bosses jack was given directions to the second floor as they waited for an elevator jack noticed lauries vigilant behavior what the devils gotten into you he questioned youre like a squirrel expecting theres a dog in the neighborhood i told you i wasnt treated with much hospitality yesterday id just as soon avoid meeting the organizations ceo or their infectioncontrol specialist dont be so paranoid you have full right to be here maybe so but i prefer not to get in any row about it on the second floor they found their way with ease to the preop waiting area the space was decorated more like a living room in a private mansion than part of a hospital even the name was a misnomer as there was little waiting involved although there were a number of other patients for surgery the next day there was adequate staff available jack and laurie didnt even have to sit down before jack was about to be taken back to an examination room where his blood was to be drawn do you have your cell phone laurie asked jack of course why i have mine as well im going to run up to the fourth floor and visit the clinical pathology lab call me if im not back here when youre ready to go jack winked so you are going to make constructive use of your time something like that laurie admitted although laurie initially didnt want to be recognized while visiting the hospital she now changed her mind she thought shed use the opportunity to see if walter osgood was there remembering that she would be calling the cdc sometime during the day she wanted to know if walter osgood would like to know if the mrsa infecting the hospitals at least in three patients was the selfsame subtype meaning theyd have to all three come from the same source it had irked her the previous afternoon when hed tried to justify not subtyping the bacteria on all the cases from an epidemiological point of view it was mandatory especially in a situation where the source and the method of spread were unknown on the fourth floor laurie walked into the laboratory and asked the first technician she encountered if dr osgood was there i have no idea the technician admitted youd have to ask dr friedlander the supervisor of the clinical lab his office is against the back wall you cant miss it she pointed across the room ive heard that before laurie mumbled to herself as she walked in the direction she was shown despite her misgivings she did stumble directly onto the office as the technician had suggested advancing to the open door laurie looked in at a thin bearded man in a spotless crisply ironed long white coat engaged in paperwork at his desk excuse me laurie called out can i help you im looking for dr osgood can you tell me if he is here this morning no not today today he is simon spun around in his chair to gaze at the bulletin board behind him he is at angels heart hospital hes here only monday and thursday thanks laurie said is there something i can help you with im the supervisor of the clinical pathology lab i think i need to talk directly with dr osgood laurie said although she briefly thought about asking dr friedlander to convey the message is it urgent we could always call hes usually available on his cell it involves the mrsa outbreak id say that was important enough and who exactly are you after laurie had identified herself dr friedlander made the call as soon as he got osgood on the line he told him that a dr laurie montgomery was standing in his office and wanted to speak with him laurie reached out for the phone but dr friedlander put up his hand to have her wait laurie could not hear what dr osgood was saying but dr friedlander locked eyes with her as he intermittently said yes into the phone with a final i understand he then dropped the receiver into its cradle before returning his attention to laurie and said sorry im afraid dr osgood is fully engaged he asked that you call him back sometime today at the home office i can give you the number taking one of his own business cards he circled the angels healthcare number and leaning across his desk handed it over to laurie mildly chagrined at being so impersonally rejected when she thought she was about to do the man a favor laurie turned on her heels and walked out of the windowless office now it was definitely an emergency walter osgood reasoned the first time it had been vague intuition based mostly on dr laurie montgomerys resistance to accepting his rationale for failing to have the mrsa completely characterized but now it was different she was back in the angels orthopedic hospital despite the companys ceo all but telling her directly not to return and on this occasion requesting to speak with him of all people getting out the emergency number again walter called washington this time the phone rang even more times than it had the previous day yet it was eventually answered the deep wary voice on this occasion sounded sleepaddled what is it this time the same problem are you on a landline yes call me back at this number the man gave walter another number then disconnected walter waited for several minutes before dialing the same man answered although the slight hoarseness was gone are you talking about the medical examiner yes she came back this morning apparently investigating even though she was all but told not to she worries me im not sure i want to continue if something is not done about her something is surely being done you have to be patient like what is being done walter demanded he hated all the secrecy especially since he was the one out in the cold we have an individual in the city at this moment whose specialty is to take care of this kind of problem you are going to have to be more specific i think the less you know the better are you saying someone is here in new york right now thats exactly what i am saying how about his or her name and a number sorry i cant do that im not sure i want to continue with all this im afraid you dont have any choice at this point it was your option to begin but it is not your option to stop the pressure must be maintained at least for a few more days walter felt a mixture of anger and fear but the fear won out he didnt respond i hope your silence means you understand the reality of your situation if she shows up again in the next few days can i call you to let you know whomever you sent here hasnt convinced her to stop her meddling yes you do that but rest assured we have sent our best negotiator one other question i dont know your name theres no need for you to know my name similar to the call the day before the line was cut off precipitously and walter found himself listening to a dead line slowly he hung up the receiver despite the reassurances the man had given walter panicked and wondered how bad a decision to become involved it would turn out to be when all was said and done his only consolation was that his son had seemingly stabilized and the doctors who were administering the supposed experimental treatment were moderately optimistic by the time laurie had had the time to read only a few of the days oped pieces in the times jack had appeared accompanied by a youthful doctor dressed in scrubs but covered by a long white coat as crisp and clean as dr friedlanders apparently such smartness was hospital policy laurie had to admit that it appeared far superior to some of the residents at the university hospital who seemed to revel in having the most soiled white coats as if it were testament to how hard they were working jack introduced the man as dr jeff albright to laurie he had the bluest eyes shed ever seen im lucky jack continued dr albright has agreed to pass gas for me in the morning i told him you were concerned about mrsa and me having surgery so he graciously offered to come out and have a word with you and hopefully put your mind at ease laurie shook hands with the anesthesiologist and noting how young he appeared made her feel old by comparison she also felt abashed from jacks introduction as if she were an oversolicitous mother jeff gave the usual stereotypical assurance and said that jack was as healthy as an ox making laurie wonder just how healthy oxen were since she thought the expression was strong as an ox when jeff finished his prepared speech laurie asked him how many cases hed done after which the patient came down with an mrsa infection somewhat nervously his eyes flicked back and forth between laurie and jack apparently jack had not asked such a specific question one he finally admitted it was several months ago after a shoulder rotator cuff repair like the others it was totally unexpected and unfortunately fatal what was the name laurie asked im not sure im at liberty to divulge that jeff said laurie knew she had the right to ask as it was undoubtedly a medical examiner case but she didnt push the issue the name didnt matter other than to reassure herself shed not missed a case she was more interested in jacks upcoming surgery was there anything you can remember about the case that was unusual jeff shook his head it went entirely smoothly well there was one thing we staff have been regularly tested for mrsa ourselves on a weekly basis during the week that the death occurred i did turn positive whether it happened from that patient i dont know but i can safely say im free now i was screened just yesterday im happy to report im also free of those buggers jack said were you the anesthesiologist for david jeffries on monday laurie asked no i wasnt that was dolores suarez thank you for talking with me laurie said she smiled weakly jeffs efforts didnt make her any more confident well take good care of your husband jeff promised he said goodbye and disappeared back into the examining area so jack said you have to admit this is a nice operation so to speak just the fact theres no waiting makes it unique its neat its clean its pleasant laurie admitted but there is obviously a problem here despite its apparent cleanliness dont tell me you are not reassured mrsa is surely not respecting the luxurious venue you are impossible jack said with a sigh every hospital is seeing mrsa but every hospital is not seeing multiple cases of mrsa necrotizing pneumonia thats killing people as if it were a raging hemorrhagic fever like ebola come on jack said with some frustration lets get to work this is a fucking mess franco complained this is what you got me out of bed for he gestured ahead through the vans windshield in front of the medical examiners office was an unruly crowd of fifty or sixty people staging an unauthorized protest over the medical examiners initial report regarding concepcion lopez whom bingham had posted the day before most of the protestors were hispanic and most were carrying amateurish placards taped or stapled to broom handles attesting to a supposed coverup and complaining of police brutality to the hispanic community what i cant figure is what theyre doing here so goddamn early angelo said id guess to get on the morning news franco said besides they get more bang for the buck if they block rushhour traffic which they are obviously doing many of the protestors were wandering out into first avenue police in riot gear were waiting to be called out of their bus parked on th street for the time being the regular police were trying to keep the crowd out of the streets and confined to an area directly in front of the ocme but with minimal success franco and angelo were sitting in the lucia organizations van which was mostly used for hijacking and other forms of thieving at kennedy airport they were parked at the curb between th and th streets in a no parkingno standing area in front of one of the original bellevue hospital buildings they had a good view of the entrance to the ocme except for a range rover parked in front of them whats with this suv angelo complained this is a noparking zone for chrissake its amazing how people just ignore the law calm down franco responded angelo hit the steering wheel several times in frustrated anger of all days why do they have to have their protest today youre getting yourself all worked up franco warned why dont we just leave with all these cops around much less all these bellyaching nuts theres no way were going to be able to make a grab i want to at least see her angelo groused then i want to go to home depot with a dumbfounded expression franco looked over at angelo home depot what the hell are you going to get at home depot angelo returned the stare and in the process raised his eyebrows as much as he was able wait a second franco said suddenly remembering tell me youre not going to get a bucket and quickset vinnie specifically said i could do it my way and that is exactly what i plan to do ever since i saw it in that movie ive wanted to do it to someone who deserved it and no one deserves it more than laurie montgomery as im sure vinnie would agree oh for the love of god franco groaned raising his eyes heavenward there she is angelo shouted excitedly pointing out his side window he reached for the door handle and had the door open before franco was able to get ahold of his arm what the hell do you think youre doing franco shouted as angelo struggled to free his arm the place is crawling with cops its suicide to go out there angelo stopped struggling pulled his foot in and closed the door he knew franco was right there was no way he could approach laurie under the circumstances as tense with anticipation as hed been all morning hed reacted by reflex when hed caught sight of her getting out of a taxi on the opposite side of the street obviously avoiding the crowd of protesters in front of the ocme suffering from acute and frustrating impotence he was forced to watch laurie a mere fifty or so feet away as she leaned back into the taxi and extracted a pair of crutches next to emerge was jack thats her boyfriend angelo growled i wouldnt mind icing him at the same time calm down franco said again i feel like im sitting with a mad dog for almost a minute laurie and jack stood in plain sight severely testing angelos restraint waiting for the light to change then like a cat forced to watch a tempting mouse walk directly in front of its nose angelo had to find the selfcontrol to witness their slow progress across first avenue when they turned to cross th street they were only the length of the range rover in front this would have been perfect if it hadnt been for the protest maybe so maybe not franco said philosophically so now youve seen her lets get the hell out of here angelo started the van im thinking he said shes going to recognize me just as easily as i recognized her maybe easier franco agreed that means we should have more people angelo put the van in gear looked behind him down first avenue and pulled away from the curb when we come back later this afternoon i think we should have freddie and richie with us i think thats a good idea franco agreed adam had scouted the area around the ocme the night before and had come up with a plan to make a definitive id on the target hed arrived that morning just before seven and had parked his range rover in an appropriate noparking zone where he was reasonably confident the commercial plates would work their usual magic he hadnt been happy about the protest which was just beginning to form not because of the people and the confusion they would cause but because of the tv vans and crews he assumed would be sent to cover the event adam wanted to avoid at all costs being caught on film as hed expected the outer door to the ocme had been open although it had been locked the night before why hed been so sure it would be open in the morning was that by peering in the previous night he had been able to see a reception desk inside and another set of glass doors beyond once inside adam had retreated to a vinyl couch with a copy of the new york times the receptionist asked adam if she could be of assistance he had told her that he was told to wait for one of the medical examiners for fifteen minutes adam had sat in the reception area several people had come in including one medical examiner whom the receptionist had greeted as dr mehta the other people had been addressed by their first names the receptionists name he learned was marlene wilson at exactly sevenfifteen the outer door opened the first person to come in did so on crutches adam lowered the paper so he could see over the top the second person looked encouraging she was of medium height with sculptured features brunette hair with auburn highlights and a surprisingly pale almost blond complexion in adams mind she matched the description as meager as it was but he had to be certain good morning you two the receptionist said to adams chagrin meaning he was forced to go to plan b hed quickly learned the modus operandi for entry was for the receptionist to make verbal contact before buzzing the employees in the regular employees went through the double doors directly opposite doors to the street the one medical doctor whod come in went to a door beyond the receptionists desk to be buzzed in requiring her to walk across the room in front of adam the person adam believed to be the target proceeded to follow the route of the previous doctor as did the man on the crutches excuse me adam called out are you dr laurie montgomery laurie stopped a step beyond adam as did jack who was almost even with the mans location adam got to his feet and regarded laurie for a beat in keeping with her light complexion her eyes were a pale bluegreen adam asked again if she were laurie montgomery why do you ask laurie questioned im from abc collection adam said could you tell me if you have ever lived in the soho section of greenwich village laurie exchanged a questioning glance with jack no i havent laurie said but your name is laurie montgomery yes but ive never lived in soho sorry to bother you then adam said and started for the door why are you looking for a laurie montgomery in soho if i may ask for a phone bill which was unpaid when she moved sorry laurie said as she turned toward the id room door adam continued outside the protest was in full swing with the protesters marching in a circle in front of the building chanting over and over in unison police brutality must be stopped coverup coverup being careful to avoid any chance of being caught by any of the cameras adam returned to his vehicle climbed in and then skirted the commotion heading north on first avenue he thought hed return to the hotel do a little planning over a second cup of coffee and then head up to the metropolitan museum it had been a favorite destination in his youth he was quite certain hed not see laurie montgomery until late that afternoon since he had yet to have her home address he was going to have to rely on the ocme to provide access april am well its about time you guys detective lieutenant lou soldano said he tossed his newspaper aside and made a production out of examining his watch youve always bragged how early you get here this aint that early what is this jack questioned is this today or is it yesterday we dont see you for months and here you are two days in a row what gives i imagine my appearance gives away the fact that once again ive been up all night how come you dont let anyone else in your department do any work lou thought for a minute it was a question hed never asked himself i guess because i dont have anything else to do i suppose that sounds rather pathetic you said it i didnt jack said as he settled into one of the brown vinyl chairs and elevated his bad knee we would have been earlier laurie said but we had to stop at the hospital for jacks preop workup lou looked from laurie to jack are you still going through with the surgery tomorrow lets not get into that jack said rather lets hear why you were up all night it was a bit of deja vu lou said laurie called over to jack to ask if he wanted coffee and he gave the usual thumbsup sign he then motioned for lou to continue i was out with the harbor guys once again just like the previous night theyd come across a floater whod been shot in the exact same fashion as the one the previous night id left word to call me if it happened and they did its just what i didnt want to see most of the other wars the competing organizedcrime syndicates have waged have started out the same way first a hit then another and then a goddamn avalanche laurie brought over jacks coffee in one hand and hers in another she sat on the arm of jacks chair listening to lou the only hopeful sign is that this hit was a little different how so jack asked the victims a girl lou said but then quickly added i mean a woman he glanced up guiltily at laurie he knew she was sensitive to feminist issues such as calling women girls thats rather novel he continued we havent seen too many women bumped off ganglandstyle so i suppose theres hope this episode is unrelated to yesterdays meaning its not necessarily an escalation of whatever was the cause of yesterdays hit the floater is not the only bit of deja vu dr riva mehta called out from the desk where she was going over all the cases that had come in overnight and deciding which ones needed to be autopsied and who in the me staff would do them laurie you asked about mrsa cases theres another one here i assume you want it absolutely laurie said slipping off the arm of jacks chair and scooting over toward riva is it from an angels healthcare hospital nope its from university hospital laurie took the case folder and walked over to the chair next to vinnies who was engrossed as per usual in the sports section of the daily news damn jack whispered returning his attention to lou shes probably going to use this new case as more grist for her mill about canceling my surgery tomorrow so please dont bring it up ill try but when it comes to common sense you are not even in lauries league are you sure you shouldnt follow her advice dont start jack said holding up his hand as if to ward off a literal attack lets get back to your case was the floater clothed or naked interesting you should ask she was half and half what the hell does that mean bottom but no top or vice versa sort of she had outerwear but no underwear she had on one of those shirtdresses i think thats what you call them and she was wearing a coat but no bra and no panties i dont know if its significant or not i mean isnt it kind of a fad these days for some girls i mean women to go out without underwear you got me jack said i havent the faintest idea regardless were obligated to use a rape kit to cover all bases i think i was born too early lou said with a laugh has this floater been ided no in that way its similar to yesterdays how about yesterdays have you identified the victim no and i put some serious time in on it yesterday i cant figure it out the guy was wearing a wedding ring and was well dressed i dont understand why the family hasnt called in in such a case missing persons ordinarily solves the mystery in twentyfour hours or less my only thought is that maybe hes a foreigner now with todays case who i suspect is single i will be less surprised if it takes a few days unless the woman has a roommate or the kind of employment where a supervisor or a coworker will call the police how old approximately young late teens early twenties does she look like a hooker how can you tell these days the way the kids dress the only thing unique is some limegreen highlights in her hair lime green jack questioned with disbelief as i said its unique does she have the same depressions in her legs like she was chained possibly to a weight like yesterdays she does which is why ive tried to keep that fact quiet if there is to be more of these gangland executions i want them to keep bobbing up i want the perps to continue making the same mistake what do you expect out of the autopsy hey i dont know lou said throwing his hands into the air youre the magician i wish that were the case i do want the slug if its again a remington highvelocity hollow point like i believe yesterdays was well at least have to consider the same gun was used for both cases was the body found where the other one was not really but not that far away either the way the current and tides move around out there its anybodys guess where flotsam will end up all right lets do it jack said he got to his feet and collected his crutches then hobbled over to riva is the new floater file handy he asked her and can i do the case riva was happy to hand over the case file and jack used it to swat vinnies newspaper lets go big guy jack said as he dropped the case file into vinnies lap lets lend a hand to the halls of justice vinnie groused as was his habit but to his credit he put away the paper and got to his feet well need a rape kit jack added vinnie nodded and headed toward communications on his way down to the autopsy room jack looked over rivas shoulder at the stack of cases she was reviewing looks like a busy day even busier than yesterday riva said hey ill meet you downstairs lou called over to jack jack waved for him to go ahead have any corkers jack asked he tried to rifle through several of rivas carefully organized case files but she smacked the back of his hand with the ruler she kept handy for that very purpose ouch jack said as he grabbed his hand and rubbed it pretending hed been truly hurt theres a couple in here which i think will be a challenge riva said that sounds good jack said how many can i expect at least three riva said ive got two people whove requested paper days so the rest of us will have to pick up the slack paper days were days that medical examiners did not do autopsies but rather concentrated on getting all the information needed to finish their pending cases and finalize the death certificates jack im afraid you have to look at this laurie said shed gone through the mrsa case that riva had given her jack rolled his eyes it wasnt difficult for him to guess that laurie was about to mount one more effort to get him to change his mind this case is a repeat of david jeffriess laurie began she also had been operated on at an angels healthcare hospital only to suffer a fulminant mrsa infection for which she was shipped off to the university hospital in hope of saving her thank the good lord it wasnt at the orthopedic hospital jack said jack be serious laurie complained this is the second astoundingly fulminant staph infection in as many days you must rethink your decision the vast majority of mrsa infections dont kill their victims and surely not within hours of the initial symptoms these are very unusual in all regards why cant you see this i do see it it is a mystery and im supportive of your efforts to figure it out as for me ive put myself in dr wendell andersons very capable hands if hes confident im confident if you can come up with something specific why i am specifically at risk ill consider it more seriously but otherwise my mind is made up ive even been tested for mrsa and i dont have it dr anderson has not had a case in short im going to have my surgery tomorrow and thats it jack stopped and took several breaths hed worked himself up during his monologue he and laurie locked eyes for a beat then he said now im going down and do my first case okay laurie nodded the melancholy shed experienced on awakening drifted back she felt tears bubble up from somewhere behind her eyes but she fought them off okay she said with a slightly hesitant voice ill see you in the pit ill see you in the pit jack echoed and walked from the room riva and laurie stared at each other with laurie wanting support and riva wanting to give it the trouble with men riva pontificated is that they are men and they dont think like we do the irony is that they accuse us of emotionalism whereas they are equally capable hed made an emotional decision to have the surgery and at this point hes incapable of rationality laurie smiled in spite of herself thank you she said i needed that interesting that he did offer you an out riva said and i can be the witness he said if you could come up with something that could specifically put him at risk hed be amenable to hear it of course he didnt offer to change his mind but he might what you need to do is find out the how and the why of these infections i know it is a tall order in less than twentyfour hours but from your past record if anybody could do it you can laurie nodded agreement not the part about her being the most capable of the challenge but rather the idea of her possibly changing jacks mind by her solving the apparent mystery suddenly laurie stood up and headed out of the room her melancholy had been overwhelmed by a surge of adrenaline she was committed to the puzzle no matter how unlikely the success and undaunted by the seemingly impossible time constraint im afraid i will have to assign you a few other cases riva called after her laurie waved to indicate shed heard do you want the case files now or later riva yelled laurie stopped and hurried back to riva they should be both interesting and quick riva said while handing over the two envelopes both are young seemingly healthy people in their early thirties so the posts will be quick and you can get back to your mrsa mystery whats the presumed cause of death there isnt any one died at the dentists office after getting injected with a local anesthetic i know it sounds like a drug reaction but there were no symptoms of anaphylaxis the other collapsed at a health club while riding a stationary bike im here a voice called out the day can now officially begin both laurie and riva looked up as chet bounded into the room he swirled his jacket over his head like a lariat and let it fly into one of the vinyl club chairs where is everyone he asked looking confused hed expected to see jack jack and vinnie are already downstairs laurie said youre even more chipper than yesterday and almost on time two days in a row what gives dont tell me you scored a dinner date with your new woman friend chet stood up straight flashed a boy scout signal with his raised right hand and clicked his heels scouts never lie i did indeed and im happy to report she was more intriguing and beautiful than i had remembered i actually enjoyed talking with her listen to this riva we are witnessing the possible stirring of maturity in this heretofore juvenile he was content merely to learn about another human female being now i wouldnt go that far chet said i was still plotting to get her back to my apartment or me over to hers but she cut me off with just dinner darn laurie said snapping her fingers in sham disappointment i have to thank you for your advice laurie im sure the date wouldnt have happened had it not been for your encouragement and advice youre very welcome laurie said she turned to riva thanks for these cases theyre perfect laurie started once again to leave she took me completely by surprise chet continued forcing laurie to hold up shes a doctor shes boarded in internal medicine on top of that shes ceo of what has to be a multimilliondollar company that builds and runs specialty hospitals i mean she is one impressive lady laurie experienced an unpleasant visceral contraction accompanied by a sensation akin to dizziness which resolved as quickly as it had appeared she cleared her throat before asking is her name by any chance angela dawson it is chet exclaimed do you know her vaguely laurie said with surprise i have met her and unfortunately i have to say i wasnt as impressed as you are why not im afraid i dont have time to explain now but let me just say that i sensed her priorities as a businesswoman were trumping those of a physician laurie knew chet would undoubtedly have more questions but she had to move on despite his protests she excused herself walking quickly through communications where notification of all the deaths of the city were received she began to plan her day with as little time as she had before jack went under the knife she would need to be efficient the first stop was the forensic investigators office janice jaeger had done the site visit on the new mrsa case and laurie wanted to question her more than once laurie had learned something important from janices wealth of experience that had not gotten into the report forensic investigators were tasked to include only facts not impressions laurie found janice finishing up after a long night she was the sole pa officially working from eleven to seven but rarely left before eight she was aided if need be by forensic pathology residents who rotated night call if even more backup was needed or the case was particularly challenging one of the medical examiners was also available did i miss something janice asked as laurie came up to her desk laurie got along famously with all the pas but particularly with janice who appreciated lauries recognition of her work more than any of the mes laurie was constantly coming to her and asking questions and valuing her opinion im about to do ramona torres laurie said i gathered from your note you made a site visit to the university hospital i did indeed did you sense anything about the case that you thought was interesting or unique but not appropriate for your report janice smiled laurie was always asking her probing questions i did actually janice said i got the feeling the doctors were upset that they werent getting the angels healthcare septic patients soon enough to make a difference concerning survival did you make a visit to the angels healthcare cosmetic surgery and eye hospital no i did not janice said not in this case do you think i should have i cant say laurie admitted but you have visited angels healthcare hospitals in conjunction with other mrsa cases absolutely janice said on a number of occasions ive read several of your reports whats your general feeling about the hospitals and these recurrent mrsa cases janice smiled again do you want the truth of course i wouldnt be asking if i didnt i dont know how to explain it but i feel like something strange is going on i mean its nothing i can write in my report but they keep having these infections and yet keep doing the surgery whenever i ask any type of question in this regard they say that they are doing everything they possibly can meanwhile people are dying ive had the same response laurie admitted thanks for your opinion is cheryl around shes out on a call bart arnold is around do you want to speak with him bart arnold was the chief of forensic investigation and ran the department no just leave a message that i need the hospital record for ramona torres they can email it to me like they did with the others not a problem laurie rushed all the way to the front elevators to save time not only were they faster there were more of them she bounded into her office laid the three case files on her desk and hung up her coat snatching up the phone she called down to the mortuary office and asked for marvin when she got him on the line she asked him if he would work with her again that day she said she wanted to be expeditious he agreed with his usual cheerful readiness laurie gave him ramona torress accession number said she wanted to do her first and then rang off she looked at the clock one of the first things she wanted to do that day was call the cdc but fearing they might not be functioning as early as it was she turned her attention to reviewing the days autopsy cases that required rereading the case file of ramona torres after doing so she felt confident the post would be similar to david jeffriess putting that one aside she picked up the first of the two suddendeath cases and pulled out the pas report the patients name was alexandra zuben age twentynine she had visited the dentist for a root canal and had received the local anesthesia as riva had described at the very outset of the procedure the patient suddenly had fallen unconscious after she had been placed in a headdown position shed revived and insisted the procedure continue a few minutes later the same situation had developed although on this occasion she did not revive had been called and the patient had been rushed to the hospital where she was found to have an arrhythmia a markedly elevated blood pressure and little or no respiratory efforts shed been put on a ventilator but despite aggressive therapy she had progressed to a cardiac arrest that could not be reversed the emergencyroom diagnosis had been recorded as respiratory failure compounded with cardiac failure secondary to severe allergic reaction and anaphylaxis to novocain the pas concluded with the fact that a family member had said that the patient was remarkably healthy but had had on occasion several syncopal attacks involving palpitations flushing and heavy perspiration laurie slipped the pas report back into its folder her initial impression was that the emergencyroom diagnosis was in error and she had a reasonable idea of what she would find on the autopsy of particular note she was reasonably certain she would not need any special equipment for the post next laurie took out the pas report on her third case it was very short it merely said that ronald carpentu had been on a semirecumbent stationary bike which he used most every day and had suddenly collapsed immediate cpr had been given by the health clubs personnel but without success had been called and the cpr was continued en route to the emergency room on arrival the patient was declared dead with the diagnosis of a severe heart attack laurie replaced the pas report on this third case she was quite certain the emergencyroom diagnosis would prove to be correct but there was still the question of why laurie guessed atheromatous heart disease again she would not need any specialized equipment picking up the phone she called down to the autopsy room it rang six times causing laurie to drum her fingers on her desk while she waited she thought about the weird coincidence of her giving chet advice about dating angela dawson of all people hello a voice said sounding more like yellow laurie asked for marvin and after only a few seconds he came on the line are we ready laurie asked weve been ready for hours marvin joked less than five minutes later laurie was suited up and staring down at ramonas corpse as with david jeffries an endotracheal tube and a number of intravenous lines were still in place but the most striking thing was the extensive bruising over much of her body from the liposuction you are motivated today marvin said in a reference to how quickly laurie had gotten down to the basement level changed into her barrier protective gear and come into the autopsy room besides her case there was only one other under way and that was the floater laurie hadnt even stopped to see how it was going i want to be as efficient as i can laurie admitted i promise i wont leave you high and dry like i did yesterday i apologize again i got sidetracked and lost all idea of the time no sweat marvin said seemingly embarrassed that laurie felt she needed to apologize laurie palpated ramonas skin and looked at it closely it had a spongy feel and there were multiple tiny abscesses such that laurie felt that had she lived she would probably have sloughed off a large part of her epidermis after taking a number of photographs laurie began the case she worked quickly and silently when marvin asked questions she answered as if preoccupied and he soon stopped since they worked together so often there was little need to talk as with david jeffries the most notable pathological finding besides the extensive cellulitis was in the lungs both were fluidfilled and contained innumerable small abscesses that would have coalesced into larger and larger ones had the patient lived as with jeffries the necrosis was substantial when the final suture had been placed closing the autopsy incision laurie stepped back from the table she glanced around the room now all eight tables were being utilized looking over near the door she could see that jack lou and vinnie were still involved with the floater that was one of the fastest autopsies ive seen marvin commented as he began to clean up how soon can you have the next case laurie asked fifteen minutes or so marvin said do you have a preference as to which one of the two should be next it doesnt matter laurie said i wouldnt fault you if you dont believe me but im going upstairs to make one phone call and then ill be back marvin smiled laurie stopped briefly at jacks table and jokingly asked why he was taking so long jack was known to be one of the fastest prosectors because these two windbags talk like a couple of old ladies vinnie said disgustingly were being thorough jack said even before the micro and the lab contribute we know this young woman was raped rather brutally which raises the question lou said was it a rape followed by a homicide or was it a homicide and an incidental rape unfortunately the autopsy is not going to provide us with an answer to that question jack said laurie excused herself and exited via the washroom to ditch her gloves and tyvek disposable suit her face mask she wiped clean with alcohol and left it in her locker intent on not keeping marvin waiting she dashed upstairs back in her office laurie dialed dr silvia salerno at the cdc as the call went through she wedged the phone between her head and shoulder to free her hands shuffling through the case files on her desk she located chets case julia francova she opened it up with the hopes of being able to add the subtyping of the patients mrsa when the phone wasnt answered immediately laurie looked at the time it was now going on nine and she was certain the cdc had to be open for business come on come on laurie urged answer the damn phone just when she thought about checking to see if the cdc had a paging system the line was picked up it was silvia and she was mildly out of breath she immediately apologized saying she had been in a neighboring office i hope im not bothering you laurie said i know you said youd be calling me but the sooner i have some information the better dont be silly silvia said you certainly arent bothering me and i was planning on calling this morning i did check on those two mrsa cases of dr mehtas they are the same organism and i can say that with definite certainty because we are adding these strains to the national library of mrsa we go out of our way to characterize them and we do this with multiple genetic methods such as highthroughput amplified fragmentlength polymorphism analysis i could send you a list of the other methods we use thank you but i dont believe that will be necessary laurie said she had no idea what silvia was talking about but i do have another case which had been sent to you people a number of weeks ago for typing specifically it was sent to a dr percy dr percy is a colleague what was the referring doctors name dr chet mcgovern hes a colleague of mine here at the ocme what was the patients name laurie spelled out the name to avoid any confusion hang on for a minute laurie could hear the familiar sound of silvias keyboard making her wonder how anything got done before digital computers yes here it is silvia said interesting its also camrsa usa four hundred mwtwo sccmeciv pvl exactly like the two previous cases is it from the same institution its from one of the same institutions laurie said remember the first two were from two separate hospitals yes i remember concerning the two cases at the same institution are they close to each other in time maybe even the same date laurie turned to her unfinished matrix but she did have the data from mehtas case from the angels cosmetic surgery and eye hospital the patients name was diane lucente and like ramona shed had liposuction laurie checked the date of dianes death and chets case no laurie said they occurred almost three weeks apart how odd silvia said i guess you know how genetically versatile staphylococcus is im on a rather steep learning curve laurie admitted but i was informed of that yesterday i find that the exact subtype being separated by institution and time quite amazing all three must have been in contact with the same carrier did you have this specific subtype in your collection before dr mehta sent you the isolate yes we did as i told you last time it is one of the most virulent subtypes weve seen for all sorts of test animals as well as humans do you send out cultures of these organisms we do we support any number of researchers willing to work with these organisms have you ever sent this particular organism to new york city i dont know offhand but i can find out id appreciate it laurie said the nagging concern of the bacteria being spread purposefully resurfaced in lauries brain yet the old arguments against such an idea resurfaced as well each essentially canceling the other i have asked around the center if anyone was aware of the cluster of mrsa cases you are investigating but no had heard about it is that odd or not laurie asked no its up to the individual institutions if they want to contact us for assistance theres no mandatory reporting to us but there probably is to the state or city authorities did you get the other isolates i had our microbiology department overnight to you yes i did they are in the works i shall have some results in two to three days four tops laurie thanked the woman for her help and rang off for a moment she sat at her desk and went over the conversation she had to admit that the call had deepened the mystery not solved it suddenly remembering the time she leaped up from her desk and dashed for the elevator she was afraid she had once again kept marvin waiting despite her promise not to do so carlo followed brennan out of the electronics store on lexington avenue in manhattan brennan had purchased a gps tracking device from a company that specialized in marine as well as terrestrial applications once outside they found that it had started to sprinkle so they ran for the black gmc denali im glad to see it started to rain carlo said as he revved the engine before pulling out into the traffic how come brennan asked absorbed in slitting the cellophane wrapping of the box containing the tracking device he loved electronic contrivances and had had a ball picking out the item hed spent such a long time discussing with the salesman the pluses and minuses of the array of tracking devices the store carried that carlo had become totally bored because therell be less chance of people hanging around the marina i dont want anyone seeing us hiding the thing on the boat you know what im saying brennan didnt answer instead he was easing the tracking device out of the boxs foam interior hey carlo demanded he didnt like to be ignored are you listening to me sort of brennan admitted he looked into the depths of the molded foam packing material im talking about the rain and the marina i asked you if you agreed it was to our advantage it was raining brennan at last found what he was looking for it was a packet containing an operating directions booklet but more important an online registration code well carlo questioned with irritation brennan next used his penknife on the packaging for the device itself but before he could free it from its cellophane mummification his head snapped forward from an openhanded blow from carlo what the hell brennan yelled he turned and glared at carlo what did you hit me for he growled i was talking to you carlo yelled back you were ignoring me i dont like to be ignored it pisses me off brennan stared at carlo he was in a momentary rage luckily he controlled himself since carlo was behind the wheel and they were hurtling down lexington avenue in a clot of traffic carlo might have been bigger and older but he sure as hell wasnt wiser in fact he was somewhat of a lunkhead and it was that realization that enabled brennan to calm down a degree dont hit me ever again brennan voiced slowly emphasizing each syllable then dont ignore me when im talking to you carlo snapped back brennan rolled his eyes shook his head and went back to the operating instructions he was pretty sure how the tracking device worked but he wanted to read up on registering it for the realtime online services im sorry i hit you carlo said after a few blocks being ignored is a pet peeve of mine sorry to hear that brennan said they drove in silence for a while to brennans relief he finished reading how to register the device and then skimmed over the operating directions armed with all that information he got his laptop from the rear seat and his cell phone from his jacket pocket once the laptop was booted up he called the company not only did he want to register he wanted to make sure that if the device was lost it could not be traced back to him apparently it was not an unusual request because the service individual was able to oblige with ease how long will it take to be online brennan asked since i just got an okay on your credit card im doing it as we speak brennan thanked the man next he opened the back of the device and inserted the four triplea copper tops hed bought as well going back to the companys website he clicked on the position icon then added the password and user name hed just gotten with another click he got an hourglass and a few seconds later a query appeared asking him to select the size of the area he wanted to display brennan clicked miles by miles a second later there was a small blinking dot moving slowly along lexington avenue turning the laptop screen in carlos direction he said it works it shows us heading south impressive carlo said how does it work it would take too long to explain brennan said but in essence its simple triangulation using satellite signals thats enough carlo said his lack of knowledge of current electronic devices made him feel inadequate as usual the traffic was bad going across town and the rain as light as it was made it worse the driving was stopandgo the whole way carlos cell phone startled both of them with a bit of a struggle carlo got it out and checked the caller id satisfied he accepted the call put it on speakerphone and nestled the phone into a cubby on the center console whats up carlo questioned nothing arthur macewan said in his highpitched shrill voice that drove everybody nuts absolutely nothing weve been here for over two hours and franco pontis hog of a car hasnt moved an inch arthur macewan and ted polowski were parked in the back of johnnys parking lot and had been there staking out francos car since before eight that morning have you seen the hawk nope no sign of franco we did see vinnie dominick when he arrived with freddie capuso and richie herns theyve been inside the neapolitan and have yet to reappear how about scarface havent seen angelo either were getting tired of sitting here and im wondering if its a good idea what if they spot us youve got a point but you heard louie this morning he went nuts about them knocking off that girl last night after the hit the night before franco and angelo are probably sleeping off their shenanigans he wants them followed because hes trying to figure out whats going on and if they do it again hes going to let that detective know its a lucia problem and has nothing to do with the vaccarros holy shit arthur said suddenly then he lowered his voice a blue van pulled up a second ago that says sonnys plumbing supply and angelo just got out and theres franco too theyre going into the neapolitan at least you found them carlo said now keep track of them and concerning your worry about being spotted make sure you eat a sandwich or something to justify sitting there okay arthur said without much enthusiasm once carlo and brennan got into the tunnel the traffic lightened up considerably they made good time to the marina in hoboken although there were a number of cars in the parking lot thanks to the rain that had continued there was no one on the pier carlo parked close to the waters edge and a good distance from the marinas sole building where all the other cars were wasting no time they stepped from the car and hustled out the pier they stopped at the stern of full speed ahead ill watch while you find a place to hide the device carlo said he looked back toward the building not a soul had appeared brennan crossed the gangplank and immediately began to search for an appropriate cranny he found one at the very stern under some attached bait containers with his hand he inserted the tracking device as far back into the nook as he could there was even a hidden lip that would keep the device from sliding out a few moments later he was back on the pier and the two men started back to the car did you see anyone brennan asked not a soul howd you make out i found a perfect spot back in the car brennan brought his laptop out of sleep mode and went through the process of logging on again when it was appropriate he clicked the position icon as hed done earlier and then the scale within seconds there was a stylized representation of the area even including the pier where full speed ahead was moored a blinking red dot was exactly where it was supposed to be brennan moved the laptop into carlos lap pretty nifty wouldnt you say brennan offered carlo nodded he was impressed but also intimidated by brennans expertise im not surprised we didnt get her this morning franco said snatching this medical examiner lady is not going to be easy the area around the medical examiners office is a busy place with bellevue on one side and nyu medical center on the other side the problem was the damn protest angelo butted in if it hadnt been for all those hispanics carrying on we would have had an opportunity hell she and her boyfriend who was on crutches walked in front of our van youre making it sound too easy franco said first of all there was an suv in front of us second of all there were two of them and only two of us what are you thinking theres no way we could muscle the two of them into the van without causing a major scene i say we should just shoot her from a distance and walk away no angelo blurted i want to snatch her thats the only way to be sure the job gets done and i want to make sure paul yang and amy lucas were both a piece of cake franco said they were unsuspecting and easy to lure but this montgomery chick is in a totally different ballpark theres no way we are going to be able to talk her into getting into the van peacefully and that assumes we can even get her by herself with her boyfriend on crutches shell be helping him i say we shoot her and be done with it as a medical examiner im sure theres a dozen people who wouldnt mind seeing her put away whats the plan vinnie asked angelo in his most serene tone for those who knew him it was a sign that he was majorleague perturbed franco angelo freddie and richie were all sitting in one of the neapolitan booths talking with vinnie dominick espresso cups overflowing ashtrays and a platter of cannoli cluttered the tabletop i agree with franco its a challenge angelo said unfortunately she moved out of her digs on nineteenth street which would have otherwise made it a breeze we may be forced to find out where she lives but for now i think we should continue to try at the medical examiners office francos also right about needing more bodies especially if we have to deal with the boyfriend something i wouldnt mind doing and we need another van why another van vinnie questioned for backup if the snatch goes bad we have an alternate getaway vehicle vinnie nodded while staring at angelo everyone stayed quiet while vinnie ruminated i want to be sure about this too vinnie said finally in the past it seems as if she has had nine lives and with two hospitals right in the same area a shot would have to be damn good it would be just our luck if we got her good and they saved her snatch her and get rid of her once and for all as far as another van goes weve got more than we need are you going back to the ocme at lunchtime we cant wait around for a week for this to go down you know what im saying we are aware angelo said he was relieved vinnie didnt jump at the easy way out the more angelo thought about it the more intent he was on a slow demise for dr laurie montgomery are you okay with this vinnie asked franco it has its merits franco said grudgingly but im worried about one thing whats that in all due respect angelo is a bit too juiced up over this job this morning after we left the stakeout we had to stop at home depot for a big bucket and a couple of bags of quickset i get nervous when theres this degree of emotion i mean hes thinking about this purely as payback not a job when emotions are involved like this mistakes happen people dont think right a wry smile appeared on vinnies face as he turned to angelo clearly he did not disapprove of angelos vengeful plans at the same time vinnie knew franco was right so you want laurie montgomery to stew for a while before you drop her in the drink something like that angelo admitted what about francos point about mistakes can be made if emotions are involved and youre too eager ill keep it in mind and tone myself down vinnie switched his attention to franco satisfied he questioned franco nodded if he listens to me vinnie nodded as well and looked back at angelo you two are a team talk to each other dont take chances be cool angelo nodded okay vinnie said its decided freddie and richie get another van keep in touch with each other and keep me informed right the men said in unison as they slipped out of the booth after the men had left vinnie had paolo salvato make him yet another espresso as vinnie sat in the silent empty restaurant he thought of angelos plans for laurie montgomery it was perfect and he fantasized about being there himself after all the troubles shed caused him hed wanted to whack her when hed been released from prison but he hadnt because lou soldano had specifically warned him that if something were to happen to laurie hed personally come after vinnie suspecting the worst but now ten years later vinnie was confident that enough time had elapsed april am laurie hurried out of the autopsy room after completing her final postmortem for the day she was anxious about the time since the final two cases had taken longer than shed expected and she was desperate to get back to the mrsa mystery she was also anxious about not knowing what else to do shed put a lot of stock in what she thought she might learn from the cdc and although she sensed it was important to have learned that the three cases that had been extensively subtyped were all the exact same bacterium she didnt quite know what to make of it shed also hoped that silvia a recognized mrsa expert would have come up with some ideas and suggestions but she hadnt as laurie removed her tyvek coverall she stopped for a minute and looked at her hands they were shaking as if shed had twenty cups of coffee preoccupied as to what she should do next laurie ducked into the locker room to change back into her clothes are you just finishing now riva asked as laurie appeared im afraid so laurie said spinning the combination lock on her locker i thought id assigned you cases that would have been quick sorry maybe i should have been able to do them quicker but i felt the medical condition should be carefully documented both can be teaching cases really why the first one the death at the dentists office turned out to be preventable which is why it would be a good teaching case particularly for primarycare and emergencycare physicians the patient was reported by a family member to have had syncopal attacks involving palpitations flushing and diaphoresis but it was never investigated hyperthyroidism riva said you are exactly right laurie said it was not an allergic reaction as was suspected the thyroid gland and the thymus gland were both diffusely enlarged as were the heart and the spleen that was why her blood pressure was so high in the emergency room what about the second case riva asked the stationary bike rider that was also interesting i thought i was going to find atheromatous coronary heart disease but i didnt that was what i suspected as well im glad i put it in the pile to be autopsied everything was normal with the heart and the coronary arteries really riva questioned with surprise except for one thing laurie said the right coronary artery had an exceptionally acute angle takeoff suddenly something the patient had unfortunately done while riding the bike cut off flow to the artery ive heard of that but have never seen it riva said which is why i thought it too would be a good teaching case i carefully dissected the area free and will have it preserved in contrast to riva who was taking a break between cases laurie had continued changing from scrubs to her clothes during the conversation when she was finished she slammed her locker closed spun the combination lock and waved to her office mate ill see you upstairs riva called after her not willing to take the time for lunch laurie went to the front elevator and rode directly up to the fifth floor before retreating to her office she went into the histology lab to see if her pulmonary slides were available on david jeffries she had little hope they would add anything significant at this point she felt obliged to get the slides since shed specifically asked maureen oconnor to put a rush on them you are eager maureen said in her colorful irish accent when she caught sight of laurie when i said id have them today i didnt say id have them this morning i hate to be a pest laurie said ill be in my office ill have someone run them down when theyre ready laurie hastened down the hall after sitting at her desk she surveyed the jumble of case files and hospital records with the matrix front and center she picked up the matrix it was far from complete glancing back to the pile of cases she felt a drain on her enthusiasm and optimism transferring the information took longer than she expected yet it seemed as if the matrix was the only hope she had of understanding what was going on with the angels healthcare hospitals as laurie was about to start she remembered she did not have ramonas hospital record as well as a few others picking up her phone she called down to the pas office when bart arnold the chief pa answered she asked to speak with cheryl what can i do for you cheryl asked when she came on the line i left word with janice earlier this morning i needed a hospital chart on ramona torres i got the message and put in the call they promised me theyd send it with the others id be surprised if it wasnt already in your email hang on laurie said quickly she opened her email as cheryl suggested the missing hospital records were there waiting for her sorry laurie said youre right they are all here after hanging up with cheryl laurie put the large file in the printing queue and then headed down to the first floor to pick up her printouts adam had had a pleasant morning after his second cup of coffee that morning back at the hotel hed made his way to the metropolitan museum as one of the first people through its imposing front entrance hed felt as though he had the place to himself he didnt try to cover too much but viewed objects hed appreciated in his youth including athenian red figure vases several classical greek statues and the old masters exhibits when noon approached adam had decided to return to the ocme for a short stay and had parked in the same location hed parked that morning as hed told himself earlier that morning he thought the chances of seeing the target over the lunch hour were slim but he now came prepared on the seat beside him he had a rolledup towel from the hotel pierre in the form of a cone and held in place with clear tape inside the cone was one of his favorite weapons a ninemillimeter beretta fitted with a threeinchlong suppressor the suppressors tip could just be seen at the pointed end of the cone in the open end he could insert his hand and seize the automatic pistols handgrip in this fashion he could use the weapon in public without causing a panic which it invariably did when it wasnt so camouflaged of course even with the towel the amount of time the weapon was out from under his coat was kept to an absolute minimum of only a few seconds with his seat tilted back his elbows on the armrests and his hands on his stomach and fingers intertwined adam had made himself snugly comfortable especially with arthur rubinstein playing chopin at a moderate volume on the vehicles cd player the light rain outside added to his tense contentment in contrast to that morning relative calm prevailed at the corner of first avenue and th street except for the traffic with its incessant thundering medley of city buses dump trucks paneled vans taxis and private cars heading north the protesters were gone as were the police and there was minimal pedestrian traffic particularly in and out of the oddly designed ocme shielded from the hum of the traffic by his vehicles impressive soundproofing as well as the cd player adam calmly went through a number of possible scenarios in case laurie montgomery fooled him and suddenly appeared preferably alone of course he would immediately step from the car with his borrowed hotel pierre towel and close the gap between himself and miss montgomery at that point he could not predict what would happen as it would depend on what had transpired between the time hed left the car and the time he got within striking distance of approximately arms length the variables included passersby particularly if anyone showed any interest in his activities whatsoever if all was copacetic the towel would come out and hed fire from three feet into the back of the head he would then calmly return to the range rover and motor away driving directly to the lincoln tunnel he had his belongings in the car and his handlers would take care of mr bramfords hotel charges at least thats how it had happened on most of adams previous operations in the middle of his musings adam who was continually aware of what was transpiring in his surroundings noticed in his rearview mirror that the occupants of the blue van that had pulled up behind him were arguing to beat the band what had caught his attention besides their mouths going a mile a minute was that each was rudely stabbing a finger at the other interspersed with angry waves of dismissal since violent arguments were not common in public and because of his line of work adam was always sensitive to unexpected behavior as he watched the driver made what looked like the final wave of dismissal before opening his door as the driver tried to climb out the companion attempted to stop him by grabbing his arm but it was to no avail the driver easily shook himself free and alighted from the vehicle the passenger responded by following suit and leaping out of the van as well adam had watched this simulated silent movie in his rearview mirror but suddenly he was aware that the driver had come alongside the range rover adam turned and stared at him adam did not like to be approached while on a mission it made the possibility of recognition after the fact much more possible adam noticed two things about the man first his extensive scarring from burns and his careful attention to his clothes which seemed out of place in relation to the condition of the van adams first thought was that the man was an iraq veteran like himself adam had seen many people with similar burns during his long rehab the driver then shocked adam by rapping noisily against the range rovers window there were two choices either open the window or just drive away just driving away was the most rational since the hit was now off even if laurie were to come out but as curious as adam was especially if the man was an iraq veteran he opened the window theres no parking here mister angelo snapped vehemently the vans passenger had joined the driver he seemed equally angry not at adam but at the driver he even ordered the driver back to the van but the driver would have none of it did you hear me angelo demanded talking to adam franco threw up his hands in disgust and returned to the van are you an iraq vet adam asked after the totality of the experience in that nightmarish country and the long process of rehabilitation because of his leg adam felt a unique and immediate bonding with anyone whod suffered similarly what kind of question is that you asshole angelo hissed i thought because of your burns you might have served adam said controlling himself against taking offense from the mans rudeness are you making fun of me angelo snarled quite the contrary i thought you and i had something in common angelo gave a short derisive laugh listen fruitcake i love your music but i want you to move this trash heap of yours out of here its a noparking area im not parking at the moment im standing okay wise guy angelo growled out of the vehicle adam stared at the grotesque man ordering him out of the car in such a confrontation adam had several advantages first he truly didnt care what happened to himself and in many ways wished hed died with his buddies and second his martial arts training had been so intense he reacted by pure reflex once again adam debated the wise thing for everyone including the nattily dressed apparent hoodlum and his companion was for him to drive away but the problem was that adam had allowed himself to get angry and it fused with all the anger he was actively suppressing adam opened the door and slowly got out every muscle in his body was tensed ready to uncoil angelo stepped back although the blond stranger was more heavily built angelo felt he had the trump card he was as usual packing his walther and he slipped his hand under the lapel of his jacket and grasped the gun he wasnt going to shoot the man he was just going to pistolwhip him once to get him the hell away from the area the nanosecond that adam saw the direction of angelos hand movement he sprang forward with lightning speed sending a flurry of karate chops that took angelo by complete and total surprise the first hit his right forearm producing an electriclike numbness to angelos hand causing him to drop his weapon onto the pavement the second and third landed on angelos head and the side of his neck causing him to stumble backward but remain on his feet the final blow was a kick to the chest that hurled him down to the wet pavement with equal speed adam snatched up angelos gun and quickly glanced through the vans windshield at the companion luckily franco didnt move and for a beat he and adam locked eyes adam was concerned he too might be armed adam broke off backed up and quickly climbed back into the range rover he started the engine and then tossed angelos gun out into first avenue where it was repeatedly run over he then pulled from the curb and accelerated down first avenue holy shit arthur macewan cried did you see that i never saw anybody move so quickly ted polowski said it was unbelievable and look at angelo hes having trouble getting up there goes franco hes got the gun arthur and ted had followed angelo and franco into manhattan and when the two had pulled up behind the silver range rover and parked arthur and ted had gone around the block and pulled over to the curb at a hydrant on th street from there they had a good view of the blue van and they settled in for what they thought might be a long wait but it turned out not to be the case almost immediately a white van pulled up behind the blue one and ted who knew most of the lucia people recognized richie herns as the driver and then it was only a few minutes later that angelo had bounded out of his vehicle to confront the guy in the range rover still shaking his head over what he had just witnessed arthur called carlo who along with brennan was having lunch with the boss louie youll never believe what we just saw he said excitedly he then went on to describe the shellacking angelo had just suffered from a guy in a range rover who angelo had tried to pick a fight with you would not believe how fast this guy was arthur continued excitedly angelo didnt stand a chance angelo even pulled a gun but the guy knocked it out of his hand then threw it out into the street im telling you it was unbelievable where are you were across the street from the city morgue in manhattan city morgue carlo questioned why the hell the city morgue we dont have the foggiest idea why did angelo pick a fight no clue about that either is angelo okay i think so hes walking a little strange but hes getting into the blue van just now hang on carlo said let me tell louie about this arthur could hear carlo relate the story and louies bewildered reaction carlo came back on the line louie wants to know if you recognized the guy no arthur said but his range rover had the name of a business called biedersomething heaven any phone number or address we couldnt see from where we were the lettering was too small but there was several more lines of print do you know if franco is there as well oh yeah hes here he tried to stop angelo from bothering the guy and after the scuffle he went out and got angelos gun from the middle of the street oh one other thing theres a second van too parked just behind angelo and francos whoa angelos started the blue van im going to have to sign off here nope false alarm angelo just pulled up a car length to be on the corner and richies pulling up behind him theres someone else in richies van but we dont know who it is should one of us walk over there and check it out no absolutely not they dont expect anyone to be watching and we dont want them to have any reason to believe so hold on again let me tell louie the rest of this weird story once again arthur could hear carlo relate the details but he couldnt hear louies responses carlo came back on the line louie said youre doing a good job he wants you to stay with them later this afternoon brennan and i will come over and relieve you sounds good arthur said carlo put his phone back in his jacket pocket and looked across at louie louie stared back his fleshy face was scrunched together his brow deeply knitted it was obvious he was deep in thought carlo and brennan knew enough to stay silent and eat their pasta finally louie broke the silence and took the napkin away from his neck where hed poked it under his collar i dont understand any of this but what i do understand is that its got to stop they are acting weird to say the least knocking people off and brawling in broad daylight on a manhattan street and whats this about the city morgue carlo and brennan knew louie well enough not to respond until louie directly asked them a question louie had always had a propensity to think out loud as louie heaved his considerable bulk out of the chair and began to pace carlo and brennan exchanged a glance wondering what was coming louie wandered over to the bar continuing his dialogue after mindlessly playing with a shot glass full of toothpicks for several minutes he came back to the table you guys are sure there was no company at the trump tower that you recognized when you stopped there this morning carlo and brennan both shook their heads get a phone book louie ordered brennan dutifully brennan left his seat to bring a phone book to the table try to look up biedersomething heaven louie ordered when brennan returned louie looked at carlo if they keep up this irresponsible behavior were going to have the entire nypd out here on our backs sooner or later what do you think carlo nodded since he was asked a specific question he said they are taking big chances so it must be important business thats exactly what i was thinking i mean that detective came all the way out here to warn us nothing in the phone book brennan reported i didnt think there would be louie said not with a guy who could handle angelo facciolo so easily the names undoubtedly a cover do you think they could have been waiting at the city morgue for the same thing brennan asked risking putting in his own two cents i mean why would angelo pick a fight with someone in broad daylight unless there was competition or some sort of existing bad feelings good thought louie said im glad were watching them id like to know whats going on but if they knock off someone else im going to let that detective know were not involved after the adrenaline rush evoked by angelo it took adam a while to calm down but by the time he arrived at the hotel he was composed enough to think clearly about the unfortunate and totally unexpected incident although nothing untoward had happened it still could if someone had observed the altercation and had called the police with a description of adams range rover consequently adam was disappointed in himself for not having driven off immediately he certainly did not get any secondary gain from the useless confrontation in fact quite the contrary will you be needing your car soon mr bramford the doorman said opening adams driversside door no thank you adam said as he alighted he specifically wanted the car put into the garage adam went up to his room he needed to make a call and did not want to use his cell he wanted a landline one of the fallouts of his onesided fight was a reluctance to return to the ocme area for fear of again running into the smartly dressed thug seated at a desk in the changing room of his junior suite adam placed his call the protocol was for him to ask for a fictitious individual by the name of charles palmer and then be given another number to call once he had the second number hed leave his directdial number at that point he had to wait the return call usually came within a minute there was no small talk when adam spoke to one of his handlers im in need of a home address he said without reference even to a name adam didnt have to question if the information could or could not be obtained with his handlers access to the highest levels of government it was always available we will have it in a few minutes youll have it on your blackberry that was it adam pressed the disconnect button on the phone and then called room service he thought hed have lunch before heading over to his secondfavorite attraction in new york city the natural history museum how was i to know hed be a karate expert angelo snapped back thats not the point franco said the point is you didnt think and when you dont think you make mistakes luckily nothing drastic happened thats easy for you to say i feel like i got run over by a truck my chest hurts and so does the side of my neck consider your bruises as a warning to keep your cool ive never seen you like this angelo youre just too damn eager as i said to vinnie youre juiced up something awful youd be juiced up if the broad had burned your face such that you look like a freak you said that i didnt what did you do with my gun its here under my seat franco said he took out the scratched handgun and handed it to angelo angelo looked it over carefully he removed the clip made sure there was no bullet in the chamber then pulled the trigger several times the mechanism worked smoothly it seems okay it might be a good idea to fire it a couple of times to be sure angelo nodded as he pushed the clip back into the base of the butt you havent answered the question i asked you earlier franco said are you going to be able to control yourself otherwise im going to send you home for a few days mark my word ill take care of montgomery myself yeah angelo said irritably ill control myself maybe i shouldnt have gotten out of the van but at least i got rid of the suv which was blocking our view at too great a risk i might add i mean you understand that dont you i do now i suppose from now on i want everything done my way until we get her on the boat then i dont care what you do apparently vinnie likes your cement shoes idea thats fine i couldnt care less if you and vinnie want some payback beyond just whacking her but i dont want any more reckless behavior are we on the same page here or what yeah were on the same page angelo said look at me angelo reluctantly glanced over at franco say it again were on the same fucking page angelo repeated irritably good franco said we got that cleared up now lets go get some lunch montgomerys not being cooperative well have to come back and try to get her when she leaves tonight april pm hello excuse me a voice called laurie looked up from her work one of the histology technicians was standing in the doorway clutching a cardboard tray for microscope slides maureen asked me to run these down the woman said she also asked me to apologize for not getting them to you sooner two people called in sick today no problem laurie said she reached over and took the tray thanks for bringing them and thank maureen for getting them to me so quickly will do the woman said amiably clutching the tray laurie looked back at her cluttered desk working nonstop she had filled in only approximately twothirds of her matrix although the process as painstaking as it was was speeding up since she had become accustomed to where in the hospital records shed find the specific information she wanted shed also added more categories as shed gone on which forced her to go back to cases she thought shed finished one thing was certain with as many categories as she now had constructing the matrix was significantly more work than shed originally imagined although laurie enjoyed a certain compulsive contentment about her progress it had to contend with a growing disappointment that her efforts were probably not going to provide any insight into the mystery as she worked shed hoped that shed see some unexpected commonality but it wasnt happening if a few cases were in the same or the next one would be in a different or if several patients were on the same floor the next one would be on a different floor and so on and so forth yet she had persisted and would continue to do so since it was all she had relishing a break from what was essentially tedious data entry laurie cleared a space on her desk for her microscope turning on the lamp she slipped the first slide of david jeffriess lung section into the stage clip rotated the revolving nosepiece to the lowest objective and lowered the objective close to but not touching the slide putting her eyes to the eyepiece she used the coarse adjustment knobs to pull the objective back up from the slide until she got an image reflexively her hand went to the fineadjustment knob and brought the image into sharp focus laurie was again awed by the degree of damage wrought by the bacteria many of which she could see as disclike clusters in the microscopes twodimensional field the normal alveolar structure of the lung was being dissolved by the bacterias flesheating toxins such that abscesses of varying sizes were being formed as she moved around with the help of the mechanical stage she could see capillary walls in various stages of sepsis causing hemorrhages into the septic soup that filled the lungs the amount of destruction of the lungs normal architecture reminded her of images of a city following a carpet bombing or a trailer park directly ravaged by a category five hurricane for more than an hour laurie went through the tray of slides one by one using a higherpower lens laurie was even more impressed with the bacterias pathogenicity focusing in on fibrous tissue responsible for maintaining the lungs normal structural architecture she could see that the tissue was coming apart like the skin of an onion covalent bonds were being broken and collagen itself was dissolving into its constituent molecules hey sweetie jack said as he quietly breezed in he was becoming progressively adept on his crutches hows your day going laurie looked up her face paler than usual whats up jack questioned his smile waned you look terrible laurie took in a deep breath and let it out the tissue destruction she had been viewing had had a visceral effect on her the fact that it had occurred within hours in a previously healthy person couldnt help but underline how fragile human beings ultimately were the idea of enjoying any sort of health seemed a miracle jack put his hand on her shoulder really are you okay laurie nodded and took another breath she tapped the barrel of her microscope i think you ought to take a look at this keep in mind it was a normal healthy person just a few hours earlier laurie pushed herself back from the desk to give jack room jack put his crutches aside and leaned down toward the eyepiece but about halfway he hesitated then regained full height wait a second he said suspiciously is this a setup am i being slyly seduced into looking at a slide of your mrsa case from yesterday remind me never to try to slip something by you laurie said with a wan smile her blood pressure had quickly risen back to normal returning color to her face and clearing the accompanying queasiness she admitted it was a section of lung from david jeffries jack looked into the microscope and moving the mechanical stage he took a quick tour of the section wow he said its totally destroyed i see hardly any normal architecture does it change your mind about elective surgery where you might find yourself dealing with such a pathogen laurie jack scolded okay laurie said pretending to be nonchalant i just thought id ask how were your cases today you seemed to have been engrossed more than usual they were fine particularly from a teaching perspective such that they took longer than i hoped i wanted to get up here asap and work on my matrix she patted the legal pad its the only thing left that i have that has a snowballs chance in hell to convince you that you are specifically at risk for being exposed to mrsa during your scheduled surgery and jack asked looking at laurie askance i havent found anything yet she admitted before looking at her watch but i still have about fifteen hours ye gods and you call me bullheaded you are bullheaded im merely persistent and of course i have the added benefit of being right jack waved laurie away and gathered his crutches im heading to my office to clean things up since ill be gone for a few days he emphasized the few days how were your cases today dont ask riva promised some good ones instead she gave me two natural deaths and an accidental one none of which were at all challenging lous case was more interesting the slugs caliber and the indentations from an apparent chain to keep her sunk suggested the same killer the difference was she was raped tragic another testament to the inherent wickedness of man im glad you said man now get out of here i only have fifteen hours what time do you want to leave this evening actually we should take separate cabs unless you want to stay late i want to finish this matrix ill come back here when im done in case you change your mind i dont want to hang around because i want to watch my buddies play basketball to remind me why im willing to go under the knife on that issue laurie had to hold her tongue instead she said is chet still in your office or has he left for the day i wouldnt know i stopped in here first well if he is you should try to dampen his enthusiasm for his new lady friend oh how come by coincidence shes the ceo of the company that has built the three angels specialty hospitals really jack said raising his eyebrows that is a coincidence why dampen his enthusiasm shes the one who all but ordered me out of the orthopedic hospital yesterday i dont know about longterm but right now i question her motivation not to worry jack said im sure chet will have eyes for someone else tonight a week from now he wont even remember her name i hope so for his sake with jack out of her office laurie went back to the microscope although she had made an effort to appear upbeat with jack she was again feeling despondent shed joked about the fifteen hours but in reality it was far too little time to solve a mystery that had been confounding people with phds in epidemiology suddenly lauries hand stopped twirling the horizontal mechanical stage control shed seen something unusual zip past the microscopes field since she was viewing at highpower objects moved very quickly in and out of the field with very little rotation of the control she slowly reversed direction with the control and the strange object came into view laurie was entranced it appeared to be in the middle of what had been a bronchiole probably close to what had been an alveolus or the terminal sac in the bronchial tree where oxygen entered the blood and carbon dioxide came out laurie immediately questioned whether it had been there originally or was an artifact inadvertently introduced or formed during the slides preparation it was about the size of the white cells laurie had seen which were the bodys defensive cells but there was no nucleus it had absorbed almost none of the standard stain used by histology most remarkable it was a nearly round disk symmetrical with a scalloped border giving it a stellate appearance why she thought the symmetry was important was that most artifacts shed seen didnt have such symmetry laurie looked at the object itself the scalloped border comprised about onefifth the diameter the center of the object was opaque with the mere hint of either nodularity or being mottled one minute shed see it the next minute she wouldnt she wished the object had taken the stain because if it had she would have known if what she was seeing was real or something she was conjuring up trying to keep her excitement in check laurie took out a grease pencil to mark the glass slide so that if the scopes mechanical stage were to accidentally move she could find the object again she did this by placing four dots in the cardinal directions satisfied laurie then shifted to low power when she looked in again the object was significantly smaller and because it lacked staining it tended to blend in to the chaotic surroundings switching back to high power she made sure the object whatever it was was still in the field with that ascertained she quickly went down to get jack when jack looked at the object he said my gosh how did one of my grandmothers butter cookies get into david jeffriess lung be serious laurie said what do you think it is im not fooling it looks just like it came from one of my grandmothers cookie cutters we called it a star but obviously it has far too many rounded points do you think it is an artifact that would be my first guess but it is surprisingly symmetrical i suppose thats due to the dynamic tension between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic forces at the interface of the menisci what the hell is that how should i know jack said still looking at the microscopic object im just running off at the mouth speaking pseudoscientific gibberish laurie swatted jacks shoulder playfully here i thought you knew what you were talking about jack looked up sorry i have no idea what it is i dont even know if it is real or artifact nor do i laurie admitted have you found any others or is this it so far thats it now that i found it though im eager to see if there are more do you have any idea what it could be i know what i think it looks like but it cant be come on run it by me it looks like a diatom do you remember those from biology i cant say that i do you must theyre a type of algae or phytoplankton with silicate cell walls give me a break jack said now how do you remember that theyre so beautiful kinda like snowflakes i did sketches of them in highschool biology well congratulations on your discovery but if youre interested in my vote id say id lean toward artifact rather than a pelagic diatom unless the university gave him a glass of antarctic sea water as part of his terminal treatment very funny laurie said sarcastically artifact or not im going to look for more good luck say im about to head out do you want to change your mind and come along thank you but no thank you im going to look at these slides for a while then finish my matrix dont wait up for me i know youre going to bed early good grief laurie youre beating a dead horse maybe so but im not sure im going to sleep that much tonight one way or the other jack bent down to give laurie a hug but she stood up and gave him a real one see you later jack said affectionately touching the end of lauries nose with his index finger whats that for laurie asked reflexively backing away jack shrugged beats me i just wanted to touch you because i guess jack paused acting suddenly selfconscious i guess i think you are terrific get out of here you oaf laurie said nudging him jacks clumsy sentiment threatened to break down lauries carefully constructed defenses in truth her own emotions were barely under the surface on the one hand she wanted to support him through his surgery as she assumed he could use as everyone could but on the other hand she didnt want to lose him and was furious that he was putting her in such a conflicted state gathering up his crutches and giving laurie a final smile jack left laurie stood for a moment looking at the stacks representing her twentyfive mrsa cases quickly leaning out into the hall she called down to jack remember to use that antibiotic soap tonight its on my list jack yelled back without turning around laurie ducked back into her office she stood for a moment recognizing that one of the struggles with having a real relationship with another was to allow the person to be themselves and make some decisions independently with hopefully enlightened selfinterest what it boiled down to from lauries perspective and the question of whether to have the surgery or not was a good example was that a real lover had to recognize that there were two centers of the universe pushing what she feared was sophomoric philosophizing out of her mind laurie sat back down at her desk her eyes flicked back and forth between her microscope and her matrix both beckoned although she thought the matrix the most promising in the long haul the diatomlike apparent artifact was the most seductive leaning forward laurie put her face to the eyepiece what she wanted to do was scan the entire slide methodically to see if there were any more of the diatomlike objects angelo pulled to a stop at the same location he and franco had been when theyd left their stakeout earlier they were at the curb on first avenue where it crossed th street the ocme was just off to the right traffic was rushhour heavy angelo put the van in park and used the emergency brake no range rover he said making a stab at justifying his behavior at noontime dont even go there franco said making himself comfortable hed gotten a coffee and a hero at johnnys as had angelo here come richie and freddie angelo said looking in the rearview mirror and watching the white van pull up within a foot behind them franco didnt answer he was intent on surveying the area to make sure there were no apparent problems such as parked police cars or loitering flatfoot patrolmen angelo took a swig from his coffee then unwrapped his sub when he was finished he glanced out the windshield and started the boyfriend angelo called out loud enough to make franco slosh a dollop of coffee into his crotch angelo blindly reached for the small castiron bottle of ethylene and a plastic bag shit franco yelled straightening his back to lift his butt off the seat angelo ditched the ethylene onto the floor and reached behind his seat for a roll of paper towels without taking his eyes off the ocmes front door franco used a few towels to blot up the coffee from his seat and a few more to wipe his pants only then did he look out the windshield wheres montgomery i dont know angelo said dejectedly jesus this woman is such a pain in the ass where the hell is she they watched as jack stood with his arm raised and crutches tucked into his armpits he had advanced out into the street as far as he dared with the traffic zooming past him this is probably better franco said without the boyfriend interfering the snatch will be far easier youre probably right angelo said i just hope she didnt leave early relax franco countered dont be such a pessimist would you like some more tea the waiter asked adam shook his head he was sitting in the pierres oval hightea room jutting off the main corridor leading to the hotels fifth avenue entrance when hed been a preteen it had been his favorite room in the hotel with its whimsical murals and more important with its afternoon selection of cookies and crumpets as he turned the page of the arts section of the times he felt his blackberry vibrate taking the mobile device out he saw that he had an email using the appropriate buttons he opened it it was short and simple west th after signing the check to his room adam went up to gather his things he was encouraged the timing seemed to be impeccable ten minutes later he was climbing back into the range rover sensing that the mission would soon be over he changed the selection on the cd changer from bach back to beethoven laurie leaned way back in her chair and it squeaked in protest with the tips of her fingers she rubbed her eyes shed been so intent on staring into the microscopes eyepiece that shed seemingly failed to blink as often as she should have her eyes had a gritty feeling but the massage was rapidly therapeutic and after only five seconds of rubbing followed by a series of rapid blinks she was fine although laurie still had no idea whatsoever what the scalloped discshaped object was shed found two more on the slide and since all three were mirror images of each other she felt they could not be artifacts introduced when the slides had been prepared they were definite objects that had been in david jeffriess lung at the time of his death lauries excitement soared she even allowed herself to fantasize that shed discovered a new infectious agent that in conjunction with staph made for an exceptionally lethal combination at that point she dashed down to histology and confronted maureen who was about to lock up for the night after pleading her cause laurie convinced the woman to locate filed pulmonary slides on a handful of the former mrsa cases after thanking her effusively laurie dashed back to her office to her delight she found more of the diatomlike objects and she noticed that the amounts differed from case to case with some cases having none they were extremely rare and consistently unstained which excused her colleagues from having not seen them it was at that point that the matrix had provided its first payoff although the matrix had not been completed it had provided a seeming corroboration of the pathogenicity of the discs the shorter the period between the onset of the individual patients symptoms and the time of death the more diatomlike objects laurie found although this discovery hadnt been akin to fulfilling kochs postulate confirming a microorganism as the source of a particular disease laurie felt encouraged very encouraged with her eyes feeling as though they were back to normal laurie grabbed her rolodex obviously she had to try to identify the scalloped microscopic objects a few years earlier jack had had a similar situation about a liver cyst and hed taken the slide over to the nyu medical center and had it looked at by a giant in the field of pathology dr peter malovar despite being in his nineties and a professor emeritus he still maintained an office and a reputation of maintaining his encyclopedic mind the mans life was his work especially since his wife had died twenty years earlier with a shaking hand laurie punched the numbers of malovars extension into her phone hoping that the rumors of the long hours the aged pathologist maintained were correct she kept her fingers crossed as the phone rang once then twice and to her delight was picked up at the commencement of the third ring dr malovars voice had a slight but pleasing english accent a grandfatherlike calmness and a surprising clarity for a nonagenarian laurie told her story in a rapid monologue tripping over her words at times in her haste when she finished there was a pause for a second shed feared that shed been cut off well this is an unexpected treat dr malovar said happily offhand i have no idea what this diatomlike object is but i would love to see it it sounds perfectly intriguing would there be any chance of my bringing it over now laurie questioned i would be delighted dr malovar insisted its not too late i mean i dont want to keep you nonsense dr montgomery im here until ten or eleven every evening im at your disposal thank you ill be over shortly is it difficult to find your office laurie was given explicit instructions before she hung up she got her coat and hurried out to the elevator as she boarded her stomach growled as a visceral reminder that shed skipped lunch with dr malovar having assured her he was not about to leave she pressed the secondfloor button there wasnt much choice in the lunchrooms vending machines but she trusted she could find something of caloric value if nothing else the lunchroom was a favorite hangout for the support staff especially during meal hours and that evening was no exception it was just after seven and half of the threetoeleven shift were present with its stark concrete walls the sound level in the room was almost painful for laurie in contrast to her offices silence as she stood in front of one of the vending machines anxiously trying to decide which selection was the least bad for her she heard her name over the din turning she saw the smiling faces of jeff cooper and pete molimo they were the evening shift health and hospital corporation van drivers who went out to fetch the bodies as with most of the rest of the staff laurie had become friendly with them over the years laurie and jack in contrast to their colleagues were more apt to visit scenes during the evening and night hours because they both felt such visits were exceedingly helpful the men were enjoying a break in their routine they had finished their meals as evidenced by the debris on their table except for rushhour auto accidents calls of deaths during mealtime were relatively rare and didnt pick up again until after nine both had their feet up on the opposing empty chairs at their fourtop table havent seen you much dr montgomery jeff said yeah whereve you been hiding pete added laurie smiled either in my office or in the pit youre a little late for going home arent you pete asked most of the other mes are out of here before five ive been working on a special project laurie said in fact im not even going home now im heading over to nyu medical center how are you getting over there i dont know what its doing now but it was sprinkling an hour or so ago im walking laurie said its too short for a cab ride why dont i run you over pete offered were just sitting here and im tired of talking to this diehard boston fan what if you get a call laurie asked whats the difference i got a radio it took laurie two seconds to make up her mind are you ready to go now you bet pete said gathering up his trash in a lot of ways it was ludicrous to ride because the medical center entrance was on the same block as the ocme and when they backed out of the morgues receiving dock onto th street it was not raining in fact there was a patch of pale bluegreen sky off to the west and moving closer this is rather silly laurie said as pete almost immediately turned into the curved driveway at the medical centers entrance several hundred feet down first avenue he managed to get up to only about twenty miles per hour im sorry to trouble you no trouble at all pete assured her i was glad to get away from jeff the bum hes so sure the sox are going to beat the yankees that he wont shut up about it laurie hopped out of the van thanked pete and used the microscope slide box she was carrying to wave as she hurried through the revolving door the center was crowded with visitors but laurie quickly left them behind on her way to the academic portion of the institution using the elevator she rose to the sixth floor as she exited she noticed that the corridor was as silent as the one outside her own office most all doors were closed and she didnt pass a single person she found the renowned doctor in a small windowless interior space that could have been a storeroom but which the aged man had decorated with all his diplomas rewards and honors all protected in simple glazed black frames a very large freestanding bookcase filled with all his favorite pathology tomes some with tooled leather bindings dominated one wall most of the rest of the room was filled by a large mahogany desk piled high with reprints and legal pads covered with erratic cursive he stood up and extended a hand as laurie entered she was surprised how much he looked like einstein with a cumulus of white hair his back was kyphotic as if he were anatomically built to look into a microscope i see you have brought the slides he said eagerly eyeing lauries slide box in anticipation of her arrival hed positioned his impressive microscope on a customized shelf that pulled out of the end of the desk it was a teaching scope with doublebinocular eyepieces an impressive digital camera was mounted on top and shared the same view as the eyepieces should we he continued motioning for laurie to take the seat positioned on her side of the scope laurie sat she could see out of the corner of her eye how zealously he watched as she opened her tray and carefully extracted one of the slides marked with grease pencil respecting that the microscope was his she handed him the slide eagerly he placed it onto the mechanical stage and lined up the greasepencil markings after hed lowered the lowpower objective he told her to use the mechanical stage control to find the object of interest having become quite proficient at locating the objects despite their lack of staining laurie quickly located one i dont know if you can quite see it but its under the pointer now i think i see it dr malovar said he backed up the objective changed to higher power then refocused ah yes he said as if experiencing visceral pleasure most interesting are they all similar they are laurie said strikingly so such symmetry such an elegant border have you observed them on end no i havent laurie admitted so i dont know if it is discshaped or spherical id say discshaped have you noted the slight nodularity i have but i didnt know if it was real its real all right fascinating as is the degree of necrosis of the lung tissue laurie was dying for him to tell her what it was and questioned why he was teasing her by withholding the information it is quite apparent they are in the bronchioles and not within the alveolar walls i felt the same way laurie admitted i can see why you said they looked like diatoms but i wouldnt have thought of it myself laurie was becoming impatient finally she just asked what is it i have no idea dr malovar said laurie was stunned particularly from the appreciative way he was describing the object she thought for sure he knew what it was the very instant hed seen it shock turned into dismay when she realized she could not charge home to jack with new decisive information it also made her consider that maybe some of her colleagues had seen them but dismissed them as being unimportant do you think that they had anything to do with the fulminant mrsa infections these people had i have no idea do you have any idea of how we might identify them for that i do have an idea id like to look at them under the scanning electron microscope especially after slicing one open is that a lengthy procedure can we do it tonight dr malovar leaned back and laughed your eagerness is commendable no we cannot do it tonight theres some skill involved we do have a talented person but of course he is gone for the night i can see if he can at least start tomorrow how about a microbiologist laurie suggested should i show it to a microbiologist you could but im not optimistic ive had a bit of microbiology myself he pointed to a phd diploma in microbiology laurie was crestfallen but i believe i do know who will be able to identify it at a glance lauries eyes brightened her emotional roller coaster was taking her up once again who she asked eagerly our own dr collin wiley my sense is that what we are seeing is a parasite and dr wiley is department head of parasitology can we get him to look at it tonight do you think he a still here he is not here in fact dr wiley is in new zealand for a parasitology meeting good lord laurie murmured the roller coaster was on its way down again she visibly sagged in her seat dont look so forlorn my dear dr malovar said leaning to the side to gaze directly at laurie with his glacial blue eyes we live in the information age i will simply take a few highdefinition digital photos tonight and email them to dr wiley along with a description of the case i know for a fact he has his laptop with him since it has his lectures power points could you give me your email address laurie rummaged in her bag for one of her me business cards she handed it over perfect dr malovar said putting it on the corner of his desk when do you suppose i might get an answer thats totally up to dr wiley and remember hes halfway around the world after discussing with dr malovar the process of getting a sample of david jeffriess lung to him perhaps even the paraffin block used by histology laurie left the pathologists office as she rode down in the empty elevator she made a decision although she was eager to finish her matrix she decided to forgo it for the time being and go home she thought there was a significant chance maybe not huge but at least possible that the discovery of the unknown objects might be enough in and of itself to make jack see the risk issue her way down at the hospital entrance she was able to catch a taxi with relative ease as soon as adam had turned onto th street he had sensed his thoughts about the imminent end to the mission were probably unduly optimistic instead of being a quiet side street it had been alive with all sorts of people and children enjoying the improving weather driving by laurie montgomerys house had added to his feeling because directly across the street was a sizable and popular playground with an impressive array of mercury vapor lights capable of turning the entire area into day but what had totally convinced him was when hed stopped for a few moments to survey the area hed spotted montgomerys injured spouse or boyfriend on the sidelines of an active neighborhood basketball game with more than fifty people either playing or watching seeing the man standing there leaning on his crutches strongly suggested to adam that laurie was probably already home as well but adam had not been discouraged quite the contrary he still thought the area a far better location than in front of the ocme for the hit it just meant hed have to wait for morning when she would appear at her door on her way to work and either walk east to catch a cab on central park west or walk west and snag one on columbus avenue either way hed have his opportunity to take her out and considering laurie had arrived at work that morning at sevenfifteen he estimated that shed left the house around sixfortyfive with that decided adam had vowed to be parked in front of montgomerys house by sixfifteen at the latest the following day good evening mr bramford the doorman said when adam climbed from the range rover back at the pierre will you be needing your vehicle again this evening no but id like it to be available at six am sharp will that be a problem no problem whatsoever mr bramford it will be waiting for you after collecting his things particularly his tennis case adam hurried into the pierre he wanted to see if it wasnt too late for the concierge to get him a symphony ticket or a ticket for whatever else was happening that evening at lincoln center to bet angelos attention about the hour franco made a production of looking at his watch by sticking out his left arm full length pulling back his jacket sleeve rebending his elbow and rotating his wrist next to him angelo was staring straight ahead out through the windshield at the darkened scene had his eyes not been open with an occasional blink franco would have thought he was asleep the vehicular traffic racing past them on first avenue had slowed to a mere trickle had it not been for the streetlights it would have been pitch dark the sun had long since set and no moon had arisen to take its place its not going to happen franco said at length at least not tonight we cant sit here all night the bitch angelo murmured i know its frustrating its as if she were taunting us i guess she went home early just before we got here or maybe shes working late either way i think we should go the troops behind us are getting antsy i want to stay another fifteen minutes angelo thats what you said a halfhour ago its time to move on well come back tomorrow morning youll get your revenge soon enough ten minutes no were going now i wanted to leave a halfhour ago ive already extended our sitting here longer than i feel comfortable with i dont want someone noticing us and getting suspicious start the van and signal the guys in back angelo got the engine going and then turned the headlights on and off a few times all right were out of here reluctantly angelo pulled away from the curb he drove slowly so that when they came abreast of the ocme he could look through the front door into the buildings interior the place looks dead franco said how appropriate as they drove up first avenue angelo broke the silence maybe well have to check out the boyfriends apartment if we cant get her here at the ocme thats on the bottom of the list franco blurted with a shake of his head he and angelo had visited jacks apartment ten years earlier with disastrous results those neighborhood gang friends of his are a menace to society and they are always on alert for other gangs were going to stick with what we got i mean its not like weve been sitting here for a week you know what im saying angelo nodded but he wasnt happy he felt like a kid promised a present but being forced to wait as laurie climbed out of the taxi in front of her house she looked over at the lighted basketball court it seemed like a particularly crowded evening which always made the competition that much more fierce as evidence laurie could hear that the cries of accomplishment and derision were more strident than usual standing on her tiptoes laurie scanned the spectators for jack as much as he enjoyed the game she wouldnt have been surprised if she saw him but she didnt a few minutes later she found him soaking in the bathtub youre early he said with as much work as you looked like you had with your matrix i didnt expect to see you until after ten at the earliest did you finish already no i did not finish laurie admitted as she stripped off her coat and tossed it out into the hallway she shut the bathroom door to keep in the steamy heat after putting down the toilet seat cover she sat and locked eyes with jack im soaking in antibiotic soap jack said averting his gaze lauries serious expression and the fact that she was willing to sit in the steamy bathroom gave him the uncomfortable feeling that she was in one of her talking moods and considering the timing there was only one subject i thought youd like to know how responsible im being he added i didnt finish my matrix because i found more of those diatomlike objects really jack said without a lot of enthusiasm really laurie repeated she then went on to describe how shed first found more in david jeffriess slides and then found them in most of the cases whose slides she was able to get were they in all cases whose slides you had jack asked despite knowing where the discussion was going jack found himself interested hed convinced himself that the object hed seen was an artifact of some sort not all but most and most interesting is that i discovered with the help of my unseen matrix that the shorter the interval from the onset of symptoms until death the greater the number of these particles were so you just randomly counted the number on each slide exactly well thats hardly scientific i know laurie admitted its just suggestive but it was consistent and therefore very supportive jack ran a soapy hand through his hair this is all very interesting but im not sure how to interpret it i mean neither one of us knows what it is i didnt leave it at that i called up dr malovar whom you had praised so highly about your liver cyst how is he hes a trip isnt he i admire the guy i hope im still around at his age much less still contributing hes fine but dont you want to know what he said of course what was his diagnosis he said he didnt know jack gave a short laugh of amazement he didnt know at all im shocked he said he thought it was a parasite thats more like it then did you get dr wiley to look at it dr wiley unfortunately is in new zealand at a parasitology conference well then i guess well have to wait because wiley in his field is like malovar in his dr malovar sent a digital photo so im certain well hear when dr wiley gets it of course theres no accounting of when that may be im afraid not okay laurie jack said sitting up whats your real point here is this another attempt at getting me to cancel my surgery if it is out with it of course it is laurie said with some heat how could it not be ive found an unknown parasite associated with a rapidly fatal postoperative course what seems to be happening is a synergism with mrsa which i have agreed is in every hospital but this unknown parasite is apparently in only three hospitals one of which you are scheduled to enter and allow yourself to become a potential victim laurie let me remind you that im going to have my operation with a surgeon who has not had one case of whatever this is and hes been operating nonstop at the angels ortho hospital well thats not entirely true he had to stop when they closed the ors to fumigate them but since then hes been back with a full schedule day in day out with no problems whatsoever secondly i do not have a parasitic disease maybe thats the basis of this outbreak these people have visited the backwaters of the amazon and picked up this parasite unbeknownst to anyone hey i commend your work and certainly keep at it if it turns out that this unknown parasite is infectious and youve discovered some new illness all the power to you hell you might even win a nobel prize laurie stood up abruptly dont patronize me im not patronizing you jack contended im just trying to fend off your negativity and prepare myself for this operation tomorrow you know how i feel about it what id really like is some support on your side not fearmongering laurie felt a rush of emotion dominated for the moment by frustrated anger yanking open the bathroom door and slamming it behind her she stalked down the hall to the darkened living room where she threw herself onto the couch to brood jack had touched the sore spot of her ambivalence carlo nosed his denali into one of the few parking places along the front of the strip mall what that meant at ninethirty on a wednesday night was that the venetian was doing a brisk business both carlo and brennan alighted the weather had completely cleared up despite the garish light coming from a neon gondola on the roof two stars could be faintly seen in the sky brennan stretched with a few noisy grunts and groans as they walked down the sidewalk toward the restaurants entrance and passed the open dvd rental store in the process brennans whole body was stiff after sitting in the suv since five oclock inside they had to search the crowd for louie carlo finally found him at a fourtop table near the bar wait here he said to brennan and struck off weaving in and out among the tables carlo thought it ironic that the restaurant was doing as well as it was considering it was in reality a cover for the vaccarro familys real work carlo attributed it to louies influence louie loved good food and red wine as was suggested by his bodys profile when louie caught sight of carlo he excused himself from his buddies heaved himself to his feet and took carlo off to the side despite the crowd it was easy to talk thanks to the assemblage of blackvelvet paintings that crowded every wall and the acoustic ceiling tiles whats up louie asked youre early they closed up shop carlo explained all four of them went back to the neapolitan parked the vans and went inside we waited a good hour and a half and when none of them reappeared we came here to let you know what was up im listening well nothing actually from the moment arthur and ted hooked up with angelo and franco midmorning theyve been staking out the medical examiners office except for the onesided scuffle between angelo and some unknown guy nothings happened theyve just sat in their vans and us in my denali any idea why they sat in two vans no idea whatsoever none of this makes sense louie complained its one hell of an effort on their part but why carlo shrugged he had no idea either despite the fact that he and brennan spent part of the afternoon batting around ideas yet because it doesnt make sense my intuition tells me its important louie said and then paused for a minute i want you guys to keep up the surveillance thats for certain i want to know where angelo and franco are and what they are doing and have arthur and ted start early like at six i think the reason they didnt hook up with them until the middle of the morning was they went out too late ill tell them anything else what about the tracking device we got it and weve got it on the boat how it works youll have to ask brennan i dont care how it works i just want to know when the boat goes out and where it goes so tell brennan to stay on top of it april am trying not to wake jack laurie rolled over and looked at the clock shed been awake for almost an hour and she was now convinced that more sleep was not an option she didnt know if it was depression frustration or dread or a mixture of all three but she couldnt stay in bed a moment longer her mind was constantly going over the same issues with the same results being as quiet as she could she slipped from under the covers gathered up the clothes she had set out for the day by feel since the only light came from the clock face and slowly inched toward the open bathroom door once she was in the bathroom she leaned back into the bedroom to listen to the sound of jacks breathing it hadnt changed which pleased her waking up as early as she had and wanting something to occupy her overly busy mind laurie had suddenly thought of heading into work early she thought she could at least finish her matrix and whether it would have any effect on jacks thinking was not the point as the discussion the previous evening had proved he was not about to be deterred and besides it was clearly too late his surgery was only four hours and fifteen minutes away laurie showered quickly and put on her usual small amount of makeup as she did so she thought about the evening before it had gone badly at first with both of them irritated at the other but that had soon changed and once again theyd agreed to disagree although laurie said she didnt want to have anything to do with the operation itself such as going with him to the hospital in the morning she promised shed be there in the afternoon to support him one hundred percent in his rehabilitation he had been warned by dr anderson that his mobility postsurgery would be restricted because he would be waking up with a device that would be constantly flexing and extending his knee and that he would be attached to it for at least twentyfour hours laurie dressed quickly while she had a quick bite to eat in the kitchen she wrote a note for jack telling him shed gone to work early and why and asked him to have dr anderson call her at the ocme when the procedure was done she signed the note by telling him she loved him and that shed see him around noon unsure of where to put the note to be certain he saw it laurie took some tape from the kitchen and returned to the bathroom using the door from the hall they had designed the bathroom with two doors one from the bedroom and one from the hall for exactly this kind of situation when one of them was up before the other with a piece of tape she adhered the note to the center of the mirror such that there was no way he could argue hed not seen it getting her coat key the tray of slides and her bag laurie opened the hallway door and was about to close it behind her when she remembered her cell phone was charging at her bedside table for a moment she debated whether she wanted to risk waking jack believing jack should get as much sleep as possible and that she would not need her cell since she would be spending the first half of the day at her ocme desk and the second half in jacks hospital room she decided to forgo its convenience outside it was still dark with only a hint of dawn in the eastern sky and the street was completely deserted in both directions thinking it would have been wiser to have called a radio cab laurie hesitated on the front stoop but not wanting to take the time now that she was already down she ran toward columbus avenue in her experience it was a lot easier getting a taxi there than on central park west and she was proved to be correct as one pulled to the curb the moment she extended her hand as the cab zipped downtown in the nearly empty streets laurie admitted to herself that april was not going to be a day she would ever want to relive the level of general anxiety she was experiencing was as high as shed ever felt evidenced by the abdominal distress shed suffered after eating her skimpy breakfast which was now being made worse by the jolting and rocking of the taxi at one point she sensed she was about to vomit but it passed it was with definite relief that the taxi finally reached the ocme laurie directed the driver to the side of the building and down the ramp to the receiving dock still queasy laurie quickly paid the fare and climbed out she waited a halfminute or so to let a mild wave of dizziness dissipate then mounted the stairs to the receiving dock as she passed down the hall she said hello to the night security man in his cubbyhole office surprised to see her mr novak jumped up from his desk poked his head out and called down to laurie whod already reached the back elevator good morning dr montgomery he called what brings you in so early just a little extra work she lied she waved as she boarded laurie stopped again on the second floor as she had the evening before she bought herself a cup of vendor coffee strangely coffee tended to calm her stomach at least it had in the past laurie turned on her office light and after hanging up her coat she surveyed her cluttered desk her microscope still occupied center stage the piles of case files and hospital records looked daunting her matrix was balanced on the top of one of them after putting her scope to the side along with the trays of slides laurie sat down she moved the matrix in front of her before beginning she opened the lid of the coffee and took a tentative sip a grimace followed by reflex it wasnt because it was too hot which was what she feared but because it tasted horrid if she hadnt known she wouldnt have even suspected it was coffee with the lid replaced she put it aside intending to go down to the id room when she thought vinnie would have the communal coffee made laurie then took the next case file and hospital record and set to work not quite an hour later the phone rang as much as shed been concentrating combined with the nearabsolute silence of the deserted fifth floor the phones oldstyle raucous jangle totally startled her she answered it in a panic before shed even had a chance to guess who it might be it was jack what time did you leave he asked im not sure it was threefifteen when i got up why didnt you wake me i missed you when i awoke a few minutes ago i wanted you to get as much sleep as you could are you exhausted ive been exhausted for days luckily i didnt have any trouble getting to sleep im glad we talked again last night jack said even if i wasnt when we began im glad too well i had better jump into the shower with my antibiotic soap im supposed to be over there at sixfifteen and its already twenty after five i forgot to ask how long does this patella tendon graft take dr anderson told me a little more than an hour im impressed thats fast he does them so often hes got it down to a science ill see you around noon laurie said i love you i love you too laurie closed she heard the click it sounded so final slowly she replaced the receiver what was the day going to bring she asked herself uneasily she wished shed hung up first because she kept hearing the metaphoric disturbing finality of the click over and over in the depths of her brain shaking off any morbid thoughts engendered by the phone laurie went back to her matrix taking yet another case file and its accompanying hospital record from the slowly dwindling stack to keep from thinking about anything other than the busywork of data entry laurie kept at her task compulsively as if it were a lifeordeath necessity close to seven she had only two more to go when riva arrived what on earth are you doing here so early i couldnt sleep laurie said i thought i might as well work riva looked over her shoulder at lauries nearly complete matrix very impressive have you learned anything earthshattering hardly laurie said she thought for a moment about telling riva about the unknown and possibly infectious agent shed found microscopically but then changed her mind riva would undoubtedly want to see it and laurie was intent on finishing her matrix are you still planning on a paper day today riva questioned absolutely laurie said i want to finish what im doing and then go over to see jack hes having his surgery today oh thats right riva said id forgotten i dont have jack to schedule either id better get down there and see whats come in overnight by seventwentyfive laurie had finally made the last entry she held the matrix up it was quite extensive with every known variable she had been able to conjure up to compare the cases quickly she scanned the document looking for gross unexpected commonalities among the twentyfive cases that might suggest the how and the why the patients had gotten infected but nothing seemed to jump out until she looked back at the column for date of surgery having always had a facility with mathematics and numbers in general there seemed to be a pattern believing it was only some sort of coincidence laurie got out her daily calendar and translated the dates of her series into days of the week to her surprise there was a pattern in that all the eye or cosmetic cases were on tuesday the heart cases were on wednesday or friday and the orthopedic cases were on monday or thursday with her knowledge of statistics laurie immediately knew that twentyfive cases were not nearly enough to give any credence whatsoever to her finding yet she found it curious returning to the matrix and slowing down she let her eyes pause at each entry in each of the categories such as age duration of the procedure type of anesthesia et cetera but still nothing significant caught her attention coming to the end of the matrix laurie switched her gaze to the wall clock it was seventhirty exactly and jacks surgery was starting laurie could visualize the scalpel cut through the skin and she winced at the thought looking back at her matrix she felt sorry she had finished filling it in the process itself had been effective in keeping her mind from thinking about what she preferred not to think about suddenly laurie thought of something else she could do to avoid obsessing over what was happening to jack she thought of dr collin wylie in new zealand and the possibility that hed gotten the photomicrograph and the possibility hed had an opportunity to look at it and if he had whether hed been able to recognize it and respond there were a lot of ifs but undeterred laurie went to her email the main reason shed not thought about doing so earlier was because the outgoing email had been sent during the night and shed forgotten to factor in that new zealand was on the opposite side of the world meaning in auckland it had been morning the moment after shed clicked the appropriate icon and her email opened she saw it cwylienyuedu eagerly laurie opened it dr montgomery greetings from down under i received the photomicrographs from peter and i have already duly chastised him for not recognizing an acanthamoeba polyphaga cyst although i gave him some slack because of the location i have never seen one in the lung if you want to see it better use an iodine stain as for the evanescent nodularity peter mentioned i can only assume that it represents encasement of more of the same mrsa as is seen free in the microscopic field it has been recently demonstrated in bath england that mrsa can invade and multiply within acanthamoeba similar to legionella the cause of legionnaires disease since acanthamoeba normally eat bacteria it is interesting to wonder how the mrsa and legionella have developed antiamoebic resistance if you will and how molecularly similar the process is to their antibiotic resistance i will be back in the city on monday if i can be of any additional assistance please do not hesitate to contact me all the best collin wylie as astonished as she was about what she was reading laurie had read the email without blinking and she had to make up for it by squeezing her eyes shut and then blinking several times in a row she knew next to nothing about amoebas in general or acanthamoeba in particular leaning over she pulled her harrisons principles of internal medicine from the shelf and rapidly looked up acanthamoeba the reference was short and merely part of a general article about infection with freeliving amoeba it talked about acanthamoeba causing an encephalitis but nothing about pneumonia it also mentioned that the cdc had a fluoresceinlabeled antiserum available for definitive diagnosis which laurie thought might be helpful to confirm dr wylies impression laurie replaced the textbook and scanned her shelf for a possible second source not seeing one she repositioned herself at her monitor screen and googled acanthamoeba a large number of hits appeared in seconds she chose a general one with a growing sense of urgency laurie scanned the first part of the article which described the protozoa as one of the most common in soil and fresh water it described some of its characteristics including the fact that it was a freeliving bacterivore but could on rare occasions cause infections in humans the next paragraph elaborated this issue at length and laurie quickly skimmed it it was at that point that lauries eyes encountered the caption of the next paragraph acanthamoeba and mrsa with a surge of adrenaline coursing through her body laurie read an elaboration of what dr wylie had mentioned namely that mrsa had recently been shown to be able to infect acanthamoeba but in addition to what hed cited the article stated that the mrsa that emerged from the amoeba was frequently more virulent and then experiencing a reaction akin to a bolt of electricity passing through her laurie read that acanthamoeba cysts infected with mrsa can act as a mode of airborne dispersal for mrsa laurie rocked back in her chair and stared blankly at her monitor screen she was stunned shed been confident that mrsa could not be aerosolized but now she was aware it could be so all potential scenarios concerning how the mrsa was spread were back on the table particularly the idea that the angels hospitals hvac systems could be involved with some difficulty laurie tried to calm herself she had to think and with her pulse racing and ideas flying around inside her brain it was difficult she took a few deep breaths and after doing so she remembered another reason shed dismissed airborne spread as a serious possibility the patients never breathed room air after being inducted it was always bottled air or cleaned and pipedin air laurie thought about this stumbling point it seemed so definitive or was it with a mounting fear that her concerns were legitimate she snapped her phone off the hook even though a quarter to eight might have been the worst time to call an anesthesiologist as all the seventhirty cases were being inducted laurie called over to the manhattan general hospital shed worked on a case with the mghs chief of anesthesia dr ronald havermeyer and hed been extraordinarily helpful laurie was sure he of all people could reassure her about patients never breathing or air and would be happy to do so additionally his being chief meant that he was in a supervisory role and might be available nervously tapping her fingers on her desktop laurie willed the connection to go through as quickly as possible dr havermeyer a voice finally said laurie quickly explained who she was and without explaining why asked her question its true dr havermeyer said the patient never breathes room air after induction until they get to the pacu and even there they are often maintained on pipedin sources thank you laurie said not at all im glad i could help laurie was about to hang up when dr havermeyer asked why she wanted to know quickly laurie sketched out her concern namely whether bacteria in the hvac system could be responsible for postoperative nosocomial pneumonia are you talking about an extended period of breathing ambient air or just three or four breaths over fifteen or twenty seconds laurie felt her throat go dry as she intuitively sensed she was about to hear something she did not want to hear because if its the latter there usually is a time dr havermeyer said when the surgeon gives the word and its time to wake the patient up or at least terminate the anesthesia the anesthetist frequently flushes the system with pure oxygen in order to get a faster turnover time for the or during the flush the patient might take two three or even four breaths so its possible laurie thanked the doctor and hung up suddenly her fears coalesced mrsa could spread airborne if encysted with acanthamoeba and patients having general anesthesia did even if for only a few seconds breathe ambient or air laurie snapped up the paper on which shed written the days of the week her cases had occurred her memory told her that orthopedic cases were on monday and thursday and it was unfortunately true it was also unfortunately true that it was thursday that very day the day jack had to have his surgery with growing desperation laurie grabbed one of her cases hospital charts frantically she searched for the anesthesia record to check the time anesthesia commenced anesthesia time was one variable shed not included in her matrix to her horror it was seventhirtyfive am literally tossing the record to the side laurie grabbed another seventhirtyone am swearing under her breath laurie grabbed yet another seventhirtyfour am damn laurie shouted she got another seventhirty am with four cases out of twentyfive enough for laurie to fear for the worst in relation to jack she ran from her office and beat the elevator down button in hopes of hurrying its arrival she checked her watch as she waited it was just after eight jacks procedure was supposed to take a little more than an hour so she might make it if she got a taxi immediately luckily first avenue was a good place to get a cab in the morning because of the hospitals and other services in the area what laurie had decided was that she wanted to be in the angels orthopedic hospitals engineering spaces above the or as soon as possible to make absolutely certain no one else did as much as angelo thought he was depressed the previous evening he now felt worse theyd been waiting for almost two hours after arriving at sixfifteen and still no laurie montgomery since she and her boyfriend had arrived the previous morning from th street hed positioned the van so as to be able to see as far up the street as possible every time hed see a taxi approach his heart would speed up in anticipation only to be disappointed again and again i dont think shes coming to work today angelo growled kinda looks that way franco said while licking his finger to turn the page of his newspaper as if you give a shit franco lowered his paper and glared over at angelo whod turned to look back up th street he felt like lashing out at his partner in crime but didnt it wasnt worth the effort instead he started to go back to the paper when he caught sight of a figure bursting out from the ocme and descending the front steps as if being chased its her franco yelled angelos head spun around he started to demand where when he caught sight of laurie she was standing at the curb holding open a taxi door so a passenger could disembark holy shit angelo yelled he reached behind his seat for the ethylene but franco grabbed his arm theres no time franco asserted weve got to follow her start the damn car they watched while lauries hand anxiously waved for the obese woman passenger to hurry laurie even resorted to giving the woman one of her hands and attempting to help by pulling as if the woman were stuck as soon as the woman was barely out of the way laurie threw herself into the cab and pulled the door shut a moment later the cab was off with a screech of rubber my god angelo said the guy must be a nascar nut dont lose them franco cried as he blindly reached for parts of the vehicle that could keep him from being thrown from his seat angelo didnt need to be reminded about not losing laurie and he had the accelerator to the floor the aged van responded admirably and it shot forward with its own screech of complaint from its tires briefly angelo glanced in the rearview mirror to see if richie was on the ball he was and was not too far behind do you think she stayed the night in the morgue angelo questioned as he wove in and out of the traffic franco didnt answer he was too busy holding on and looking out for police cruisers luckily he saw none soon lauries taxi and angelos van had to stop for a traffic light and franco had an opportunity to put on his seat belt when laurie had finally managed to get into the taxi she had hurriedly told the driver the name of the hospital the address and that she was a doctor as a plea for speed shed said she was on a lifeanddeath emergency the cab driver who was a young individual had taken the request to heart and laurie was pleased how quickly he took them up first avenue although hed not run any red lights as far as laurie could tell some of them had been debatably close and had required him to accelerate through the amber unfortunately going across town was different and lauries feet began a nervous tap as they were forced to wait for a taxi to unload ahead of them at the corner of park avenue not only did the stop increase her anxiety of being too late it also gave her a chance to add to her fears if it were true that all the cases involved the seventhirty or time slot then it was understandable why wendell anderson had never had an mrsa case he didnt start his surgery until significantly later by choice at least not before doing so as a favor to jack laurie gritted her teeth if she hadnt been so anxious she could have gotten angry at jack all over again about his headstrong insistence on having his surgery that day as they neared the destination having just turned down fifth avenue laurie got out more than enough money and poked it through the plexiglas divider she had the door open before the cab came to a complete stop and she was out on the pavement in a flash slamming the taxi door behind her she ran toward the entrance but then slowed as she neared the liveried doorman for fear of making him suspicious and delaying her seemingly unperturbed by lauries dash from the taxi the man touched the brim of his hat as a kind of welcoming salute before giving the revolving door a push for her benefit once inside laurie continued to force herself to walk at a nearly normal gait she was conscious of her reception on tuesday and did not want to call attention to herself especially since there was a uniformed security man standing off to the side of the lobby laurie reached the elevators and pushed the call button looking up to the floor indicator she could see that one car was nearing the lobby out of the corner of her eye to her chagrin laurie glimpsed the security man push off the wall and walk in her direction selfconsciously she looked the other way she could sense his presence at her side but slightly behind the elevator arrived with relief laurie boarded and in the process pushed the fourthfloor button for a beat she faced into the car fearing the man was about to accost her but he didnt yet when she turned to face the elevator doors he boarded and their eyes briefly met they were the only two people in the elevator as the doors closed laurie quickly shifted her gaze up to the cabs floor indicator above the doors and held her breath expecting to be questioned at any moment the doors closed the elevator rose but then immediately stopped to her surprise and relief the security man exited on the second floor apparently having pressed the button when laurie had been purposefully keeping her eyes on the floor indicator when the doors reclosed laurie breathed a sigh of relief the elevator then rose up to the fourth floor as the doors opened laurie dashed out and ran headlong down the aseptically white corridor coming up to the engine room door she hesitated praying she was wrong and that her suspicions and fears were a product of an overly active imagination looking at her watch she saw it was eightforty the timing would be correct grasping the doorknob and with a bit of effort laurie pushed into the engineering room and was immediately enveloped in the throaty deep hum of the machinery in the heavily insulated highceilinged room the heavy door made a loud mechanical click that caught the attention of a surgically masked hooded and gowned figure who straightened up from where he had been otherwise hidden among the ducting in one hand he held a wrench hardly a surgical instrument in the other a stoppered erlenmeyer flask in took only a second for laurie to believe her worst fears were confirmed shouting no at the top of her lungs she raced toward the man who took a few steps back as if he were going to flee but then changed his mind and stood his ground laurie ran into him at full speed with her hands clawing at his mask and ripping it away instantly she recognized who it was it was walter osgood the unexpected contact forced walter to stagger back as he desperately tried to grasp something to keep him on his feet he dropped both the wrench and the flask the wrench clattered safely to the floor but the flask smashed into a dozen shards the contained white powder was ignominiously dumped onto the floor laurie screamed like a banshee and pounded walter who tried to protect himself by raising his crossed arms and briefly allowing laurie to hit against them she even got an arm through to his face striking it as hard as she could which jolted him out of his inaction with a surge of defensive anger he balled his hand into a fist and swung it wide in a roundhouse blow catching laurie above the ear laurie went down hard still she shook herself and then tried to get up but felt her head yanked painfully to the side walter had roughly grabbed a handful of her hair and was dragging her with walter twice her size and weight it was difficult for laurie to resist but she reached up and hit and then scratched his forearms walters reaction was to strike her again almost as hard with his left hand she tried to break the hold he had on her hair as he pulled her over to a door opening it with his left hand he dragged her inside she tried to kick his legs but he released the grip he had on her hair and hit her again on the side of her head with his fist as she flopped back supine he dashed back out through the door although dizzy laurie regained her feet and lunged for the doorknob only to feel and hear it make a loud mechanical click she was locked in walter gingerly touched the side of his face pulling his fingers away he saw a small amount of blood quickly he retrieved his n mask and secured it to his face despite the fact that one of its ties had been snapped apart when laurie had torn it off next he ran to a large deep sink where he found a towel wetting it he rushed back to the smashed flask and being careful not to cause even the slightest air disturbance laid the wet towel over the white powder ignoring lauries muffled yells as she pounded on the storerooms door walter pulled out his cell phone he was pleased there was a signal quickly he dialed the emergency number in washington once again it had to ring a number of times as he waited he winced at the new crashing sounds coming from the storeroom laurie was apparently throwing large metal containers against the door which was more worrisome than her previous yelling or pounding against the door with her fists walter was concerned someone might hear the commotion despite the extensive sound insulation with which the room had been equipped there was no doubt in walters mind that dr montgomery had to be removed and she had to be removed quickly finally the phone was answered walter had no patience with the heretofore cloakanddagger routine when the man started to ask whether walter was on a cell phone walter yelled that he didnt have time for such intrigue ive got dr laurie montgomery locked in a storeroom in the or hvac room he yelled should i let you listen to her yelling and screaming and pounding on the walls this whole mess is over if shes not dealt with do you understand what im saying whoever your best negotiator as you called him is hes doing a hell of a lousy job she burst in here and ruined my sample so todays attempt isnt going to happen i warned you about this two days ago you say miss montgomery is locked in a closet i said a storeroom walter yelled what floor fourth floor its left down the corridor from the elevator the door plaque says engineering dont let anyone in walter laughed sarcastically you dont understand if one of the engineers needs to come up here for any reason i couldnt stop them how often they do come i have no idea ill have someone there momentarily this time it was walter who hung up first for a moment he just stood there furious at what he had been dragged into and everything that was happening all because the companys health insurance wouldnt pay for his boys lymphoma treatment another crash brought walter abruptly back to the present he walked over to the storeroom door pounded it himself and told laurie to shut up and that hed let her out when shed calmed down let me out now laurie yelled back ive called security they are on their way walter yelled but his comment only resulted in another horrendous crash from within the storeroom giving up he set his mind to clean up the airborne infection powder adam was parked on the playground side of the street just opposite laurie montgomerys house hed gotten there slightly earlier than hed planned to give himself an extra cushion of time but something had obviously gone awry although a few people had exited the building neither laurie nor her boyfriend had shown their faces just when adam was about to admit hed have to return in the morning his phone buzzed against his leg it was one of his handlers in washington where are you the man demanded one hundred sixth street on the upper west side get over to the angels orthopedic hospital the target is locked in a closet in a fourthfloor engineering space an operative of ours is there his name is walter osgood miss montgomery must be extracted asap and then dealt with accordingly it should be a challenge but we trust you are up to it adam quickly hung up and started his vehicle he then switched on the beethoven and turned up the volume in the darkness laurie was becoming desperate shed always been somewhat claustrophobic and being locked in the way she was had awakened her childhood fears the only sliver of light was found beneath the stout door and shed been unable to locate a light switch after the first few minutes of pounding on the door and yelling in hopes of being heard by someone other than walter osgood shed groped about in the utter blackness the storeroom was about ten by twenty feet with shelving on both sides it was in the very back that shed found the sizable metal containers whose tops were secured like paint cans she had no idea what they contained and thought they may well have been paint by rolling one forward shed used it to heave repeatedly against the door it had had no perceivable effect despite its weight and she had to be careful in the darkness that it didnt bounce off the door and injure her for a moment she did nothing except try to listen it had been some time since shed heard walter moving about in the outer room unable to hear anything and finding that standing in the darkness was more harrowing than trying to avoid hitting herself with the multigallon container she went back to heaving it at the door on her second try she heard a deeper sound as the can struck the door and a softer one when it hit the floor laurie guessed that the top had come off and the contents spilled bending down laurie gingerly patted the floor as she moved her hand forward there was no smell of paint so laurie assumed it had to be something else all at once she encountered a fine powder with her fingers slowly she moved her fingers toward her face warily sniffing the closer she came it wasnt until her fingers were close to her face that she smelled anything and even then she wasnt sure what it was she guessed it was a type of cleaning product laurie righted the container it still contained about half of its contents she pushed it to the side so as not to stumble on it then she was about to get another one when she heard sounds coming from out in the other room it sounded as if it were a door closing hoping it was someone other than walter laurie began rattling the doorknob with one hand and pounding on the door with the other all the while yelling help over and over within the confines of the storeroom her yells were almost painfully loud but she imagined they werent so in the other room everything was so insulated laurie stopped her clamor no one had come to her rescue she heard muttering voices obviously someone had joined walter and hadnt rushed to her aid it wasnt hard for her to imagine that whoever it was was in league with walter probably coming to get her out of the hospital panicking laurie tried to think of what she could do shed not even been able to defend herself from one man much less two suddenly she thought of the fine powder it certainly wouldnt hold them off for long but may be enough to get a step on them maybe she could get out into the corridor where yelling and screaming could bring someone anyone moving up to the door laurie felt around for the open container reaching in with her two hands she scooped up as much of the powder as she could then stepping forward she pressed herself against the wall on the side of the door that opened it was none too soon as the door was suddenly unlocked and thrown completely ajar for a second nothing happened and then a head cautiously came in along with what could have been a gun laurie threw the powder into the face then rolled around into the doorway and pushed the man backward without waiting for an instant laurie took off running she saw walter grab the man who had his free hand slapped over his eyes the ruse had caught both unawares and had been more effective than laurie had even hoped the problem was that shed not been able to run toward the door to the corridor but rather toward the far door that laurie had been told led to a second hvac room more important for her at the moment was that shed also been told it too had an exit leading to a back stairway although the powder had provided laurie with the opportunity to run it was not caustic enough to hold adam down for long laurie had just managed to get through the adjoining door when adam got his sight more or less back to normal and he was able to pursue although he was still coughing to a degree when adam dashed into the second hvac room he had to come to a full stop for a second he did not see laurie rapidly his eyes scanned the highceilinged room with its tangle of ducting he didnt see laurie but he did see the rooms second door settling into its jamb there were large service elevators but laurie ignored them going through yet another door that laurie sensed was locked in the other direction she plunged down the stairs which had two runs per floor originally she was going to run back into the hospital on the or floor below and make a large ruckus but she had to ditch that idea with the fear of the door being locked from the stairwell side instead laurie continued down behind her she heard adam burst out through the door on the fourth floor reaching the ground floor laurie exited out to the deserted receiving dock to her right was the parking garage to the left the ramp leading up to fifth avenue without a seconds hesitation laurie ran to the left at least she was confident the avenue would be filled with moving traffic halfway up the ramp and despite her heavy breathing she heard behind her the exit door bang open against the side of the building at this point of fullfledged headlong sprinting her muscles were complaining in agony and each breath gave her a searing sensation in her chest laurie got to the street to her left almost a half a block away was the liveried doorman at the moment the sidewalk was devoid of activity the street was a different story as shed expected it was all but clotted with traffic moving at a slow pace for lack of any other alternative laurie ran directly out into the middle of the oneway multilaned avenue causing several cars to brake precipitously before drivers angrily drove on with both hands waving laurie tried to get a car a taxi a bus anything to stop when she saw adam sprinting in the middle of the street she started to run north against the traffic while still waving her hands and pleading for someone to stop its her for chrissake angelo yelled the moment hed seen laurie appear dashing from the hospitals parking ramp he was out of the van in an instant he and richie had parked their respective vans just south of the ramp entrance at the north end of the hospital since the traffic went north to south theyd decided it was the best place to be when laurie came out the front entrance which was what they had expected franco leaped out of his side of the blue van while richie and freddie jumped from the white one all four men were running up the sidewalk on the park side of fifth avenue with angelo slightly in the lead suddenly angelo stopped as did the others all saw adam race out into the street in pursuit of laurie at whom he was yelling to stop they all saw that he was carrying something wrapped in a towel because laurie was not moving ahead exclusively but rather trying to get cars to stop by slapping their hoods adam rapidly closed the narrow gap between them laurie turned to look at him although shed thought upstairs in the hvac room that he was a stranger now she thought she recognized him as the bill collector at the ocme but before she could say anything and before he said anything he slowly raised the coneshaped towel he was carrying such that laurie could see a black cylinder just concealed in its tip the sound of the gun was muffled and laurie reflexively winced and closed her eyes strangely nothing happened she reopened her eyes at her feet lay adam still clutching his pistol which had partially come out from behind its towel laurie was shocked into momentary immobility staring down at her attacker who was on his stomach slightly twitching but lauries trance didnt last long a moment later she was set on by four men one of whom was yelling police and showing several motorists whod finally stopped his police badge two other cars had actually pulled to the side of the road and the drivers were climbing out laurie was relieved as she allowed herself to be rapidly escorted to the parkside sidewalk it was there that her relief dissolved in a totally new whirl of fear one of the men was angelo facciolo an old nemesis of hers going back fifteen years she tried to slow the rapid progress being made as the four men hustled her toward the vans excuse me she called out still wanting to believe the men had saved her lets stop im fine she was ignored no one spoke suddenly she tried desperately to break from their collective grasp but to no avail she found herself being hoisted up into the air with her feet only lightly touching the pavement it was at that point that laurie belatedly tried to verbally protest but even that was of limited value as a hand snaked from behind and was clasped over her mouth reaching the vans the sliding door of the white one was thrown open and laurie was pulled inside as if devoured she tried to struggle but the four men crushed her under them making it hard for her to breathe she felt her legs being bound with duct tape then her arms she still tried to struggle and she screamed when the hand over her mouth had been removed but her shouting didnt persist for long as she was gagged with an oily rag held in by several turns of the duct tape april pm jack cringed from a new stab of pain from his freshly traumatized knee as hed forgotten where he was while reaching for the glass of water on his bedside table although the general background pain hadnt gone away the blissful narcotic had changed the pains character such that jack could easily ignore it jack had an intravenous setup with which he could control how much pain medicine he got in that way he was certain to get less which was his goal he knew that all the strong pain meds had a price to pay down the road even if it was something seemingly simple like constipation from about noon on jack had been multitasking meaning watching tv and flipping through magazines simultaneously hed brought some more serious reading but he had a sneaking suspicion he might not get around to it until the following day or the day after that or maybe never he liked just relaxing now that the big stress was over the operation was history and dr anderson had popped in around eleven and reported that it had gone exceedingly smoothly there was only one problem laurie had said shed be by around noontime and so far there had been no laurie and no call by one jack had called the ocme as he assumed shed gotten held up perhaps by there being so many autopsies such that she had to pitch in but he learned the day had not been overwhelming speaking with riva jack was told laurie was in her office around seven that morning but that no one had seen her since thinking that she might have gone home jack had tried her there when he didnt catch her he left a message for her to call with no other ideas of where she might be jack could only wait now that it was after two he began to get seriously concerned after drinking his water jack was about to go back to his magazine and the tv when lou soldano walked in he was doubly solicitous when he saw the contraption jacks operated leg was velcroed into it was constantly flexing and extending the knee which lou envisioned as being constantly painful after assuring the detective that it wasnt bothering him jack asked if hed seen or heard from laurie thats why im here lou said in a very serious tone he pulled over an upholstered chair i think youd better tell me whats going on there was a very bizarre shooting this morning while you were under the knife lou said it was right below your window in fact the victim was a man we knew little about since he was carrying false identification jack nodded he had no idea how laurie possibly could be in any way involved as you know new yorkers are rather high on the hardhearted scale and when this shooting went down not too many stopped although we are hearing from more people as the day progresses of those who stopped we havent gotten consistent reports be that as it may the individual had been chasing a woman out from behind the hospital so the woman shot this guy no not the woman but some passerby who had leaped from a van with three other people this guy shot the man who was about to shoot the woman at least according to a couple of witnesses but to corroborate the story the shooting victim was carrying a silenced automatic ninemillimeter pistol rolled up in a towel is the victim dead no hes critical but not dead have you been able to talk to him nope he had to undergo emergency surgery down the street at beth israel what about the woman have you talked to her nope again the woman was whisked off in a white van by the four men who had of all things pretended to be plainclothes police im telling you this is one weird case so how does this relate to laurie jack asked although he was unsure if he wanted to hear the descriptions of the woman although theyre not terribly consistent could be describing laurie with some more so than others jack stared at lou his anesthesiaaddled mind was struggling to process the information lou was providing jack didnt like what he was hearing but wanted to remain hopeful let me get this straight he said you dont have any specific association of this apparently abducted woman with laurie lou nodded nothing specific just the suggestive descriptions that and the fact that no one knows where laurie is at the moment i mean no one at the ocme and certainly not you good god jack murmured and me a total invalid with a totally bum knee lou stood up and replaced the chair he came back to the bed where the flexing and extending machine was making a constant lowpitched grinding noise he reached out and gave jacks arm a squeeze i just want you to know that ive got a thousand people including myself working on this and will be twentyfourseven weve been stopping white vans all over the city jack nodded although his knee felt reasonably well he was now sick with fear april pm by a little after eight it was finally dark enough to suit angelo for the quick ride over to the marina that morning after they made the snatch theyd driven south to a parking garage where franco was known with ease theyd transferred a terrified laurie from the white van to the blue one at that point richie and freddie had driven the white one back to queens where it disappeared into the motor pool meanwhile angelo and franco had driven the blue van with laurie in it out to new jersey where theyd found a rundown motel of questionable morals with rooms rentable by the hour what was most significant to angelo was that the entrance to the units was up and around the back of the grubby office angelo had wanted privacy for escorting laurie inside and he had had it in spades at that time of the morning the motel had all but been deserted richie and freddie had returned just before noon bringing with them takeout from johnnys and a couple sixpacks the four men then had spent the early afternoon playing cards eating subs and generally enjoying themselves it had been after the card game that angelo had finally attended to laurie after getting her to promise not to make a scene hed removed the duct tape from across her mouth and allowed her to spit out the gag hed then asked if she were thirsty and when shed admitted she was he held a glass hed prepared for her laurie had taken it despite its taste and from then on shed been easy to take care of angelo had spiked the drink with one of his small white daterape pills later in the afternoon theyd added another to make the switch from the van to the boat a piece of cake okay come on baby doll angelo said as he shook lauries shoulder were going for a nice little boat ride without any trouble they got laurie from the motel room into the van with two of the rohypnol tablets on board they didnt even need to rely on the duct tape yet they elected to leave it on with angelo driving and franco sitting shotgun in the van and richie and freddie in richies car the group made their way to the waterfront once there they headed directly to the marina all was going well until the pier itself came into view at that point they noted something theyd not seen the previous nights another car angelo braked and stopped the van richie pulled directly behind angelo can you make out the make of the car angelo asked franco leaned forward so that his nose was practically touching the windshield its hard to say but if i had to id say it was a cadillac a black cadillac sitting back franco looked at angelo did vinnie say he was coming not to me he didnt you think its vinnies franco shrugged it could be angelo put the van back in gear and slowly drove forward he didnt like surprises and he knew franco didnt either when they were fifty to sixty feet away angelo stopped again this time both men strained to see forward i think it is vinnies angelo said franco got out and as he closed on the car he could see it was vinnies franco walked around to the driversside window and knocked because of the tinting he couldnt see in but then looking out the pier he could see why a light from one of the lower gallerys portholes was casting a dim flickering beam across the water walking back to the van franco approached on the drivers side angelo lowered the window its okay franco said its the boss hes already out on the boat i wonder how come angelo said he wasnt sure he wanted to share the upcoming experience with the whole city beats me they parked got laurie out of the van took the duct tape off her ankles and walked her out the pier reminiscent of the snatch that morning they had to hoist her practically off her feet but not because she was resisting i think you might have overdone the daterape drug franco said being nearly comatose laurie seemed to weigh a surprising amount considering her trim figure hello men vinnie called to them when they drew near he had been standing in the shadows of the afterdeck but now he walked out more into the open ice could be heard clinking in his oldfashioned glass i hope you dont mind me dropping by i realized i didnt want to miss the fun and i see you men have already got the quickset and the other gear we got it yesterday angelo said and got it on board today good work vinnie said calmly i also brought someone else with me he gestured back into the shadows reluctantly michael calabrese stepped forward with a weak smile i got to thinking vinnie explained putting an arm around michaels shoulders mikey here seems to come up with all this work for you guys and for me but never gets his hands dirty you know what im saying its just prudent business practice to have him participate if push ever came to shove he couldnt throw up his hands and say he didnt know what was going down when these nice people disappear angelo i know this is mostly your show but i didnt think you would mind sharing is that too much to ask angelo held his tongue as he and franco maneuvered laurie across the gangplank onto the yacht i didnt hear your response vinnie said its okay angelo murmured as he and franco helped laurie across the open afterdeck there you go mikey vinnie said thumping michael on the back your fears are over angelos glad to have you on board so lets party while franco and angelo were below putting the deeply sleeping laurie in one of the staterooms richie and freddie manned the mooring lines vinnie happily climbed to the bridge and with his scotch at his side he started the twin diesels and eased the boat from its slip as they motored out into the middle of the river vinnie called down for someone to put on one of his frank sinatra cds a few minutes later hobokens favorite son was crooning away and massaging everyones mental state it was a pleasant night there was little wind and the water was calm a scimitar moon was just peeking over the jagged twinkling skyline of the city to the north was the lighted george washington bridge with the martha washington level demurely beneath to the south in the middle distance was their approximate destination the illuminated statue of liberty within ten minutes all worries concerns or irritation were blown away by the soft breeze and the loud but lulling sound of the engines everyone was either on the bridge or sitting on the gunwales in the stern except for laurie who was sleeping off her unexpected medication and angelo who was apparently beginning the preparation for the real reason they were all there ten minutes later angelo appeared and asked franco to help him move laurie up to the afterdeck you are right we overdid the daterape pill she wont wake up franco followed angelo below and richie went as well in case they needed more help a few minutes later the group appeared carrying both laurie and the fivegallon bucket into which her feet were sticking freddie jumped out of a folding chair so they could sit her down the group gathered around even vinnie came down after putting the boat on autopilot while freddie ducked below for some rope to keep laurie upright vinnie stuck his hand into the bucket to feel the consistency of the cement impressive vinnie said looking down into the bucket lauries feet were buried up to midcalf its almost dry it only takes a halfhour angelo said its actually called hydrophilic cement the guy at the home depot recommended it vinnie looked at angelo and joked you didnt tell him what you were going to do with it did you everyone had a good laugh the problem is shes passed out angelo said changing the subject i wanted her to suffer instead she looks like shes enjoying herself try to wake her vinnie offered maybe the fresh air will help angelo patted lauries cheek with the flat of his hand but there was no response he tried it harder still no response vinnie looked across at richie head up to the bridge and drive this brute of a boat we shouldnt leave it on autopilot we dont want to take a chance of hitting anything richie reluctantly climbed the ships ladder he didnt want to miss the fun you and me are just going to have to take what we get vinnie said to angelo then to the group he added lets all have another drink and toast to angelos vengeance as the boat bore down on the statue of liberty the festivities hit high gear a second frank sinatra cd had been put into the player and when my way came on everyone sang a few minutes later when they got to the worldfamous landmark vinnie yelled up to richie to head out toward the verrazano bridge hey its my turn to join the fun richie said how about someone else run this hulk vinnie looked at freddie and hooked a finger in the direction of the ladder to the bridge your turn he said with a slightly inebriated smile twenty minutes later vinnie poked his finger into lauries bucket the hydrophilic cement felt like it was supposed to feel it was even cool i think shes ready he yelled at angelo angelo came over and felt as well and nodded vinnie went over and yelled up to freddie to ease back on the throttle vinnie looked at angelo this looks like as good a place as any they were in the mouth of the narrows with the verrazanonarrows bridge dead ahead fine with me angelo said slurring his words freddie vinnie yelled up the ladder put it in neutral and come on down if you want hey everybody angelo said it looks like the evening air has done her a world of good she seems to be waking up yes she does vinnie agreed lets give her a little time angelo suggested id like her to know whats going on when we balance her on the stern with her cement boot on perfect vinnie said time for another round everyone cheered even richie until vinnie added except you richie tonight youre the designated driver a halfhour slipped comfortably by as the men sat around laurie and watched her slowly revive there had been a lot of jerky movements over a fifteenminute period and finally her eyes had opened halfway although it was obvious to everyone except angelo that lauries lights were on but no one was home as of yet angelo insisted on talking with her in an attempt to get her to comprehend exactly what was about to transpire finally he realized his efforts were in vain standing up angelo steadied himself with his hand on the sterns gunwale lets do it he said he undid the rope around lauries torso which had been holding her upright in the chair i want you to help vinnie said to michael giving him yet another slap on the back thats quite okay michael said i dont want to horn in on the fun nonsense vinnie countered its a community activity i insist michael studied vinnies face he could tell the man was dead serious reluctantly he moved to one side of lauries rag doll figure all right everyone angelo said first we stand her up although the boat was in neutral the engines still made considerable noise especially when the exhaust pipes went under the waters surface a situation that produced loud popping noises reminiscent of gunfire moving laurie from the chair to the very back of the boat was more difficult than they had expected she was so flaccid several people had to keep her upright while the others had to lift the fivegallon bucket of concrete at that point they faced the daunting task of lifting laurie and the concrete up onto the stern gunwale all right on three angelo said everyone was either grasping the weighty bucket or lauries floppy body not everyone was immediately aware of a giant presence that had silently loomed out of the darkness but certainly became so within seconds of each other on the other hand everyone was instantly frozen by the powerful and blinding searchlight beam and everyone heard the word freeze as it was suddenly and loudly projected from a sizable directional speaker mounted on one of the larger vessels of the harbor police fleet a second later a grappling hook dropped over the yachts gunwale and the two boats were quickly made fast a moment later uniformed police swarmed out of the blinding light and relieved the revelers of the burden of laurie and her concrete boot epilogue april pm detective lieutenant lou soldano quickly stubbed his cigarette out in his cars ashtray when he turned onto th street whenever he even got close to laurie and even to jack for that matter he always felt guilty about his smoking on account of having promised both of them he was stopping about nine million times slowing down lou parked in a noparking access to the neighborhood playground across from jack and lauries he tossed his nypd auto identification onto the dashboard and got out of the vehicle although spring often would take a long time to appear in the city it was doing fine as lou looked around the neighborhood a few crocuses had poked their delicate heads out of the ground in a small plot in the playground and even in a few window boxes on jack and lauries side of the street in the small wedge of central park that lou could see at the end of the street was a patch of lacy yellow forsythia starting across the street lou couldnt help but notice how jack and lauries building stood out they had just renovated it the year before when they had gotten married now several other buildings were in the process the neighborhood was definitely on the upswing before the renovation lou could just push in through the outer door since its lock had been broken some time before the war and never fixed jack used to joke that it was the civil war now lou had to ring the bell which he did jack and laurie lived on the top two floors the rest of the building had been divided into rental apartments but lou had the suspicion that jack and laurie let them for little or no money to deserving families particularly singleparent families presently laurie answered which made sense since jack was still hobbled from his recent operation her voice sounded disgruntled knowing what they both had been through he asked if he should come back at another time after identifying himself having come directly from court hed not phoned ahead are you joking she questioned with exasperation as if lou were adding to her woe i was just asking maybe i should have called lou for chrissake get your ass up here behind him lou could hear the door release activated quickly he pushed it open then held it with an extended foot im on my way youd better be lou had no real idea what lauries mindset was at first shed sounded purely vexed but then it had seemingly turned to pique as he climbed the final flight suffering from all the cigarettes hed smoked in his life he vowed once again to quit tomorrow or maybe the next day before he could knock and with his arm raised to do so the door opened laurie was standing just inside the threshold with one fist jammed in the crook of her hip am i glad to see you she said motioning over her shoulder with her head would you mind talking to king louis quatorze over there lou leaned in and looked into the living room jack was sprawled out on the couch surrounded by all manner of treats including juices fruit and cookies lou looked back at laurie he had to admit she looked good considering her horrid experience less than a week previously at the hands of vengeful twobit mafioso types her face had her normal color and her eyes were bright and fully open he thinks he can order in a semirecumbent exercise bike today and just hop on can you imagine that might be rushing it lou agreed now dont you gang up on me jack warned but with a smile im not getting involved lou said raising his hands im just calling it as i see it but let me ask the two of you a question are you getting a little stircrazy locked up in here together lou knew that laurie had been essentially ordered to take sick leave after her abduction and torture laurie and jack glanced irritably at each other then simultaneously laughed all right lou ordered whats so funny now am i the butt of a joke jacked waved lou away not at all i think we both realized at the same instant that you were correct is that right laurie im afraid so i think weve been getting on each others nerves because neither one of us can do what we want to do we both want to get out clearly happier than they had been five minutes earlier jack and laurie welcomed a visit with lou for whom laurie had quickly made fresh coffee laurie was sitting on the couch next to jack and lou in a side chair on the opposite side of the coffee table so how are both you guys lou asked balancing his coffee on his knee laurie looked at jack and motioned for him to go first im as good as can be expected jack said the surgery went fine and thanks to laurie i didnt get anything i hadnt signed up for meaning a fulminant mrsa infection im chagrined to say the least that i didnt give the threat more credence but i have to say if a doctor tells you youre going to have a little discomfort after a surgery dont believe him or her surgeons lie like crazy but with that proviso in general i guess im doing okay its just hard looking out my livingroom window at night seeing the guys having a run i feel like a kid quarantined what about you laur louis asked switching his line of vision laur had been the name given to laurie by lous kids back when lou had first met her fifteen years previously laurie flashed a questioning expression i feel a heck of a lot better than people think i should im sure its a function of the rohypnol i was given i mean id heard daterape pills frequently caused considerable amnesia but i had no idea how total it would be or that it could involve retrograde events i remember only sketchily confronting osgood and then being locked in the storeroom im not sure how i got out although i do remember being chased by whats his name adam williamson lou put in a tragic figure i might add at least in some regards hes an iraq veteran who went through hell and has a lot of resultant mental problems did he pull through jack asked he noticed that lou used the present tense he did hes going to make it what were not sure about is whether hes going to be willing to plea bargain with us obviously we have him on attempted murder and conspiracy you do know he was about to shoot you at pointblank range dont you laurie thats what i was told isnt there a witness to the fact we have two good witnesses lou said and the king of all ironies is that angelo is the one who saved you by shooting adam before adam shot you that part i dont remember laurie admitted in fact i dont remember anything else until gradually waking up in the hospital its a good thing lou said when we got there in the middle of upper new york bay they had you rigged up with what they used to call cement boots so i heard laurie said with a shudder that reminds me jack said first how did you know she was out there and once you did how in tarnation did you find them out there in the middle of new york bay in the dark thats the best part lou said and truthfully i dont mind taking a little credit the floater we picked up monday night scared the bejesus out of us making me worry about a mob war breaking out like i told you when i found out that the word on the street was that vinnie dominick was behind it i went over to paul cerinos old organization to tip them off thinking the floater might have been in cahoots with them as it turned out he wasnt but the vaccarros were concerned enough to follow vinnies principle enforcers angelo and franco and discovered vinnie had squirreled away a sizable yacht which they were using for nasty purposes the next part is the cleverest what they did was to figure out a way to get the city meaning me to get rid of the competition vinnie represented and how they did it was secretly to put a gps tracking device on the yacht and then wait until a good opportunity arose louie barbera paul cerinos replacement called me up thursday evening right at the point i was despairing and offered me the website and the password and user name for the gps device he also told me what he thought was about to happen so we wouldnt waste time and we didnt it was just lucky we got there when we did for your benefit at the same time the opportunity couldnt have been any better from a lawenforcement angle we reeled in vinnie dominick and all his top guys in one fell swoop plus another guy by the name of michael calabrese and best of all we got them all for attempted firstdegree murder hardly a minor charge furthermore while the crime guys have been poring over the boat trace blood was discovered that belonged to the two floaters whom we have identified as paul yang and amy lucas both from new jersey and both worked for angels healthcare laurie stiffened angels healthcare that runs the angels hospitals none other its a relatively complicated story and the investigation is ongoing involving the fbi and the sec sadly it is just another one involving huge amounts of potential money the kind of corruption weve all heard a bit too much of these days although in this case there was a generous amount of oldfashioned crime involved like murder as well as the newer whitecollar variety as you correctly sensed laurie the mrsa was being purposefully spread and not just for terrorist purposes there was a method to the madness what a group of people was trying to do was sabotage the ipo and in a sense the specialtyhospital concept who was responsible laurie asked ultimately the people behind it are lobbyists mostly former lawyerpoliticians who had morphed into becoming lobbyists after either retiring or being voted out of office of the particular organization we are speaking of they had landed the perfect clients the aha and the fah what they had been hired to do was to make absolutely sure that the senate moratorium on building specialty hospitals and registering them with cms or centers for medicaid and medicare services be changed into law but they didnt do it somehow they dropped the ball wanting to keep the aha and the fah as clients they shouldered the responsibility to make absolutely certain the first ipo after the moratorium was lifted would not be successful hence they conjured up the mrsa initiative as ive been calling it their thinking was that it would be viewed as a natural phenomenon and that investors would be driven away by the cash crunch the postop infections would cause so it was they who recruited walter osgood was he just a pawn in this affair im afraid so we know that he wasnt extorted but did it on his own free will he had both the background to pull it off and some very specific needs that motivated him as i think you know he trained in microbiology so it wasnt difficult for him to requisition the mrsa from the cdc and the amoeba from national culture he had a little private lab where he cooked up what turns out to be a pretty good bioterrorism agent at least thats what our consults have been telling us he got the mrsa to invade the amoeba proliferate and then he got the amoeba to encyst once he got the amoeba to form cysts which is apparently easy he could dry the cysts to form an airborne infectious agent perhaps the cleverest part he could use the cysts to flood an or at the moment when patients with anesthesia with endotracheal tubes are about to be awakened timing was critical and it didnt work a hundred percent of the time but as osgood became more and more familiar with particular surgeons and the lengths of particular procedures he got better and better sounds like you have all these terms and concepts down pat laurie said on a case like this i needed to be prepared for the sake of the prosecutors all the arraignments were this morning what were walter osgoods needs you mentioned he had a son who came down with a very severe form of some sort of cancer the only treatment was deemed experimental and the angels healthcare employees health insurance company would not pay walter had been paying on his own the involved pharmaceutical company had been charging him twenty thousand a month can you believe it you certainly have learned a lot in a few days its a hot case as you can well imagine im lucky the fbi got into it bigtime they have been carrying the ball the lobbyist organization is in washington dc as you might imagine so in a very real way angels healthcare has been subverted for the last number of months thats a good way to describe it but they have not been lilywhite by any stretch of the imagination i should say laurie agreed even if they didnt know the mrsa was being deliberately spread they kept on doing surgery even though people kept dying they are guilty of a little more than that in these days of sarbanesoxley this part of the case is being handled by the sec investigators once angels healthcare got into financial difficulty with their cash flow they were required by law to have conveyed the information to the sec so investors could protect themselves especially if there was an imminent ipo and this isnt the kind of thing you get slapped on the wrist for and told you are bad nowadays this kind of oversight means big fines and stiff prison sentences the government is intent on making examples of these whitecollar criminals because it is the little guy who is always hurt weve all heard of some notorious cases over the last couple of years laurie said thats an understatement lou said im ninetyninepointnine percent sure that all the angels healthcare principals will be able to spend some time with those more famous brethren the ceo cfo and coo have all been arrested and arraigned two posted very high bail but the third couldnt what if they didnt know they were supposed to file when their cash flow fell ignorance of the law is not an excuse lou said at the same time they knew except for the ceo they are experienced businesspeople and the ceo had recently been through business school they all knew what they should have done in fact the reason paul yang and his secretary amy lucas were killed as near as we can tell is because paul wanted to file the necessary paperwork and the others put pressure on him not to do it thats serious business have the angels healthcare executives also been charged with murder laurie asked with shock no we were able to learn through freddie capuso who has copped a plea that the two killings and your being put in jeopardy was from the civilian guy on the boat michael calabrese i remember your mentioning him what was his role he used to be married to the ceo angela dawson and even had a child with her in the past he was an investment banker with morgan stanley but left because of the opportunity to invest all the racketeering and drug money vinnie dominick controlled he was in essence a professional money launderer on top of that hes going to be tried for murder god what a mess laurie said in a very real way we owe you for breaking the case or more accurately breaking the cases if it hadnt been for you all these people would be still carrying on i dont think i deserve the credit laurie said im afraid my motivations were to get jack to postpone his surgery so the rest is fallout lou smiled he didnt agree but wasnt going to argue what has walter osgood been charged with laurie asked havent you heard heard what walter osgood committed suicide yesterday good grief laurie said his son whom hed been trying to raise the money for died on saturday osgood had a lot of reasons to be depressed its a multilayered tragedy for everyone involved ill tell you what it is jack said speaking up for the first time its equivalent to the adage in politics that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely the difference is that with medicine its money not power chet mcgovern pressed his nose against the buss window and looked across the east river at laguardia airport he was close enough to see individual windows on the jetliners as they waited to take off he was close but in another way he was far because chet was on a new york city bus heading across a long twolane bridge that not only had he never seen but he never knew even existed having lived in the city for fifteen years he thought he was familiar with it but here he was on a bridge every bit as long as the mighty george washington and it was his first contact and he hoped his last the bridge led from the borough of queens to rikers island the largest penal institution in the world as a metaphor for incarceration rikers island was a long way from its neighbor laguardia airport which like any airport was a contrasting icon for freedom chets morning had started early in the courthouse although he had had significant experience testifying during many trials involving all manner of death hed had little other contact with the courts and that morning hed had to face a steep learning curve over the easter weekend hed fretted over the news that had been in the times concerning angels healthcare and its ceo and founder angela dawson she her chief financial officer and her chief operating officer had been arrested for an astounding array of charges including various conspiracies a number of different categories of fraud money laundering violations of the patriot act and violation of sarbanesoxley an even more serious charge of accessory to depravedheart murder had been quickly dropped chet had first been angry here was a woman whod impressed and charmed him into going to frivolous lengths to spend a little time with her and to get to know her not to mention the money hed spent on her and now after all the effort he learns from a newspaper that shes a criminal for him it had been yet another reminder that women like his old college girlfriend cannot be trusted and keeping them at arms length represented an act of selfpreservation yet by late easter sunday chets initial response had mellowed enough for him to question the charges since they hardly fit the mental and emotional image hed begun to construct of angela dawson he also reminded himself of a basic tenet of american jurisprudence namely that people are innocent until proven guilty it was at that point that another fact had begun to bother him all three individuals had been offered bail but only two had posted it angela dawson had not done so and the reason given was that shed consumed all her equity in trying to prop up her floundering company from there on it had been downhill as far as chets sense of wellbeing was concerned hed been unable to get two images out of his mind one was angela chained to a bare stone wall in a damp dungeonlike cell with rats and cockroaches running around the second was a tenyearold daughter crying incessantly by monday chet had made a decision which he assumed was irrational and surely had more to do with his own needs than with chivalry and by that morning tuesday hed started the process by calling a bail bondsman and arranging for a quick meeting it had been at that point that chets learning curve about criminal law had had to begin hed always had a rather simplified view of posting bail a person brought the money handed it over and that was it but particularly in highprofile cases such as angelas especially when the bail amount was high as it was there was a bit more involved in fact it took all morning for chet and the bail bondsman to arrange for a court surety hearing to make sure chets twentyfive thousand cash and his collateral for the other two hundred thousand were coming from legitimate sources and not drug money or something similar forced to wait even over a court adjournment for lunch chet had not gotten the final determination that the bail had been met until onethirty it was for that reason that it was now almost three as he was at last approaching rikers island chet looked around the buss interior the other riders were mostly female and appeared to reside mostly on the south side of the poverty line although it was abundantly clear that rich people were as capable as anyone else of committing crime the lions share of the burden of paying for it fell on the poor after what seemed like an exceptionally long drive the bus drove onto rikers island proper and presently came to a stop at the rikers island visitors center as chet climbed down from the bus he got the immediate impression the complex was generally dirty and rundown it was not a happy place unsure of where to go chet followed the crowd into the scarred and scuffed building the atmosphere was repressive as the others whod come on the bus with chet filed off to their respective destinations chet stopped he didnt know where to go hed not realized how large the place was spotting an officialappearing person chet started in his direction for advice but he didnt need it he saw angela sitting among a crowd who plainly had more in common with one another than with her angela had been staring ahead blankly until she caught sight of chet her first reaction was confusion as if she recognized him but couldnt quite remember who he was chet walked directly up to her and looked down into her eyes which suddenly reflected recognition she stood up with confusion chet she said as much a question as a statement what a coincidence meeting you here chet said spontaneously hed not planned on what he should say angela laughed uneasily i had no idea it would be you suddenly i was told my bail had been posted and that i was to be picked up i thought maybe by my cfo or my coo but never you i hope im not a disappointment hardly angela said she reached out and gave him a hug pinning his arms to his sides for a moment she wouldnt let go when she did he saw her eyes had become significantly wetter thank you and my daughter thanks you i dont know what else to say thanks is fine chet said and youre welcome then he hooked a thumb over his shoulder maybe we should try to catch the bus i came out here on otherwise i dont know how long we will have to wait lets for sure angela said eagerly she wanted to put as much distance between herself and rikers island as possible and as quickly as possible she picked up her small bag together they headed for the exit both were selfconscious they didnt touch why did you do it angela asked when they got outside to be honest i dont know angela stopped for a moment and glanced around when you are locked up you realize how much you take freedom for granted this has been the worst experience of my life i think we better hurry chet said the bus was still standing where chet had gotten off but the line to board was down to three people chet and angela ran and climbed on the first empty double seat was close to the very rear i guess i posted your bail because i dont think you could have done the things you are charged with im sorry to disabuse you of that belief angela said turning to chet i did do some of them but hardly as charged i have had a number of miserable hours thinking about everything the main thing is that i knowingly did not file an eightk its a required sec form but do you know something there was never a precise moment when it should have been filed i mean at first there was no cashflow problem it happened over time and we thought the mrsa would be easily handled we never suspected it was being deliberately spread i spoke to a lawyer friend of mine chet said he told me in cases like this the judge has a lot of discretion i hope so angela said my biggest worry right now is the threat of losing my medical license which is a very real possibility for me that will be the worst punishment because ive finally seen the light as a businesswoman i dont like the person ive become its like ive had blinders on ive come to realize that money is a seductive but illusionary goal and its addictive the problem is ones never satisfied and no matter how much money is made it cant shake a stick at how i remember feeling after helping an office full of patients what im saying is i want to go back to medicine come again chet said with surprise i want to go back to the practice of medicine angela repeated my immediate goal is going to be to solve my legal problems so i can do it its been a hard lesson but i know now that mixing medicine and business is great for business with the huge amount of money available but an unmitigated disaster for medicine and the doctors who allow themselves to be caught up in it interesting chet said interesting angela repeated questioningly are you humoring me ive really been thinking about this nonstop im being very serious im not humoring you at all chet said quite the contrary im realizing that you are telling me why i was willing to post your bail about robin cook a bestselling author for many years since early books such as coma were the basis for successful films originally residing and practising in boston he now lives and works in florida
