peter robinson close to home aka the summer that never was book in the inspector banks series for sheila the glory dropped from their youth and love and both perceived they had dreamed a dream which hovered as dreams do still above but who can take a dream for a truth robert browning the statue and the bust chapter trevor dickinson was hungover and badtempered when he turned up for work on monday morning his mouth tasted like the bottom of a birdcage his head was throbbing like the speakers at a heavy metal concert and his stomach was lurching like a car with a dirty carburetor he had already drunk half a bottle of milk of magnesia and swallowed four extrastrength paracetamol with no noticeable effect when he arrived at the site trevor found he had to wait until the police had cleared away the last of the demonstrators before he could start work there were five left all sitting crosslegged in the field environmentalists one was a little grayhaired old lady ought to be ashamed of herself trevor thought a woman of her age squatting down on the grass with a bunch of bloody marxist homosexual treehuggers he looked around for some clue as to why anyone would want to save those particular few acres the fields belonged to a farmer who had recently been put out of business by a combination of madcow disease and footandmouth as far as trevor knew there werent any rare pinknippled fart warblers that couldnt nest anywhere else in the entire country nor were there any ivyleafed larksturds lurking in the hedgerows there werent even any trees unless you counted the shabby row of poplars that grew between the fields and the a stunted and choked from years of exhaust fumes the police cleared away the demonstrators including the old lady by picking them up bodily and carting them off to a nearby van then they gave the goahead to trevor and his fellow workers the weekends rain had muddied the ground which made maneuvering more difficult than usual but trevor was a skilled operator and he soon got his dipper shovel well below the topsoil hoisting his loads high and dumping them into the waiting lorry he handled the levers with an innate dexterity directing the complex system of clutches gears shafts and winch drums like a conductor scooping as much as the power shovel could hold then straightening it so as not to spill any when he lifted it up and over to the lorry trevor had been at work for well over two hours when he thought he saw something sticking out of the dirt leaning forward from his seat and rubbing condensation from the inside window of the cab he squinted to see what it was and when he saw it took his breath away he was looking at a human skull and what was worse was that it seemed to be looking right back at him alan banks didnt feel in the least bit hungover but he knew hed drunk too much ouzo the night before when he saw that he had left the television on the only channels it received were greek and he never watched it when he was sober banks groaned stretched and made some of the strong greek coffee he had become so attached to during his first week on the island while the coffee was brewing he put on a cd of mozart arias picked up one of last weeks newspapers he hadnt read yet and walked out on the balcony though he had brought his discman he felt fortunate that the small timeshare flat had a mini stereo system with a cd player he had brought a stack of his favorite cds with him including billie holiday john coltrane schubert walton the grateful dead and led zeppelin he stood by the iron railings listening to parto ma tu ben mio and looking down at the sea beyond the jumbled terraces of rooftops and walls a cubist composition of intersecting blue and white planes the sun was shining in a perfect blue sky the way it had done every day since he had arrived he could smell wild lavender and rosemary in the air a cruise ship had just dropped anchor and the first launches of the day were carrying their loads of excited camerabearing tourists to the harbor gulls squawking in their wake banks went to pour himself some coffee then came out again and sat down his white wooden chair scraped against the terra cotta tiles scaring the small lizardlike creature that had been basking in the morning sun after looking at the old newspaper and perhaps reading a little more of homers odyssey banks thought he would walk down to the village for a long lunch maybe have a glass or two of wine pick up some fresh bread olives and goat cheese then come back for a nap and a little music before spending his evening at the taverna on the quayside playing chess with alexandros as had been his habit since his second day there was nothing much that interested him in the newspapers except the sports and arts pages rain had stopped play in the third test match at old trafford which was hardly news england had won an important world cup qualifying match and it wasnt the right day of the week for the book or record reviews he did however notice a brief report on a skeleton uncovered by a construction worker at the site of a new shopping center by the a not far from peterborough he only noticed it because he had spent a good part of his early life in peterborough and his parents still lived there he put the newspaper aside and watched the gulls swoop and circle they looked as if they were drifting on waves of mozarts music drifting just like him he thought back to his second conversation with alexandros during their game of chess alex had paused looked seriously at banks and said you seem like a man with many secrets alan a very sad man what is it you are running from banks had thought about that a lot was he running yes in a way running from a failed marriage and a botched romance and from a job that had threatened for the second time in his life to send him over the edge with its conflicting demands its proximity to violent death and all that was worst in people he was seeking a temporary escape at least or did it go deeper than that was he trying to run away from himself from what he was or from what he had become he had sat there pondering the question and answered only i wish i knew before making a rash move and putting his queen in jeopardy he had managed to avoid affairs of the heart during his brief stay andrea the waitress at philippes taverna flirted with him but that was all occasionally one of the women from the cruise ships would give him that certain kind of wistful look which led only to one place if you let it but he hadnt let it he had found himself a place where he didnt have to confront crime on a daily basis more particularly a place where he didnt have to go down into cellars stuffed with the violated bodies of teenage girls a scene from his last case that still even here on this peaceful island haunted his dreams so he had achieved his goal run away from a messy life and found paradise of a kind why was it then that he still felt so damn restless detective inspector michelle hart of the cambridgeshire constabulary northern division entered the forensic anthropology department of the district hospital she was looking forward to this morning usually at postmortems she found herself disturbed not so much by the cutting and probing itself as by the contrast between the bright reflective surfaces of utilitarian tile and steel and the messy slosh of stomach contents the dribbles of blackish blood running into the polished gutters between the smell of disinfectant and the stench of a punctured bowel but this morning none of that was going to happen this morning all that dr wendy cooper the forensic anthropologist had to examine was bones michelle had worked with her just over a month ago her first case in her new posting on some remains that had turned out to be anglosaxon not unusual in those parts and they had got on well enough the only thing she found hard to take was dr coopers predilection for playing countryandwestern music while she worked she said it helped her concentrate but loretta lynn had quite the opposite effect on michelle dr cooper and her graduatestudent assistant david roberts were bent over the partial skeleton arranging the small bones of the hands and feet in the correct order it must be a difficult task michelle realized from the one brief anatomy course she had attended and how you told one rib or one knuckle from another was quite beyond her dr cooper seemed to be doing well enough she was in her early fifties a rather stout figure with very short gray hair silverrimmed glasses and a nononsense manner do you know how many bones there are in a human hand dr cooper asked without looking away from the skeleton a lot michelle answered twentysix said dr cooper twentysix and awkward little buggers to make out some of them got anything for me yet michelle took out her notebook a little bit as you can see were still trying to put him back together again him oh yes you can take my word for that the skull and pubis bear it out northern european too id say she turned the skull sideways see that straight facial profile the narrow nasal aperture all signs there are others of course the high cranium the eye sockets but you dont want a lesson in ethnic anthropology do you i suppose not said michelle who actually found the subject quite interesting sometimes she thought she might have chosen the wrong career and should instead have become an anthropologist or perhaps a doctor not very tall though is he dr cooper looked at the bones laid out on the steel trolley tall enough for his age id say dont tell me you know his age of course only a rough guess mind you by measuring the long bones and applying the appropriate formula weve calculated his height at around five foot six thats somewhere between a hundred and sixtyseven and a hundred and sixtyeight centimeters a kid then dr cooper nodded and touched the shoulder with her pen the medial clavicular epiphysis collarbone to you is the last epiphysis in the body to fuse normally in the midtwenties though it can occur anytime between fifteen and thirtytwo his hasnt fused yet also ive examined the rib ends and vertebrae in an older person youd expect not only signs of wear and tear but sharper ends and more scalloping on the ribs his rib ends are flat and smoothly rounded only slightly undulating and the vertebrae show no epiphyseal rings at all also the fusion of ilium ischium and pubis is in its early stages that process usually takes place between the ages of twelve and seventeen so youre saying hes how old in my business it doesnt pay to go out on a limb but ill say between twelve and fifteen allow a couple of years either way as a fair margin of error the databases we get these figures from arent always complete and sometimes theyre out of date anything else the teeth of course youll have to bring in the odontologist to examine the roots and check the levels of fluoride if there is any it wasnt introduced in toothpaste here until but i can tell you three things right now first off there are no deciduous teeth left thats baby teeth and the second molar has erupted that means hes aged around twelve again give or take a couple of years and id hazard a guess given the other evidence that hes older rather than younger and the third thing a bit less scientific im afraid but judging by the general state of his teeth and the look of all these metal fillings in the posterior teeth id guess vintageschool dentist how long ago was he buried there impossible to say theres no remaining soft tissue or ligaments the bones are discolored and theres some flaking so id say more than a decade or two but beyond that its anyones guess until ive done more rigorous tests any sign of cause of death not yet i need to get the bones cleaned up sometimes you cant see knife marks for example because of the encrusted dirt what about that hole in the skull dr cooper ran her finger around the jagged hole must have occurred during excavation its definitely postmortem how can you tell if it had happened before death thered be signs of healing this is a clean break but what if it was the cause of death dr cooper sighed as if she were talking to a dense undergraduate michelle noticed david roberts grin and he blushed when he saw her watching him if that were the case the doctor went on youd expect a very different shape fresh bones break in a different way from old bones and look at that she pointed to the hole what do you see michelle peered closely the edges she said theyre not the same color as the surrounding bone very good that means its a recent break if it had happened around the time of death youd expect the edges to have stained the same color as the rest of the skull wouldnt you i suppose so said michelle simple isnt it if you know what youre looking for theres a fractured humerus too right arm but thats healed so id say it happened while he was alive and do you see this she pointed to the left arm its slightly longer than his right arm which may indicate lefthandedness of course it could be due to the fracture but i doubt it there are differences in the scapulae that also support my hypothesis michelle made some notes then turned back to dr cooper we know he was most likely buried where he was found she said because the remains were about three or four feet underground but is there any way of knowing whether he died there or was moved there later dr cooper shook her head any evidence of that was destroyed in the same way the skull and some of the other bones were damaged by the bulldozer wheres the stuff we found with the body dr cooper gestured toward the bench that ran the length of the far wall and turned back to the bones david roberts spoke for the first time he had a habit of keeping his head down when he spoke to michelle and of mumbling so she couldnt always hear what he was saying he seemed embarrassed in her presence as if he fancied her she knew that her combination of blond hair and green eyes had a captivating effect on some men but this was ridiculous michelle had just turned forty and david couldnt be more than twentytwo she followed him over to the bench where he pointed to a number of barely recognizable objects we cant say for certain that theyre his he said but all these were gathered within a short radius of the body when she looked more closely michelle thought she could make out scraps of material perhaps fragments of clothing a belt buckle coins a pen knife a roundedged triangle of plastic shoe leather lace eyelets and several round objects what are those she asked marbles david rubbed one of them with a cloth and handed it to her it felt smooth to michelles touch and inside the heavy glass sphere was a double helix of blue summer then she said almost to herself beg your pardon she looked up at david oh sorry i said summer boys usually played marbles in summer outdoors when the weather was good what about the coins a few pennies half a crown sixpence a threepenny bit all old coinage before decimalization at any rate so thats pre she picked up a flat triangular object with rounded edges whats this david polished away some of the grime and revealed a tortoiseshell pattern i think its a plectrum he said you know for a guitar a musician then michelle picked up a chain bracelet of some sort crusted and corroded with a flat elongated oval at its center and something written on it dr cooper came over yes i thought that was interesting she said you know what it is a bracelet of some kind yes i think its an identity bracelet they became very popular with teenage boys during the midsixties i remember my brother had one david was able to clean this one up a bit all the silver platings gone of course but luckily the engravers drill went deep into the alloy underneath you can read part of the name if you look very closely here use this she passed michelle a magnifying glass michelle looked through it and was able to make out the faint edges of some of the engraved letters grha that was all graham id guess said dr cooper michelle looked at the collection of bones trying to imagine the warm living breathing human being that they had once formed a boy graham she whispered pity he didnt have his last name engraved too itd make our job a lot simpler dr cooper put her hands on her ample hips and laughed to be honest my dear she said i dont think you can have it much simpler than this can you if im right so far youre looking for a lefthanded boy named graham aged between say twelve and fifteen who once broke his upper right arm and went missing at least twenty or thirty years ago maybe in summer oh and he played marbles and the guitar am i forgetting anything ill bet there cant be too many matching that description in your files banks walked down the hill and through the winding streets of the village at about seven every evening he loved the quality of the light at that time of day the way the small white houses with their colorful wooden steps seemed to glow and the flowers a profusion of purple pink and red seemed incandescent the scent of gardenia mingled with thyme and oregano below him the winedark sea stretched all the way back to the mainland just as it had done in homers day although it wasnt exactly winedark banks noticed not all of it anyway some of the areas closer to land were deep blue or green and it only darkened to the purple of a young greek wine much farther out one or two of the shopkeepers greeted him as he passed he had been on the island for a little over two weeks now which was longer than most tourists stayed and while he wasnt accepted his presence was at least acknowledged it was much the same as in a yorkshire village where you remain an incomer until you have wintered out several years maybe he would stay here that long learn the language become a mysterious hermit merge into the rhythms of island life he even looked a bit greek with his lean frame closely cropped black hair and tanned skin he picked up the twodayold english newspapers that came on the last boat of the day and carried them with him to philippes quayside taverna where he spent most of his evenings at an outside table overlooking the harbor he would have an ouzo as an aperitif make his mind up about what to eat then drink retsina with dinner he found that hed come to enjoy the odd oily taste of the local resinated wine banks lit a cigarette and watched the tourists getting into the launch that would take them back to their cruise ship and the evenings entertainment probably cheryl from cheadle hulme dancing the dance of the seven veils or a group of beatles imitators from heckmondwike tomorrow they would disembark on a new island where they would buy overpriced trinkets and take photographs they wouldnt look at more than once a group of german tourists who must have been staying overnight at one of the islands few small hotels took a table at the other side of the patio and ordered beer they were the only other people sitting outside banks sipped ouzo and nibbled on some olives and dolmades as he settled on fish à la grecque and a green salad for dinner the last of the tourists had returned to the cruise ship and as soon as he had cleared away his stock alex would come by to play chess in the meantime banks turned to the newspapers his attention was caught by an article on the bottom right of the front page headed dna confirms identity of longburied body intrigued banks read on a week ago the skeleton of a young boy was unearthed by workers digging the foundations of a new shopping centre next to the a west of peterborough cambridgeshire information discovered at the scene and provided by forensic anthropologist dr wendy cooper led to a very narrow list of possibilities it was almost a gift dr cooper told our reporter usually old bones dont tell you so much but in this case we knew early on that he was a young boy who had broken his right arm once and was most likely lefthanded an identity bracelet popular with teenage boys in the midsixties was found near the scene and bore a partial name detective inspector michelle hart of the cambridge constabulary commented dr cooper gave us a lot to work with it was simply a matter of going through the files narrowing the possibilities when police came up with one strong candidate graham marshall the boys parents were approached for dna samples and the testing proved positive its a relief to know theyve found our graham after all these years said mrs marshall at her home even though we lived in hope graham marshall disappeared on sunday nd august at the age of while walking his regular newspaper round near his council estate home in peterborough no trace of him has ever been found until now the police at the time exhausted every possible lead di hart told our reporter but theres always a chance that this discovery will bring new clues asked if there is likely to be a new investigation into the case di hart would only state that missing persons are never written off until they are found and if theres the possibility of foul play then justice must be pursued as yet there are no clear indications of cause of death though dr cooper did point out that the boy could hardly bury himself under three feet of earth banks felt his stomach clench he put the paper down and stared out to sea where the setting sun was sprinkling rose dust over the horizon everything around him began to shimmer and feel unreal as if on cue the tape of greek music came to zorbas dance as it did every night the taverna the harbor the brittle laughter all seemed to vanish into the distance and there was only banks with his memories and the stark words in the newspaper alan what is it you say a penny for them banks looked up and saw the dark squat figure of alex standing over him alex sorry good to see you sit down alex sat looking concerned you look as if youve had bad news you could say that banks lit a cigarette and stared out over the darkening sea he could smell salt and a whiff of dead fish alex gestured to andrea and in moments a bottle of ouzo appeared on the table in front of them along with another plate of olives and dolmades philippe lit the lanterns that hung around the outside patio and they swayed in the breeze casting fleeting shadows over the tables alex took out his portable chess set from its leather bag and arranged the pieces banks knew that alex wouldnt press him it was one of the things he liked about his new friend alex had been born on the island and after university in athens had traveled the world as an executive for a greek shipping line before deciding to pack it all in ten years ago at the age of forty now he made a living from tooling leather belts which he sold to tourists on the quayside alex was an extremely cultured man banks had soon discovered with a passion for greek art and architecture and his english was almost perfect he also possessed what seemed to banks a very deeprooted sense of himself and a contentment with the simple life which banks wished he could attain of course he hadnt told alex what he did for a living merely that he was a civil servant he had found that telling strangers you meet on holiday that youre a policeman tends to put them off either that or they have a mystery for you to solve the way people always seem to have strange ailments to ask about when they are introduced to doctors perhaps its not a good idea tonight alex said and banks noticed he was putting the chess set away it had always been a mere backdrop to conversation anyway as neither was a skilled player im sorry said banks i just dont seem to be in the mood id only lose you usually do but its all right my friend clearly there is something troubling you alex stood to leave but banks reached out and touched his arm oddly enough he wanted to tell someone no stay he said pouring them both a generous glass of ouzo alex looked at him for a moment with those serious brown eyes and sat down again when i was fourteen said banks looking out at the lights in the harbor and listening to the stays on the fishing boats rattle a close school friend of mine disappeared he was never seen again nobody ever found out what happened to him not a trace he smiled and turned to look at alex its funny because this music seemed to be playing constantly back then zorbas dance it was a big hit in england at the time marcello minerbi funny the little things you remember isnt it alex nodded memory is indeed a mysterious process and often not to be trusted true it seems that as things lie there they are strangely metamorphosed a lovely greek word metamorphosed it is one thinks of ovid of course but it happens to the past doesnt it to our memories yes anyway banks went on there was a general assumption at the time that my friend graham was his name had been abducted by a pedophile another greek word but not so lovely and done away with it seems a reasonable assumption given life in the cities but might he not have simply run away from home that was another theory but he had no reason to as far as anyone knew he was happy enough and he never talked about running off anyway banks went on all attempts to find him failed and he never turned up again the thing is about two months earlier i was playing down by the river when a man came and grabbed me and tried to push me in what happened i was wiry and slippery enough to wriggle my way free and run off but you never told the authorities i never even told my parents why not you know what kids are like alex i wasnt meant to be playing down there for a start it was quite a long way from home i was also playing truant i was supposed to be at school and i suppose i blamed myself i just didnt want to get into trouble alex poured more ouzo so when your friend disappeared you assumed it was the same man yes and youve been carrying the guilt all these years i suppose so i never really thought about it that way but every once in a while when i think about it i feel its like an old wound that never quite heals i dont know i think it was partly why i why you what never mind why you became a policeman banks looked at him in astonishment how did you know alex was smiling ive met a few in my time you get to recognize the signs like what oh watchfulness curiosity a certain way of walking and sitting little things banks laughed by the sound of it youd make a pretty good policeman yourself alex oh no i think not why i dont think i could ever be quite certain that i was on the right side and are you now i try to be so do i said banks im sure you are a good policeman you must remember though in greece well weve had our share of regimes but please go on banks tapped the folded newspaper theyve found him he said buried by the roadside about eight miles away from where he disappeared alex whistled between his teeth they dont know the cause of death yet banks went on but he couldnt have got there by himself so perhaps the assumptions were right yes and that makes you feel bad all over again does it terrible what if i was responsible alex what if it was the same man if id spoken up even if you had reported what happened it doesnt mean he would have been caught these men can be very clever as im sure you have learned over the years alex shook his head but im not foolish enough to believe that one can talk a man out of his guilt when hes set on feeling it do you believe in fate i dont know we greeks are great believers in fate in destiny what does it matter anyway because it exonerates you dont you see its like the catholic church absolving you of sin if its fate then you were meant to survive and not tell anyone and your friend was destined to be abducted and killed and his body discovered many years later then i dont believe in fate well it was worth a try said alex what are you going to do i dont know theres nothing i can do really is there the local police will investigate and theyll either find out what happened or they wont my bet is that after all these years they wont alex said nothing for a moment just toyed with his ouzo glass then he took a long sip and sighed what said banks i have a feeling im going to miss you my friend why im not going anywhere you know the germans occupied this island during the war of course said banks surprised by alexs abrupt change of subject ive explored the old fortifications you know i have we talked about it it wasnt exactly the guns of navarone but i was impressed alex waved his hand in a dismissive gesture you and i can only imagine what life was like under the nazi occupation he said but my father lived through it he once told me a story about when he was a boy not much older than you and your friend were the german officer in command of the island was called von braun and everyone thought he must have been an incompetent bastard to be sent somewhere like this as you say my friend not exactly the guns of navarone not exactly the most strategic position in the mediterranean nevertheless someone had to keep an eye on the populace and von braun was the man it wasnt a very exacting task and im sure the soldiers posted here became very sloppy one day my father and three of his friends stole a german jeep the roads are bad as you can see even now and they couldnt drive of course and knew nothing beyond the rudiments so they crashed into a boulder after theyd barely gone half a mile luckily they were uninjured and ran away before the soldiers were alerted to what had happened though apparently one soldier saw them and told von braun there were four kids alex paused and lit one of his turkish cigarettes banks had once questioned him on the political correctness of a greek smoking turkish tobacco but all hed said was that it tasted better anyway alex went on expelling a plume of smoke whatever the reason von braun took it upon himself to seek retribution make an example in the same way the nazis did in many occupied villages he probably wanted to prove that he wasnt just some soft incompetent idiot sent to the middle of nowhere to keep him out of harms way he rounded up four teenage boys the same number the soldier had counted and had them shot just over there alex pointed to where the main street met the quayside two of them had actually been involved the other two were innocent none of them was my father the german tourists laughed at something one of the women had said and called andrea to order more beer they were already pretty drunk in bankss opinion and theres not much worse than a drunken german unless its a drunken english football fan alex ignored them and went on my father was guiltstricken for not speaking up as was his friend but what could they have done the nazis would probably have shot them in addition to the four others they had chosen it was what the americans call a nowin situation he carried that shame and that guilt with him all his life is he still alive hes been dead for years now but the point is von braun was one of the minor war criminals tried after the war and do you know what my father went to the trial hed never left the island before in his life except for one visit to athens to have his appendix removed but he had to go to bear witness banks felt oppressed by alexs story and the weight of history felt as if there was nothing he could say that would not be inappropriately light finally he found his voice are you trying to tell me you think i ought to go back alex looked at him and smiled sadly im not the one who thinks you ought to go back ah shit banks lit a cigarette and tilted the ouzo bottle again it was nearly empty am i right alex persisted banks looked out at the sea dark now twisting the lights reflected on its shimmering surface and nodded there was nothing he could do tonight of course but alex was right he would have to go he had been carrying his guilty secret around for so long now that it had become a part of him and he could no more put the discovery of graham marshalls bones out of his mind than he could all the other things he had thought hed left behind sandra and her pregnancy annie cabbot the job he watched a pair of young lovers arms around each other stroll along the quayside and felt terribly sad because he knew it was all over now this brief sojourn in paradise knew that this would be the last time he and alex spent a companionable evening together in the greek warmth with the waves lapping against the ancient stone quay and the smell of turkish tobacco and salt and rosemary in the air he knew that tomorrow he had to go down to the harbor early take the morning ferry to piraeus and get on the first flight home and he wished to hell he didnt chapter up in yorkshire two days later the sky was far from cloudless and the sun was definitely not shining it had not in fact shone since banks had left for greece reflected detective inspector annie cabbot as she pushed yet another pile of paperwork aside and put her feet up on the desk it was as if the bugger had gone and taken all the sunshine with him nothing but cold rain gray skies and more rain and this was august where was summer annie had to admit that she missed banks she had ended their romantic relationship but there was no one else in her life and she enjoyed his company and his professional insight in her weaker moments too she sometimes wished they had managed to remain lovers but it wasnt a valid option given his family baggage and her renewed interest in her career too many complications involved in sleeping with the boss on the plus side she had found far more time for her painting and had started meditation and yoga again not that she couldnt understand why banks had gone the poor sod had simply had enough he needed to recharge his batteries gird his loins before he entered back into the fray a month should do it assistant chief constable ron mclaughlin had agreed and banks had more than enough accrued leave for that so he had buggered off to greece taking the sunshine with him lucky sod at least bankss temporary absence meant a quick transfer for annie from complaints and discipline back to cid at the rank of detective inspector which was what she had been angling for she didnt have her own office anymore however only a semipartitioned corner in the detectives squad room along with ds hatchley and six dcs including winsome jackman kevin templeton and gavin rickerd but it was worth the sacrifice to be away from that fat sexist lecher detective superintendent chambers not to mention a welcome change from the kind of dirty jobs she had been given under his command there hadnt been much more crime than sun in the western area lately either except in harrogate of all places where a mysterious epidemic of eggthrowing had broken out youths seemed to have taken to throwing eggs at passing cars old folks windows and even at police stations but that was harrogate not eastvale which was why annie bored with looking over reports mission statements circulars and costcutting proposals perked her ears up when she heard the tapping of detective superintendent gristhorpes walking stick approaching the office door she took her feet off the desk as much so that gristhorpe wouldnt notice her red suede ankle boots as anything else tucked her wavy chestnut hair behind her ears and pretended to be buried deep in the paperwork gristhorpe walked over to her desk hed lost quite a bit of weight since he shattered his ankle but he still looked robust enough even so rumor had it that he had been heard to broach the subject of retirement owt on annie he asked annie gestured to the papers strewn over her desk not a lot only theres this boy gone missing schoolboy aged fifteen how long ago didnt come home last night gristhorpe put the misper report in front of her parents have been calling us since yesterday evening annie raised her eyebrows a bit soon to bring us in on it isnt it sir kids go missing all the time fifteenyearolds in particular gristhorpe scratched his chin not ones called luke armitage they dont luke armitage not aye martin armitages son stepson to be accurate oh shit martin armitage was an exfootball player who in his time had been one of the major strikers of the premier league since retiring from professional sport he had become something of a country gentleman he lived with his wife and stepson luke in swainsdale hall a magnificent manor house perched on the daleside above fortford armitage was known as a champagne socialist because he professed to have leftwing leanings gave to charities especially those supporting and promoting childrens sporting activities and chose to send his son to eastvale comprehensive instead of to a public school his wife robin fetherling had once been a celebrated model well enough known in her field as martin armitage was in his and her exploits including drugs wild parties and stormy public affairs with a variety of rock stars had provided plenty of fodder twenty years ago or more when annie was a teenager robin fetherling and neil byrd had been a hot item the beautiful young couple of the moment when annie was at the university of exeter she had even listened to neil byrds records in her student flat but she hadnt heard his name or his music in years hardly surprising as she had neither the time nor the inclination to keep up with pop music these days she remembered reading that robin and neil had had a baby out of wedlock about fifteen years ago luke then they split up and neil byrd committed suicide while the child was still very young oh shit indeed said gristhorpe id not like to think we give better service to the rich and famous than to the poor annie but perhaps you could go and try to set the parents at ease the kids probably gone gallivanting off with his mates run away to london or something but you know what peoples imaginations can get up to where did he disappear from sir we dont know for certain hed been into town yesterday afternoon and when he didnt come home for tea they started to get worried at first they thought he might have met up with some mates but when it got dark and he still wasnt home they started to get worried by this morning they were frantic of course turns out the lad carried a mobile with him so theyre sure he would have rung if anything came up annie frowned that does sound odd have they tried ringing him no signal they say his phones switched off annie stood up and reached for her umbrella ill go over there and talk to them now and annie yes sir you hardly need me to tell you this but try to keep as low a profile as possible the last thing we want is the local press on the case softly softly sir gristhorpe nodded good annie walked toward the door nice boots said gristhorpe from behind her banks remembered the days surrounding graham marshalls disappearance more clearly than he remembered most days that long ago he realized as he closed his eyes and settled back in the airplane seat though memory he found tended to take more of a cavalier view of the past than an accurate one it conflated condensed and transposed it metamorphosed as alex had said last night weeks months years were spread out in his minds eye but not necessarily in chronological order the emotions and incidents might be easy enough to relocate and remember but sometimes as in police work you have to rely on external evidence to reconstruct the true sequence whether he had got caught shoplifting in woolworths in or for example he couldnt remember though he recollected with absolute clarity the sense of fear and helplessness in that cramped triangular room under the escalator the cloying smell of old spice aftershave and the way the two darksuited shop detectives laughed as they pushed him about and made him empty his pockets but when he thought about it more he remembered it was also the same day he had bought the brandnew with the beatles lp which was released in late november and that was the way it often happened remember one small thing a smell a piece of music the weather a fragment of conversation then scrutinize it question it from every angle and before you know it theres another piece of information you thought youd forgotten and another it didnt always work but sometimes when he did this banks ended up creating a film of his own past a film which he was both watching and acting in at the same time he could see what clothes he was wearing knew what he was feeling what people were saying how warm or cold it was sometimes the sheer reality of the memory terrified him and he had to snap himself out of it in a cold sweat just over a week after he had returned from a holiday in blackpool with the banks family graham marshall had disappeared during his sundaymorning paper round out of donald bradfords newsagents shop across the main road a round he had been walking for about six months and one that banks himself had walked a year or so earlier when mr thackeray owned the shop at first of course nobody knew anything about what had happened apart from mr and mrs marshall and the police as banks leaned back in his seat and closed his eyes he tried to reconstruct that sunday it would have started in the normal way on weekends banks usually stayed in bed until lunchtime when his mother called him down for the roast during lunch they would listen to the radio comedies on the light programme the navy lark and round the horne until the billy cotton band show drove banks out of doors to meet up with his friends on the estate sometimes the five of them banks graham steve hill paul major and dave grenfell would go walking in the local park staking out an area of grass near the playing fields and listen to alan freemans pick of the pops on pauls trannie watching the girls walk by sometimes steve would get bold and offer one of them a couple of woodbines to toss him off but mostly they just watched and yearned from a distance other sundays theyd gather at pauls and play records which was what they did on the day graham disappeared banks remembered pauls was best because he had a new dansette which he would bring outside on the steps if the weather was good they didnt play the music too loudly so nobody complained if pauls mum and dad were out theyd sneak a cigarette or two as well that sunday everyone was there except graham and nobody knew why he was missing unless his parents were keeping him in the house for some reason they could be strict grahams parents especially his dad still whatever the reason he wasnt there and nobody thought too much of it there they would be then sitting on the steps wearing their twelveinchbottom drainpipe trousers tightfitting shirts and winklepickers hair about as long as they could grow it before their parents prescribed a trip to mad freddys the local barbers no doubt they played other music but the highlights of that day banks remembered were steves pristine copy of the latest bob dylan lp bringing it all back home and bankss help along with his fascination with masturbation steve hill had some rather wayout tastes in music other kids might like sandie shaw cliff richard and cilla black but for steve it was the animals the who and bob dylan banks and graham were with him most of the way though banks also enjoyed some of the more traditional pop music like dusty springfield and gene pitney while dave and paul were more conservative sticking with roy orbison and elvis of course everybody hated val doonican jim reeves and the bachelors that day songs like subterranean homesick blues and maggies farm transported banks to places he didnt know existed and the mysterious love songs love minus zerono limit and she belongs to me lingered with him for days though banks had to admit he didnt understand a word dylan was singing about there was something magical about the songs even vaguely frightening like a beautiful dream in which someone starts speaking gibberish but perhaps that was hindsight this was only the beginning he didnt become a fullfledged dylan fan until like a rolling stone knocked him for a loop a month or two later and he wouldnt claim even today to know what dylan was singing about half the time the girls from down the street walked by at one point as they always did very mod in their miniskirts and mary quant hairdos all bobs fringes and headbands eye makeup laid on with a trowel lips pale and pink noses in the air they were sixteen far too old for banks or his friends and they all had eighteenyearold boyfriends with vespas or lambrettas dave left early saying he had to go to his grandparents house in ely for tea though banks thought it was because dylan was getting up his nose steve headed off a few minutes later taking his lp with him banks couldnt remember the exact time but he was certain that he and paul were listening to everyones gone to the moon when they saw the ford zephyr cruising down the street it couldnt have been the first one because graham had been missing since morning but it was the first one they saw paul pointed and started whistling the z cars theme music police cars werent a novelty on the estate but they were still rare enough visitors in those days to be noticed the car stopped at number grahams house and two uniformed officers got out and knocked on the door banks remembered watching as mrs marshall opened the door thin cardie wrapped around her despite the warmth of day and the two policemen took off their hats and followed her into the house after that nothing was ever quite the same on the estate back in the twentyfirst century banks opened his eyes and rubbed them the memory had made him even more tired hed had a devil of a time getting to athens the other day and when he had got there it was only to find that he couldnt get a flight home until the following morning hed had to spend the night in a cheap hotel and he hadnt slept well surrounded by the noise and bustle of a big city after the peace and quiet of his island retreat now the plane was flying up the adriatic between italy and the former yugoslavia banks was sitting on the left and the sky was so cloudless he fancied he could see all of italy stretched out below him greens and blues and earth colors from the adriatic to the mediterranean mountains the crater of a volcano vineyards the cluster of a village and sprawl of a large city soon he would be landing back in manchester and soon the quest would begin in earnest graham marshalls bones had been found and banks damn well wanted to know how and why they had ended up where they did annie turned off the broad between fortford and relton onto the gravel drive of swainsdale hall elm sycamore and ash dotted the landscape and obscured the view of the hall itself until the last curve when it was revealed in all its splendor built of local limestone and millstone grit in the seventeenth century the hall was a long twostory symmetrical stone building with a central chimney stack and stonemullioned windows the dales leading family the blackwoods had lived there until they had died out in the way many old aristocratic families had died out lack of money and no suitable heirs though martin armitage had bought the place for a song so the stories went the cost of upkeep was crippling and annie could see as she approached that parts of the flagstone roof were in a state of disrepair annie parked in front of the hall and glanced through the slanting rain over the dale it was a magnificent view beyond the low hump of the earthworks in the lower field an ancient celtic defense against the invading romans she could see the entire green valley spread out before her from the meandering river swain all the way up the opposite side to the gray limestone scars which seemed to grin like a skeletons teeth the dark stubby ruins of devraulx abbey were visible about halfway up the opposite daleside as was the village of lyndgarth with its square church tower and smoke rising from chimneys over roofs darkened by the rain a dog barked inside the house as annie approached the door more of a cat person herself she hated the way dogs rushed up when visitors arrived and barked and jumped at you slobbered and sniffed your crotch created chaos in the hall while the apologetic owner tried to control the animals enthusiasm and explain how it really was just very friendly this time was no exception however the young woman who opened the door got a firm grip on the dogs collar before it could drool on annies skirt and another woman appeared behind her miata she called out behave josie would you take miata to the scullery please yes mam josie disappeared halfdragging the frustrated dobermann along with her im sorry the woman said she gets so excited when we have visitors shes only being friendly miata nice name said annie and introduced herself thank you the woman held out her hand im robin armitage please come in annie followed robin down the hall and through a door on the right the room was enormous reminiscent of an old banquet hall with antique furniture scattered around a beautiful central persian rug a grand piano and a stone fireplace bigger than annies entire cottage on the wall over the mantelpiece hung what looked to annies trained eye like a genuine matisse the man who had been staring out of the back window over a lawn the size of a golf course turned when annie entered like his wife he looked as if he hadnt slept all night he introduced himself as martin armitage and shook her hand his grip was firm and brief martin armitage was over six feet tall handsome in a rugged athletic sort of way with his hair shaved almost to his skull the way many footballers wore it he was slim longlegged and fit as befitted an exsportsman and even his casual clothes jeans and a loose handknit sweater looked as if they had cost more than annies monthly salary he glanced down at annies boots and she wished shed gone for something more conservative that morning but how was she to know detective superintendent gristhorpe told me about luke annie said yes robin armitage tried to smile but it came out like the twentieth take of a commercial shoot look ill have josie bring us some tea or coffee if youd prefer it tea would be fine thanks said annie perching carefully on the edge of an antique armchair one of the most civilized things about being a policewoman she thought especially working in plainclothes was that the people you visited witnesses victims and villains alike invariably offered you some sort of refreshment usually tea it was as english as fish and chips from what she had read or seen on television she couldnt imagine anything like it happening anywhere else in the world but for all she knew perhaps the french offered wine when a gendarme came to call i know how upsetting something like this can be annie began but in ninetynine percent of cases theres absolutely nothing to worry about robin raised a finely plucked eyebrow do you mean that youre not just saying it to make us feel better its true youd be surprised how many mispers we get sorry thats police talk for missing persons and most of them turn up none the worse for wear most of them echoed martin armitage im just telling you that statistically hes likely statistically what kind of martin calm down shes only trying to help robin turned to annie im sorry she said but neither of us has had much sleep lukes never done anything like this before and we really are quite frantic with worry nothing short of seeing luke back here safe and sound will change that please tell us where you think he is i wish i could answer that i really do said annie she took out her notebook can i just get some information from you martin armitage ran his hand over his head sighed and flopped down on the sofa again yes of course he said and i apologize my nerves are a bit frazzled thats all when he looked right at her she could see the concern in his eyes and she could also see the steely gaze of a man who usually got what he wanted josie came in with tea which she served on a silver tray annie felt a bit embarrassed the way she always did around servants martin armitages lip curled in a smile as if he had noticed her discomfort a bit pretentious isnt it he said i suppose youre wondering why a dyedinthewool socialist like me employs a maid its not as if i dont know how to make a cup of tea i grew up with six brothers in a west yorkshire mining town so small nobody even noticed when maggie thatcher wiped it off the face of the earth bread and dripping for breakfast if you were lucky that sort of thing robin here grew up on a small farm in devon and how many millions of pounds ago was that annie wondered but she wasnt here to discuss their lifestyle its none of my business she said i should imagine youre both very busy you can use the help she paused just as long as you dont expect me to stick my little finger in the air while i drink my tea martin managed a weak laugh i always like to dunk digestive biscuits in mine then he leaned forward and became serious again but youre not going to make me feel better by distracting me what can we do where do we look where do we begin well do the looking thats what were here for when did you first start to believe something was wrong martin looked at his wife when was it love after tea early evening robin nodded hes always home for tea when he wasnt back by after seven oclock and we hadnt heard from him we started to get worried what did you do we tried to call him on his mobile martin said and what happened it was turned off then what well about eight oclock robin said martin went looking for him where did you look mr armitage i just drove around eastvale a bit aimless really but i had to do something robin stayed home in case he rang or turned up how long were you gone not long i was back oh around ten robin nodded in agreement do you have a recent photograph of luke annie asked something we can circulate robin went over to one of the low polished tables and picked up a package of prints she thumbed through them and handed one to annie this was taken at easter we took luke to paris for the holidays will it do annie looked at the photograph it showed a tall thin young man dark hair curling around his ears and brow who looked older than his fifteen years even to the point of having the fluffy beginnings of a goatee he was standing by a grave in an old cemetery looking moody and contemplative but his face was out of the shadows and close enough to the camera to be useful for identification purposes he insisted on visiting the père lachaise cemetery robin explained thats where all the famous people are buried chopin balzac proust edith piaf colette lukes standing by jim morrisons grave there have you heard of jim morrison ive heard of him said annie who remembered friends of her fathers playing loud doors records even years after morrisons death light my fire and the end in particular had lodged themselves somewhere in her memories of those days its funny said robin but most of the people making pilgrimages to that grave werent even born when he was at the height of his popularity even i was just a little girl when the doors were first big that placed her in her early forties annie guessed and still a striking figure robin armitages golden tresses hung over her narrow shoulders and shone every bit as much in real life as they did in her magazine adverts for shampoo despite the signs of strain and worry hardly a line marred her smooth pale complexion though robin was shorter than annie had imagined her figure looked as slender as it had been in all the posters annie had ever seen of her and those lips which had so tantalizingly sucked the lowfat ice cream off the spoon in a famous television commercial some years ago were still as full and pink as ever even the beauty spot annie had always imagined was fake was still there at the corner of her mouth and close up it looked real yes robin armitage looked as good as she had twenty years ago annie thought she ought to hate the woman on sight but she couldnt it wasnt just because of the missing boy either she told herself but she sensed something very human very vulnerable behind the exquisitely packaged models facade thisll do fine said annie slipping the photograph into her briefcase ill get it circulated as soon as i get back what was he wearing the usual said robin black tshirt and black jeans you say the usual do you mean he always wears black its a phase said martin armitage or at least thats what his mother tells me it is martin you wait hell grow out of it if we ever see him again dont worry mrs armitage hell turn up in the meantime id like more information about luke himself anything you know about his friends interests or acquaintances that could help us work out where he may be first of all was everything all right between you had there been any arguments recently not that i can think of robin answered i mean nothing serious everything was fine between us luke had everything he wanted its been my experience said annie that nobody ever has everything they want even if someone who loves them very dearly thinks they have human needs are so various and so hard to define at times i didnt only mean material things said robin as a matter of fact luke isnt much interested in the things money can buy except for electronic gadgets and books her longlashed blue eyes blurred with tears i meant that he has all the love we can give him i dont doubt it said annie what i was thinking though was that maybe there was something he wanted to do that you wouldnt let him like what asked robin something you didnt approve of a pop concert he wanted to go to friends you didnt like him being with that sort of thing oh i see what you mean but i cant think of anything can you darling martin armitage shook his head as parents go i think were pretty liberal he said we realize kids grow up quickly these days i grew up quickly myself and lukes a smart lad i cant think of any films i wouldnt want him to see except for pornography of course hes also a quiet shy sort of boy not much of a mixer he keeps to himself hes very creative robin added he loves to read and he writes stories and poems when we were in france it was all rimbaud verlaine and baudelaire annie had heard of some of those poets through her father had even read some of them she thought they were a little advanced for a fifteenyearold boy then she remembered that rimbaud started writing poetry at fifteen and gave it up at nineteen what about girlfriends annie asked he never mentioned anyone said robin he might be embarrassed to tell you annie suggested im sure wed have known annie changed tack and made a note to look into lukes love life or lack of it later if necessary i dont know how to put this any more diplomatically she said but i understand youre not lukes biological father mr armitage true hes my stepson but ive always thought of him as my own son robin and i have been married ten years now luke has our family name tell me about lukes father mrs armitage robin glanced over at her husband its all right darling martin armitage said it doesnt bother me if you talk about him though i cant quite see the point of all this robin turned back to annie actually im surprised you dont know already given the inordinate amount of interest the gutter press took in the whole affair at the time its neil byrd i thought most people knew about neil and me oh i know who he was and what happened i just dont remember the details he was a pop singer wasnt he a pop singer hed have been disgusted to hear himself called that he thought of himself more as a sort of modern troubadour more of a poet than anything else from singersongwriter to footballer annie thought the way marilyn monroe went from baseball player to playwright there was clearly more to robin armitage than met the eye please excuse my ignorance and refresh my memory she said robin glanced out of the window where a large thrush had found a worm on the lawn then sat down beside her husband he took her hand as she spoke youre probably thinking it seems like an odd combination she said but neil was the first man not to treat me like a complete moron because of my looks its difficult being well you know looking like i did most men are either too scared to approach you or they think you must be an easy lay with neil it was neither how long were you together about five years luke was only two when neil walked out on us just like that no warning he said he needed his solitude and couldnt afford to be burdened with a family any longer thats exactly the way he put it burdened im sorry said annie what happened what about your career i was twentyfive when we met and id been modeling since i was fourteen it was hard to get my figure back after luke of course and i was never quite the same as before but i still got work mostly tv commercials a small and very forgettable part in a slasher film part fifteen of some series or other but why do you need to know all this it cant have anything to do with lukes disappearance neils been dead for twelve years i agree with my wife said martin as i said earlier i cant see what relevance all this has im just trying to get as much background as i can annie explained you never know what might be important with missing persons what might trigger them does luke know who his father was oh yes he doesnt remember neil of course but i told him i thought it important not to keep secrets from him how long has he known i told him when he was twelve and before that martin is the only father he has known so for seven years annie calculated luke had accepted martin armitage as his true father then his mother had dropped the bombshell about neil byrd how did he react to the news she asked he was confused naturally said robin and he asked a lot of questions but other than that i dont know he didnt talk about it much afterward annie made a couple of notes as she digested this she thought there must be more to it than robin let on but perhaps not kids can be surprisingly resilient and unexpectedly sensitive do you still have any contact with any of neil byrds friends or relatives annie asked good lord no neils parents both died young it was one of the things that haunted him and i dont move in those sort of circles anymore may i see lukes room of course robin led annie out into the hall up a flight of worn stone stairs to the upper floor where she turned to the left and opened the heavy oak door of the second room along annie turned on the bedside light it took her a few moments to register that the room was black except for the carpeted floor it faced north so it didnt get a lot of sun and even with the bedside light on there was no ceiling light it looked gloomy it was tidier than she had expected though and almost spartan in its contents luke or someone had painted a solar system and stars on the ceiling one wall was covered with posters of rock stars and moving closer annie noted the names kurt cobain nick drake jeff buckley ian curtis jim morrison most of them were at least vaguely familiar to her but she thought banks might know more about them than she did no sports personalities she noticed on the opposite wall written in silver spray paint were the words le poëte se fait voyant par un long immense et raisonné dérèglement de tous les sens the words rang a bell but she couldnt quite place them and her french wasnt good enough to provide her with a clear translation do you know what this means she asked sorry said robin i never was any good at french in school annie copied the words down in her notebook an electric guitar stood propped against a small amplifier under the mullioned window a computer sat on a desk and next to the wardrobe were a mini stereo system and a stack of cds she opened the violin case on top of the dresser and saw that it did indeed contain a violin annie flipped through the cds most of the bands shed never heard of such as incubus system of a down and slipknot but she recognized some oldies like nirvana and rem there was even some old bob dylan though annie knew virtually nothing about the musical tastes of fifteenyearold boys she was certain they didnt usually include bob dylan there was nothing by neil byrd again annie wished banks were here hed be able to read something into all this the last cd she had bought consisted of chants by tibetan monks to help with her yoga and meditation annie glanced at the contents of the bookcase a lot of novels including sons and lovers catcher in the rye and le grand meaulnes alongside the more traditional adolescent fare of philip pullman and short story collections by ray bradbury and h p lovecraft a number of poetry anthologies an oversize book on preraphaelite art and that was about it other than that the room revealed remarkably little there was no address book at least none that annie could find and not very much of anything except the books clothes and cds robin told her that luke carried a battered leather shoulder bag around with him wouldnt go anywhere without it and anything important to him would be in there including his ultralight laptop annie did find some printed manuscripts in a drawer short stories and poems the most recent of which was dated a year ago and she asked if she could borrow them to look at later she could tell that robin wasnt keen mostly it seemed for the sake of lukes precious privacy but again a little prodding in the right direction worked wonders she didnt think the creative work would tell her much anyway but it might give her some insight into lukes character there was nothing more to be gained from staying up there and the black walls were beginning to oppress her so she told robin she had finished they went back downstairs where martin armitage was still sitting on the sofa i understand you sent luke to eastvale comprehensive instead of a public school like braughtmore annie said we dont believe in public schools said martin his west yorkshire accent getting thicker as he spoke theyre just breeding grounds for effete civil servants theres nothing wrong with a comprehensiveschool education then he paused and smiled annie got the impression it was a gesture that had worked for him often with the media the sudden flow of charm turned on like an electric current well maybe theres a lot wrong with it at least thats what i keep hearing but it was good enough for me and its good enough for most kids lukes intelligent and hardworking hell do fine judging from her body language the folded arms and lips pressed together annie surmised that robin didnt agree that lukes education had been a matter of some heated discussion is he happy at school she asked hes never complained said martin no more than any kid would you know he doesnt like his geography teacher doesnt like games and algebras too hard that sort of thing hes not a sports fan unfortunately no said martin ive tried to get him interested but he shrugged what about the other boys at school even if he is as you say a bit of a loner he must have some contact with his classmates i suppose so but ive never seen any evidence of it hes never brought friends to the house never or asked permission to visit their houses no does he go out a lot no more than any other boy his age said martin maybe even less we want luke to have a normal life said robin its hard knowing what to allow and what not to its hard to know how much discipline to apply if you dont give enough then the child runs wild and the parents get the blame if you keep too strict control he doesnt develop naturally and he blames you for screwing him up we do our best to be good parents and strike a fair balance annie an outsider herself at school because she was brought up in an artists commune the hippie chick to the other kids understood just how alienated luke might feel not through any fault of his parents for a start they lived in an outoftheway place like swainsdale hall a grand place at that secondly they were minor celebrities and thirdly he sounded like an introverted personality anyway im sure you do she said what did he do yesterday she asked he went into the town center how did he get there bus theres a good service at least until after teatime did he have any particular reason to go to eastvale yesterday nothing in particular robin answered he just loves hunting for secondhand books and he wanted to look at some new computer stuff thats all as far as i know it was nothing out of the ordinary has he ever stopped out all night before no said robin putting her hand to her throat never thats why were so worried he wouldnt put us through this unless something something awfuls happened she started to cry and her husband held her smoothing her silky spungold hair there there darling dont worry theyll find him all the time his intense eyes were looking right at annie as if daring her to disagree not that she wanted to a man used to having his own way a man of action too annie had no doubt used to running ahead with the ball and slamming it into the back of the net what about the rest of the family uncles aunts grandparents she asked was he close to anybody in particular robins familys down in devon said martin my parents are dead but ive got a married sister living in dorset and a brother in cardiff of course we rang everyone we could think of but nobodys seen him did he have any money with him not much a few pounds look inspector he said i do appreciate your questions but youre on the wrong track luke has his mobile if he wanted to go somewhere or do something that meant he wouldnt be coming home or that hed be late then why wouldnt he give us a buzz unless it was something he didnt want you to know about but hes only fifteen said martin what on earth could he be up to thats so secret he wouldnt want his parents to know about it do you know where your children are do you know what your children are doing it was annies experience both through her own memories and as a policewoman that there was no one more secretive than an adolescent especially a sensitive lonely adolescent but lukes parents just didnt seem to get this hadnt they been through it themselves or had so much else happened since their own childhoods that they had forgotten what it was like there were any number of reasons why luke might have thought it necessary to go off for a while without telling his parents children are often selfish and inconsiderate but they couldnt seem to think of one still it wasnt the first time annie had come across such an astonishing gap between parental perception and reality more often than she would have expected she had found herself facing the parents of missing children who said they had simply no idea where young sally could have gone or why she would want to go off anywhere and cause them such pain have there ever been any threats against you she asked no said martin why do you ask celebrities often attract the wrong sort of attention martin snorted were hardly beckham and posh spice were not much in the public eye these days not for the past five years or so since we moved here we both keep a very low profile did it cross your mind that someone might have thought luke was worth kidnapping she asked despite what you think martin said were actually not all that wealthy he gestured around the house for a start it just eats up money wed be very poor marks for a kidnapper believe me the kidnapper might not know that robin and martin looked at each other finally robin spoke no i dont think so as i said we always wanted luke to have a normal life not like mine we didnt want him surrounded by bodyguards and security maybe it was foolish of us unrealistic but its worked until now nothing bad ever happened to him and im sure nothing has now said annie look i realize its probably second nature to you but if anyone from the press comes around asking questions dont worry said martin armitage theyll have me to deal with very good sir and just to be on the safe side do you think we could arrange to have any phone calls intercepted but why asked robin in case of ransom demands she put her hand to her cheek but surely you dont think its just a precaution its an unlisted number martin said even so he held annies gaze for a few beats before nodding very well if you must thank you sir ill arrange for the technician to drop by later this morning do you have a business office no said martin not at the moment you dont have a business number no he paused then went on as if hed sensed an implied slight in annies tone or manner look i might have been just a football player but that doesnt mean im thick you know i didnt i got my alevels went to leeds polytechnic as it was back then and got a business diploma so what did that make him annie wondered unimpressed the thinking womans crumpet i didnt mean to imply anything she went on im simply trying to make sure weve got every eventuality covered im sorry martin said its been a stressful night its just well being who we are robin and i get that sort of thing a lot people tend to patronize us i understand said annie standing up to leave i wont keep you any longer she passed her card over to robin who was closest my mobile numbers on there too she smiled and added when you can reach it cellphone coverage was spotty in the dales to say the least if you do hear anything at all you wont hesitate to call me will you no said robin of course not and if youll be the first to hear dont worry well be looking for him i can assure you were really very good at this sort of thing if theres anything i can do said martin of course annie gave them her best most confident smile and left not feeling confident at all chapter di michelle hart locked up her dark gray peugeot outside hazel crescent and took the measure of the neighborhood shed been there twice before once investigating a string of burglaries and another time because of vandalism as council estates went these days the hazels as the locals called it wasnt particularly bad built in the early sixties before the new town expansion its terraces of serviceable brick houses behind low walls and privet hedges were now home to a mixed crowd of unemployed people teenage mothers pensioners who couldnt afford to move and a growing asian population mostly from pakistan or bangladesh there were even a few asylum seekers like every other estate the hazels also had its share of shiftless hooligans who took their greatest pleasure in vandalizing other peoples property stealing cars and spraying graffiti over the walls it was still raining and there was no sign of any gaps in the gray cloud cover the drab street that curved through the heart of the estate was empty all the kids indoors playing computer games or surfing the web and their mothers wishing the sun would come out and bring a few moments peace and quiet michelle knocked on the dark green door mrs marshall a fraillooking woman stooped and grayhaired face lined with care answered and led her into a small living room and bade her sit on a plum velour armchair michelle had met the marshalls before during the identification process but hadnt yet visited them at home everything in the room was so tidy and spotless that she felt a momentary twinge of guilt over her own unwashed breakfast dishes unmade bed and the dust balls in the corner still who was there to see them but her bill marshall incapacitated by a stroke looked at michelle blanket over his knees walking stick by his side slackjawed a little drool collecting at the corner of his mouth one half of his face drooping lower than the other as if it had melted like a dali clock he had been a big man that much was obvious but now his body had withered with disease his eyes were alive though the whites a little cloudy but the gray irises intense and watchful michelle said hello to him and thought she saw his head move just a fraction in greeting though he couldnt speak mrs marshall had assured michelle that he could understand everything they said among the framed photographs on the mantelpiece above the electric fire one was of a young boy aged about thirteen or fourteen hair in a beatle cut popular in the early sixties wearing a black polo neck standing on a promenade with the sea in the background and a long pier off to one side he was a goodlooking kid michelle noticed perhaps a little feminine soft and delicate in his features but hed probably have grown up to be a real heartbreaker nonetheless mrs marshall noticed her looking yes thats our graham it was taken on the last holiday he had we couldnt go away that year bill had a big job to finish so the bankses took him to blackpool with them their lad alan was a good mate of his mr banks took that photo and gave it to us when they came back she paused no more than a week or so later and graham was gone forever he looks like a fine boy michelle said mrs marshall nodded and sniffed i dont want to bother you for long michelle began but as you can imagine finding your son after all this time has come as a bit of a shock to us too i need to ask a few more questions if thats all right youve got your job to do love dont worry about us we did our mourning years ago most of it anyhow she fingered the collar of her dress funny though how it all just seems like it happened only yesterday now youve found him i havent seen the reports yet but i understand there was a full investigation in when graham first disappeared oh yes and i cant fault them they did their best searched high and low jet harris himself was in charge you know at his wits end he was when all their efforts turned up nothing he even came to search our house for clues himself detective superintendent john harris nicknamed jet after both his speed and his resemblance to the shadows bass guitarist was still a legend around divisional headquarters even michelle had read the small biographical pamphlet published by one of the local bobbies with a literary bent and she had been impressed by it from his lowly birth in the glasgow slums in to his distinguished conduct medal with the royal naval commandos in the second world war his rise through the ranks to detective chief superintendent and his legendary retirement party in his framed photograph hung on the wall near the front entrance and his hallowed name was mentioned only with suitably hushed awe michelle could imagine how his failure to solve the graham marshall case must have galled him harris had a reputation not only for closing cases quickly but for hanging on and not letting go until he got a conviction since his death from cancer eight years ago he had become even more revered itll have been done properly then she said i dont know what to say sometimes one just slips through the cracks dont apologize love ive got no complaints they turned over every stone they could find but whod think to dig there eight miles away i mean they could hardly dig up the whole county could they i suppose not michelle agreed and there were those missing kids out manchester way mrs marshall went on what they later called the moors murders it wasnt until a couple of months after our graham disappeared though that brady and hindley got caught and then it was all over the news of course michelle knew about ian brady and myra hindley the moors murderers even though she had been only a child at the time as with jack the ripper reginald christie and the yorkshire ripper the horror of their acts was etched into the consciousness of future generations she hadnt realized though just how closely their crimes were linked chronologically with graham marshalls disappearance it might have been natural for detective superintendent harris at least to assume that grahams disappearance could somehow be linked with the victims of brady and hindley on the other hand peterborough was over a hundred and thirty miles from manchester and brady and hindley tended to stick to their own neck of the woods before michelle could formulate her next question another woman walked into the room she bore a strong facial resemblance to the boy in the photograph the same small straight nose oval chin and welldefined cheekbones only the feminine aspects were even more enhanced in her she wore her graystreaked hair long tied in a ponytail and was casually dressed in a dark blue tshirt and jeans she was a little too thin for comfort or perhaps michelle was jealous always feeling herself to be five or ten pounds overweight and the stress of recent events showed in her features as it did in mrs marshalls this is joan my daughter mrs marshall said michelle stood and shook joans limp hand she lives in folkestone teaches at a comprehensive school there mrs marshall added with obvious pride she was going on her holidays but when she heard well she wanted to be with us i understand said michelle were you and graham close joan as close as any brother and sister with two years between them can be in their teens said joan with a rueful smile she sat on the floor in front of the television and crossed her legs actually im not being fair graham wasnt like most other boys his age he even bought me presents he didnt tease me or torment me if anything he was very protective from what sorry what did he have to protect you from oh i didnt mean anything in particular you know just in general if anyone tried to bully me or anything like that boys well i was only twelve when he disappeared but yes there were a couple of overamorous local lads he sent packing was graham a tough lad not really said mrs marshall mind you he never backed away from a fight when we moved and he first went to school here there was a bit of bullying you know the way they always like to test the new kid but in his first week our graham took on the school bully he didnt win but he put up a good fight blacked an eye and bloodied a nose so nobody bothered him after that michelle was wondering how difficult it would be for someone to abduct and murder graham marshall if he could put up a good fight might it have taken two people might he have been drugged or knocked unconscious first or was it someone he knew and went with willingly you said you moved up here michelle went on would that be from the east end it still shows does it after all these years once a cockney always a cockney i suppose not that im ashamed of it yes we came from bethnal green we moved around a fair bit because of bills work hes a bricklayer or he was wed only been here a year or so when it happened graham had just finished third form at the local grammar school but you stayed on after yes there was plenty of work what with the new town business plenty of building and we like it here it suits us mrs marshall said michelle i know its a long time ago but can you tell me what sort of things graham was interested in interested in oh the usual boys stuff football cricket and pop music he was popmusic crazy weve still got his old guitar upstairs practiced chords for hours he did mind you he read a lot too graham was the sort of lad who could amuse himself he didnt always need someone to entertain him loved to read about space you know science fiction rockets to mars greeneyed monsters spacemad he was she looked at the photograph and a faraway expression came over her features just the day before he well there was some sort of rocket launch in america and he was so excited watching it on telly did he have many friends he made quite a few around here joan answered she looked at her mother who was there mum let me remember there was the banks lad of course they were very close and david grenfell and paul major and steven hill some others maybe but those five all lived on the estate so theyd walk to school together play cricket or football on the rec listen to music together swap records that sort of thing some of their parents still live here those who are still left alive that is was graham a popular boy id say so yes said mrs marshall he had an easygoing nature i cant see how he could possibly have offended anyone im not saying he was perfect mind you he was a normal teenage lad and he had his fair share of high spirits was he a bright lad he did well at school didnt he mum said joan yes hed have got to university easily just like his sister what did he want to be when he grew up an astronaut or a pop star but im sure he would have changed his mind about that he was good at physics and chemistry hed probably have made a good teacher she paused whats going to happen now if you dont mind me asking miss hart i mean it was all so long ago surely you dont think you can catch whoever did this not after all this time i dont know said michelle i certainly wouldnt want to make any rash promises but when something like this happens we do our best to go over the ground again and see if we can find something someone missed the first time around a fresh pair of eyes it works sometimes but if im to be completely honest with you id have to say well not be giving the case full priority in terms of manpower believe me love theres plenty of crime going on around here now without you police spending your time digging up the past as well she paused its just that well i think i would like to know even after all this time i thought about it a lot the other day when they came back with the dna results and said it definitely was our graham i thought id got resigned that wed never know but now well im not so sure i mean if you can just find out what happened to him and why she looked at her husband i know hed like his mind set at ease before well im sure you know what i mean michelle packed away her notebook in her briefcase yes i think i know what you mean she said and i promise ill do my best there is one question id like to ask said mrs marshall yes well you know the way things happened we never i mean our graham never had a proper funeral do you think we could do that you know the bones michelle thought for a moment we might need them for a few days longer she said for tests and suchlike but i dont see why not look ill talk to the forensic anthropologist im sure shell do her best to release the remains as soon as possible you are really oh thank you so very much miss hart you dont know how much it means to us do you have any children of your own michelle felt herself tense up the way she always did when people asked her that finally she got the words out no no i dont mrs marshall saw her to the door if theres anything more i can tell you she said please dont hesitate to ask i wont said michelle thank you and she walked down the path in the rain to her car taking deep breaths shaken flooded with memories shed been blocking out memories of melissa and of ted now graham marshall was more to her than just a pile of bones on a steel table he was a bright easygoing lad with a beatle haircut who wanted to be an astronaut or a pop star if only she could figure out where to begin banks met annie at the woolpack a quiet pub in the tiny village of maltham about halfway between gratly and harksmere on his way home from manchester airport he had debated whether to call her and he decided in the end it would be a good idea he wanted to talk to someone about what he had just learned and annie was the only person he had told about the incident with the pervert down by the river it shocked him to realize that he hadnt even told his exwife sandra though they had been married for over twenty years it was drizzling when he pulled up in the market square car park shortly before nine oclock annies purple astra was nowhere in sight he obeyed the sign and stepped on the disinfectant pad before entering the pub though there hadnt been an outbreak near maltham itself incidences of footandmouth disease had occurred in some of the surrounding areas and as a consequence strict sometimes unpopular measures had been brought in by the ministry many footpaths had been closed and access to the countryside limited also as local farmers used the village pubs and shops many of the owners had placed disinfectant mats on their doorsteps maltham itself wasnt much of a place though it did have a fine norman church and the woolpack was one of those pubs that did good business mostly by virtue of its being on a busy road between tourist destinations that meant most of the trade was transient and during the day so the few grizzled locals who stood around the bar turned as one and gawped when banks entered they did that every time one of them must have recognized him and said something because in no time at all they turned back to their pints and ignored him banks bought a pint of black sheep bitter and a packet of cheese and onion crisps and sat down near the door as far from the bar as he could get a couple of the other tables were taken tourists renting local cottages by the looks of them poor sods theyd be going out of their minds with no footpaths to walk christ it was a long way from greece banks thought hard to believe that at this time just two nights ago he had been drinking ouzo and nibbling dolmades with alex in philippes taverna they had drunk well into the small hours knowing it was to be their last evening together telling stories and soaking up the scented warmth of the air and the rhythm of the sea lapping at the quayside beside them in the morning banks had looked for alex by the harbor to say goodbye as he caught the early ferry to piraeus but his friend was nowhere to be seen probably nursing his hangover banks had thought aware of the pounding in his own head the door opened the men gawped again with a bit more interest this time and annie entered in tight jeans and a light blue sleeveless top bag slung over her shoulder she pecked banks on the cheek and sat down smelling her delicate grapefruitscented shampoo and soap and aware of the vague outlines of her nipples under the thin cotton banks felt a momentary rush of desire for her but he held himself in check that part of their relationship was over they had moved on to something different instead he went back to the bar and bought her a pint look at that tan annie said when he sat down again her laugh lines crinkling its all right for some im sure youll manage a week in blackpool before summers over said banks dancing to the wurlitzer in the tower ballroom donkey rides on the beach in the rain candy floss on the prom and a kissmequick hat i can hardly wait she leaned over and patted his arm it is good to see you again alan you too so come on then tell how was greece magnificent magical paradisiacal then what the bloody hell are you doing back in yorkshire you were hardly forthcoming on the phone years of practice annie leaned back in her chair and stretched out her legs the way she did crossing them at the slender ankles where the thin gold chain hung sipped some beer and almost purred banks had never met anyone else who could look so comfortable and at home in a hard chair anyway she said youre looking well less stressed even half a holiday seems to have had some effect banks considered for a moment and decided that he did feel much better than he had when he had left it helped put things in perspective he said and you swimmingly thriving the jobs going well im getting back into yoga and meditation and ive been doing some painting again i kept you away from all that annie laughed well its not as if you twisted my arm but when youve got as little time as people in our line of work have then something has to go by the wayside banks was about to make a sarcastic reference to that something being him this time but he bit his tongue he wouldnt have done that two weeks ago the holiday really must have done him good well he said im glad youre happy i mean it annie annie touched his hand i know you do now what brings you back here in such a hurry i hope its not serious it is in a way banks lit a cigarette and went on to explain about the discovery of graham marshalls bones annie listened frowning when banks had finished she said i can understand why youre concerned but what can you do i dont know banks said maybe nothing if i were the local police i wouldnt want me sticking my nose in but when i heard i just felt i dont know it was a big part of my adolescence annie graham just disappearing like that and i suppose its a big part of me now always has been i cant explain but there it is i told you about the man by the river the one who tried to push me in yes if it was him then maybe i can help them find him if hes still alive i can remember what he looked like odds are there could be a photo on file and if it wasnt him is that it is this the guilt you talked about before partly said banks i should have spoken up but its more than that even if its nothing to do with the man by the river someone killed graham and buried his body maybe i can remember something maybe there was something i missed at the time being just a kid myself if i can cast my mind back another annie looked at her glass half full and she was driving no she said not for me dont worry said banks catching her anxious glance as he went to the bar thisll be my last for the evening so when are you going down there annie asked when he came back first thing tomorrow morning and youre going to do what exactly present yourself at the local nick and offer to help them solve their case something like that i havent thought it out yet itll hardly be high priority with the locals anyway surely theyll be interested in someone who was around at the time they interviewed me back then you know i remember it clearly well you said yourself they wont exactly welcome you with open arms not if you go as a copper trying to tell them how to do their jobs ill practice humility annie laughed youd better be careful she said they might have you down as a suspect it wouldnt surprise me anyway its a pity youre not sticking around we might be able to use your help up here oh whats on missing kid another this one disappeared a bit more recently than your friend graham boy or girl does it matter you know it does annie far more girls are abducted raped and killed than boys a boy how old fifteen that was almost grahams age when he disappeared banks thought then the odds are good hell turn up none the worse for wear he said though graham hadnt thats what i told the parents banks sipped his beer there were some compensations to being back in yorkshire he thought looking around the quiet cozy pub hearing the rain patter on the windows tasting the black sheep and watching annie shift in her chair as she tried to phrase her concerns hes an odd kid she said bit of a loner writes poetry doesnt like sports his room is painted black what were the circumstances annie told him and theres another thing what hes luke armitage robins boy neil byrds son martin armitages stepson do you know him martin armitage hardly saw him play once or twice though i must say i thought he was overrated but ive got a couple of cds by neil byrd they did a compilation three or four years ago and theyve just brought out a collection of outtakes and live performances he really was very good you know did you meet the supermodel robin yes quite the looker as i remember still is said annie scowling if you like that sort of thing what sort of thing oh you know skinny flawless beautiful banks grinned so whats the problem oh nothing its just me hell probably turn up safe and sound but youre worried just a teeny bit kidnapping it crossed my mind but theres been no ransom demand yet we searched the house of course just in case but there was no sign hed been back home we did talk to the armitages about security when they first moved to swainsdale hall you know banks said they installed the usual burglar alarms and such but beyond that they said they just wanted to live a normal life nothing much we could do i suppose not annie agreed she brought out her notebook and showed banks the french words she had copied down from lukes wall make any sense of this its awfully familiar but i cant put my finger on it banks frowned as he peered at the text it looked familiar to him too but he couldnt place it either le poëte se fait voyant par un long immense et raisonné dérèglement de tous les sens he tried to decipher it word by word reaching far back into his memory for his grammar school french hard to believe now that he had been quite good at it at one time even got a grade two in his olevels then he remembered its rimbaud i think the french poet something about the total disordering of all the senses of course said annie i could kick myself robin armitage told me luke was into rimbaud baudelaire and verlaine and all that stuff what about these she named the subjects of lukes posters i mean ive heard of some of them nick drake for example and i know kurt cobain was in nirvana and killed himself but what about the others banks frowned theyre all singers ian curtis used to sing with joy division jeff buckley was tim buckleys son used to was theres an ominous past tense to all this isnt there oh yes said banks they all either committed suicide or died under mysterious circumstances interesting annies mobile buzzed excusing herself she walked over to the front door before taking it out of her shoulder bag and stepping outside when she came back two minutes later she looked puzzled not bad news i hope said banks no not at all quite the opposite do tell that was robin robin armitage apparently luke just rang them and he says he just needed some space that hell be back home tomorrow did he say where he was wouldnt tell them what are you going to do annie finished her drink i think id better go down the station scale down the manhunt you know how expensive these things are i dont want red ron on my back for wasting our time and money scale down yes call me overly suspicious if you like but im not going to call off the search completely until i see luke armitage safe and sound at home with my own eyes i wouldnt call that overly suspicious said banks id call it very sensible annie leaned forward and pecked banks on the cheek again it really is good to see you again alan stay in touch i will said banks and he watched her walk out the door hint of body shop grapefruit soap wafting behind her the soft pressure of her kiss lingering on his cheek chapter on the surface it had seemed a simple enough question to ask where were the graham marshall case files in reality it was like searching for the holy grail and it had taken michelle and her dc nat collins the best part of two days after first trying bridge street in the city center which served as divisional headquarters until thorpe wood opened in michelle and dc collins drove from station to station all across the northern division bretton orton werrington yaxley hampton discovering that some of them were relatively new and that the premises used in had long since been demolished and covered over by new housing estates or shopping centers what complicated matters even more was that the original forces cambridge peterborough ely and huntingdon had amalgamated into the midanglia constabulary in necessitating a major overhaul and restructuring and had become the presentday cambridgeshire constabulary in as one helpful duty constable after another suggested possibilities michelle had begun to despair of ever finding the old paperwork about the only bright spot on the horizon was that the weather had improved that morning and the sun was poking its lazy way through greasy rags of cloud but that made the air humid and michelle was about to throw in the towel around lunchtime shed drunk a bit too much wine the previous evening too something that was happening rather too often these days and the fact that she didnt feel a hundred percent didnt help much either when she finally did track the paperwork down having sent dc collins to cambridge to make inquiries there she could have kicked herself it was deep in the bowels of divisional headquarters not more than thirty feet or so below her office and the civilian records clerk mrs metcalfe proved to be a mine of information and let her sign out a couple of files why hadnt michelle thought to look there in the first place easy she had only been at thorpe wood for a short time and no one had given her the grand tour she didnt know that the basement was the repository for much of the county forces old paperwork the noise level was high in the openplan squad room phones ringing men laughing at dirty jokes doors opening and closing but michelle was able to shut it all out as she put on her reading glasses and opened the first folder which contained maps and photos of the hazels estate along with a summary of any relevant witness statements that helped pin down grahams progress on the morning of august one useful handdrawn map showed grahams paper round in detail listing all the houses he delivered to and for good measure what newspapers they took the poor lad must have had a hell of a heavy load as many of the sunday papers were bulky with magazines and supplements at the eastern end of the estate wilmer road separated the hazels from an area of older houses soon to be demolished it was at the tjunction between wilmer and hazel crescent that graham had delivered his last newspaper a news of the world to mr and mrs halloran who lived in the corner house the next delivery was supposed to be to one of the houses across the road but the lintons there said they never received their observer that day nobody else on the other side of wilmer road received a newspaper that morning either the anonymous mapmaker had also calculated that it would have been around am when graham who started at am got to that part of his round daylight at that time of year but still very early in the morning for any sort of traffic including pedestrian it was a sunday after all the traditional morning for a liein after the excesses of saturday night and most of the customers said they were still in bed when their papers arrived michelle looked at the old blackandwhite photos they depicted a very different scene from the one she had visited yesterday after she had talked to the marshalls in across wilmer road there had been a grim row of old shops all boarded up and ready for demolition but today a modern diy center stood next to the new estate which had replaced the old houses the derelict shops looked like just the sort of place a kid might want to explore michelle checked the file to see if they had been searched of course they had dogs brought in too not a trace michelle tucked some strands of blond hair which had been tickling her cheek behind her ears and chewed at the end of her pen as she read over transcripts of the initial interviews nearly everything was typed of course except some of the documents that were handwritten and the results looked strange with the uneven pressure of the keys and the occasional blob of a deformed e or g such distinguishing features used to be very handy for identifying which machine a note had been typed on michelle reflected before the anonymity of laser printers some of the papers were carbon copies faint and often hard to read occasionally illegible amendments had been made in pen or pencil between the lines the original words scratched out all in all not a promising start detective superintendent benjamin shaw now one of the senior officers at thorpe wood was named once or twice as a detective constable on the case michelle knew that shaw had started his career in peterborough and had recently returned from six years with the lincolnshire constabulary but it still surprised her to see his name in connection with something that happened so long ago maybe she could have a word with him see if he had any theories that hadnt made it into the files it seemed that the first person to miss graham marshall was his employer donald bradford owner of the newsagents shop bradford lived some distance away from the shop and employed a local woman to open up not arriving himself until eight oclock according to bradfords statement when graham hadnt returned by eightfifteen that sunday half an hour late for his second round on a neighboring estate bradford drove around the wilmer road estate in search of him he found nothing whatever had happened to graham his papers and his canvas bag were missing too michelle was willing to bet that some of those scraps of cloth found with the bones came from grahams newspaper sack after that donald bradford called at grahams house to see if the lad had become ill and hurried home without stopping to report in he hadnt grahams parents now also worried searched the estate for their son and found nothing with news of the manchester child abductions still fresh in the public eye both bradford and the marshalls were soon concerned enough to call in the police and a short while after that the official investigation began preliminary inquiries were carried out in the immediate area and detective superintendent harris was put in charge first thing the following day when still no trace had been found of graham and the cumbersome but efficient mechanics of a police investigation groaned into action michelle stretched and tried to work out a crick in her neck without success it was hot in the office and her tights were killing her dc collins just back from cambridge took pity on her and said im just off to the canteen mam bring you anything id love a diet coke please said michelle and maybe a slice of chocolate gâteau if theyve got any left she reached for her handbag its all right said collins pay me when i get back michelle thanked him adjusted her tights as discreetly as possible below her desk and turned back to the files as far as she could gather from a cursory glance there hadnt been any leads at all police had interviewed everyone on grahams round along with all his friends family and schoolteachers none of it led anywhere graham was described among other things as being bright cheeky quiet polite rude sweetnatured foulmouthed talented and secretive which pretty much covered every eventuality nobody on wilmer road had seen or heard anything unusual that morning no screams shouts or sounds of a struggle though one person said he had heard a car door bang around half past six there were no convenient dog walkers and even the most devout of churchgoers being for the most part methodists or low anglican were still in the land of nod all the evidence especially the missing paper sack suggested that graham had most likely got in a car willingly with someone he knew someone local but who and why dc collins returned with michelles diet coke no gâteau im afraid he said so i brought you a danish instead thanks said michelle who didnt like danish but paid him anyway nibbled at it awhile then dropped the rest in her waste bin and went back to her files the coke tin was cold and wet so she pressed it against her flushed cheek and enjoyed the icy sensation then she did the same with her other cheek and her forehead the police at the time didnt neglect the possibility that graham might have run away under his own steam dumping the sack of papers somewhere and heading for the bright lights of london like so many young lads had in the midsixties but they could find nothing at all to support this theory his home life seemed happy enough and none of his friends suggested that he was at all interested in running away from home the sack was never found either even so missing persons reports went out all over the country and there were the usual sightings none of which amounted to anything the interviews also turned up nothing and police checks into the records of several estate dwellers drew a blank michelle could read a little excitement between the lines when police discovered that one of the deliveries on grahams route was the house of a man who had served time for exposing himself in a local park but subsequent interviews no doubt involving some very rough business knowing police methods of the time and jet harriss reputation as a tough guy led nowhere and the man was exonerated michelle slipped off her reading glasses and rubbed her tired eyes at first glance she had to admit that it seemed very much as if graham marshall had disappeared into the void but she knew one thing that the police hadnt known in she had seen his bones and she knew that graham had been murdered annie cabbot drove out to swainsdale hall midmorning to tie up a few loose ends with the armitages the sun had come to the yorkshire dales at last and wraiths of mist rose from the roadsides and the fields that stretched up the dalesides the grass was bright green after so much rain and the limestone walls and buildings shone clean gray the view from the front of swainsdale hall was magnificent and annie could see plenty of blue sky beyond fremlington edge with only a few light fluffy clouds scudding by on the breeze the armitages must be relieved annie thought as she got out of her car of course they would be happier when luke arrived back home but at least they knew he was safe josie answered the door and seemed surprised to see her there was no sign of miata this time but annie could hear the dog barking from the back of the house sorry i didnt phone ahead annie said are they in josie stood aside and let annie walk through to the same large living room she had been in yesterday only robin armitage was there this time sitting on the sofa flipping through a copy of vogue she jumped to her feet when annie entered and smoothed down her skirt its you again whats happened is something wrong calm down mrs armitage said annie nothings happened i came to see if youre all right all right of course i am why shouldnt i be lukes coming home may i sit down please annie sat but robin armitage stayed on her feet pacing id have thought youd be relieved annie said i am said robin of course i am its just that well ill be a lot more settled when lukes back home again im sure you understand have you heard from him again no only the once and he definitely said hes coming home today yes id like to talk to him when he gets back if thats all right certainly but why we like to follow up on these matters just routine robin stood up and folded her arms making it clear that she wanted annie to leave ill let you know the minute hes back annie remained seated mrs armitage you told me yesterday that luke said he needed some space do you know why why yes you told me hes a normal teenager and theres nothing wrong in the family so why would he run off like that worry the two of you half to death i hardly think thats relevant now do you detective inspector cabbot annie turned to see martin armitage standing in the doorway briefcase in hand why are you here what is it despite his commanding presence he seemed edgy to annie like his wife shifting his weight from foot to foot as he stood there as if he had to go to the toilet nothing she said just a friendly visit i see well thank you for your efforts and your concern we really do appreciate it but i can see no point in your coming and badgering us with more questions now that lukes safe and sound can you interesting choice of words badgering annie thought most families wouldnt see it that way not with their son missing he glanced at his watch anyway im afraid i have to hurry off to a business meeting its been nice to see you again inspector and thank you again yes thank you echoed robin dismissed annie knew when she was beaten i was just leaving she said i only wanted to make sure everything was okay i didnt mean to cause offense well as you can see said martin everythings fine luke will be back home this evening and it will be as if none of this ever happened annie smiled well dont be too hard on him martin managed a tight smile which didnt reach his eyes i was young once myself i know what its like oh just one more thing annie paused in the doorway yes you said luke rang you last night yes and immediately afterward my wife rang you annie glanced at robin then back at martin yes i appreciate that she said but im wondering why lukes call wasnt intercepted after all the technician had set everything up and we picked up your wifes call to me thats easy said martin he called me on my mobile did he usually do that we were supposed to be going out for dinner martin explained as it was we ended up canceling but luke wasnt to know that ah i see said annie problem solved goodbye then they both bade her a perfunctory goodbye and she left at the end of the drive she turned right toward relton and parked in layby just around the corner from the armitages drive where she took out her mobile and discovered that there was indeed a signal in the area so martin armitage hadnt been lying about that what was it then that had given her the unmistakable feeling that something was wrong annie sat for a moment in her car trying to figure out the meaning of the tension she had sensed in the room not just between her and robin but between robin and martin something was going on annie only wished she knew what neither robin nor martin had behaved like a couple who had just heard that the son whose life they feared for was now safe and would soon be home when martin armitages beemer shot out of the driveway spraying gravel a minute or two later annie had an idea it was rare that she got to think or act spontaneously as so much police work was governed by procedure rules and regulations but annie was feeling reckless this morning and the situation called for some initiative on her part as far as she knew martin armitage had no idea what make or color car she drove so he would hardly be suspicious that a purple astra was following him at a respectable distance as banks drove down the a and entered the landscape of bright new shopping centers electronics warehouses and housing estates that had replaced the old coal mines pitwheels and slag heaps of west yorkshire he thought about the way the country had changed since grahams disappearance winston churchills funeral the wilson era the end of capital punishment the kray trial carnaby street the moors murders the first us space walk help mods and rockers it was a time of possibility of hope for the future the fulcrum of the sixties only weeks after graham disappeared the sexy leatherclad emma peel debuted in the avengers jeremy sandfords documentarystyle tv play about a homeless mother and her children cathy come home caused a major stir and the who were singing about my generation soon young people were taking to the streets to protest against war famine and anything else they could think of shouting make love not war smoking dope and dropping acid everything seemed on the verge of blossoming into some new sort of order and graham who had seemed so forwardlooking so cool in so many ways should have been there to see it but he wasnt and what came between then and blairs britain mostly margaret thatcher who dismantled the countrys manufacturing base emasculated the trade unions and demoralized the workingman leaving the north especially a ghost land of empty factories thrift shops and decaying council estates where those growing up had no hope of a job in their idleness and hopelessness many turned to crime and vandalism car theft became commonplace and the police became the enemy of the people today without doubt it was a softer easier more middleoftheroad britain and a much more american one with mcdonalds pizza huts and shopping malls springing up all over the place most people seemed to have what they wanted but what they wanted was mostly of a material nature a new car a dvd player a pair of nike trainers and people were being mugged even murdered for their mobile phones but were things so very different back in the midsixties banks asked himself wasnt consumerism just as rife back then that monday evening in august when the knock came at their door the banks family was settling down to watch coronation street on their brandnew television set bought on hire purchase just the previous week bankss father was in work then at the sheetmetal factory and if anyone had predicted that he would be made redundant seventeen years later hed have laughed in their face coronation street was one of those rituals every monday and wednesday when tea over dishes washed and put away homework and odd jobs done the family sat down to watch television together so it was an unexpected disruption when someone knocked at the door no one ever did that as far as the bankses were concerned everyone on the street everyone they knew at any rate watched coronation street and would no more think of interrupting that than well ida banks was lost for words arthur banks answered the door prepared to send the commercial traveler and his suitcase of goods packing the one thing that entered nobodys mind when he did this because it was such a disturbance of the normal routine was that joey bankss pet budgie was out of his cage having his evening constitutional and when arthur banks opened the front door to admit the two detectives he left the living room door open too joey seized the moment and flew away no doubt he thought he was flying to the freedom of the open sky but banks knew even at his young age that such a pretty colored thing wouldnt survive a day among the winged predators out there when they realized what had happened everyone dashed out in the garden looking to see where he had gone but there wasnt a trace joey had vanished never to return more of a fuss might have been made over joeys escape had the new visitors not become the center of everyones awed attention they were the first plainclothes policemen ever to enter the banks household and even young banks himself forgot about joey for the time being looking back now it seemed like some sort of ill omen to him but at the time he hadnt seen any significance beyond the simple loss of a pet both men wore suits and ties banks remembered but no hats one of them the one who did most of the talking was about the same age as his father with slickedback dark hair a long nose a general air of benevolence and a twinkle in his eye the sort of kindly uncle who might slip you half a crown to go to the pictures and wink as he gave it to you the other one was younger and more nondescript banks couldnt remember much about him at all except that he had ginger hair freckles and stickingout ears banks couldnt remember their names if he had ever known them bankss father turned off the television set nineyearold roy just sat and gawped at the men neither detective apologized for disturbing the family they sat but didnt relax remaining perched on the edges of their chairs as the kindly uncle asked his questions and the other took notes banks couldnt remember the exact wording after so many years but imagined it went along the following lines you know why were here dont you its about graham isnt it yes you were a friend of his right yes do you have any idea where he might have gone no when did you see him last saturday afternoon did he say or do anything unusual no what did you do went shopping in town whatd you buy just some records what sort of a mood was graham in just ordinary was anything bothering him he was just like normal did he ever talk about running away from home no any idea where he might go if he did run away did he talk about any particular places no but he was from london i mean his parents brought him up from london last year we know that we were just wondering if there was anywhere else he talked about i dont think so what about secret hiding places the detective winked i know all lads have secret places no banks was unwilling to tell them about the big tree in the park holly he thought it was with prickly leaves and branches right down to the ground if you made your way through them you ended up hidden inside between the thick leaves and the trunk like being in a teepee he knew graham was missing and it was important but he wasnt going to give away the gangs secrets he would look in the tree himself later and make sure graham wasnt there did graham have any problems you were aware of was he upset about anything no school were on holiday i know that but i mean in general it was a new school for him wasnt it hed only been there one year did he have any problems with the other boys no not really he had a fight with mick slack but hes just a bully he picks fights with all the new kids thats all yes have you seen any strange men hanging around the area lately no banks probably blushed as he lied he certainly felt his cheeks burning nobody no did graham ever mention anyone bothering him no all right then son thats it for now but if you can think of anything at all you know where the police station is dont you yes and im sorry about your budgie really i am thank you they seemed all set to go then and got to their feet just before they left they asked roy and bankss parents a few general questions and that was it when they shut the door everyone was quiet there were still ten minutes of coronation street left but nobody thought of switching on the television set again banks remembered turning to joeys empty cage and feeling the tears gather in his eyes annie waited until martin armitages beemer had got a respectable distance ahead then let a local delivery van get between them before she started to follow the roads were quiet at that time in the morning they were quiet most of the time if truth be told so she couldnt appear too conspicuous at the village of relton he turned right and followed the broad that ran about halfway up the valley side they passed through tiny mortsett which didnt even have a pub or a general store and annie got stuck when the delivery van stopped to make a call at one of the cottages the road wasnt wide enough for her to pass she got out and prepared to show her warrant card and ask the driver to get out of the way there was a passing area about twenty yards farther along when she noticed armitage pull over and stop about half a mile beyond the village she had a clear view of the open road so she brought out the binoculars she kept in her glove compartment and watched him armitage got out of the car with his briefcase looked around and started walking over the grass toward a squat stone shepherds shelter about eighty yards off the road up the daleside and she didnt think he was nervous because he was breaking the government footandmouth regulations when he got there he ducked inside the shelter and when he came out he wasnt carrying his briefcase annie watched him walk back to his car he stumbled once over the uneven ground then glanced around again and drove off in the direction of gratly birds is it a voice asked disturbing annies concentration what she turned to face the deliveryman a brash gelhaired youngster with bad teeth the binoculars he said birdwatching cant understand it myself boring now when it comes to the other sort of birds annie flipped him her warrant card and said move your van out of the way and let me pass all right all right he said no need to get shirty theres no one home anyway never is in this bloody godforsaken hole he drove off and annie got back in her car armitage was long gone by the time she reached the spot where he had stopped and there were no other cars in sight save the delivery van fast disappearing ahead annie was the one who felt nervous now was someone watching her with binoculars the way she had watched armitage she hoped not if this was what she thought it was it wouldnt do to reveal police interest the air was still and mild and annie could smell warm grass after rain somewhere in the distance a tractor chugged across a field and sheep baaed from the daleside as she ignored the posted warnings and made her way to the shelter the place smelled musty and acrid inside enough light spilled through the gaps in the drystone for her to see the used condom on the dirt empty cigarette packet and crushed lager cans a local lads idea of showing his girlfriend a good time no doubt she could also see the briefcase the inexpensive nylon kind annie picked it up it felt heavy she opened the velcro strips and inside as she had expected found stacks of money mostly ten and twentypound notes she had no idea exactly how much there was but guessed it must be somewhere in the region of ten or fifteen thousand pounds she put the briefcase back where it was and returned to her car she couldnt just sit there by the roadside waiting for something to happen but she couldnt very well leave the scene either in the end she drove back to mortsett and parked there was no police station in the tiny hamlet and she knew it would be no use trying to use her uhf hand radio behind so many hills and at such a distance besides it only had a range of a couple of miles she was driving her own car as she often did and she hadnt got around to having the more powerful vhf radio installed it hardly seemed necessary as she wasnt a patrol officer and more often than not she simply used the car to drive to work and back and perhaps to interview witnesses as she had done that morning before she headed out on foot to find a good spot from which to watch the shelter without being seen annie picked up her mobile to ring the station and let detective superintendent gristhorpe know what was going on and wouldnt you know it the damn mobile didnt work out of cell range bloody typical she should have known she was quite close to gratly where banks lived and her mobile didnt work there either there was an old red telephone box in the village but the phone had been vandalized the wires torn from the cash box damn unwilling to take her eyes off the shelter for too long annie knocked on some doors but the van driver had been right nobody seemed to be home and the one old lady who did answer said she didnt have a telephone annie cursed under her breath it looked as if she was on her own for the time being she couldnt leave the shelter unwatched and she had no idea how long she would have to stay out there the sooner she found a good vantage point the better still she thought turning toward the hillside it served her bloody well right for not calling in before she followed armitage so much for initiative chapter nick lowes the convincer ended and banks slipped in david grays white ladder as he approached the turnoff to peterborough he wondered what to do first he had rung his parents to let them know he was coming of course so perhaps he should go straight there on the other hand he was closer to police hq and the sooner he introduced himself to detective inspector michelle hart the better so he headed for the police station in its idyllic setting just off the nene parkway between the nature reserve and the golf course in the reception area he asked to speak to the detective in charge of the graham marshall investigation introducing himself only as alan banks a childhood friend he didnt want to appear to be pulling rank or even introduce himself as a fellow copper at least not at first not until he saw which way the wind was blowing besides just out of curiosity he wanted to know how they treated an ordinary member of the public who came forward with information it would do no harm to play a bit of a game after he had been waiting about ten minutes a young woman opened the locked door that led to the main part of the station and beckoned him inside conservatively dressed in a navyblue suit skirt below the knees and a buttondown white blouse she was petite and slim with shoulderlength blond hair parted in the middle and tucked behind her small delicate ears she had a jagged fringe that came almost down to her eyes which were a startling green a color banks remembered seeing somewhere in the sea near greece her mouth was slightly downturned at the edges which made her look a bit sad and she had a small straight nose all in all she was a very attractive woman banks thought but he sensed a severity and a reserve in her a definite no entry sign and there was no mistaking the lines that suffering had etched around her haunting and haunted eyes mr banks she said raising her eyebrows banks stood up yes im detective inspector hart please follow me she led him to an interview room it felt very strange being on the receiving end banks thought and he got an inkling of the discomfort some of his interviewees must have felt he looked around though it was a different county the basics were still the same as every interview room he had ever seen table and chairs bolted to the floor high window covered by a grille institutional green paint on the walls and that unforgettable smell of fear there was nothing to worry about of course but banks couldnt help feeling just a little nervous as di hart put on her silverrimmed oval reading glasses and shuffled the papers around in front of her as he had done many times himself to draw out the tension and cause anxiety in the person sitting opposite it touched the raw nerve of his childhood fear of authority even though he knew he was authority himself now banks had always been aware of that irony but a situation like this one really brought it home he also felt that di hart didnt need to act this way with him that she was putting on too much of a show his fault perhaps for not saying who he was but even so it was a bit heavyhanded to talk to him in an official interview room he had come in voluntarily and he was neither a witness nor a suspect she could have found an empty office and sent for coffee but what would he have done the same probably it was the us and them mentality and in her mind he was a civilian them di hart stopped playing with her papers and broke the silence so you say you can help with the graham marshall investigation perhaps said banks i knew him have you any idea at all what might have happened to him im afraid not said banks he had intended to tell her everything but found it wasnt as easy as that not yet we just hung around together what was he like graham its hard to say said banks i mean you dont think about things like that when youre kids do you try now he was deep i think quiet at any rate most kids joked around did stupid stuff but graham was always more serious more reserved banks remembered the small almost secret smile as graham had watched others act out comic routines as if he didnt find them funny but knew he had to smile you never felt you were fully privy to what was going on in his mind he added you mean he kept secrets dont we all what were his they wouldnt have been secrets if i knew them would they im just trying to give you some sense of what he was like there was a secretive side to his nature go on she was becoming edgy banks thought rough day probably and not enough help we did all the usual stuff together played football and cricket listened to music talked about our favorite tv shows what about girlfriends graham was a goodlooking kid the girls liked him and he liked them but i dont think he had anyone steady what kind of mischief did he get up to well i wouldnt want to incriminate myself but we broke a window or two did a bit of shoplifting played truant and we smoked cigarettes behind the cycle sheds at school pretty much normal stuff for teenagers back then we didnt break into anyones home steal cars or mug old ladies drugs this was for crying out loud drugs were around back then how would you know you probably werent even born michelle reddened i know king harold got an arrow in his eye at the battle of hastings in and i wasnt born then okay point taken but drugs not us at any rate cigarettes were about the worst we did back then drugs may have been increasingly popular with the younger generation in london but not with fourteenyearold kids in a provincial backwater look i should probably have done this before but he reached into his inside pocket and took out his warrant card laying it on the desk in front of her michelle looked at it a minute picked it up and looked more closely then slid it back across the desk to banks she took off her reading glasses and set them on the table prick she whispered come again you heard me why didnt you tell me from the start you were a dci instead of playing games and stringing me along making me feel like a complete fool because i didnt want to give the impression i was trying to interfere im simply here as someone who knew graham besides why did you have to come on so heavyhanded i came here to volunteer information there was no need to put me in an interview room and use the same tactics you use on a suspect im surprised you didnt leave me here alone to stew for an hour youre making me wish i had they glared at each other in silence for a few moments then banks said look im sorry i had no intention of making you feel foolish and you dont need to why should you its true that i knew graham we were close friends at school we lived on the same street but this isnt my case and i dont want you to think im pushing my nose in or anything thats why i didnt announce myself at first im sorry youre right i should have told you i was on the job right from the start okay michelle gazed at him through narrowed eyes for a while then twitched the corners of her lips in a brief smile and nodded your name came up when i was talking to his parents i would have got in touch eventually the powers that be not exactly overwhelming you with assistance on this one then michelle snorted you could say that one dc its not a high priority case and im the new kid on the block new girl i know what you mean banks said he remembered first meeting annie cabbot when she was put out to pasture at harkside and he was in outer siberia back in eastvale that hadnt been a high priority case to start with either but it had turned into one he could sympathize with di hart anyway she went on i didnt know you were a copper i suppose i should call you sir rank and all not necessary im not one to stand on ceremony besides im on your patch here youre the boss i do have a suggestion though oh banks looked at his watch its one oclock i drove down from eastvale this morning without stopping and i havent had a thing to eat why dont we get out of this depressing room and talk about graham over lunch ill pay michelle raised on eyebrow you asking me out to lunch to discuss the case over lunch yes dammit im hungry know any decent pubs around here she gazed at him again apparently appraising him for any imminent risk he might pose to her when she couldnt seem to think of anything she said okay i know a place come on but im paying my own way what a stupid bloody decision it had been to take to the high ground annie cabbot thought as she trudged illegally up the footpath trying to avoid the little clusters of sheep droppings that seemed to be everywhere and failing as often as not her legs ached and she was panting with effort even though she thought of herself as pretty fit she wasnt dressed for a walk in the country either knowing she was visiting the armitages again that morning she had dressed in a skirt and blouse she was even wearing tights not to mention the navy pumps that were crippling her it was a hot day and she could feel the sweat trickling along every available channel stray tresses of hair stuck to her cheeks and forehead as she climbed she kept glancing behind at the shepherds shelter but nobody approached it she could only hope that she hadnt been spotted that the kidnapper if that was what this was all about wasnt watching her through binoculars from a comfortable distance she found a spot she thought would do it was a gentle dip in the daleside a few yards off the footpath from there she could lie on her stomach and keep a close eye on the shelter without being seen from below annie felt the warm damp grass against her body smelled its sweetness as she lay flat on her stomach binoculars in hand it felt good and she wanted to take off all her clothes feel the sun and earth on her bare skin but she told herself not to be such a bloody fool and get on with the job she compromised by taking off her jacket the sun beat down on the back of her head and her shoulders she had no suntan lotion with her so she put the jacket over the back of her neck even though it felt too hot better than getting sunstroke when she had got settled there she lay waiting watching thoughts drifted through her head the way they did when she settled down to meditation and she tried to practice the same technique of letting them go without dwelling on them it started as a sort of free association then went way beyond sunlight warmth skin pigment her father banks music luke armitages black room dead singers secrets kidnapping murder flies buzzed around her snapping her out of the chain of association she waved them away at one point she felt a beetle or some insect creeping down the front of her bra and almost panicked but she managed to get it off her before it got too far a couple of curious rabbits approached twitched their noses and turned away annie wondered if she would end up in wonderland if she followed one she took long deep breaths of grassscented air time passed an hour two three still nobody came to pick up the briefcase of course the shepherds shelter was offlimits because of footandmouth as was all open countryside but that hadnt stopped martin armitage and she was certain it wouldnt stop the kidnapper either in fact it was probably why the place had been chosen little chance of anyone passing by most people in the area were lawabiding when it came to the restrictions because they knew how much was at stake and the tourists were staying away taking their holidays abroad or in the cities instead normally annie obeyed the signs too but this was an emergency and she knew she hadnt been anywhere near an infected area in weeks she wished she had something to eat and drink it was long past lunchtime now and she was starving the heat was also making her thirsty and there was something else she realized a more pressing urge she needed to go to the toilet well she thought looking around and seeing nothing but sheep in every direction theres a simple remedy for that she moved a few yards away from her flattened spot on the ground checked for nettles and thistles then took off her tights squatted and peed at least a woman could do that during surveillance in the countryside annie thought with a smile it was a bit different if you were sitting cooped up in your car on a city street as she had found out more than once in the past before she had finished two lowflying jets from a nearby us airbase screamed over seeming no more than twenty feet or so from her head she wondered if the pilots had got a good view she gave them the finger the way americans did back on her stomach she tried her mobile again on the off chance that it might just have been local interference before but still no luck the moor was a dead zone how long should she wait she wondered and why hadnt he come the money was just lying there what if he didnt come before nightfall and the lovers returned more important things than footandmouth on their minds several thousand quid as well as a quick bonk would be an unexpected bonus for them her stomach rumbling tongue dry against the roof of her mouth annie picked up the binoculars again and trained them on the shelter michelle drove banks to a pub she knew near the a wondering more than once on the way why she was doing this but she knew the answer she was bored with routine bored first with tracking down the paperwork and then bored with reading through it she needed to get out blow the cobwebs away and this was the opportunity to do that and work as well she also had to admit that she was intrigued to meet someone who had been a friend of graham marshalls especially as this banks despite a touch of gray in his closely cropped black hair didnt look old enough he was slim perhaps stood three or four inches taller than her five foot five had an angular face with lively blue eyes and a tan he showed no great clothes sense but was dressed in basic marks amp sparks casuals light sports jacket gray chinos blue denim shirt unbuttoned at the collar and the look suited him some men his age only looked good in a business suit michelle thought anything else made them the male version of mutton dressed up as lamb but on some older men casual looked natural it did on banks is it to be di hart then banks asked michelle glanced sideways at him i suppose you can call me michelle if you want michelle it is then nice name was he flirting come off it michelle said no seriously i mean it no need to blush angry at herself for letting her embarrassment show michelle said just as long as you dont start singing the old beatles song i never sing to a woman ive just met besides i imagine you must have heard it many times michelle graced him with a smile too numerous to mention the pub had parking at the back and a big freshly mown lawn with white tables and chairs where they could sit out in the sun a couple of families were already there settled in for the afternoon by the look of it kids running around and playing on the swings and slide the pub provided in a small playground but michelle and banks managed to find a quiet enough spot at the far end near the trees michelle watched the children play as banks went inside to get the drinks one of them was about six or seven head covered in lovely golden curls laughing unselfconsciously as she went higher on the swings melissa michelle felt as if her heart were breaking up inside her chest as she watched it was a relief when banks came back with a pint for himself and a shandy for her and set two menus down on the table whats up he asked you look as if youve seen a ghost maybe i have she said cheers they clinked glasses banks was diplomatic she noted curious about her mood but sensitive and considerate enough to leave well enough alone and pretend to be studying the menu michelle liked that she wasnt very hungry but she ordered a prawn sandwich just to avoid being questioned about her lack of appetite if truth be told her stomach still felt sour from last nights wine banks was obviously ravenous as he ordered a huge yorkshire pudding filled with sausages and gravy when their orders were in they sat back in their chairs and relaxed they were in the shade of a beech tree where it was still warm but out of the direct sunlight banks drank some beer and lit a cigarette he looked in good shape michelle thought for someone who smoked drank and ate huge yorkshire puddings and sausages but how long would that last if he really was graham marshalls contemporary hed be around fifty now and wasnt that the age that men started worrying about their arteries and blood pressure not to mention the prostate still who was she to judge true she didnt smoke but she drank too much and ate far too much junk food so what else can you tell me about graham marshall she asked banks drew on his cigarette and let the smoke out slowly he seemed to be enjoying it michelle thought or was it a strategy he used to gain the upper hand in interviews they all had some sort of strategy even michelle though she would have been hardpushed to define what it was she thought herself quite direct finally he answered we were friends at school and out of it too he lived a few doors down the street and for the year i knew him there was a small gang of us who were pretty much inseparable david grenfell paul major steven hill and you ive only had time to track down and speak to david and paul on the phone so far though neither of them was able to tell me very much go on i havent seen any of them since i left for london when i was eighteen you only knew graham for a year yes he was a new kid in our class the september before he disappeared so it wasnt quite a full year even his family had moved up from london that july or august the way quite a lot of people were already doing then this was before the huge influx that came later in the sixties and the early seventies the new town expansion you probably werent around then i certainly wasnt here where if you dont mind my asking i grew up in hawick border country spent most of my early police career with greater manchester and since then ive been on the move ive only been here a couple of months go on with your story that explains the accent banks paused to sip beer and smoke again i grew up here a provincial kid where my childhood was unspent graham seemed i dont know sort of cool exotic different he was from london and that was where it was all happening when you grow up in the provinces you feel everythings passing you by happening somewhere else and london was one of those in places back then like san francisco what do you mean by cool banks scratched the scar beside his right eye michelle wondered how hed got it i dont know not much fazed him he never showed much emotion or reaction and he seemed sort of worldlywise beyond his years dont get me wrong though graham had his enthusiasms he knew a lot about pop music obscure bsides and all that he played guitar quite well he was crazy about science fiction and he had a beatle haircut my mother wouldnt let me have one short back and sides all the way but he was cool yes i dont know how to define the quality really how do you i think i know what you mean i had a girlfriend like that she was just like oh i dont know someone who made you feel awkward someone you wanted to emulate perhaps im not sure i can define it any more clearly no just cool before it was even cool to be cool his mother said something about bullying oh that was just after he arrived mick slack the school bully he had to try it on with everybody graham wasnt much of a fighter but he didnt give up and slack never went near him again neither did anybody else it was the only time i ever saw him fight i know its hard to remember that far back said michelle but did you notice anything different about him toward the end no he seemed much the same as always he went on holiday with you shortly before he disappeared so his mother told me yes his parents couldnt go that year so they let him come with us its good to have someone your own age to hang about with when youre away for a couple of weeks it could get awfully boring with just parents and a younger brother michelle smiled younger sister too when did you last see graham just the day before he disappeared saturday what did you do banks gazed away into the trees before answering do what we usually did on saturdays in the morning we went to the palace to the matinee flash gordon or hopalong cassidy a three stooges short and the afternoon in town there was an electrical shop on bridge street that used to sell records long gone now three or four of us would sometimes crowd into one of those booths and smoke ourselves silly listening to the latest singles and that night dont remember i think i just stayed in watching tv saturday nights were good juke box jury doctor who dixon of dock green then there was the avengers but i dont think it was on that summer i dont remember it anyway anything odd about the day at all about graham you know for the life of me i cant remember anything unusual im thinking perhaps i didnt know him very well after all michelle was getting the strong impression that banks did know something that he was holding back she didnt know why but she was certain that was the case number twelve a young girl carrying two plates wandered into the garden banks glanced at the number the bartender had given him over here he said she delivered the plates michelle gazed at her prawn sandwich wondering if shed be able to finish it banks tucked into his yorkshire pudding and sausages for a while then said i used to do grahams paper round before him before the shop changed owners it used to be thackerays until old man thackeray got tb and let the business run into the ground thats when bradford bought the shop and built it up again but you didnt go back no id got an afterschool job at the mushroom farm down past the allotments filthy work but it paid well at least for back then ever have any trouble on the paper round no i was thinking about that on my way here among other things no strangers ever invited you inside or anything there was one bloke who always seemed a bit weird at the time though he was probably harmless oh michelle took out her notebook prawn sandwich still untouched on the plate in front of her now arousing the interest of a passing bluebottle banks swatted the fly away better eat it soon he said who was this bloke you were talking about i cant remember the number but it was near the end of hazel crescent before you crossed wilmer road thing was he was about the only one ever awake at that time and i got the impression he hadnt even gone to bed hed open the door in his pajamas and ask me to come in for a smoke or drink or whatever but i always said no why banks shrugged dunno instinct something about him a smell i dont know sometimes when youre a kid youve got a sort of sixth sense for danger if youre lucky it stays with you anyway id already been well trained not to accept sweets from strange men so i wasnt going to accept anything else either harry chatham michelle said what thatll be harry chatham body odor one of his characteristics you have done your homework he came under suspicion at the time but he was eventually ruled out you were right to stay away he did have a history of exposing himself to young boys never went further than that though they were sure michelle nodded he was on holiday in great yarmouth didnt get back until that sunday night plenty of witnesses jet harris gave him the third degree i should imagine banks smiled jet harris havent heard his name in years you know when i was a kid growing up around there it was always better keep your nose clean or jet harris will get you and lock you up we were terrified of him though none of us had ever met him michelle laughed its still pretty much the same today she said surely he must be dead by now eight years ago but the legend lingers on she picked up her sandwich and took a bite it was good she realized she was hungry after all and had soon devoured the first half was there anything else michelle asked she noticed banks hesitate again he had finished his yorkshire pudding and he reached for another cigarette a temporary postponement funny shed seen the signs before in criminals shed interviewed this man definitely had something on his conscience and he was debating whether to tell her or not michelle sensed that she couldnt hurry matters by pushing him so she let him put the cigarette in his mouth and fiddle with his lighter for a few moments and she waited annie wished she hadnt given up smoking at least it would have been something to do as she lay on her belly in the wet grass keeping an eye on the distant shepherds shelter she glanced at her watch and realized she had been lying there over four hours and nobody had come for the money under her clothes and the jacket protecting the back of her neck annie felt bathed in sweat all she wanted to do was walk under a nice cool shower and luxuriate there for half an hour but if she left her spot what would happen on the other hand what would happen if she stayed there the kidnapper might turn up but would annie go running down the daleside to make an arrest no because luke armitage certainly wouldnt be with him would she have time to get to her car in mortsett and follow whoever picked up the money possibly but she would have a much better chance if she were already in the car in the end annie decided that she should go back down to mortsett still keeping an eye on the shelter and keep trying until she found someone home with a telephone then sit in her car and watch from there until relief came from eastvale she felt her bones ache as she stood up and brushed the loose grass from her blouse it was a plan and it beat lying around up here melting in the sun now that it was time to confess banks was finding it more difficult than he had imagined he knew he was stalling playing for time when what he should do was just come right out with it but his mouth felt dry and the words stuck in his throat he sipped some beer it didnt help much sweat tickled the back of his neck and ran down his spine we were playing down by the river he said not far from the city center it wasnt developed quite as much as it is today so it was a pretty desolate stretch of water who was playing with you just paul and steve go on it was nothing really banks said embarrassed at how slight the events that had haunted him for years now seemed on this bright afternoon sitting under a beech tree with an attractive woman but there was no backing out now we were throwing stones in the water skimming that sort of thing then we moved down the riverbank a bit and found some bigger stones and bricks we started chucking those in to make a big splash at least i did steve and paul were a bit farther down anyway i was holding this big rock to my chest with both hands it took all my strength when i noticed this tall scruffy sort of bloke walking along the riverbank toward me what did you do held on to it said banks so i didnt splash him always the polite little bugger i was i remember smiling as he got nearer you know showing him i was holding off dropping the rock until he was out of range banks paused and drew on his cigarette next thing i knew he went on hed grabbed hold of me from behind and id dropped the rock and splashed us both what happened what did he do we struggled i thought he was trying to push me in but i managed to dig in my heels i might not have been very big but i was wiry and strong i think my resistance surprised him i remember smelling his sweat and i think hed been drinking beer i remembered smelling it on my fathers breath when he came back from the pub sometimes michelle took her notebook out can you give me a description he had a ragged dark beard his hair was greasy and long longer than usual back then it was black like rasputin and he wore one of those army greatcoats i remember thinking when i saw him coming that he must be hot in such a heavy overcoat when was this late june it was a nice day sort of like today so what happened he tried to drag me away toward the bushes but i managed to squirm out of his grasp one arm at any rate and he swung me around swore at me and punched me in the face the momentum broke me loose so i ran where were your friends back up by the road by then a good hundred yards away watching didnt they help you they were scared they didnt call the police it all happened so fast when i got free i ran off and joined them and we never looked back we decided not to say anything to our parents because we werent supposed to be playing down by the river in the first place and we were supposed to be at school we thought wed get into trouble i can imagine you did what did your parents say about your face they werent too pleased i told them id got into a bit of a scrap at school all in all i suppose it was a lucky escape i tried to put it out of my mind but you couldnt off and on theres been lengthy periods of my life when i havent thought of it at all why do you see a connection with what happened to graham it seemed too much of a coincidence thats all said banks first this pervert trying to push me in the river dragging me into the bushes then graham disappearing like that well said michelle finishing her drink and closing her notebook id better go and see if i can find any trace of your mystery man hadnt i chapter showered and dressed in crisp clean clothes annie presented herself at detective superintendent gristhorpes office that afternoon as requested there was something austere and headmasterly about the room that always intimidated her partly it had to do with the tall bookcases mostly filled with legal and forensics texts but dotted here and there with classics such as bleak house and anna karenina books annie had never read books that mocked her with their oftmentioned titles and their thickness and partly it was gristhorpes appearance big bulky redfaced unrulyhaired hooknosed pockmarked today he wore gray flannel trousers and a tweed jacket with elbow patches he looked as if he ought to be smoking a pipe but annie knew he didnt smoke right said gristhorpe after he had asked her to sit down now tell me what the hells going on out mortsett way annie felt herself flush it was a judgment call sir gristhorpe waved his large hairy hand im not questioning your judgment i want to know what you think is happening annie relaxed a little and crossed her legs i think luke armitage has been kidnapped sir someone communicated a ransom demand to the family last night and martin armitage rang me to cancel the search for luke but you didnt no sir something wasnt right in my opinion luke armitage wasnt to be considered found until id seen him with my own eyes and talked to him fair enough what happened next as you know sir i went out to see the family again this morning i got the distinct impression they didnt want me there that something was going on annie explained about following martin armitage to the drop and being stuck up the hillside watching the shelter by herself for hours until she went back down to the village and finally found someone at home with a telephone do you think he saw you the kidnapper its possible annie admitted if he was hiding somewhere nearby and watching through binoculars its open country up there but its my impression that hell either wait until nightfall and risk leaving the money out there all day its off the beaten track and most people follow the government regulations what else pardon sir you said either to me that implies an or i interrupted you go on what else do you think might have happened maybe something has gone wrong something we dont know about like annie swallowed and looked away like lukes dead sir it happens sometimes with kidnappings he tried to escape struggled too hard but the kidnapper can still collect remember the armitages cant possibly know their sons dead if he is and the moneys just sitting there for the taking if you werent seen then only martin armitage and the kidnapper know its there thats what puzzles me sir the money obviously a kidnapper who makes a ransom demand is in it for the money whether the victim lives or dies maybe hes just being unduly cautious waiting for dark as i suggested earlier possibly gristhorpe looked at his watch whos up there now dc templeton sir organize a surveillance rota ill ask for permission to plant an electronic tracking device in the briefcase someone can put it there under cover of darkness if the damn thing hasnt been picked up before then gristhorpe grunted might as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb acc mclaughlin will have my guts for garters you could always blame me sir aye youd like that wouldnt you annie a chance to get bolshie with the bigwigs sir its all right lass im only teasing you havent you learned yorkshire ways yet sometimes i despair that i ever will give it a few more years anyway thats my job i can handle the brass what about the armitages sir i think youd better pay them another visit dont you but what if their place is being watched the kidnapper doesnt know you gristhorpe smiled and its not as if you look like a plainclothes copper annie and i thought id put on my conservative best all you have to do is wear those red boots again are their telephone calls still being intercepted yes sir then how the devil the same thing puzzled me martin armitage said the call from luke came through on his mobile so im assuming it was the kidnappers call he was talking about but why wouldnt he just use the regular land line armitage said he and robin were supposed to go out to dinner that night so luke didnt think theyd be home he believed they would still go out to dinner even after hed disappeared and he told his kidnapper this i know it sounds odd sir and in my judgment martin armitage is the last person luke would call ah i see signs of family tension all under the surface but definitely there id say lukes very much his mothers son and his biological fathers perhaps hes creative artistic a loner a dreamer martin armitage is a man of action a sportsman bit of a macho tough guy go carefully then annie you dont want to disturb a nest of vipers there might be no choice if i want honest answers to my questions then tread softly and carry a big stick ill do that and dont give up on the kid its early days yet yes sir annie said though she wasnt at all certain about that the old street looked much the same as it had when banks lived there with his parents between and from love me do to woodstock except that everything the brickwork the doors the slate roofs was just that little bit shabbier and small satellite dishes had replaced the forest of old television aerials on just about all the houses including his parents that made sense he couldnt imagine his father living without sky sports back in the early sixties the estate was new and bankss mother had been thrilled to move from their little backtoback terrace house with the outside toilet to the new house with all mod cons as they used to say as far as banks was concerned the best mod cons were the indoor wc a real bathroom to replace the tin tub they had had to fill from a kettle every friday and a room of his own in the old house he had shared with his brother roy five years younger and like all siblings they fought more than anything else the house stood near the western edge of the estate close to the arterial road across from an abandoned factory and a row of shops including the newsagents banks paused for a moment and took in the weathered terraced houses rows of five each with a little garden wooden gate low wall and privet hedge some people had made small improvements he noticed and one house had an enclosed porch the owners must have bought the place when the conservatives sold off council houses for peanuts in the eighties maybe there was even a conservatory around the back banks thought though it would be folly to add an extension made almost entirely of glass on an estate like this a knot of kids stood smoking and shoving one another in the middle of the street some asian some white clocking banks out of the corners of their eyes locals were always suspicious of newcomers and the kids had no idea who he was that he had grown up here too some of them were wearing lowslung baggy jeans and hoodies mangy dogs wandered up and down the street barking at everything and nothing shitting on the pavements and loud rock music blasted out of an open window several houses east banks opened the gate he noticed that his mother had planted some colorful flowers and kept the small patch of lawn neatly trimmed this was the only garden she had ever had and she always had been proud of her little patch of earth he walked up the flagstone path and knocked at the door he saw his mother approach through the frosted glass pane she opened the door rubbed her hands together as if drying them and gave him a hug alan she said lovely to see you come on in banks dropped his overnight bag in the hall and followed his mother through to the living room the wallpaper was a sort of wispy autumnleaves pattern the threepiece suite a matching brown velveteen and there was a sentimental autumnal landscape hanging over the electric fire he didnt remember this theme from his previous visit about a year ago but he couldnt be certain that it hadnt been there either so much for the observant detective and the dutiful son his father was sitting in his usual armchair the one with the best straighton view of the television he didnt get up only grunted son how you doing not bad dad you mustnt complain arthur banks had been suffering from mild angina and an assortment of less specified chronic illnesses for years ever since hed been made redundant from the sheetmetal factory and they seemed to get neither better nor worse as the years went on he took pills occasionally for the chest pains other than that and the damage booze and fags had wreaked on his liver and lungs over the years he had always been fit as a fiddle short skinny and hollowchested he still had a head of thick dark hair with hardly a trace of gray he wore it slicked back with lashings of brylcreem bankss mother plump and nervy with pouchy chipmunk cheeks and a haze of bluegray hair hovering around her skull fussed about how thin banks was looking i dont suppose youve been eating properly since sandra left have you she said you know how it is said banks i manage to gulp down the occasional big mac and fries now and then if ive got time to spare dont be cheeky besides you need proper food in for tea i suppose so banks said he hadnt thought about what he was going to do once he actually got home if truth be told he had imagined that the local police in the lovely form of di michelle hart would find his offer of help invaluable and give him an office at thorpe wood but that clearly was not to be fair enough he thought its her case after all ill just take my bag up he said heading for the stairs though banks hadnt stayed overnight since he had first left for london somehow he knew that his room would be just as it always had been and he was right almost it was the same wardrobe the same small bookcase the same narrow bed he had slept in as a teenager sneaking his transistor radio under the covers to listen to radio luxembourg or reading a book by the light of a flashlight the only thing different was the wallpaper gone were the sportscar images of his adolescence replaced by pink and green stripes he stood on the threshold for a few moments allowing it all to flow back allowing the emotion that he felt nudging at the boundaries of his consciousness it wasnt quite nostalgia nor was it loss but something in between the view hadnt changed bankss bedroom was the only one at the back of the house next to the wc and bathroom and it looked out over backyards and an alleyway beyond which an empty field stretched a hundred yards or so to the next estate people walked their dogs there and sometimes the local kids gathered at night banks used to do that he remembered with dave paul steve and graham sharing woodbines and park drives or if graham was flush those long american tipped cigarettes peter stuyvesants or pall malls later after graham had disappeared banks had sometimes been there with girlfriends the field wasnt square and there was a little dogleg on the other side where if you were careful you couldnt be seen from the houses he remembered well enough those long rawlipped snogging sessions pushed up against the rusty corrugated iron fencing the fervid struggles with bra hooks safety pins or whatever other contrivances the local girls so inconsiderately used to keep themselves fastened up banks dropped his bag at the bottom of the bed and stretched it had been a long drive and the time spent in the pub garden the pint he had drunk with di hart all conspired to make him feel tired he thought of taking a brief nap before tea but decided it would be rude he could at least go down and talk to his parents as he hadnt been in touch for so long first he unpacked his shirt to hang up in the wardrobe before the creases became too permanent the other clothes in the wardrobe were unfamiliar but banks noticed several cardboard boxes on the floor he pulled one out and was stunned when he saw it contained his old records singles as those were all he could afford back then when they cost and an lp cost of course he got lps for christmas and birthdays often with record tokens but they were mostly beatles and rolling stones and he had taken those to london with him the records here represented the beginnings of his musical interests when he left he had soon gone on to cream hendrix and jefferson airplane then later discovered jazz and later still classical but these banks dipped his hand in and lifted out a stack flipping through them here they were in all their glory dusty springfields goin back the shadows the rise amp fall of flingel bunt cilla blacks anyone who had a heart and alfie nut rocker by b bumble and the stingers sandie shaws always something there to remind me house of the rising sun by the animals and as tears go by by marianne faithfull there were many more some he had forgotten and a few really obscure artists such as ral donner and kenny lynch and cover versions of del shannon and roy orbison hits made by unnamed performers for woolworths cheap embassy label what a treasure trove of nostalgia all the stuff he listened to between the ages of about eleven and sixteen his old record player was long gone but his parents had a stereo downstairs so perhaps he would play a few of the old songs while he was home for the moment he put back the box and pulled out another one this one full mostly of old toys there were model airplanes spitfires wellingtons junkers and a messerschmitt with a broken wing a couple of dinky toys a dan dare rocket gun and a small clockwork dalek that said exterminate exterminate as it rolled along like an upturned dustbin there were a few old annuals too the saint danger man and the man from uncle along with what had once been his pride and joy a pocketsize philips transistor radio maybe if he put in some new batteries he could even get it working the third box he opened was full of old school reports magazines letters and exercise books he had sometimes wondered over the years what had happened to all this stuff and assumed if anything that his parents had chucked it out when they figured he wouldnt need it anymore not so it had been hiding away in the wardrobe all this time there they were beatles monthly fabulous record song book and the radio luxembourg book of record stars banks pulled out a handful of the small notebooks and found they were his old diaries some were plain letts diaries with a little slot for a pencil down the spine and some were specialthemed illustrated ones such as pop star television or sports diaries the one that was of most immediate interest to him though was a photoplay diary with a stiff laminated cover and a color photo of sean connery and honor blackman from s bond film goldfinger on the front inside a photo of a different film star faced each page of dates the first was brigitte bardot for the week starting sunday december the first full week of his diary for the year graham disappeared michelle took off her reading glasses and rubbed the bridge of her nose where she sensed a headache beginning to form between her eyes she suffered from headaches frequently these days and while her doctor assured her there was nothing seriously wrong no brain tumor or neurological disease and her psychiatrist told her that it was probably just stress and coping she couldnt help but worry the air quality in the archives office didnt help either instead of signing the heavier boxes out and carrying them up to her office michelle had decided she might as well look through the material down there the reading room was just a glassedin alcove with a desk and chair it stood at the entrance to several parallel aisles of old papers some of which went back to the latenineteenth century if the environment had been a little more comfortable she might have considered having a browse around the archives there was bound to be some fascinating stuff for the moment would have to do michelle wanted to get a general idea of the crimes occurring around the time of grahams disappearance to see if she could come up with any links to bankss mysterious stranger and mrs metcalfe had directed her to the logbooks that indexed and recorded all complaints and actions taken day by day it made for interesting reading most of it not relevant to what she was looking for many of the calls listed went no further missing pets some domestic complaints but the lists gave her a good impression of what daily life must have been like for a copper back then in may for example a man had been arrested in connection with an assault on a fourteenyearold girl who had accepted a lift with him near the a but he bore no resemblance whatsoever to bankss description of the man by the river also in may there had been a major jewelry robbery at a city center shop netting the thieves eighteen thousand pounds in june a number of youths had gone on the rampage and slashed tires on about thirty cars in the city center in the same month a twentyoneyearold man had been stabbed outside the rose and crown on bridge street after an argument over a girl in august two alleged homosexuals had been questioned in connection with lewd goingson at the country mansion of a local bigwig rupert mandeville but the anonymous informant couldnt be located and all charges had later been dismissed for lack of evidence hard to believe that it was a crime to be gay michelle thought but was back in the dark ages before homosexuality had been legalized in there were certainly plenty of incidents before and after graham marshalls disappearance michelle was fast discovering but none of them seemed to have anything remotely to do with bankss riverbank adventure she read on in july police had investigated complaints about a local protection racket modeled on the east london kray gang operation allegedly led by a man called carlo fiorino but no charges were brought the more she read the more michelle realized what a vast chasm yawned between and today she had in fact been born in but she was damned if she was going to admit that to banks her own teenage years had been spent in what banks would no doubt call a musical wasteland made up of the bay city rollers elton john and hot chocolate not to mention saturday night fever and grease punk came along when she was about fifteen but michelle was far too conservative to join in with that crowd if truth be told the punks scared her with their torn clothes spiky hair and safety pins in their ears and the music just sounded like noise to her not that michelle had had a great deal of time for pop music she had been a studious child lamenting that it always seemed to take her so long to finish her homework when others were done and out on the town her mother said she was too much of a perfectionist to let something be and have done with it and perhaps that was true painstaking perfectionist these were labels she had come to know and hate from friends family and the teachers at school why not just say pedestrian and plodding and have done with it if that was what they meant she sometimes wondered she hadnt done brilliantly at school despite all her hard work but she had managed to pass enough o and alevels to get into a poly again cramming through all the concerts and parties her fellow students went to where she had studied business and management techniques before deciding on the police as a career on those rare occasions when she did have time to go out late in the seventies she liked to dance for that reggae or twotone was her music of choice bob marley the specials madness ub michelle had always hated nostalgia snobs as she called them and in her experience the sixties ones were the worst of the lot she suspected that banks was one to hear them talk youd think paradise had been lost or the seventh seal broken now that so many of the great rock icons were dead geriatric or gaga and nobody wore beads and caftans anymore and youd also think that drugtaking was an innocent way to spend a few hours relaxing or a means of reaching some exalted spiritual state instead of a waste of lives and a source of money for evil unscrupulous dealers the archives office was quiet except for the buzzing of the fluorescent light silence is a rare thing in a police station where everyone is pushed together in openplan offices but down here michelle could even hear her watch ticking after five time for a break soon some fresh air perhaps and then back down to it reading the crime reports for august she sensed rather than heard someone approaching the office and when she looked up she saw it was detective superintendent benjamin shaw shaws bulk filled the doorway and blocked some of the light from coming in what you up to di hart he asked just checking the old logs sir i can see that what for you wont find anything there you know not after all this time i was just having a general look around trying to get some context for the marshall case actually i was wondering if context is that one of those fancy words they taught you at polytechnic bloody timewasting sounds more like it sir dont bother to argue inspector youre wasting your time what do you expect to find in the dusty old files apart from context i was talking to one of graham marshalls friends earlier she said he told me he was approached by a strange man on the riverbank about two months before the marshall boy disappeared i was just trying to see if any similar incidents were on file shaw sat on the edge of the desk it creaked and tilted a little michelle worried that the damn thing would break under his weight and he asked im curious nothing so far sir do you remember anything odd like that shaw frowned no but who is this friend hes called banks sir alan banks actually its detective chief inspector banks is it indeed banks the name sounds vaguely familiar i take it he didnt report the incident at the time no sir too scared of what his parents might say i can imagine look about this banks chap he went on i think id like a little word with him can you arrange it ive got his phone number sir but michelle was about to tell shaw that it was her case and that she didnt appreciate his poaching her interviews but she decided it wouldnt be diplomatic to alienate one of her senior officers at such an early stage of her career in peterborough besides he might be helpful having been involved in the original investigation but what nothing sir good shaw stood up well have him in then soon as possible i know it must seem odd after all these years banks said but im alan banks and ive come to offer my condolences alan banks well i never the look of suspicion on mrs marshalls face was immediately transformed into one of pleasure she opened the door wide do come in and make yourself at home it was over thirtysix years since banks had set foot in the marshall house and he had a vague memory that the furniture had been made of much darker wood then heavier and sturdier now the sideboard and television stand looked as if they were made of pine the threepiece suite seemed much bigger and a huge television dominated one corner of the room even all those years ago he remembered he hadnt been inside grahams house often some parents kept an open house for their childrens friends the way his own did and daves and pauls but the marshalls were always a bit distant standoffish graham never spoke about his mum and dad much either banks remembered but that hadnt struck him as at all unusual at the time kids dont except to complain if theyre not allowed to do something or discovered in some deception and have their pocket money stopped as far as banks knew graham marshalls home life was every bit as normal as his own his mother had told him that mr marshall had been disabled by a stroke so he was prepared for the frail drooling figure staring up at him from the armchair mrs marshall looked tired and careworn herself which was hardly surprising and he wondered how she kept the place so spickandspan maybe the social helped out as he doubted she could afford a daily look bill its alan banks said mrs marshall you know one of our grahams old friends it was hard to read mr marshalls expression through the distortions of his face but his gaze seemed to relax a little when he found out who the visitor was banks said hello and sat down he spotted the old photo of graham the one his own father had taken with his brownie on blackpool promenade he had taken one of banks too also wearing a black poloneck beatle jumper but without the matching hairstyle mr marshall was sitting in the same spot he had always sat in like bankss own father back then he had always seemed to be smoking but now he looked as if he could hardly lift a cigarette to his lips i understand youre an important policeman now mrs marshall said i dont know about important but im a policeman yes you dont have to be so modest i bump into your mum at the shops from time to time and shes very proud of you thats more than she lets on to me banks thought well he said you know what mothers are like have you come to help with the investigation i dont know that i can said banks but if they want any help from me id be happy to give it she seems very nice the girl they sent round im sure shell be just fine i told her i cant imagine what she can do that jet harris and his boys didnt do back then they were very thorough i know they were but he just seemed to have vanished all these years ive often thought about him banks said i realize i didnt actually know him for very long but he was a good friend i missed him we all missed him mrs marshall sniffed thank you i know he appreciated the way you all accepted him when we were new here you know how difficult it can be to make friends sometimes its just so hard to believe that hes turned up after all this time it happens said banks and dont give up on the investigation theres a lot more science and technology in police work these days look how quickly they identified the remains they couldnt have done that twenty years ago i just wish i could be of some use said mrs marshall but i dont remember anything out of the ordinary at all it just came like a lightning bolt out of the blue banks stood up i know he said but if theres anything to be discovered im sure di hart will discover it are you going already its nearly teatime banks said smiling and my mother would never forgive me if i didnt turn up for tea she thinks i need fattening up mrs marshall smiled better go then mustnt cross your mother by the way they cant release the body yet but miss hart said shed let me know when we can have the funeral you will come wont you of course said banks when he looked over to say goodbye to mr marshall he had a sudden flash of the big muscular man he used to be the sense of physical menace he had somehow conveyed back then banks remembered with a shock he had been afraid of grahams dad he never had any real reason to feel that way but he had she should have packed it in long ago michelle realized but she was loath to give up without finding at least some trace of bankss mystery man if any existed besides the material itself gave her an interesting picture of the times and she found herself becoming quite fascinated by it all it hadnt been a bumper crime year for peterborough in but the fastgrowing city had its share of some of the more newsworthy national problems michelle was fast discovering mods and rockers clashed at some city center pubs cannabis was beginning to insinuate its way into the lifestyles of the young and rebellious despite what banks had said and the pornography trade was blossoming in the shape of tons of german danish and swedish magazines covering every perversion you could imagine and some you couldnt why not norwegian or finnish too michelle wondered werent they into porn burglary and armed robbery were as common as ever and the only thing that seemed new today was the increase in car theft far fewer people owned cars in michelle realized and that made her think again about bankss statement banks said he had been assaulted by a dirty scruffy rasputinlike stranger on the riverside near the city center but graham marshall had been abducted along with a heavy canvas bag full of newspapers two months later from a council estate several miles away the mos were different it didnt look as if graham had put up a struggle for example which he certainly would have done as banks had if hed been attacked by this frightening stranger and felt that he had been fighting for his life besides the man who assaulted banks had been on foot and graham hadnt walked all the way to his burial site it was possible that the mysterious stranger had a car somewhere but not very likely given bankss description michelle would have guessed the man was homeless and poor perhaps a tramp the passing tramp cliché of so many detective stories the problem was that she still couldnt see any logical connection between the event banks had described and the disappearance of graham marshall she thought that bankss sense of guilt might over the years have warped his judgment in the matter it happened shed seen it before but could it have happened that way who was this man there was a good chance michelle realized that she might not find out anything about him in the police files not everyone had a file despite what the antipolice groups seemed to think she might have to dig in the newspaper morgue or perhaps the local mental hospital archives the man sounded disturbed and there was a chance he had sought treatment at some time of course there was also every possibility that he wasnt a local michelle had no idea exactly where the river nene started but she thought it was somewhere down northampton way and she knew that it flowed all the way to the wash maybe he was walking the riverbank from town to town she flipped through file after file and tossed them aside in frustration finally as her eyes were starting to tire she struck gold chapter the coach and horses about a hundred yards along the main road had changed over the years banks noticed but not as much as some pubs the large public bar had always housed a diverse group mixed generations drinking there together and today it was no different though the racial mix had changed now among the white faces there were pakistanis and sikhs and according to arthur banks a group of kosovan asylumseekers who lived on the estate also drank there noisy machines with flashing lights had replaced the old barbilliards area the scarred wooden benches had been replaced with padded ones perhaps the wallpaper had been redone and the light fixtures modernized but that was about all the brewery had forked out for this minor facelift sometime in the eighties bankss father had told him hoping to pull in a younger freerspending crowd but it didnt take the people who drank at the coach and horses had for the most part been drinking there most of their lives and their fathers before them banks had drunk his first legal pint there with his father on his eighteenth birthday though he had been knocking them back with his mates at the wheatsheaf about a mile away since he was sixteen the last time he had been in the coach and horses he had played one of the earliest pub video games that silly machine where you bounced the tennis ball back and forth across a green phosphorous screen though there were few young people to be seen there the coach and horses still managed to be a warm and lively place banks noticed as he walked in with his father just after eight oclock that night his mothers steamed pudding and custard the proper food he was supposed to be eating still weighing heavy in his stomach his father had managed the walk without too much puffing and wheezing which he put down to having stopped smoking two years ago banks had tapped his own jacket pocket rather guiltily for his cigarettes as they went out of the door this was arthur bankss local he had been coming here almost every day for forty years and so had his cronies harry finnegan jock mcfall and norman grenfell daves father here arthur was respected here he could escape the clutches of his ailments and the shame of his redundancy at least for an hour or two as he drank laughed and told lies with the men with whom he felt most comfortable for the coach and horses was by and large a mens pub despite the occasional couple and groups of women dropping by after work when arthur took ida out for a drink as he did on fridays they went to the duck and drake or the duke of wellington where ida banks caught up on the local gossip and they took part in trivia quizzes and laughed at people making fools of themselves in the karaoke sessions but there was none of that at the coach and horses and the piped sixties pop music was turned down low enough so that old men could hear one another talk at the moment the kinks were singing waterloo sunset one of bankss favorites after banks and his father had settled themselves at the table pints in front of them and introductions had been made arthur banks first lamented jock mcfalls absence due to hospitalization for a prostate operation then norman grenfell started the ball rolling we were just saying before you got here alan what a terrible thing it is about the marshall boy i remember you and our david used to play with him yes how is dave by the way hes doing fine said norman he and ellie still live in dorchester the kids have grown up now of course theyre still together ellie hatcher was banks remembered daves first real girlfriend they must have started going out together around some couples stick it out muttered arthur banks banks ignored the remark and asked norman to pass on his regards to dave next time they spoke unlike jock and harry banks remembered both of whom had worked with arthur at the sheetmetal factory norman had worked in a clothing shop on midgate where he could sometimes get his mates a discount on a duffel coat a pair of jeans or tuf shoes norman drank halves instead of pints and smoked a pipe which made him different almost genteel compared to the rough factory workers he also had a hobby he read and collected everything to do with steam trains and had an entire room of his small house devoted to clockwork models and that set him even farther apart from the beer sport and telly crowd yet norman grenfell had always been as much a part of the group as jock or harry or arthur himself though he didnt share that ineffable bond that workingmen have of having toiled under the same lousy conditions for the same lousy bosses and faced the same dangers day in day out for the same lousy pay maybe banks wondered graham had been a bit like that too set apart by his background by his being a newcomer by his london cool yet still a part of the gang the quiet one the george harrison of the group well banks said raising his glass heres to graham in the long run i suppose its best they found him at least his parents can lay his bones to rest now true enough said harry amen said norman didnt grahams father use to drink here banks asked arthur banks laughed he did he was a rum customer bill marshall isnt that right harry a rum customer indeed and a couple of bricks short of a full hod too if you ask me they all laughed in what way was he rum banks asked harry nudged bankss father always the copper your lad hey arthurs brow darkened banks knew damn well that his father had never approved of his choice of career and that no matter how well he did how successful he was to his father he would always be a traitor to the working class who traditionally feared and despised coppers as far as arthur banks was concerned his son was employed by the middle and upper classes to protect their interests and their property never mind that most coppers of arthurs own generation came from the working classes unlike today when many were middleclass university graduates and management types the two of them had never resolved this problem and banks could see even now that his father was bothered by harry finnegans little dig graham was a friend of mine banks went on quickly to diffuse the tension i was just wondering thats all is that why youre down here norman asked partly yes it was the same question mrs marshall had asked him perhaps people assumed that because he was a policeman and because he knew graham he would be assigned to this particular case i dont know how much i can help banks said glancing sideways at his father who was working on his beer he had never told either of his parents about what had happened down by the river and he wasnt about to do so now it might come out of course if his information led anywhere and now he had an inkling of what the many witnesses who lied to avoid disclosing a shameful secret had to be anxious about its just that well ive thought about graham and what happened on and off over the years and i just thought i ought to come and try to help thats all i can understand that said norman relighting his pipe i think its been a bit of a shock to the system for all of us one way or another you were saying about grahams father dad arthur banks glanced at his son was i you said he was strange i didnt know him well i never really talked to him course not said arthur you were just a kid thats why im asking you there was a pause then arthur banks looked over at harry finnegan he was shifty wouldnt you say so harry he was indeed always an eye for a fiddle and not above a bit of strongarm stuff i wouldnt have trusted him as far as i could throw him and he was a big talker too what do you mean banks asked well his father said you know the family came up from london yes bill marshall worked as a bricklayer and he was a good one too but when hed had a drink or two hed start letting things slip about some of his other activities in london i still dont understand he was a fit bloke bill strong big hands powerful upper body comes from carrying those hods around the building sites he used to get into fights you could say that what your dads saying explained harry leaning forward is that bill marshall let slip he used to act as an enforcer for gangsters down the smoke protection rackets that sort of thing the smoke banks hadnt heard that term for london for years he did banks shook his head it was hard to imagine the old man in the chair as having been some sort of gang enforcer but it might help explain the fear banks remembered feeling in his presence all those years ago the threat of violence id never have how could you his father cut in like i said you were just a kid you couldnt understand things like that the music had changed banks noticed herb alpert and his bloody tijuana brass just finishing thank god banks had hated them back then and he hated them now next came the bachelors marie mum and dad music did you tell the police he asked the men looked at one another then arthur looked back at banks his lip curling what do you think but he could listen bill marshall might have been a big talker but he had nothing to do with his sons disappearance how can you know that arthur banks snorted you police all the bloody same you are just because a man might be a bit dodgy in one area youre ready to fit him up with anything ive never fitted anyone up in my life said banks what im saying is that bill marshall might have been a bit of a wild man but he didnt go around killing young lads especially not his own son i didnt say i thought he did it banks said noticing that the others were watching him and his father now as if they were the evenings entertainment then what did you mean look dad banks said reaching for a cigarette he had been determined not to smoke in front of his father mostly because of the old mans health but not smoking in the coach and horses was as pointless as swimming in the nopissing section of a swimming pool if such a section were ever to exist if there was any truth in what bill marshall said about his criminal background in london then isnt it possible that something hed done there came back to haunt him but nobody hurt bill doesnt matter dad these people often have more devious ways of getting back at their enemies believe me ive come across more than a few of them in my time did he ever mention any names what do you mean i mean in london the people he worked for did he ever mention any names harry finnegan gave a nervous laugh arthur shot him a glance and he shut up as a matter of fact said arthur pausing dramatically he did who the twins reggie and ronnie kray bloody hell arthur bankss eyes shone with triumph now do you see why we just thought he had a big mouth on him for the second time that day annie turned up at swainsdale hall only this time she felt the butterflies in the pit of her stomach people like martin armitage were difficult enough to deal with in the first place and he wouldnt like what she had to say still she thought for all his tough bluster he hadnt done much but kick a ball around most of his life robin was another matter annie sensed that she might feel relieved to have someone else to share her fears with and that underneath her accommodating exterior and her air of vulnerability there was a strong woman who was capable of standing up to her husband josie answered the door as usual holding a barking miata by the collar annie wanted to talk to josie and her husband calvin but they could wait for the moment the fewer people who knew what was going on the better robin and martin were both out in the garden sitting at a wroughtiron table under a striped umbrella it was a warm evening and the back garden faced south so there was plenty of honeytinted sunlight and dark shadows cast by tree branches annie felt like reaching for her sketch pad beyond the high drystone wall that marked the property boundary the daleside stretched up in a patchwork of uneven fields green until the sere bareness of the higher slopes where it rose more steeply to merge into the wild stretch of heather moorland that separated the dales neither martin nor robin seemed to be enjoying the beautiful evening or the long cool drinks that sat in front of them both seemed pale tense and preoccupied and the mobile perched on the table like an unexploded bomb what are you doing here martin armitage said i told you luke was on his way home and id be in touch when he got here i take it hes not arrived yet no heard from him again no annie sighed and sat down without being invited i didnt ask you to annie raised her hand to quiet martin down look she said theres no point pissing about any more i know whats going on i dont understand what you mean come off it mr armitage i followed you you did what i followed you after i left this morning i waited in a layby and followed you to the shepherds shelter what were you doing there none of your bloody business why what are you going to do charge me with disobeying government regulations let me tell you what you were doing mr armitage you were leaving a briefcase full of money old bills tens and twenties for the most part around ten thousand pounds at a guess maybe fifteen armitage was red in the face still annie pressed on and now let me tell you what happened they got in touch with you last night on your mobile said theyd got luke and you were to hand over the money you told them you couldnt lay your hands on that much cash until the banks were open so they gave you until this morning to leave it at the prearranged drop which means they know something about the area annie realized or that theyve been watching scouting for some time maybe someone had noticed them strangers usually stood out around these parts especially as the tourist numbers were down how am i doing so far youve got imagination ill certainly give you that they said no police which is why my arrival scared the living daylights out of you ive told you martin robin armitage spoke for the first time and though her voice was soft and kindly it was authoritative enough to command her husbands attention cant you see she went on she knows i must admit that i for one feel rather relieved but he said they dont know who i am said annie and im pretty certain they didnt see me around mortsett this morning pretty certain annie looked him in the eye id be a liar if i said i was a hundred percent certain birds in the trees filled in the silence that followed and a light breeze ruffled annies hair she held martin armitages gaze until she saw it waver and finally wane into defeat his shoulders slumped robin leaned over and put her arm around him its all right darling she said the police will know what to do theyll be discreet robin looked at annie as she spoke as if daring her to disagree annie didnt martin ran the backs of his hands across his eyes and nodded im sorry about whats happened annie said but mrs armitage is right robin please as were involved in such an intimate matter at least you can call me by my first name my husband too okay robin look i have to tell you that im not a negotiator this isnt my area of expertise we have people specially trained to deal with kidnappers and their demands but he said no police martin repeated he said if we brought in the police hed kill luke what did you say i told him id already reported luke missing and what did he say to that he was quiet for a moment as if he was thinking like or consulting with someone else he could have been but i didnt hear anyone anyway when he came back on he said that was fine but to make sure i told you luke had rung and said that he was coming home which i did it was a man who made the call then yes what time about half past nine just before robin rang you how much did he ask for ten thousand accent none really he didnt sound local he couldve been but he didnt have a strong accent sort of bland and his voice what do you mean high or low husky reedy whatever just ordinary im sorry im not good at this sort of thing especially recognizing voices on the telephone annie favored him with a smile not many people are think about it though it could be important if theres anything at all you remember about the voice yes ill think about it did he let you speak to luke no did you ask yes but he said luke was being kept somewhere else and he called you on your mobile yes who knows the number family close friends business colleagues i suppose it would be easy enough to find out luke of course he has it programmed into the electronic phone book of his own mobile at first i thought it was him because his name was displayed when the call came so the kidnapper used lukes mobile to call you i suppose so why does it matter at least it tells us hes in an area where theres a signal or he was when he made the call also if hes used it at other times well be able to get the information from the phone company it might help us pinpoint him of course it would be better if he left it switched on but hes not going to make things that easy for us tell me said robin in your experience in how many cases do they how many times do the victims i dont have any statistics offhand annie admitted but if it makes you feel any better kidnappers are essentially businesspeople theyre in it for the money not to hurt anyone theres every chance that this will be resolved and that youll see luke back here safe and sound annie could feel her nose growing as she talked too much time had passed she suspected for a happy ending though she hoped she was wrong in the meantime while appearing to go along with his demands and not alarming him in any way we want to make sure that in addition to getting luke home safely we take every opportunity to discover the kidnappers identity and bring him to justice how can we help asked robin you dont have to do anything said annie youve already played your part just leave the rest to us maybe youve scared him off martin said luke should be back by now its been hours sometimes they wait a long time just to make sure nobodys watching hes probably waiting till dark but you cant be certain can you robin said nothings certain in this world mrs armitage robin i told you oh how rude of me she got to her feet all this time and i havent offered you anything to drink she was wearing denim shorts annie noticed cut high on her long smooth legs there werent many women who could get away with the bare midriff look at her age either annie thought she wouldnt even think of it herself though she was only thirtyfour but what she could see of robins stomach looked flat and taut with a ring of some sort glinting in her navel no she said really im not stopping long there wasnt much else annie could do for luke except wait and she had promised herself a nice pint of bitter at the black sheep in relton where she could sit in peace and mull things over before calling it a day i just want to make certain that youll report any future communications if there are any straight to me youve got the numbers where i can be reached both martin and robin nodded and of course youll let me know the second luke turns up we will said robin i just hope and pray that he does come home soon me too said annie getting up theres one more thing that puzzles me what asked robin last night when you rang to tell me youd heard from luke you said he would be back tonight thats what he told martin the kidnapper he said that if we left the money this morning then luke would be home unharmed by tonight and you know that i wanted to see luke as soon as he got back to talk to him yes so how were you going to explain everything asked annie im curious robin looked over at her husband who answered we were going to persuade luke to tell you what we said happened in the first place that hed run away and phoned us the night before to say he was coming back who thought of this the kidnapper suggested it sounds like the perfect crime said annie only you two luke and the kidnapper would ever know that it had been committed and none of you would be likely to talk martin looked down at his drink he would have done that annie went on luke would have lied to the police he would have done it for me said robin annie looked at her nodded and left the krays banks thought as he lay in his narrow bed that night reggie and ronnie he didnt remember the exact dates of course but he had an idea that they were flying high in the midsixties part of the swinging london scene mixing with celebrities pop stars and politicians it had always intrigued him the way gangsters became celebrities al capone lucky luciano john dillinger dutch schultz bugsy siegel figures of legend he had known a few of the lesser ones in his time and they almost always rubbed shoulders with the rich and famous as if celebrity recognized only itself and was blind to all else morality decency honor and they never lacked for beautiful women to run around with the kind who were attracted by danger and the aura of violence there seemed to be a glamour and mystique attached to making your money out of running prostitutes supplying drugs and threatening to destroy peoples livelihoods if they didnt pay protection and it was more than likely that most film stars sports personalities and pop stars were addlebrained enough to fall for it the glamour of violence or was it the violence of glamour the krays were no exception they knew how to manipulate the media and being photographed with a famous actress an mp or a peer of the realm made it less likely that the truth about their real activities would come out there was a trial in banks remembered and they came out of that more fireproof than they went in it was hard to believe that graham marshalls dad had had anything to do with them though and banks had to admit that his father was probably right it had just been the beer talking why though why even hint at something like that if there wasnt a scrap of truth in it maybe bill marshall was a pathological liar but over his years as a copper banks had learned that the old cliché theres no smoke without fire had a great deal to recommend it and there were two other things the marshalls came from the east end of london kray territory in the midsixties and banks now remembered feeling afraid around mr marshall he already knew a bit about the krays most of it picked up when he was on the met years ago but he could dig deeper there were plenty of books about them though he doubted that any mentioned bill marshall if he had done anything for them it had obviously been lowlevel going round the customers and exuding physical menace maybe clobbering the occasional informer or doubledealer in a dark alley he would have to tell di hart michelle she had left a message with bankss mother while he was out asking him to drop by thorpe wood at am the following morning it was her case after all if there was a connection though he was surprised that it hadnt come out in the investigation usually the parents come under very close scrutiny in missing child cases no matter how griefstricken they appear banks had once come across a young couple he had believed to be genuinely grieving the loss of their child only to find the poor kid strangled for crying too loud and stuffed in the downstairs freezer no you couldnt trust surfaces in police work you had to dig if only to make certain you werent having the wool pulled over your eyes banks picked up his old transistor radio he had bought a battery earlier and wondered if it would still work after all these years probably not but it was worth the price of a battery to find out he unclipped the back connected the battery and put the earpiece in his ear it was just a single unit like an old hearing aid no stereo radio back then when he turned it on he was thrilled to find that the old trannie actually worked banks could hardly believe it as he tuned the dial though he soon began to feel disappointed the sound quality was poor but it wasnt only that the radio received all the local stations classic fm and radios and just like any modern radio but banks realized he had been halfexpecting to go back in time the idea that this was a magic radio that still received the light programme radio luxembourg and the pirates radio caroline and radio london was lodged somewhere in his mind he had expected to be listening to john peels the perfumed garden to relive those magical few months in the spring of when he should have been studying for his olevels but spent half the night with the radio plugged in his ear hearing captain beefheart the incredible string band and tyrannosaurus rex for the first time banks switched off the radio and turned to his photoplay diary at least he had a bedside light in his room now and didnt have to hide under the sheets with a flashlight beside each week was a fullpage photograph of an actor or actress popular at the time usually an actress or starlet chosen because of pulchritude rather than acting ability and more often than not appearing in a risqué pose bra and panties the carefully placed bedsheet the offtheshoulder strap he flipped through the pages and there they all were natalie wood catherine deneuve martine beswick ursula andress cleavage abounded the week of august was accompanied by a photo of shirley eaton in a lowcut dress as he flipped through the diary banks discovered that he had hardly been voluminous or the least bit analytical he had simply noted events adventures and excursions often in a very cryptic manner in a way it was a perfect model for the policemans notebook he was to keep later still the pages were small divided into seven sections with room for a little fact or piece of cinema history at the bottom if any of the dates happened to be a stars birthday as many did a portion of the available space was taken up with that too given the restrictions he had done a decent enough job he thought deciphering the miniature scrawl he had certainly been to see a lot of films listing all of them in his diary along with his terse opinions which varied from crap and boring through okay to fantastic a typical entry might read went to the odeon with dave and graham to see dr who and the daleks okay played cricket on the rec scored not out or rained stopped in and read casino royale fantastic he flipped to the saturday before graham disappeared the twentyfirst went into town with graham bought help with uncle kens record token it was the same lp they had listened to at pauls the next day that was all he had written nothing unusual about grahams state of mind on friday he had watched the animals one of his favorite groups on ready steady go on sunday he had written probably while in bed that night played records at pauls place new bob dylan lp saw police car go to grahams house on monday grahams run away from home police came joey flew away interesting he should assume that graham had run away from home but of course he would at that age what else the alternatives would have been too horrific for a fourteenyearold boy to contemplate he flipped back to late june around the time he thought the event on the riverbank had occurred it was a tuesday he noticed he hadnt written much about it simply skived off school and played by river this afternoon a strange man tried to push me in tired banks put the diary aside rubbed his eyes and turned out the light it felt odd to be back in the same bed he had slept in during his teenage years the same bed where he had had his first sexual experience with kay summerville while his parents were out visiting his grandparents one saturday it hadnt been very good for either banks or kay but they had persevered and got a lot better with practice kay summerville he wondered where she was what she was doing now probably married with kids the same way he had been until recently shed been a beauty though had kay long blond hair slender waist long legs a mouth like marianne faithfulls firm tits with hard little nipples and hair like spun gold between her legs christ banks he told himself enough with the adolescent fantasies he put on his headphones and turned on his portable cd player listening to vaughan williamss second string quartet and settled back to more pleasant thoughts of kay summerville but as he approached the edge of sleep his thoughts jumbled mixing memory with dream it was cold and dark and banks and graham were walking across a rugby field goalposts silhouetted by the moon cracking spiderweb patterns in the ice as they walked their breath misting the air banks must have said something about the krays having been arrested was he interested in criminals even then and graham just laughed saying the law could never touch people like them banks asked him how he knew and graham said he used to live near them they were kings he said puzzled by the memory or dream banks turned the bedside light on again and picked up the diary if what he had just imagined had any basis in reality then it had happened in winter he glanced through his entries for january and february samantha eggar yvonne romain elke sommer but no mention of the krays until the ninth of march when he had written krays went to trial today graham laughed and said theyd get off easy so graham had mentioned them it was flimsy but a start he turned off the light again and this time he drifted off to sleep without further thoughts of either graham or kay summerville chapter when banks arrived at thorpe wood the following morning and asked to see detective inspector hart he was surprised when a man came down to greet him the telephone call that his mother had told him about when he got back from the pub had been from michelle mr banks or should i say dci banks come with me please if you would he stood aside and gestured for banks to enter and you are detective superintendent shaw well talk in my office shaw looked familiar but banks couldnt place him it was possible they had met on a course or even on a case years ago and he had forgotten but he usually had a good memory for faces they didnt speak on their way to shaws office and as soon as they got there shaw disappeared saying hed be back in a couple of minutes old coppers trick banks knew and shaw knew he knew there wasnt likely to be anything of interest in the office if shaw was willing to leave banks there alone but he had a poke around nonetheless second nature he wasnt looking for anything in particular but just looking for the sake of it the filing cabinets were locked as were the desk drawers and the computer required a password it began to seem very much as if shaw expected banks to nose about there was an interesting framed photograph on the wall quite a few years old by the look of it showing a younger shaw and jet harris standing by an unmarked rover looking for all the world like john thaw and dennis waterman in the sweeney or was it morse and lewis is that how shaw saw himself as sergeant lewis to harriss chief inspector morse the bookcase held mostly binders and back issues of the police review mixed in were a few legal texts and an american textbook called practical homicide investigation banks was browsing through this and trying not to look at the gruesome color illustrations when after half an hour shaw came back followed by a rather embarrassedlooking di michelle hart sorry about that said shaw sitting down opposite banks something came up you know how it is michelle sat to one side looking uncomfortable i know banks put the book aside and reached for a cigarette theres no smoking in here said shaw not anywhere in the building not for any of us these days maybe youre still a bit behind the times back up in yorkshire banks had known that he probably couldnt smoke though shaw had the nicotinestained fingers of a heavy smoker but he thought it at least worth a try obviously though this was going to be played the hard way even though they had done him the courtesy of conducting the interview in the superintendents office rather than in a dingy interview room he didnt feel nervous just puzzled and pissed off what was going on so what can i do for you superintendent shaw you dont remember me do you shaw stared at banks and banks searched through his store of faces for a match the ginger hair was thin on top one long side strand combed over to hide the bald patch but not fooling anyone hardly any eyebrows freckles pale blue eyes the face filled out and jowly the fleshy redveined nose of a seasoned drinker he was familiar but there was something different about him then banks knew youve had your ears fixed he said the wonders of modern medicine shaw reddened so you do remember me you were the baby dc who came to our house after graham disappeared it was hard to believe but shaw would have been about twentyone at the time only seven years older than banks yet he had seemed an adult someone from another world tell me said shaw leaning forward across the table so banks could smell the minty breath of a man who drinks his breakfast ive always wondered did you ever get your budgie back banks leaned back in his chair well now weve got all the pleasantries out of the way why dont we get on with it shaw jerked his head at michelle who slid a photograph across the desk to banks she looked serious with her reading glasses on sexy too banks thought is this the man she asked banks stared at the blackandwhite photo and felt a rush of blood to his brain ears buzzing and vision clouding it all flooded back those few moments of claustrophobia and terror in the strangers grip the moments he had thought were his last are you all right it was michelle who spoke a concerned look on her face im fine he said you look pale would you like a drink of water no thank you said banks its him are you certain after all this time i cant be a hundred percent positive but im as certain as ill ever be shaw nodded and michelle took the picture back why banks asked looking from one to the other what is it james francis mccallum michelle said he went missing from a mental institution near wisbech on thursday june seventeenth that would be about right said banks mccallum hadnt been involved in any violent activity but the doctors told us that the possibility always existed and that he might be dangerous when was he caught banks asked michelle glanced at shaw before answering he gave her a curt nod thats just it she went on he wasnt mccallums body was fished out of the river nene near oundle on the first of july banks felt his mouth open and shut without any sound coming out dead he managed dead echoed shaw he tapped his pen on the desk nearly two months before your friend disappeared so you see dci banks youve been laboring under an illusion for all these years now what im really interested in is why you lied to me and di proctor in the first place banks felt numb from the shock he had just received dead all these years the guilt and all for nothing the man who assaulted him on the riverbank couldnt have abducted and killed graham he should have felt relieved but he only felt confused i didnt lie he muttered call it a sin of omission then you didnt tell us about mccallum doesnt seem as if it would have mattered does it why didnt you tell us look i was just a kid i hadnt told my parents because i was scared how theyd react i was upset and ashamed by what happened dont ask me why i dont know but thats how i felt dirty and ashamed as if it was somehow my fault for inviting it you should have told us it could have been a lead banks knew that shaw was right he had told reluctant witnesses the same thing himself time after time well i didnt and it wasnt he snapped im sorry okay but shaw wasnt going to be so easily put off banks could tell he was enjoying himself throwing his weight around it was the bully mentality to him banks was still the fourteenyearold kid whose budgie had just flown out the door what really happened to your friend he asked what do you mean shaw scratched his chin i remember thinking at the time that you knew something that you were holding something back id like to have taken you to the station had you down in the cells for an hour or so but you were a minor and my senior officer reg proctor was a bit of a softie when it came right down to it what really happened i dont know graham just disappeared are you sure you and your mates didnt set on him maybe it was an accident things just went too far what the hell are you talking about im suggesting that maybe the three of you ganged up on graham marshall for some reason and killed him these things happen then you had to get rid of the body banks folded his arms and tell me how we did that i dont know shaw admitted but i dont have to maybe you stole a car none of us could drive so you say it wasnt the way it is today with tenyearolds behind the wheel is that how it happened a fight broke out and graham got killed maybe fell and smashed his skull or broke his neck im not saying you intended to kill him but it happened didnt it why dont you come clean with me banks itll do you good to get it off your chest after all these years sir shut up di hart well banks im waiting banks stood up youll have a bloody long wait then goodbye he walked toward the door shaw didnt try to stop him just as banks had turned the handle he heard the superintendent speak again and turned to face him shaw was grinning only teasing banks he said then his expression became serious my but youre sensitive the point i want to make is that youre on my turf and it turns out you cant help us any more now than you could all those years ago so my advice to you laddie is to bugger off back up to yorkshire go shag a sheep or two and forget about graham marshall leave it to the pros bloody good job the pros did last time said banks leaving and slamming the door behind him annoyed at himself for losing his temper but unable to prevent it outside the station he kicked a tire lit a cigarette and got in his car maybe shaw was right and he should just head back up north he still had over a weeks holiday left and plenty to do around the cottage whereas there was nothing more he could do down here before driving off he sat for a moment trying to digest what michelle and shaw had told him his guilt over the years had been misplaced then mccallum was in no way responsible for grahams abduction and by extension neither was banks on the other hand if he had reported the incident there was a chance that mccallum might have been apprehended and hospitalized instead of drowning more guilt then banks cast his mind back to that hot june afternoon by the river and asked himself if mccallum would have killed him the answer he decided was yes so sod the bastard and sod guilt mccallum was a dangerous loony and it wasnt bankss fault hed fallen in the fucking river and drowned good riddance turning up the volume on creams crossroads he sped out of the police car park daring one of the patrol cars to chase him nobody did they all looked tired annie thought as the armitage team gathered in the boardroom of western area headquarters late that morning the boardroom was so called because of its long polished table highbacked chairs and paintings of nineteenthcentury cotton magnates on the walls redfaced eyes popping probably because of the tight collars they were wearing annie thought as works of art the paintings were negligible if not execrable but they lent authority to the room detective superintendent gristhorpe sat at the head of the table and poured himself a glass of water also present were dcs templeton rickerd and jackman and detective sergeant jim hatchley still clearly uneasy with annies promotion over him but as banks had told annie more than once jim hatchley was born to be a sergeant and a damn good one too there wasnt much hatchley didnt know about the shady side of eastvale he had a network of informers second only to his network of pub managers and landlords who all kept an eye on criminal comings and goings for him and his tiredness was probably due to the fact that his wife had just given birth to their second child a couple of weeks ago it was the three dcs who had borne the brunt of the previous nights surveillance so were not much further ahead gristhorpe opened no sir said annie who at least had managed her quick pint in relton then gone home for a bath and a few hours sleep before arriving back at the station shortly after dawn except weve checked with the phone company and got lukes records well be tracking down all the people he phoned over the last month though there arent many the ransom call to martin armitage was the only call made after lukes disappearance the only call made that day and it was local wherever luke is hes not far away or he wasnt on tuesday evening anything else weve got a fair idea of lukes movements until fivethirty the day he disappeared go ahead annie walked over to the whiteboard and listed the times and places as she mentioned them she knew the details by heart and didnt need to consult her notebook he arrived at the bus station by the swainsdale centre at a quarter to three the bus driver and several of the passengers remember him weve been looking at some of the closedcircuit tv footage and he walked around the center for a while went into wh smiths then into hmv but he didnt appear to buy anything that takes us up until half past three he appeared in that small computer shop on north market street at a quarter to four which is about right as he was on foot he stayed there half an hour trying out some games then he visited the music shop at the corner of york road and barton place did anyone notice anything unusual about his state of mind gristhorpe asked no everyone said he just seemed normal which i guess was pretty weird to start with i mean he wasnt exactly a barrel of laughs and next the usedbook shop on the market square annie walked over to the window and pointed that one down there normans i know it said gristhorpe what did he buy crime and punishment and portrait of the artist as a young man right up gristhorpes alley annie thought gristhorpe whistled pretty heavy going for a fifteenyearold what next that was it he walked out of the market square cctv range at half past five and we havent found anyone who admits to seeing him since oh and he was also seen talking to a group of lads in the square after coming out of the bookshop it looked as if they were ragging him one of them took the parcel of books from his hand and they tossed it around to one another while he flailed around trying to get it back what happened in the end one of them threw it to him and they went off laughing classmates yes weve had a chat with them at least dc templeton has nothing there sir said templeton theyve all got alibis which direction did he walk off in gristhorpe asked down market street south gristhorpe scratched his chin and frowned what do you make of it all annie he asked i dont know sir hes been gone three nights now and nobodys seen hide nor hair what about the armitages nothing sure theyre telling you the truth theyve no reason to lie now annie said and the kidnapper knows were treating luke as a misper remember it was him who suggested that the armitages get luke to back up their story too late for that now isnt it said dc kevin templeton i mean wasnt he supposed to come home yesterday yes so what happened gristhorpe asked hes probably dead sir cut in dc winsome jackman but why hasnt the kidnapper gone for the money because he knows were watching annie answered its the only explanation he must have seen me when i went up to the shelter to check the briefcase nobody said anything there was nothing they could say annie knew they agreed with her and could all sense what she was feeling herself that gutwrenching fear that she might be responsible for the boys death that if she had stuck to rules and procedure then things might have gone according to plan to give him his due though whatever he thought gristhorpe didnt say anything unless annie went on aye lass well a couple of things have puzzled me about all this right from the start i agree that as kidnappings go its hardly conventional said gristhorpe but go on annie took a sip of water in the first place she said why did the kidnapper wait so long before getting in touch with the armitages and making his demand luke disappeared sometime late monday afternoon or evening according to what weve managed to find out so far yet the demand didnt come until after dark on tuesday maybe the kidnapper didnt get hold of him until tuesday dc templeton suggested you mean he really did run away and just happened to get picked up by a kidnapper before he could go back its possible isnt it too much of a coincidence id say coincidences do happen sometimes maybe or the kidnapper might have been keeping an eye on luke for a while watching his movements biding his time ill grant you thats more likely said gristhorpe annie it still doesnt explain the time delay between lukes not turning up at home monday night and the ransom demand on tuesday evening sir these people dont usually like to waste time if they snatched him on monday then theyd have rung the armitages on monday besides thats only the first thing that bothered me whats next gristhorpe asked well martin armitage told me that when he asked to speak to luke the kidnapper wouldnt let him said luke was somewhere else so said dc templeton thats perfectly likely isnt it but he was calling from lukes mobile annie pointed out i still dont see your point said templeton mobiles are mobile you can take them anywhere thats what theyre for annie sighed think about it kev if lukes being kept somewhere where there isnt a phone then the kidnapper might have to go to a phone box and hed be unlikely to take luke with him but the kidnapper was using lukes mobile so why isnt he with luke could be where theyre keeping the lad is out of cell range suggested dc rickerd possible annie agreed remembering her time out of range but isnt it usual for kidnappers to let the people they want the money from speak to their loved ones isnt it an incentive to pay proof of life good point annie said gristhorpe so weve got two unusual variations on the formula first the time delay and second no proof of life anything else yes said annie the ransom demand what about it asked gristhorpe its nowhere near enough but the armitages arent as rich as people think they are argued templeton my point exactly kev so theyre struggling to maintain swainsdale hall and whatever lifestyle theyve become accustomed to we know that now since i talked to them but it wasnt common knowledge as police were privy to a lot of inside information its our lifeblood but if you kidnapped the son of a famous exmodel and a famous exfootballer living in a place like swainsdale hall how much would you think they were worth how much would you ask them for the life of their son ten thousand twenty thousand fifty id go to a hundred myself or maybe a quarter of a million let them negotiate down a few thousand from there i certainly wouldnt start at ten so maybe the kidnapper knew they were on their uppers templeton suggested maybe its someone who knows the family then why kidnap luke at all why not go for someone who had more money maybe thats all they needed maybe its enough youre clutching at straws kev templeton smiled just playing devils advocate mam thats all but if youre right then perhaps they dont have quite the intelligence were crediting them with okay point taken annie looked at gristhorpe but dont you think its all a bit puzzling when you add it up sir gristhorpe paused and made a steeple of his thick fingers on the desk before answering i do he said i cant say ive had to deal with many kidnappings over the course of my career and for that i thank the lord because its a cowardly crime but ive dealt with a few and none of them have been as riddled with anomalies as this one what are your conclusions annie either its an amateur job annie answered very amateur like some junkie who saw the chance to get enough money for his next few fixes and now hes too scared to go through with it or or its something else entirely a setup a diversion the ransom demand merely to deflect us confuse us and something else is going on like what gristhorpe asked i dont know sir annie answered all i know is that in either scenario the outcome looks bad for luke it wasnt fair thought andrew naylor the man from the ministry as he drove his government range rover over the disinfectant pad at the entrance to the unfenced road above gratly he had nothing to do with footandmouth control yet in the eyes of the locals all government employees were tarred with the same brush everyone knew him in the area and before the outbreak no one had paid him much mind now though he was getting sick of the resentful looks he got when he walked into a shop or a pub the way conversations stopped and whispers began and the way people sometimes even expressed their anger to his face in one pub they had been so hostile toward him he thought they were going to beat him up it didnt do the slightest bit of good to tell them that he worked for the department for the environment food and rural affairs defra in the water and land directorate and that his job was water because that only made them think of yorkshire water of droughts leakages shortages and restrictions on washing their bloody cars and watering their lawns and then they got even angrier it was part of andrews job to collect water samples from local lakes ponds tarns and reservoirs and these were later tested for contaminants at the central science laboratory because some of these bodies of water were surrounded by open country andrew was one of the few with a special dispensation to visit them after taking all the proper precautions of course that day his last call was hallam tarn a godforsaken hollowedout bowl of water on the very top of the moor beyond tetchley fell legend had it that the place used to be a village once but the villagers took to satanic practices so god smote them with his fist and the tarn was created in place of the village it was said that on certain days of the year you could see the old houses and streets beneath the waters surface and hear the cries of the villagers sometimes when the light was right and the curlews cry piped across the desolate moor andrew could almost believe it today though the sun was shining and the honeyed air was still and sweet summer seemed to have arrived at last and andrew couldnt imagine any hint of evil taking place the deepest part of the tarn ran closest to the road and a tall solid drystone wall separated it from children and drunks and anyone else foolish enough to wander around up there in the dark to get access to the water you had to drive a few yards farther on cross the stile and take a footpath that led to its shallow shore in the days before the government restrictions it had been a popular spot for ramblers and picnickers but these days it was offlimits except to people such as andrew a government poster nailed to the stile warned people to stay out on penalty of a steep fine before heading out with his dinghy and his sample jar andrew sprayed his wellington boots with disinfectant and donned his plastic outerwear he felt like a spaceman preparing for a walk on the moon he also felt hot inside the protective clothing and all he wanted to do was get this over with as soon as possible then head home for a nice long bath and an evening out in northallerton with nancy maybe the pictures a spot of dinner and a drink after feeling the sweat drip down the back of his neck he walked along the narrow dirt path the hundred yards or so to the edge of the tarn and squatted by the waterside to fill his sample jar it was so quiet up there he could imagine himself the only man left in the world because he had to take samples from various depths he got in the small dinghy and began to row the tarn wasnt much bigger than a large pond maybe a couple of hundred yards long and a hundred wide but it was quite deep in places andrew felt a little disquiet at being out there all alone not another soul in sight and whenever he looked down into the water he fancied he could see a roof or a street below it was an optical illusion of course most likely caused by the sun on the water but it unnerved him nonetheless when he neared the wall he noticed some dark material snagged on the roots of an old tree the tree was gone but gnarled roots still jutted out of the bank like arms reaching out of a grave and there was something about their arched sinewy shapes that upset andrew even more curious about the material however he put his fears aside and rowed closer legends and myths couldnt harm him when he got near enough he stretched out his arm and tried to free the material from the root it was heavier than he thought and as it jerked free the dinghy tipped and andrew offbalance fell into the tarn he was a strong swimmer so drowning didnt worry him but what chilled his blood was that the thing he was holding tightly as a lover in a slow dance was a dead body and from its ashen face open dead eyes looked directly into his andrew let go of the burden mouth full of bile he struggled back into the dinghy salvaged his oars and rowed back to shore where he stopped only long enough to be sick before squelching back to his van hoping to god his mobile worked up there it didnt cursing he threw it on the floor and started the van with shaking hands as he drove back toward helmthorpe he glanced frequently in his rearview mirror to make sure that no misshapen supernatural beasts from the depths of the tarn were following him banks still felt angry when he pulled up outside his parents house brakes squealing but before he went inside he took several deep breaths determined not to let it show his parents didnt need it they had problems enough of their own he found his father in front of the television watching horse racing and his mother in the kitchen fussing over a cake im heading home this afternoon he said popping his head around the kitchen door thanks for letting me stay theres always a bed for you here his mother said you know that son have you finished what you came for not really said banks but theres not a lot more i can do youre a policeman surely you can do something to help the ways bankss mother said policeman wasnt quite as vehement as the way his father said it nor was it as tinged with distaste as the way she used to say it but it wasnt far off which was why it had surprised banks when mrs marshall told him his mother was proud of him bankss mother had always made it clear that she thought he had sold himself short that he should have gone into commerce and worked himself up to be managing director of some big international company it didnt seem to matter how well he did in his job or how often he was promoted to his mother his career choice was undignified and his achievements always seemed to pale beside those of his stockbroker brother roy banks had always suspected that roy was a bit of a shady dealer a frequent enough occurrence in the world of financial speculation in his experience though he would never voice such suspicions to his mother or indeed to roy himself still he lived in dread of that telephone call coming from his brother one day alan can you help me im in a bit of a fix with the law its not my case mum he said the locals are good theyll do the best they can will you have something to eat with us before you go of course know what id like what fish and chips from over the road said banks ill get them my treat well maybe ill have a fish cake said his mother your dad hasnt eaten from there since it went chinese though go on dad said banks turning to the living room or maybe you should stick to your lowfat diet bugger low fat said arthur banks ill have the special and chips just make sure theres no bloody chop suey or sweet and sour sauce gone anywhere near it banks winked at his mother and walked over to the shop the strip of shops across the main road set back by a stretch of tarmac for customer parking had gone through dozens of changes over the years when banks first moved to the estate he remembered there had been the fish and chips shop a ladies hairdresser a butchers a greengrocers and a launderette now there was a videorental shop a takeaway pizza and tandoori place called caesars taj mahal a minimart and a unisex hair salon the only constants were the fish and chips shop which now also sold takeaway chinese food and the newsagents which according to the signs was still run by the walkers who had taken over from donald bradford all those years ago in banks wondered what had become of bradford he was said to have been devastated over what had happened to graham had the local police ever followed up on him banks waited to cross the busy road to the left of the shops stood the remains of the old ballbearing factory still untouched for some reason it could hardly be for historical preservation as it was a real eyesore the gates were chained and padlocked shut and it was surrounded by high wiremesh fencing with barbed wire on top the windows beyond covered by rusty grilles despite these security precautions most of the windows were broken anyway and the front of the blackened brick building was covered in colorful graffiti banks remembered when the place was in full production lorries coming and going the factory whistle blowing and crowds of workers waiting at the bus stop a lot of them were young women or girls scarcely out of school a rough lot his mother called them and banks often used to time his visits to the shops to coincide with the factory gates opening because he lusted after some of the girls there was one girl in particular he remembered who used to stand at the bus stop smoking a faraway look in her eyes scarf done up like a turban on her head even her serviceable work clothes couldnt disguise the curves and she had pale smooth skin and looked a bit like julie christie in billy liar when banks used to walk as casually as possible past the bus stop he remembered as he stood in the fish and chips shop queue the other girls used to tease him with lewd comments and make him blush hey mandy one of them would call out here comes that lad again i think he fancies you they would all howl with laughter mandy would tell them to shut up and banks would blush once mandy tousled his hair and gave him a cigarette he smoked it over a week taking a few drags at a time then nicking it to save for later in the end it tasted like something he might have picked up from the gutter but he finished it anyway after that mandy would sometimes smile when he passed by she had a nice smile sometimes strands of hair escaped from under her turban and curled over her cheek and other times she might have a smudge of oil or dirt on her face she must have been about eighteen four years age difference far from an impossible gap when you get older but wider than the grand canyon at that age then one day he noticed that she had started wearing an engagement ring and a few weeks later she no longer stood at the bus stop with the others and he never saw her again where was mandy now he wondered shed be in her fifties if she was still alive older than kay summerville had she put on a lot of weight had her hair turned gray did she look old and worn after years of struggle and poverty had she stayed married to the same man had she won the lottery and gone to live on the costa del sol did she ever think of that lovestruck adolescent who used to time his visits to the shops so he could see her waiting at the bus stop he doubted it very much the lives we leave behind so many people our paths cross for a while even as fleetingly as his had crossed mandys and we move on some encounters are impressed indelibly in our memories others slip away into the void of course mandy never thought of him he was a mere passing amusement to her whereas she fed deeper into his adolescent dreams of sex and in his memory she would always be standing there with her hip against the bus stop smoking with a faraway look in her eyes a loose lock of hair resting softly against her pale cheek always beautiful and always eighteen two specials and chips and one fish cake banks paid for the fish and chips and set off back home carrying the paper bag no newspaperwrapped fish and chips anymore dirty not healthy there was a telephone call for you while you were out alan his mother said when he got back who was it same woman as called last night have you got a new girlfriend already already sandra had been gone nearly two years was pregnant with another mans child and about to marry him had banks got a new girlfriend already no mum he said its one of the local coppers you already know that from last night they let women on the force these days no need to be cheeky eat your fish and chips before they go cold what did she say to ring her back when you had a moment i wrote down the number just in case youd forgotten it bankss mother rolled her eyes when he left the table and headed toward the telephone his father didnt notice he had his fish and chips on the paper on his lap and was eating them with his fingers engrossed in the onethirty from newmarket glass of beer balanced precariously on the arm of the chair the number scribbled on the pad by the hall telephone wasnt familiar it certainly wasnt thorpe wood curious banks dialed di hart here whos speaking michelle its me alan banks ah dci banks you left a message for me to call is this your mobile number thats right look first off im sorry about detective superintendent shaw this morning thats all right not your fault i just felt well anyway im surprised hes taking such an interest its not even his case i had him marked down as just putting in time till his retirement now hes all over me like a dirty shirt what did you want to talk to me about are you going home yes when i dont know this afternoon this evening no point hanging around where im not wanted dont feel sorry for yourself it doesnt suit you only i was wondering if youd like to meet up for a chat before you go if youre not in a hurry any particular reason perhaps because i didnt treat you like an undesirable alien despite your less than polite introduction yes okay why not shall we say half past five in starbucks cathedral square theres a starbucks in peterborough dont sound so surprised were very withit these days theres a mcdonalds too if youd prefer no starbucks will do fine halffive it is thatll give me plenty of time to pack and say my goodbyes see you there annie and gristhorpe arrived at hallam tarn in time to see two police frogmen haul up the body and pull it back to shore with them peter darby crime scene photographer sat in a dinghy nearby and videotaped everything he had already taken several stills and polaroids of the spot where the body had been first seen by andrew naylor one of the lads at helmthorpe had found a dry set of clothes for naylor and he stood with the small group chewing his fingernails as the frogmen edged closer to shore once on shore they laid the body on the grass at the feet of dr burns the police surgeon dr glendenning the home office pathologist was unavailable that day as he had been called in to help a colleague with a difficult case in scarborough detective sergeant stefan nowak crime scene coordinator and his sceneofcrime officers were on their way well annie thought with some relief at least it wasnt a floater she had been at the scene of more than one bloated misshapen lump pulled from the water and she didnt relish another but when she saw the face she would gladly have accepted an anonymous floater any day the body was luke armitages no doubt about it he was wearing the black tshirt and jeans that robin said he had on when he went to eastvale and he hadnt been in the water long enough for his features to become unrecognizable though the skin was white and there were signs of cutis anserina more commonly known as gooseflesh the once dark curls were straight now and stuck to his head and face like seaweed annie stood aside and let dr burns perform his in situ examination this is going to be difficult he told annie in general bodies decompose twice as fast in air as in water but there are so many variables to take into account any chance he drowned the doctor examined lukes mouth for signs of foam and his eyes for the telltale petechial hemorrhages associated with asphyxia of which drowning is a form he shook his head and turned back to annie hard to be certain well have a better idea when dr glendenning checks the lungs and runs a diatomic analysis diatoms annie knew from her basic courses in forensic science were microorganisms that lived in the water if you drowned you breathed in a lot of them with the water and they spread to every nook and cranny of your body even your bone marrow if you hadnt drowned but were found dead in water then a few diatoms might be found but they would be nowhere near as abundant or widely spread dr burns turned the body over and pointed to the back of lukes head annie could see the signs of a blow would that have been enough to cause death she asked hard blow to the cerebellum said dr burns certainly he began to examine the body in more detail hes cold he said and theres no rigor what does that tell you usually a body is cold after eight to ten hours in the water ill have to take his temperature to substantiate this of course and well need to know the temperature of the water too as for the rigor given the obvious effects of water on his skin it must have come and gone how long does that take in water anything from two to four days not sooner not usually no again though ill have to make some temperature checks it might be summer but weve hardly been enjoying seasonal temperatures of late two days annie thought it was thursday afternoon now and the ransom demand had come two days ago on tuesday evening was luke already dead by then if so his death had nothing to do with her rash actions she began to feel a glimmer of hope if that was the case then the kidnapper was trying to cash in on lukes death which could have come about for other reasons curious she would have to begin casting about for a motive now the sound of an approaching van interrupted annies stream of thought and she looked across to the wall to see ds nowak and his soco team jumping the stile one after another looking like sheep in their white protective clothing well she thought maybe the experts would be able to tell her a bit more banks arrived half an hour early for his meeting with michelle parked in the short stay round the back of the town hall and cut through the arcade to bridge street where he nipped into waterstones and bought a book called the profession of violence the story of the kray twins as he walked up the busy street toward the square he marveled at how much the city center had changed since his day for a start it was all pedestrian precinct now not busy roads the way it had been when he lived there and it seemed cleaner the buildings less shabby and grimecoated it was a sunny afternoon and tourists wandered in and out of the cathedral grounds into the square to spend a while browsing through the shops banks found it all quite pleasant which didnt square with his memory of being stuck in a dirty smallminded provincial backwater maybe it was he who had changed the most he found starbucks on the corner by the cathedral entrance and sipped a grande latte while he flipped through the book michelle arrived five minutes late cool and collected wearing black slacks and a slategray jacket over a cream blouse she went to the counter for a cappuccino then sat down opposite banks bit of a shock for you wasnt it this morning she said i suppose so banks said after all these years i dont know i suppose id allowed myself to believe there had to be a connection conned myself we all do one way or another youre too young to be so cynical and you should be old and wise enough to realize that flattery will get you nowhere youve got a bit of froth on your lip before banks could wipe it away michelle reached out her finger and did it for him her fingertip brushing his lip thanks he said michelle blushed turned her head away and let out a little giggle i dont know why i did that she said my mother used to do it when i drank milk shakes havent had a milk shake in years said banks me neither what next home and you dunno the leads are hardly jumping out at me left right and center banks thought for a moment he hadnt told shaw about the possible kray connection because shaw had behaved like a bastard besides it wasnt his case there was no reason to keep it from michelle though it probably meant nothing but at least it would give her something to do the illusion of progress ive heard rumors that graham marshalls dad was connected with the krays in london just before the family moved up here connected in what way strongarm man enforcer i dont know how true it is you know how these things can be exaggerated but it might be worth a bit of delving into how do you know this banks touched the side of his nose ive got my sources and how long have you known just found out before i came here yeah and the popes jewish the point is what are you going to do about it michelle moved the froth in her cup around with a spoon i dont suppose itd do any harm to set a few inquiries in motion might even get a trip to london out of it you sure i wont come out looking like a complete moron i cant guarantee that its always a risk better than being the moron who missed the vital clue though thanks thats really encouraging i dont know very much about the krays before my time i havent even seen the film i do remember the big funeral they gave one of them in the east end not so long ago though thatd be reggie couple of years ago the whole east end came out for him it was the same when ronnie died in very popular among east enders the krays were loved their mother there were three of them an older brother called charlie but ronnie and reggie the twins are the ones people focus on they pretty much ran the east end during the fifties and sixties and a fair bit of the west end too till they got put away ronnie was the crazy one paranoid schizophrenic he ended up in broadmoor reggie was category a in parkhurst i suppose you could say that he was led astray by his more dominant twin brother if you wanted to be charitable but what could they have to do with graham marshalls disappearance and murder probably nothing banks said they didnt operate outside london much except for maybe a few clubs in cities like birmingham or leicester but if bill marshall did work for them then theres always the chance he left them reason to bear a grudge and the twins had a long reach and for that theyd kill his son i dont know michelle these people have a very warped sense of justice and dont forget ronnie was crazy he was a sexual sadist a serious pervert among other things he was the one who walked into the blind beggar and shot george cornell right between the eyes in front of a roomful of witnesses know what was playing on the jukebox tell me it was the walker brothers the sun aint gonna shine anymore and they say the needle got stuck on anymore when he was shot how melodramatic i dont remember the walker brothers not many people do want me to sing you a couple of verses i thought you said you never sing to women youve just met i did dont you remember nothing slips past you does it not much i know you read philip larkin too how you quoted him im impressed anyway who knows how someone like ronnie kray thinks if think is even the right word he was seeing enemies all around him by then and coming up with more and more dramatic ways of hurting people he loved to inspire fear and trembling even in his own men he was also a homosexual with a taste for teenage boys they wouldnt have done graham themselves of course theyd have got agoraphobia if they came this far north of london but they could have sent someone to do it anyway its not only that what then if bill marshall did work as a strongarm man for the krays what was he doing up here you know as well as i do that people dont just walk away from that line of work maybe he got himself fixed up with someone local a branch manager so youre saying he might have been up to the same tricks here and that might have had something to do with grahams death im just saying its possible thats all worth investigating there was a reference to a protection racket in the old crime logs michelle said someone called carlo fiorino ring any bells vaguely said banks maybe his name was in the papers when i was a kid anyway its something to think about so why didnt it come up in the original investigation didnt it said banks dunno want another coffee michelle looked into her empty cup sure banks went and got two more coffees and when he came back michelle was leafing through the book borrow it if you want he said i just picked it up to see if i could fill in a bit more background thanks id like to read it did graham ever mention the krays to you yes but im not sure that he ever said he or his dad knew them ive also been thinking about the time frame graham and his parents came up here around july or august in july there was a big brouhaha in the press over ronnies alleged homosexual relationship with lord boothby who denied everything and sued the sunday mirror for libel ronnie followed suit but all he got was an apology still there was an upside in that the press had to lay off the krays for a while after that nobody wanted any more libel suits one day ronnie was a thug and a gangster the next a sporting gentleman it set the police investigation back too everyone had to walk on eggs around them even so they were arrested the next january for demanding money with menaces there was no bail and they were tried at the old bailey what happened they got off it was a flimsy enough case to start with there was talk of jury tampering see back then there was no majority verdict like we have today all twelve had to agree or thered be a retrial which would give the accused even more time to fix things they dug up some dirt on one of the main prosecution witnesses and that was it they were free but how does any of this relate to graham im not saying it does only that that was what was happening around and the period were concerned with the krays were in the public eye a lot the libel case and the trial were both big news and after they got off they were fireproof for a long time it was the start of their ascendancy as celebrities the dark side of swinging london you might say soon they were being photographed with film stars sporting figures and pop singers barbara windsor sonny liston judy garland victor spinetti who was in a hard days night help and magical mystery tour if you can handle another piece of trivia in the summer of they had a fiddle involving selling stolen american securities and bonds for the mafia and they were squaring up for a big fight with their rivals the richardson gang banks tapped the book its all in there i dont know if it means anything but as your boss made clear this morning its none of my business michelle frowned yeah i know i keep thinking hes looking over my shoulder even now in here i dont want you to get into trouble for talking to me dont worry i wasnt followed im only being paranoid it doesnt mean youre not being followed will you keep in touch let me know if you come up with anything i shouldnt but i will and if theres any way i can help of course if you remember anything graham said or did that might be useful id appreciate knowing you will look grahams mother mentioned a funeral when the remains have been released any idea how long that might be im not sure it shouldnt be long ill see how dr coopers doing tomorrow would you good i think id like to come down for it even shaw cant complain about that will you let me know of course can i ask you something go ahead that remark shaw made about the budgie what did he mean banks related the sad story of joeys flight to freedom and certain death by the end michelle was smiling thats so sad she said you must have been heartbroken i got over it he wasnt exactly a wonderbudgie he couldnt even talk as everyone told me at the time it wasnt goldie the eagle goldie the eagle yes earlier the same year goldie the eagle escaped from london zoo they got her back a couple of weeks later it was a big story at the time but your joey was never found no he had no defenses he must have thought he was home free but he couldnt survive all the predators out there he was in way over his plumage look banks went on will you answer a question for me michelle nodded but looked wary and shuffled in her seat are you married banks asked no she said no im not and she got up and walked out without even saying goodbye banks was about to go after her when his mobile rang cursing and feeling like a bit of a pillock the way he always did when it went off in a public place banks answered the call alan its annie hope i havent called at a bad time no not at all only we could use a bit of extra help if youve finished your business down there pretty much said banks thinking that his partings with both members of the local constabulary he had met left a lot to be desired whats up know that missing kid i told you about luke armitage thats the one what about him it looks as if its just turned into a murder case shit said banks im on my way chapter strictly speaking you know said banks this is your case it has been from the start are you sure you want me muscling in i wouldnt have rung you if i didnt would i said annie besides you know im not that kind of copper what kind of copper all territorial and bureaucratic i dont go in for pissing matches im all for cooperation me not competition fair enough lets chalk my comment down to recent experience what do you mean banks told her about detective superintendent shaw well annie said dont say i didnt warn you they wouldnt exactly welcome you with open arms thanks my pleasure anyway you can help me just as long as you give me the respect i deserve and dont treat me like a skivvy have i ever this is a pretty good start bankss car was in the garage for servicing and wouldnt be ready until after lunch so they had signed out a department car that morning and annie was driving something banks usually liked to do himself i was thinking i could sort of get to like it said banks theres a lot to be said for having a chauffeuse annie shot him a look feel like getting out and walking the rest of the way no thanks well behave yourself anyway she went on if you want to be all official about it its the big mans case hes the sio and hes the one who suggested if i asked you nicely you might come back from leave early and give us the benefit of your considerable expertise the big man detective superintendent gristhorpe does he know you call him that annie grinned you should hear what we call you in the squad room i must say its great to be home said banks annie glanced sideways at him how did things go other than your runin with the local constabulary all a bit embarrassing really banks told her about mccallum turning out to be an escaped mental patient who drowned before graham disappeared im so sorry alan she said touching his knee after all those years feeling guilty and responsible but you must be relieved in a way i mean knowing it couldnt have been him so it wasnt your fault i suppose i must you know apart from the police down there youre the only other person ive ever told about what happened by the river that day you never told sandra no why i dont know banks felt annie retreat into silence beside him and knew hed done again exactly the sort of thing that caused her to end their romantic relationship it was as if she offered him something warm soft and sensitive yet the moment he reached out and touched it she shot back into her hard impenetrable shell before either of them could think of anything else to say they arrived at the end of the armitages drive where reporters clamored around them with pens microphones and cameras the officer on duty lifted the tape and let them through impressive said banks when the buildings solid symmetrical architecture came into view ive only seen the place from the riverside walk before just wait until you meet the beautiful people inside go easy annie theyve just lost their son annie sighed i know that and i will okay okay im just not looking forward to this who dealt with the identification winsome did last night so you havent seen the family since the boys body was found no if you dont think im being patronizing why dont you let me deal with them be my guest honest given my track record with martin armitage id be grateful to be an observer this time fresh approach and all that okay josie answered the front door almost the moment they rang the bell and led the two of them into the living room where banks introduced himself what is it now martin armitage asked glaring at annie neither he nor his wife looked as if they had had much sleep and they probably hadnt a murder investigation said banks or so it seems and we need your help i dont see how we can help any more than we have done already we cooperated with you against the kidnappers wishes and look what happened he glanced toward annie again voice rising i hope you realize this is your fault that lukes death is your responsibility if you hadnt followed me to the shelter and then come nosing around here the kidnapper would have picked up the money and luke would be home safe and sound martin said robin armitage weve been over this again and again dont make a scene dont make a scene good god woman this is your son were talking about she as good as killed him calm down mr armitage said banks martin armitage wasnt quite as tall as banks had imagined but he was fit and bursting with energy not the kind of man to sit around waiting for results but one who went out and made the result happen that was the way hed played football too banks remembered armitage hadnt been content to hang around the goalmouth waiting for a midfielder to feed him the ball he had created scoring opportunities himself and the main criticism leveled at him was that he was greedy for the ball more apt to shoot and miss than pass to someone in a better scoring position he had also lacked selfcontrol and attracted a high number of red and yellow cards banks remembered once seeing him lash out at a member of the other team who had taken the ball from him fairly in the penalty area hed given away a penalty over that and it lost his side the game this is a difficult enough job as it is said banks without you making it worse im sorry for your loss but its no good flinging blame about we dont know how or why luke died yet we dont even know where or when so until weve been able to answer some of those basic questions were not in a position to jump to conclusions i suggest you exercise the same restraint what else would you say said martin you always stick together you lot can we get down to business yes of course said robin sitting on the sofa in jeans and a pale green blouse long legs crossed hands folded on her lap without makeup and with her famous goldblond hair tied back in a ponytail she still looked gorgeous banks thought and the crowsfeet only enhanced her beauty she had the classic models face high cheekbones small nose pointed chin perfect proportion but she also had character and individuality in her features banks had once worked on a case for the met involving a modeling agency and he had been surprised that so many of these women who looked beautiful in magazines and on television lacked something in real life their features perfect but bland unformed and unfinished like a blank canvas or an actor without a role but robin armitage had presence im sure you know said banks that lukes death changes everything it changes the way we proceed in the investigation and were going to have to go over much of the same ground again this may seem tedious and pointless to you but believe me its necessary im new to the case but i took the time this morning to familiarize myself with the investigation so far and i have to say that ive found nothing out of order nothing i wouldnt have done had i been in charge myself like i said martin chipped in you lot stick together ill be complaining to the chief constable hes a personal friend of mine thats your privilege but hell only tell you the same as im telling you if everyone gave in to a kidnappers demands without informing the police it would be the most popular crime in the country but look what happened when we did inform the police our son is dead something went wrong this was an unusual case from the start there are a number of inconsistencies what are you suggesting that it wasnt a straightforward kidnapping there was nothing straightforward about it at all mr armitage i dont understand said robin the phone call the ransom demand they were genuine surely yes said annie taking a cue from banks but the ransom demand came an unusually long time after luke disappeared the kidnapper didnt let you speak to your son and the sum he asked for was ridiculously low i dont know what youre talking about said martin were not made of money i know that annie said but how would the kidnapper know to all intents and purposes footballers and models make millions and youre living in a mansion martin frowned i suppose youve got a point unless yes banks picked up the questioning again unless it was someone close to us can you think of anyone of course not i cant imagine any of our friends doing something like this are you insane mrs armitage robin shook her head no well still need a list of people to talk to im not having you going around bullying our friends said martin dont worry well be discreet and dont forget youre the one who suggested it might be someone close to you anyone have a grudge against either of you a few goalies i suppose said martin but nothing serious no mrs armitage i dont think so modeling can be a brutally competitive career and im sure i stood on my share of toes on the catwalk but nothing so terrible i mean nothing to make anyone do something like this especially so long after if youd both like to think about it for a while it would be a great help you said it was odd that he wouldnt let us talk to luke robin said its unusual yes annie answered do you think it was because because luke was already dead thats possible said annie but we wont know until the pathologist has finished his job when will that be perhaps by this evening or early tomorrow dr burns the police surgeon had been unable to give an accurate estimate of time of death at the scene so they would have to wait until dr glendenning had finished his postmortem examination of lukes body even then they had learned not to expect miracles from medical science can you remember anything else about the caller banks asked martin armitage ive told you everything i know i cant remember any more the voice definitely wasnt familiar no one i recognized and there was only the one call yes is there anything else you can tell us that might be of help both martin and robin armitage shook their heads banks and annie got up well need to have a look at lukes room next said banks and then wed like to talk to your housekeeper and her husband josie and calvin said martin but why they might be able to help i cant see how were they close to luke not especially if truth be told i always got the impression that they thought him a bit of a weirdo theyre wonderful people salt of the earth but sort of traditional in their views of people and behavior and luke didnt fit the mold no he might as well have come from outer space as far as theyre concerned was there any animosity of course not they are our employees after all what are you suggesting that they had something to do with this im not suggesting anything merely asking look mr armitage i can understand your feelings honestly i can but you must let us do our jobs the way we see fit its not going to help at all if you start challenging every move we make i promise you well be as discreet as we can with all our inquiries no matter what you think we dont go around bullying people but we also dont accept everything at face value people lie for a variety of reasons many of them irrelevant to the investigation but sometimes its because they did it and its for us to sort out the lies from the truth youve already lied to us once yourself that we know of when you rang di cabbot and told her youd heard from luke i did that to protect luke i understand why you did it but it was still a lie maybe you can see how complicated our job becomes when you take all the lies into account the lies of the innocent especially as i said we dont take things or people at face value and like it or not every murder investigation begins close to home then moves outward now if you dont mind well take a look at lukes room michelle had been joking when she told banks she was getting paranoid but she was beginning to think that every time she visited the archives mrs metcalfe rang detective superintendent shaw here he was again preceded by the dark chill of his shadow on the threshold of the tiny room any progress he asked leaning against the door im not sure said michelle ive been going over the old crime reports for looking for some sort of connection with grahams disappearance and have you found any not directly no i told you you were wasting your time maybe not entirely what do you mean michelle paused she had to be careful what she said because she didnt want shaw to know that banks had tipped her off to the kray connection that would send him into a tantrum she could well do without i was reading over the reports and statements on a protection racket investigation in july and grahams dads name came up so wheres the connection a club on church street called le phonographe i remember that place it was a discotheque michelle frowned i thought disco was in the seventies not the sixties im not talking about the music but the establishment itself clubs like le phonographe offered memberships and served meals usually an inedible beef burger if my memory serves me well so they could sell alcohol legally after regular closing time theyd stay open till three in the morning or so thered be music and dancing too but it was usually motown or soul you sound familiar with the place sir i was young once di hart besides le phonographe was the sort of place you kept an eye on it was a villains club owned by a nasty piece of work called carlo fiorino used to like to pretend he was mafia wore the striped widelapel suits pencilthin mustache spats and everything very untouchables but his father was a pow who ended up staying on after the war and marrying a local farm girl out huntingdon way plenty of local villains hung out there and you could often pick up a tip or two and i dont mean for the threethirty at kempton park so it was a criminal hangout back then yes but petty people who liked to think they were big players including bill marshall yes so you knew about bill marshalls activities of course we did he was strictly a minor presence we kept an eye on him it was routine what was this carlo fiorinos game bit of everything soon as the new town expansion was well under way he turned le phonographe into a more upmarket club with decent grub a better dance floor and a casino he also owned an escort agency we think he also got into drugs prostitution and pornography but he was always clever enough to stay one step ahead and he played both sides against the middle most of the time what do you mean sir got himself shot in a drug war with the jamaicans in but he never did time never got charged with anything far as i remember doesnt that strike you as odd sir odd shaw seemed to snap out of his reminiscing mood and become his grumpy old self again he stuck his face so close to hers that she could smell his tobaccomintandwhiskey breath and see the lattice of purple veins throbbing in his bulbous nose ill tell you whats bloody odd di hart its you asking these questions thats whats odd none of this can possibly have anything to do with what happened to graham marshall and thats a fact youre muckraking i dont know why but thats what youre doing sir all im doing is trying to get a handle on the circumstances of the boys disappearance looking over the investigation and over other investigations around the same time seems a reasonable way of doing it to me its not your brief to look into the marshall investigation di hart or any other for that matter who do you think you are complaints and discipline stick to your job but sir bill marshall was one of the men interviewed in connection with this protection racket all involved with carlo fiorino and le phonographe some of the city center shopkeepers filed a complaint and marshall was one of the people they named was he charged no sir only questioned one of the original complainants ended up in hospital and the other witnesses backed off retracted their statements no further action shaw smirked then its hardly relevant is it but doesnt it seem odd to you that no further action was taken and that when graham marshall disappeared his father never came under close scrutiny even though he had recently been implicated in a criminal ring why should he maybe he didnt do it did that thought ever enter your head and even if he was involved in some petty protection racket it doesnt make him a child killer does it even by your standards thats a long stretch of the imagination was bill marshall a police informer he might have let slip the odd snippet of information thats how we played the game back then tit for tat is that why he was protected from prosecution how the hell should i know if youve read your paperwork youll know i wasnt on that case he took a deep breath then seemed to relax and soften his tone look he said policing was different back then there was more giveandtake plenty of take michelle thought shed heard stories of the old days of departments of stations and even of whole counties run wild but she didnt say anything so we bent the rules every now and then shaw continued grow up welcome to the real world michelle made a mental note about bill marshalls possible role as a police informer if he had informed on criminals here in peterborough she could only imagine what the krays might have done if hed tried anything like that with them and then disappeared the south pole wouldnt have been far enough let alone peterborough from what i can piece together she went on the graham marshall investigation followed one line of inquiry and one only when it became clear that he hadnt run away from home a sex killing by a passing pervert well whats so odd about that its what the evidence pointed to just seems a bit of a coincidence thats all that some pervert should happen to be driving by a quiet street at that hour in the morning just as grahams doing his paper rounds wrong place at the wrong time happens often enough besides do you think perverts dont know about paper rounds dont you think someone could have been watching studying stalking the marshall kid the way such perverts often do or didnt they teach you that at bramshill its possible sir you think you can do better than us do you said shaw his face turning red again think you can outdetect jet harris i didnt say that sir its just the advantage of hindsight thats all a long perspective look we worked our bollocks off on that case jet harris reg proctor and me not to mention dozens more dcs and uniforms have you any idea what that sort of investigation is like the scope of it how wide a net we cast we were getting a hundred sightings a day from as far afield as penzance and the mull of fucking kintyre now you come along with your fancy education and your bramshill courses and you have the gall to tell me we were wrong michelle took a deep breath im not saying you were wrong sir only you didnt solve the case did you you didnt even find a body look i know you came up the hard way and i respect that but there are advantages to an education yes accelerated promotion they let you buggers run before you can toddle policing has changed sir as you pointed out not so long ago and crime has changed too sod that for a theory dont spout your booklearning at me a criminals a criminal only the coppers have got softer especially the ones at the top michelle sighed time to change tack you were a dc on the graham marshall investigation sir can you tell me anything at all look if id known anything wed have solved the bloody case wouldnt we instead of having you point out how stupid we were im not trying to make anyone look stupid arent you thats how it sounds to me its easy to secondguess given twentytwenty hindsight if bill marshall had anything to do with his sons disappearance believe me wed have had him in the first place he had an alibi who sir his wife not the most reliable of alibis is it shed hardly give him an alibi for doing in her own son now would she tell me even you arent so twisted as to think mrs marshall was involved we dont know sir do we but michelle remembered mrs marshall her sincerity and dignity the need to bury her son after all these years certainly it was possible she was lying some criminals are very good actors but michelle didnt think so and she wouldnt be getting any answers out of bill marshall did the marshalls own a car yes they did but dont expect me to remember the make and number look bill marshall might have been a bit of a jackthelad but he wasnt a child molester how do you know that was the motive behind grahams abduction have some brains woman why else does a fourteenyearold boy go missing without a trace if you ask me id still say he might have been one of brady and hindleys victims though we could never prove it but its way out of their area a geographical profiler more benefits of a university education profilers dont make me laugh ive had enough of this its about time you stopped nosing about down here and got back on the bloody job and he turned and stalked out michelle noticed that her hand was shaking when he left and she felt her breath held tight in her chest she didnt like confrontation with authority she had always respected her bosses and the police hierarchy in general an organization like the police couldnt run efficiently without a quasimilitary structure she believed orders given and obeyed sometimes without question if it came right down to it but shaws rage seemed out of proportion to the situation she got up and returned the files to their boxes and gathered together her notes it was well after lunchtime and time for some fresh air anyway perhaps she would make a few phone calls find someone whod been on the job during the kray era and head down to london the next day back in her office she found a message slip on her desk informing her that dr cooper had rung and wanted to know if she would drop by the mortuary sometime that afternoon no time like the present she thought telling dc collins where she was going and heading out to her car the search of lukes room didnt reveal much except a cassette tape marked songs from a black room which banks with robins permission slipped in his pocket to listen to later lukes desktop computer contained nothing of interest there was hardly any email which was only to be expected and most of the web sites he visited were connected with music he also did a fair bit of online purchasing mostly cds also to be expected from someone living in so remote a spot banks was surprised at the range of lukes musical tastes there was the usual stuff of course the cds annie had told him about but also among the grunge metal hiphop and gothic he found other oddities such as brittens setting of rimbauds les illuminations and miles daviss in a silent way there were also several indie cds including banks was thrilled to see his son brians bands first recording blue rain not your usual listening for a fifteenyearold but banks was coming to believe that luke armitage had been far from a typical fifteenyearold he had also read some of the stories and poems annie had collected from her previous visit and in his humble opinion they showed real promise they didnt tell him anything about what might have happened to luke or his feelings about his father or stepfather but they revealed a young mind preoccupied with death war global destruction and social alienation unlike annie banks wasnt surprised by the rooms decor brian hadnt painted his room black but he had stuck posters on the walls and surrounded himself with his favorite music and the guitar of course always the guitar annie had no children so banks could imagine how the black room would seem more outlandish to her the only thing that disturbed him was lukes apparent obsession with dead rock stars and with the absence of anything to do with his famous father neil byrd something was definitely out of kilter there brian had gone on to make a career of music and now his band was on the verge of recording its first cd for a major label after getting over the initial shock that brian wasnt going to follow any safe paths in life banks had come to feel very proud of him a leap of faith that his own parents hadnt seemed able to make yet banks wondered if luke had been any good maybe the tape would tell him from what annie had told him and from his own first impressions he doubted that martin armitage would have been thrilled by any signs of musical ability in his stepson physical fitness and sports seemed to be his measures of success josie and calvin batty lived in their own small apartment upstairs at the far eastern end of swainsdale house there they had a sitting room bedroom and a small kitchen in addition to a wc and bathroom with a powershower all modernized by the armitages josie told them as they stood with her in the kitchen while she boiled the kettle for tea the whole place was brightly decorated in light colors creams and pale blues and made the best of the available light josie looked as if she could be quite an attractive young woman if she made the effort banks thought but as it was her hair seemed lifeless and illcut her clothes rather plain shapeless and oldfashioned and her complexion pale and dry her husband was short and thickset with dark gypsyish coloring and heavy eyebrows that met in the middle what exactly are your duties here banks asked the two of them when they were settled in the living room opposite an enormous tvandvcr combination with a tray of tea and chocolate digestives in front of them general really i do most of the washing ironing cleaning and cooking calvin does odd jobs takes care of the cars and any heavy work building repairs garden that sort of thing i imagine there must be a lot of that sort of thing banks said glancing at calvin a big old house like this aye calvin grunted dunking a biscuit in his tea what about luke what about him asked josie did any of your duties involve taking care of him calvind give him a lift to school sometimes or bring him back if he happened to be in town id make sure he was well fed if sir and madam had to go away for a few days did they do that often not often no when was the last time he was left alone here last month they both went down to london for some fancy gala charity do what did luke do when he was left alone in the house we didnt spy on him said calvin if thats what youre getting at not at all said banks but did you ever hear anything tv stereo did he ever have his friends over that sort of thing music were loud enough but he didnt have no friends to ask over did he said calvin you know thats not true said his wife so he did entertain friends i didnt say that did he mrs batty not here banks took a deep breath where then she hugged her gray cardie closer to her i shouldnt be telling tales out of school annie leaned forward and spoke for the first time mrs batty this is a murder investigation we need your help were in the dark here if you can help throw any light at all on what happened to luke please do so this is way beyond telling tales or keeping promises josie looked at banks uncertain di cabbots right he said all bets are off when its murder who was this friend just someone i saw him with thats all where in eastvale swainsdale centre when recently past week or two a bit longer a month aye about that how old his age older younger older she wasnt no fifteenyearold i can tell you that how old hard to say when theyre that age what age young woman how young late teens early twenties aye around that taller or shorter than him shorter luke were a big lad for his age tall and skinny what did she look like dark you mean she was black no her skin was pale she just dressed dark like him and her hair was dyed black she had red lipstick on and them studs and chains all over tplace and she had a tattoo she added in a hushed tone as if saving the greatest sin for last banks glanced at annie who he happened to know from experience had a butterfly tattoo just above her right breast annie gave him a look where she asked josie josie touched her upper left arm just below the shoulder there she said she was wearing one of them leather waistcoats over a tshirt what was the tattoo annie asked her couldnt tell said josie too far away i could just see there was a mark like this woman shouldnt be too difficult to find if she lived in or near eastvale banks thought it was hardly leeds or manchester when it came to girls in black with studs chains and tattoos there was only one club the bar none which catered to such a crowd and then only two nights a week the rest of the time being reserved for the technodance set it was possible she was a student at the college too he thought would you mind if we sent a sketch artist over to work on an impression with you this afternoon he asked i suppose not said josie if sir and madam dont mind like only im supposed to be doing tupstairs banks looked at her i dont think mr and mrs armitage will mind he said all right then but i cant promise owt like i said i didnt get a close look can you tell us anything more about her banks asked no it was just a quick look i were having a coffee and a kitkat at the food court when i saw them walk by and go into that there big music shop hmv thats the one did they see you no did you tell anyone youd seen them not my place is it besides besides what it was a school day he should have been in school what were they doing just walking close together they werent holding hands if thats what you mean were they talking laughing arguing just walking i didnt see them so much as look at one another but you knew they were together how you just know dont you had you seen them together before no only the once and you mr batty no never not even when you picked him up from school she werent no schoolgirl said josie not like i ever saw no said mr batty what did you talk about when you gave luke a lift nowt really he wasnt much of a one for small talk and wed nowt in common i mean he werent interested in sport or anything like that i dont think he watched telly much either hed nothing to talk about only death and poetry and music thought banks so these journeys passed in silence i usually put the news on the radio how did he get on with his parents wouldnt know answered josie hear any rows or anything theres always rows between parents and kids isnt there so you did nothing out of the ordinary who between luke and his mother nay butter wouldnt melt in his mouth as far as she were concerned spoiled him rotten his stepfather then like i said it were nowt out of tordinary did you ever hear what was said what they were arguing about walls is too thick around here banks could believe that did anything unusual happen lately what do you mean josie asked something out of the routine no seen any strangers hanging about fewer than normal since they cant go for their country walks so you havent seen anyone hanging about no mr batty nobody they were getting no further with the battys banks wasnt certain whether they were holding anything back or not but he decided he might have another chat with them a little later on just as they were leaving he turned around to mr batty and said ever been arrested mr batty no we can easily find out you know batty glared at him all right once it were a long time ago how long twelve years public nuisance i were drunk all right i used to drink a lot in those days then i met josie i dont drink anymore what was all that about annie asked when they were back in the car what asking him if hed been arrested you know an offense like that is hardly still going to be in records oh that said banks buckling up and settling back in the passenger seat while annie started the ignition i just wanted to see whether hes a good liar or not people usually lie the first time when you ask them if theyve ever been arrested and well there was a slightly different inflection on that last no the lie but not different enough to convince me hes not a good liar bloody hell said annie heading off down the drive and spraying gravel a proper sherlock holmes ive got beside me it was only a short drive down longthorpe parkway from police headquarters to the district hospital and early that friday afternoon the traffic was light instinctively michelle found herself checking her rearview mirror to see if she was being followed she wasnt she parked in the official visitors area and made her way to pathology the forensic anthropology department was small just a couple of offices and one lab and none of the staff was permanent dr cooper herself lectured in nearby cambridge in addition to her practical duties at the hospital there certainly werent enough skeletons to justify a fulltime forensic anthropology department most counties didnt even have one at all and had to hire the services of an expert when circumstances demanded but there had been enough anglosaxon and viking remains found in east anglia for a small parttime department to be thought justified for the most part that was wendy coopers main area of interest too ancient remains not skeletons of boys buried in ah di hart dr cooper greeted her in her office standing up and shaking hands good of you to come not at all you said you had something to tell me show you actually its not much but it might help follow me curious michelle followed her into the lab where graham marshalls bones were still laid out on the table and tammy wynette was singing stand by your man on dr coopers portable cassette player though still a dirty brownishyellow like bad teeth the bones were a hell of a lot cleaner than they had been a few days ago michelle noticed dr cooper and her assistant nowhere in sight at the moment had clearly been working hard the body looked asymmetrical though michelle noticed and wondered what was missing when she looked more closely she could see it was the bottom rib on the left side hadnt they been able to find it but no there it was on the bench dr cooper led her toward we couldnt see it before because of the accumulated dirt dr cooper explained but once wed cleaned it up it was plain as daylight look michelle bent closer and looked she could see a deep narrow notch in the bone it was something she had come across before she looked at dr cooper knife wound very good thats what id say pre or postmortem oh pre cuts in green bone are different from cuts made in bones after death when theyre more brittle this is a clean smooth cut definitely premortem cause of death dr cooper frowned i cant say that for certain she said i mean there could have been lethal poison in the system or the victim might have drowned first but what i can say in my opinion is that the wound would have been sufficient to cause death if you follow the trajectory of the blade to its natural destination it pierces the heart michelle paused a moment looking at the rib in question to take it all in front or behind she asked does it matter if it was done from behind michelle explained it could have been a stranger if it happened from the front someone had to get close enough to the boy to do it without his knowing what was going to happen yes i see said dr cooper good point i never have managed to get the hang of thinking the way you police do different training i suppose so dr cooper picked up the rib judging from the position of the cut on the bone see its almost on the inside and by the straightness id say that it was done from in front the classic upthrust through the rib cage and into the heart harder to be that accurate from behind much more awkward far more likely to be at an angle so it had to be someone he would let get that close to him without being suspicious close enough to pat him on the shoulder yes and whoever did it was righthanded what kind of knife that i cant tell you except that it was very sharp and the blade wasnt serrated its quite a deep cut as you can see so theres plenty of scope for analysis and measurement theres someone i know who can probably tell you the date it was made and the company who made it an expert his names dr hilary wendell if you like i can try to track him down get him to have a look could you dr cooper laughed i said id try hilarys all over the place and i mean all over including the united states and eastern europe hes very well known he even spent some time with the forensic teams in bosnia and kosovo you were there too werent you dr cooper gave a little shudder yes kosovo any idea when the coroner can release the bones for burial he can release them now as far as im concerned id specify burial rather than cremation though just in case we need to exhume i think thats what they have in mind and some sort of memorial service its just that i know the marshalls are anxious for some sense of closure ill give them a ring and say its okay to go ahead and make arrangements funny thing that isnt it said dr cooper closure as if burying someones remains or sending a criminal to jail actually marks the end of the pain its very human though dont you think said michelle for whom closure had simply refused to come despite all the trappings we need ritual symbols ceremonies i suppose we do what about this though she pointed to the rib on the lab bench it could even end up being evidence in court well said michelle i dont suppose the marshalls will mind if they know grahams being buried with a rib missing will they especially if it might help lead us to his killer ill get their permission anyway fine said dr cooper ill talk to the coroner this afternoon and try to track hilary down in the meantime thanks said michelle she looked again at the bones on the table laid out in some sort of semblance of a human skeleton and then glanced back at the single rib on the bench strange she thought it didnt matter they were only old bones but she couldnt help but feel this odd and deep sense of significance and the words adams rib came to mind stupid she told herself nobodys going to create a woman out of graham marshalls rib with a bit of luck dr hilary wendell is going to tell us something about the knife that killed him a few dark clouds had blown in on a strong wind from the north and it looked as if rain was about to spoil yet another fine summers day when banks drove out in his own car to the crime scene late that afternoon listening to luke armitages songs from a black room there were only five short songs on the tape and lyrically they were not sophisticated about what youd expect for a fifteenyearold with a penchant for reading poetry he couldnt understand there were no settings of rimbaud or baudelaire here only pure unadulterated adolescent angst everybody hates me but i dont care im safe in my black room and the fools are out there but at least they were lukes own songs when banks was fourteen he had got together with graham paul and steve to form a rudimentary rock band and all they had managed were rough cover versions of beatles and stones songs not one of them had had the urge or the talent to write original material lukes music was raw and anguished as if he were reaching straining to find the right voice his own voice he backed himself on electric guitar occasionally using special effects such as fuzz and wahwah but mostly sticking to the simple chord progressions banks remembered from his own stumbling attempts at guitar the remarkable thing was how much lukes voice resembled his fathers he had neil byrds broad range though his voice hadnt deepened enough to handle the lowest notes yet and he also had his fathers timbre wistful but bored and even a little angry edgy only one song stood out a quiet ballad with a melody banks vaguely recognized perhaps an adaptation of an old folk tune the last piece on the tape it was a love song of sorts or a fifteenyearolds version of salvation he shut me out but you took me in hes in the dark but youre a bird on the wing i couldnt hold you but you chose to stay why do you care please dont go away was it about his mother robin or was it the girl josie had seen him with in the swainsdale centre along with winsome jackman and kevin templeton annie was out showing the artists impression around the most likely places maybe one of them would get lucky the socos were still at hallam tarn the road still taped off and a local tv van along with a gaggle of reporters barely kept their distance as he pulled up by the side of the road banks even noticed a couple of middleaged ladies in walking gear sightseers no doubt stefan nowak was in charge looking suave even in his protective clothing stefan banks greeted him hows it going were trying to get everything done before the rain comes stefan said weve found nothing else in the water so far but the frogmen are still looking banks looked around christ but it was wild and lonely up there an open landscape hardly a tree in sight with miles of rolling moorland a mix of yellow gorse sandycolored tufts of grass and black patches where fires had raged earlier that summer the heather wouldnt bloom for another month or two but the dark multibranched stems spread tough and wiry all around clinging close to the ground the view was spectacular even more dramatic under the lowering sky over in the west banks could see as far as the long flat bulk of the three peaks ingleborough whernside and penyghent anything interesting he asked maybe said stefan we tried to pin down the exact point on the wall where the body had been dropped over and it matches the spot where these stones stick out here like steps makes climbing easy good footholds i see it would have taken a bit of strength though wouldnt it oh i dont know he might have been a big lad for his age but he was still only a kid and pretty skinny could one person have done it certainly anyway weve been looking for scuff marks its also possible that the killer scratched himself climbing up youve found blood on the wall minute traces but hold your horses alan we dont even know if its human blood yet banks watched the socos taking the wall apart stone by stone and packing it in the back of a van he wondered what gristhorpe would think of such destruction gristhorpe was building a drystone wall at the back of his house as a hobby it went nowhere and fenced in nothing some of these walls had been standing for centuries without any sort of cement holding them together but they were far more than mere random piles of rocks gristhorpe knew all about the techniques and the patience it took to find just the right stone to fit with the others and here the men were demolishing it still if it could lead them to lukes killer banks thought that was worth a drystone wall or two he knew gristhorpe would agree any chance of footprints stefan shook his head if there was any sort of impression in the grass or the dust you can be sure its gone now dont get your hopes up do i ever tire tracks again too many and its not a good road surface but were looking weve got a botanist coming up from york too there may be some unique plant life by the roadside especially with it being close to a body of water you never know if you find someone with a bit of purplespeckled ragwort sticking to the bottom of his shoe it just might be your man wonderful banks walked back to his car chief inspector it was one of the reporters a local man banks recognized what do you want he asked weve just told you lot all we know at the press conference is it true what weve been hearing the reporter asked what have you been hearing that it was a botched kidnapping no comment said banks muttering shit under his breath as he got in his car turned around in the next layby and set off home after tracking down a retired detective inspector who had worked out of west end central and persuading him to talk to her in london the following day michelle had left the station and stopped off to rent the video of the krays on her way home she hoped the film would at least give her a general picture of their life and times she had been living in her riverside flat on viersen platz for two months now but it still felt temporary just another place she was passing through partly it was because she hadnt unpacked everything books dishes some clothes and other odds and ends and partly it was the job of course long hours made it difficult to keep house and most of her meals were eaten on the run the flat itself was cozy and pleasant enough a modern fourstory building part of the rivergate centre it faced south overlooking the river got plenty of light for the potted plants she liked to keep on her small balcony and was so close to the city center as to be practically in the shadow of the cathedral she didnt know why she hadnt settled in more it was one of the nicest places she had ever lived in if a bit pricey but what else did she have to spend her money on she particularly liked to sit out on the balcony after dark look at the lights reflected in the slowmoving river and listen to the trains go by on weekends she could hear blues music from charters bar an old iron barge moored opposite by town bridge and the customers sometimes made a bit too much noise at closing time but that was only a minor irritant michelle had no friends to invite for dinner nor the time or inclination to entertain them so she hadnt even bothered to unpack her best chinaware she had even let such basics as laundry dusting and ironing slip and as a consequence her flat had the air of someone who used to maintain a certain level of tidiness and cleanliness but had let things go even the bed was unmade since that morning she glanced at the answering machine but no light flashed it never did she wondered why she bothered to keep the thing work of course after a quick blitz on the dishes in the sink and a run around with the hoover she felt ready to sit down and watch the krays but she was hungry as usual there was nothing in the fridge at least nothing edible so she went around the corner to the indian takeaway and got some prawn curry and rice sitting with a tray on her lap and a bottle of south african merlot beside her she pressed the remote and the video began when it had finished michelle didnt feel she knew much more about the kray twins than before it had begun yes theirs was a violent world and youd better not cross them yes they seemed to have plenty of money and spend most of their time in ritzy clubs but what exactly did they do apart from vague battles with the maltese and meetings with american gangsters the exact nature of their businesses was left unexplained and as far as the film was concerned coppers might as well have not even existed she turned to the news still feeling a little queasy from the violence or was it from the curry and wine she didnt really believe that the krays had anything to do with graham marshalls murder no more than she believed brady and hindley had and she could imagine how shaw would laugh if he heard her suggest such a thing if bill marshall had any serious criminal aspirations they hadnt done him much good he never got out of the council house though the marshalls had bought it for four thousand pounds in perhaps he swore off crime michelle had checked subsequent police records and found no further mention of him so he had gone either straight or uncaught she would guess at the former given his standard of living grahams disappearance must have shaken him then maybe he sensed a connection to the world he had been involved in so he severed all ties she would have to find time to have an even closer look at the old crime reports dig out old action books and the notebooks of the detectives involved but that could wait until after the weekend she turned on her computer and tried to put her thoughts and theories into some kind of order the way she usually did last thing at night then she played a couple of games of freecell and lost it got dark michelle turned off her computer cleared away the detritus of her lonely dinner found there wasnt enough wine left in the bottle worth saving so topped up her glass as it so often did around bedtime the depression seemed to close in on her like a dense fog she sipped her wine and listened to rain tapping against her window god how she missed melissa even after all this time she missed ted too sometimes but mostly she missed melissa her thoughts went back to the day it happened it was a movie that ran in her mind as if on a constant loop she wasnt there that was a big part of the problem but she could picture melissa outside the school gates her golden curls little blue dress with the flowers on it the other kids milling around vigilant teachers nearby then melissa seeing what she thought was her fathers car pulling to a stop across the road though they always picked her up on her side then she pictured melissa waving smiling and before anyone could stop her running right out in front of the speeding lorry before getting into bed she took melissas dress the same dress she had died in from her bedside drawer lay down held it to her face and cried herself to sleep chapter as annie waited outside acc mclaughlins office at county headquarters the following morning having been summoned she felt the same way she had when her geography teacher sent her to the headmasters office for defacing a school atlas with her own cartographic designs fantastic sea creatures and warnings that beyond this point be monsters she had little fear of authority and a persons rank or status was something she rarely considered in her daily dealings but somehow this summons made her nervous not red ron himself he was known to be stern but fair and had a reputation for standing behind his team but the situation she might find herself in it seemed that since she had decided to pursue her career again she had made nothing but mistakes first sliding arse over tit down the side of harkside reservoir in full view of several of her colleagues and against the orders of the officer in charge then the debacle of her excessive force investigation of probationary pc janet taylor during her brief but not brief enough spell with complaints and discipline and now being blamed for the murder of luke armitage pretty soon everyone would be calling her fuckup annie if they didnt already got a case you want fucking up mate give it to annie cabbot shell see you right so much for a revitalized career at least she was determined to go down with her middle finger high in the air it wasnt bloody fair though annie thought as she paced she was a damn good detective everything she had done in all those instances had been right it was just the spin the way it all added up that made her look bad red rons secretary opened the door and ushered annie into the presence as befitted his rank acc mclaughlin had an even bigger office than detective superintendent gristhorpes and a carpet with much thicker pile at least he didnt have the books that intimidated her so in gristhorpes office red ron had done a few things to personalize it since he first came to the job about eight months ago a framed photo of his wife carol stood on the desk and a print of constables the lock hung on the wall the glass cabinet was full of trophies and photos of red ron with various police athletics teams from rowing to archery he looked fit and was rumored to be in training for a marathon he was also rumored to keep a bottle of fine single malt in his bottom drawer but annie didnt expect to see much evidence of that di cabbot he greeted her glancing over the top of his wirerimmed glasses please sit down ill be with you in a moment annie sat there was something different about him she thought then she realized red ron had shaved off his mustache since she had last seen him she was surprised to find that he had an upper lip she always thought men grew mustaches and beards to hide weak jaws and thin lips he kept his receding silver hair cut short instead of growing one side long and trying to hide a bald center by combing it over the top of the skull the way some men did annie didnt understand that what was so wrong with going bald she thought some bald men were quite sexy it was one of those ridiculous macho male things she guessed like the obsession with penis length were all men so bloody insecure well she would never find out because none of them would ever talk about it not even banks though he did at least try more than most perhaps it was something they really couldnt do something they were genetically incapable of something going back to the caves and the hunt annie brought herself back to the present the acc had just finished signing a stack of papers and after he had buzzed his secretary to come and take them away he leaned back in his chair and linked his hands behind his head i suppose you know why youre here he began yes sir the chief constable got in touch with me last night just as i was settling down to my dinner by the way and said hed had a complaint about you from martin armitage would you care to explain what happened annie told him as she spoke she could tell he was listening intently and every now and then he made a jotting on the pad in front of him nice fountain pen she noticed a maroon waterman sometimes he frowned but he didnt interrupt her once when she had finished he paused for a while then said why did you decide to follow mr armitage from his house that morning because i thought his behavior was suspicious sir and i was looking for a missing boy a boy he had already told you was due back that very day yes sir you didnt believe him i suppose not sir why not annie went over the armitages behavior on the morning in question the tension she had felt the brusqueness of their response to her the haste with which they wanted rid of her all i can say sir she said is that i found their behavior to be out of sync with what id expect from parents whod discovered that their son was all right and was coming home all very speculative on your part di cabbot annie gripped the arms of the chair hard i used my judgment sir and i stand by it hmm red ron took off his glasses and rubbed his eyes its a bad business he said weve had the press all over us and needless to say theyre hot to trot with this idea of a simple kidnapping gone wrong add police cockup to that and theyd like nothing better with all due respect sir it wasnt a simple kidnapping annie gave her reasons why as she had done before with gristhorpe and banks red ron stroked his chin as he listened plucking at his upper lip as if he still expected to feel the mustache when she had finished he asked as she had hoped he wouldnt didnt it cross your mind just for one moment that the kidnapper might have been watching mr armitage make the drop i er you didnt think of it did you i wanted to know what hed left there di cabbot use your intelligence a mans stepson is missing hes edgy and anxious to be somewhere annoyed that the police are on his doorstep you follow him and see him enter a disused shepherds shelter with a briefcase and come out without it what do you surmise annie felt herself flush with anger at the rightness of his logic when you put it like that sir she said through gritted teeth i suppose its clear hes paying a ransom but things dont always seem so clear cut in the field youve no need to tell me what its like in the field di cabbot i might be an administrator now but i wasnt always behind this desk ive served my time in the field ive seen things that would make your hair curl then im sure youll understand what im saying was that a halfsmile annie spotted fleeting across red rons features surely not he went on the point remains that you must have known the risk of being seen by the kidnapper was extremely high especially as you were in open countryside and that for whatever reason you disregarded that risk and went into the shelter anyway and now the boys dead theres some indication that luke armitage might have been killed even before his stepfather delivered the money that would be a piece of luck for you wouldnt it thats not fair sir i needed to know what was in the briefcase why i needed to be sure thats all and it turned out to be a clue of sorts the low amount yes but how did you know that wasnt just the first installment with respect sir kidnappers dont usually work on the installment plan not like blackmailers but how did you know i didnt know but it seemed a reasonable assumption you assumed yes sir look di cabbot im not going to beat about the bush i dont like it when members of the public make complaints about officers under my command i like it even less when a selfimportant citizen such as martin armitage complains to his golfclub crony the chief constable who then passes the buck down to me do you understand yes sir you dont like it now while your actions werent exactly by the book and while you might have lacked judgment in acting so impulsively i dont see anything serious enough in what you did to justify punishment annie began to feel relieved a bollocking that was all she was going to get on the other hand annies spirits sank again we dont have all the facts in yet sir we dont know whether you were seen by the kidnapper or not do we no sir and we dont know exactly when luke armitage died dr glendennings doing the postmortem sometime today sir yes i know so what im saying is that until we have all the facts ill postpone judgment go back to your duties detective inspector annie stood up before he changed his mind yes sir and di cabbot sir if youre going to keep on using your own car on the job get a bloody police radio fitted would you annie blushed yes sir she mumbled and left michelle got off the intercity train at kings cross at about half past one that afternoon and walked down the steps to the tube struck as she always was by the sheer hustle and bustle of london the constant noise and motion cathedral square on a summer holiday weekend with a rock band playing in the marketplace didnt even come close unlike many of her contemporaries michelle had never worked on the met she had thought of moving there after greater manchester after melissa had died and ted had left but instead she had moved around a lot over the past five years and taken numerous courses convincing herself that it was all for the good of her career she suspected though that she had just been running somewhere a bit more out of the way had seemed the best option at least for the time being another lowprofile position and you didnt get anywhere in todays police force without switching back and forth a lot from uniform to cid from county to county career detectives like jet harris were a thing of the past a few ragged junkies sat propped against the walls of the busy underpass several of them young girls michelle noticed and too far gone even to beg for change as she passed one of them started to moan and wail she had a bottle in her hand and she banged it hard against the wall until it smashed echoing in the tiled passage and scattering broken glass all over the place like everyone else michelle hurried on the tube was crowded and she had to stand all the way to tottenham court road where retired detective inspector robert lancaster had agreed to talk to her over a late lunch on dean street it was raining when she walked out onto oxford street christ she thought not again at this rate summer would be over before it had begun michelle unfurled her umbrella and made her way through the tourists and hustlers she turned off oxford street and crossed soho square then followed lancasters directions and found the place easily enough though it was a pub michelle was pleased to see that it looked rather more upmarket than some establishments with its hanging baskets of flowers outside stained glass and shiny dark woodwork she had dressed about as casually as she was capable of in a midlength skirt a pink vneck top and a light wool jacket but she would still have looked overdressed in a lot of london pubs this one however catered to a business luncheon crowd it even had a separate restaurant section away from the smoke and video machines with table service no less lancaster recognizable by the carnation he told michelle he would be wearing in his gray suit was a dapper man with a full head of silver hair and a sparkle in his eye perhaps a bit portly michelle noticed as he stood up to greet her but definitely wellpreserved for his age which she guessed at around seventy his face had a florid complexion but he didnt otherwise look like a serious drinker at least he didnt have that telltale calligraphy of broken red and purple veins just under the surface like shaw mr lancaster she said sitting down thank you for agreeing to see me the pleasures mine entirely he said traces of a cockney accent still in his voice ever since my kids flew the coop and my wife died ill take any opportunity to get out of the house besides its not every day i get to come down the west end and have lunch with a pretty girl like yourself michelle smiled and felt herself blush a little a girl hed called her when she had turned forty last september for some reason she didnt feel offended by lancasters particular brand of male chauvinism it had such a quaint oldfashioned feel to it that it seemed only natural on her part to accept the compliment and thank him with as much grace as possible shed soon find out if it got more wearing as their conversation continued i hope you dont mind my choice of eatery michelle looked around at the tables with their white linen cloths and weighty cutlery the uniformed waitresses dashing around not at all she said he chuckled a throaty sound you wouldnt believe what this place used to be like used to be a real villains pub back in the early sixties upstairs especially youd be amazed at the jobs planned up there the contracts put out not anymore i hope oh no its quite respectable now he spoke with a tinge of regret in his voice a waitress appeared with her order book what would you like to drink lancaster asked just a fruit juice please orange grapefruit or pineapple the waitress asked orange is fine and ill have another pint of guinness please lancaster said sure you dont want something a bit stronger love no thatll be just fine thanks truth was michelle had felt the effects of last nights bottle of wine that morning and she had decided to lay off the booze for a day or two it was still manageable she never drank during the day anyway only in the evening alone in her flat with the curtains closed and the television on but if she didnt nip it in the bud shed be the next one with broken blood vessels in her nose the foods quite good here said lancaster while the waitress was fetching their drinks id stay away from the lamb curry if i were you though last time i touched it i ended up with a case of delhi belly michelle had eaten a curry the previous evening and though it hadnt given her delhi belly it had made its presence felt during the night she wanted something plain something unencumbered with fancy sauces something british the waitress returned with her britvic orange and lancasters guinness and asked them for their orders ill have the cumberland sausage and mashed potatoes please michelle said and diet be damned she added under her breath lancaster ordered the roast beef bangers and mash he said beaming when the waitress had wandered off wonderful one doesnt often meet people who go for the more traditional food these days its all that nasty foreign muck isnt it i dont mind a bit of pasta or a curry now and then said michelle but sometimes you cant beat the traditional english lancaster paused for a few moments drumming his fingers on the table michelle could sense him changing gear from oldfashioned gallant to seasoned street copper wondering what she was after and whether it could harm him she could see it in his eyes their gaze sharpening becoming more watchful she wanted to set him at ease but decided it was best to let him lead see where it went at first the bloke that put you on to me said you wanted to know about reggie and ronnie there they were out the dreaded words reggie and ronnie the krays sort of michelle said but let me explain lancaster listened taking the occasional sip of guinness nodding here and there as michelle told him about the marshalls and what had happened to graham so you see she finished its not really the twins or not just them anyway that im interested in yes i see said lancaster drumming his fingers again their food arrived and they both took a few bites before he spoke again hows your sausage he asked fine said michelle wondering if he was going to be any use at all or if it was going to be one of these pleasant but pointless sessions good good i knew billy marshall and his family said lancaster then he stuffed his mouth full of roast beef and mashed potato and looked at michelle eyes wide and expressionless as he chewed watching for her reaction she was surprised and she was also pleased that the information banks had given her led somewhere although she still had no idea where billy and i grew up just around the corner from one another we went to the same schools played on the same streets we even used to drink in the same pub he went on when hed washed his food down with guinness does that surprise you a bit i suppose though i must say not much about those days surprises me anymore lancaster laughed youre right there love another world see youve got to understand where detectives came from michelle can i call you michelle of course the first detectives came from the criminal classes they were equally at home on either side of the law jonathan wild the famous thieftaker for example half the time he set up the blokes he fingered did you know that they hanged him in the end and vidocq the froggie thief police informer master of disguise criminal and back then the days youre asking about i think we were a bit closer to our prototypes than the office boys we seem to have in the force today if youll pardon my criticism now im not saying i was ever a criminal myself but i lived close enough to the line at times to know what a thin line it is and i was also close enough to know how they thought and do you imagine for a moment those on the other side didnt know that too you turned a blind eye sometimes i told you i went to school with billy marshall grew up the next street over only difference was he was thick as two short planks but he could fight and me well i had the smarts and the stealth but i wasnt much of a scrapper enough to survive and believe me you had to have that much or you were a goner any trouble and id talk my way out of it and if that didnt work id leg it mostly id talk my way out is it any wonder we went our different ways thing is it couldve gone either way for me i ran a bit wild when i was kid got into a scrape or two i knew exactly where people like reggie and ronnie were coming from we lived in the same poor neighborhood in the shadow of the war i could think like them i couldve easily used my street smarts for criminal purposes like reggie and ronnie or he let the sentence trail and ate some more roast beef youre saying morality doesnt come into it michelle asked the law justice honesty words love lancaster said when hed finished eating nice words ill grant you but words nonetheless so how did you choose toss a coin lancaster laughed toss a coin good one that ill have to remember it then his expression turned more serious no love i probably joined for the same reasons you did same as most people there wasnt much pay then but it seemed a decent enough job maybe even a bit glamorous and exciting fabian of the yard and all that stuff i didnt want to be a plod walking the beat oh i did it of course we all did had to do but i knew i wanted cid right from the start and i got it what im saying love is that when it came right down to it when you stood at the bar of your local or took your usual table in the corner the one your father had sat at all his life and when someone like billy came in someone you knew was a bit dodgy well then it was just a job you did everybody knew it nothing personal we mixed tolerated one another hoped our paths never crossed in a serious way a professional way and remember i was working out of west end central then the east end wasnt my manor i just grew up there lived there of course we were all aware there was a barrier between us at least one wed better not breach in public so it was all hello billy hows it going hows the wife and kid oh fine bob cant complain hows things down the nick thriving billy boy thriving glad to hear it mate that sort of thing i can understand that said michelle who thought she took policing a bit more seriously and wouldnt be caught dead in the same pub as known villains unless she was meeting an informant it was the same thing shaw had said the lines between them and us werent so clearly drawn as they are today mostly because many cops and criminals came from the same backgrounds went to the same schools and drank in the same pubs as lancaster had just pointed out and as long as no innocent bystanders got hurt no harm done nothing personal different times just wanted to get it clear said lancaster so you wouldnt go away thinking i was bent or anything why would i think that he winked oh there were plenty that were vice obscene publications the sweeney oh yes it was all just getting going then there are some naive buggers who look at it as the beginnings of some new age of enlightenment or something aquarius call it what you will fucking hippies with their peace and love and beads and long hair he sneered know what it really was it was the beginnings of the rise of organized crime in this country oh im not saying we hadnt had gangsters before that but back in the midsixties when reggie and ronnie were at their peak you could have written what your average british copper knew about organized crime on the back of a postage stamp i kid you not we knew buggerall even nipper read the bloke in charge of nailing the twins porn was coming in by the lorryload from denmark germany sweden the netherlands someone had to control distribution wholesale resale same with drugs opening of the floodgates the midsixties license to print money maybe the hippies saw a revolution of peace and love in the future but people like reggie and ronnie only saw even more opportunities to make cash and ultimately all your hippies were just consumers just another market sex drugs rock and roll your real criminals were rubbing their hands in glee when flower power came along like kids given the free run of the sweetshop this was all very well michelle thought but a man with a bee in his bonnet the way lancaster seemed to have could be difficult to get information from lancaster ordered another guinness michelle asked for coffee and sat back in his chair he took a pill from a small silver container and washed it down with stout blood pressure he explained anyway im sorry love he went on as if reading her mind i do go on a bit dont i one of the few benefits of getting old you can go on and on and nobody tells you to shut up bill marshall yes billy marshall as he was called back then i havent forgotten havent seen or heard of him for years by the way is he still alive barely said michelle hes suffered a serious stroke poor sod and the missus coping he nodded good she always was a good coper was maggie marshall maggie michelle just realized that she hadnt known mrs marshalls first name did bill marshall work for reggie and ronnie she asked yes in a way what do you mean a lot of people in the east end worked for reggie and ronnie at one time or another fit young geezer like billy idve been surprised if he hadnt he was a boxer amateur mind you and so were the krays they were into boxing in a big way they met up at one of the local gyms billy did a few odd jobs with them it paid to have the twins on your side back then even if you werent in deep with them they made very nasty enemies so ive read lancaster laughed you dont know the half of it love but he wasnt regularly employed not on their payroll thats about it an occasional encouragement to pay up or deterrent against talking you know the sort of thing he told you this lancaster laughed come off it love it wasnt something you discussed over a game of darts at the local but you knew it was my job to know keeping tabs i liked to think i knew what was going on even outside my manor and that those who counted knew that i knew what do you remember about him nice enough bloke if you didnt cross him bit of a temper especially after a jar or two like i said he was strictly lowlevel muscle a boxer he used to boast that he knew reggie and ronnie when he was in his cups after hed moved up to peterborough typical billy that didnt have two brain cells to rub together ill tell you one thing though whats that you said the kid was stabbed thats what the pathologist tells me billy never went tooled up he was strictly a fist man maybe a cosh or knuckledusters depending who he was up against but never a knife or a gun i didnt really regard bill marshall as a serious suspect michelle said but thanks for letting me know im just wondering if or how all this could have had any connection with grahams death i cant honestly say i see one love if billy did something to upset his masters then surely if billy marshall had done anything to upset reggie or ronnie love hed have been the one pushing up daisies not the kid they wouldnt have harmed the boy to make a point not their way no direct not subtle they had their faults and there wasnt much they wouldnt do if it came right down to it but if you crossed them it wasnt your wife or your kid got hurt it was you i understand ronnie was yes he was and he liked them young but not that young then they didnt hurt kids it was a mans world there was a code unwritten but it was there and another thing youve got to understand love is that reggie and ronnie were like robin hood dick turpin and billy the kid all rolled into one as far as most east enders were concerned even later you only have to look at their funerals to see that fucking royalty pardon my french folk heroes and you were the sheriff of nottingham lancaster laughed hardly i was only a dc a mere foot soldier but you get the picture i think so and after the days battles youd all adjourn to the local and have a jolly old drink together and talk about football lancaster laughed something like that you know maybe youre right maybe it was a bit of a game when you nicked someone fair and square there were no hard feelings when they put one over on you you just filed it away till next time if the courts let them off then you bought them a pint next time they came in the pub i think billy marshall took the game to peterborough with him ever hear of a bloke called carlo fiorino lancasters bushy eyebrows knitted in a frown cant say as i have no but thats way off my manor besides ive already told you billy didnt have the brains to set up an operation he didnt have the authority the command charisma call it what you will billy marshall was born to follow orders not give them let alone decide what they ought to be now that lad of his he was another matter entirely michelle pricked up her ears graham what about him young lad with the beatle cut right sounds like him if anyone in that family was destined to go far id have said it wouldve been him what do you mean graham was a criminal no well not apart from a bit of shoplifting but they all got into that me too when i was his age we figured the shops factored the losses into their prices see so we were only taking what was rightfully ours anyway no it was just that he had brains though god knows who he got them from and he was also what they call street smart these days never said much but you could tell he was taking it all in looking for the main chance youre saying that graham might have been involved with the krays nah oh he might have run an errand or two for them but they didnt mess around with twelveyearold kids too much of a liability only that he watched and learned there wasnt much got by him sharp as a tack billy used to leave him outside the local sitting in the street playing marbles with the other kids it was common enough then and some pretty shady customers went in there believe me i know more than once the young lad would get half a crown and a watching brief keep an eye on that car for me kid like or if you see a couple of blokes in suits coming this way stick your head around the door and give me a shout no flies on young graham marshall thats for sure im just sorry to hear he came to such an early end though i cant say as it surprises me that much dr glendenning was delayed in scarborough so the postmortem had been put off until late in the afternoon in the meantime banks thought his time would be well spent talking to some of lukes teachers starting with gavin barlow the head teacher of eastvale comprehensive despite the threatening sky and earth damp from an earlier shower barlow was weeding the garden of his north eastvale semi dressed in torn jeans and a dirty old shirt a collie with a sleek coat jumped up at banks as he entered through the garden gate but barlow soon brought the dog to heel and it curled up in a corner under the lilac bush and seemed to go to sleep hes old gavin barlow said taking off a glove wiping his hand on his jeans and offering it banks shook and introduced himself yes ive been expecting a visit said barlow terrible business lets go inside no stay tristram stay tristram stayed and banks followed barlow into the bright ordered interior of the house he was clearly interested in antiques and by the looks of the gleaming sideboard and drinks cabinet into restoring them too can i offer you a beer or a lager perhaps or arent you supposed to drink on duty one never knows watching morse and the like on telly banks smiled were not supposed to he said not that it had ever stopped him but it was far too early in the day and he didnt have weeding the garden as an excuse id love a coffee if youve got some only instant im afraid thats fine come on through they went into a small but wellarranged kitchen whoever had designed the maple cabinets over the slategray countertops had decided on following a pattern of horizontal grain rather than vertical which made the room seem much more spacious banks sat at a breakfast nook with a redandwhitechecked tablecloth while barlow made the coffee daddy whos this a girl of about sixteen appeared in the doorway all long blond hair and bare leg she reminded banks a bit of kay summerville its a policeman come to talk about luke armitage rose off you go rose pouted then made a theatrical aboutturn and sashayed away wiggling her hips daughters said barlow have you any of your own banks told him about tracy tracy banks of course now i remember her i just didnt put two and two together when i saw your identification tracy very bright girl how is she doing fine shes just finished her second year at leeds history do give her my best regards when you see her i cant say i knew her well so many pupils and so little time but i do remember talking to her gavin barlow looked a bit like tony blair banks thought definitely more of an educational unit manager than an oldstyle school headmaster the way his predecessor mr buxton had been banks remembered the old fellow whod been in charge during the gallows view case when banks had first moved up north buxton was the last of a dying breed with his batlike cape and a wellthumbed copy of cicero on his desk gavin barlow probably thought latin referred to a type of dance music though maybe that was being a bit unfair at least the radio station he was tuned in to was playing thelonious monks epistrophy at eleven oclock in the morning a good sign im not sure i can tell you very much about luke said gavin barlow bringing over two mugs of instant coffee and sitting opposite banks its usually only the persistent troublemakers who come to my attention and luke wasnt a troublemaker good heavens no youd hardly know he was there if he didnt move once in a while any trouble at all not really trouble nothing his form tutor couldnt deal with tell me luke didnt like games and he once forged a note from his mother excusing him on the grounds of a stomach upset it was a note the pe teacher remembered seeing a few months earlier and luke had traced it out with a new date quite a good forgery really what happened nothing much detention a warning to his mother odd as he wasnt bad at all wasnt bad at what rugby luke was a decent wing threequarters fast and slippery when he could be bothered playing but he didnt like games he had no interest in sports hed far rather read or just sit in a corner and stare out the window god only knows what was going on in that head of his half the time did luke have any close friends at school any other pupils he might have confided in i really cant say he always seemed to be a bit of a loner we encourage group activities of course but you cant always i mean you cant force people to be sociable can you banks opened his briefcase and slipped out the artists impression of the girl josie batty had seen going to hmv with luke do you recognize this girl he asked not sure of how close a likeness it was barlow squinted at it then shook his head no he said i cant say as i do im not saying we dont have pupils who affect that general look but not very many and nobody quite like this so youve never seen her or anyone like her with luke no banks returned the sketch to his briefcase what about his schoolwork did he show any promise enormous promise his work in math left a lot to be desired but when it came to english and music he was remarkably gifted what about the other subjects good enough for university if thats what you mean especially languages and social studies you could tell that even at his early age unless what well unless he went off the rails ive seen it happen before with bright and sensitive pupils they fall in with the wrong crowd neglect their work you can guess the rest banks who had gone off the rails a bit himself after grahams disappearance could were there any teachers luke was particularly close to he asked anyone who might be able to tell me a bit more about him yes you might try ms anderson lauren anderson she teaches english and art history luke was way ahead of his classmates in his appreciation of literature and in its composition and i believe ms anderson gave him extra tutoring lauren andersons name had come up in the companys records of lukes cell phone calls banks remembered is that something the school does often if the student seems likely to benefit from it then yes certainly you have to understand that we get such a broad range of abilities and interests and we have to pitch our teaching level just a little above the middle too high and you lose most of the class too low and the brighter students become bored and distracted but its not all as bad as they say it is in the newspapers were lucky in that we have a lot of passionate and committed teachers at eastvale comprehensive ms anderson is one of them luke was also taking violin lessons after school yes he had a violin in his bedroom i told you hes not your commonorgarden pupil barlow paused for a moment staring out the window wasnt well miss him even if you hardly knew he was there i was probably overstating the case barlow said with a frown luke had a certain presence what i meant was that he just didnt make a lot of noise or demand a lot of attention who was giving him violin lessons our music teacher alastair ford hes quite a skilled player himself plays with a local string quartet strictly amateur of course you might have heard of them theyre called the aeolian quartet i understand theyre very good though i must admit that my tastes edge more toward miles than mahler the aeolian banks had indeed heard of them not only that but he had heard them the last time was shortly after christmas at the community center with annie cabbot they had played schuberts death and the maiden quartet and made a very good job of it banks remembered is there anything else you can tell me he asked standing to leave i dont think there is said barlow all in all luke armitage was a bit of a dark horse as they walked through to the hall banks felt certain he caught a flurry of blond hair and long leg ducking through a doorway but he could have been mistaken why would rose barlow want to listen in on their conversation anyway the rain seemed to have settled in for the day after a short afternoon respite a constant drizzle from a sky the color of dirty dishwater when annie did the rounds of lukes final ports of call she found out nothing from the hmv staff perhaps because they had such a high turnover and it was a large shop hard to keep an eye on everyone no one recognized the sketch besides as one salesperson told her many of the kids who shopped there looked pretty much the same black clothing wasnt exactly unusual as far as hmvs customers were concerned nor was bodypiercing or tattoos she fared little better at the computer shop on north market street gerald kelly the sole proprietor and staff member remembered just about all his customers but he had seen no one resembling the girl in black with luke who had always been alone on his visits to the shop annie had just one last call normans used books was a dank cramped space down a flight of stone steps under a bakery one of several shops that seemed to be set right into the church walls in the market square the books all smelled of mildew but you could find the most obscure things sometimes annie herself had shopped there once or twice looking for old art books and had even found some decent prints among the boxes the owner kept at the back of the shop though they were sometimes warped and discolored because of the damp the roof was so low and the small room so full of books not only in cases against the walls but piled up haphazardly on tables ready to teeter over if you so much as breathed on them that you had to stoop and make your way around the place very carefully it must have been even harder for luke annie thought as he was taller and more gangly than her the owner himself norman wells was just a little over five feet with thin brown hair a bulbous sort of face and rheumy eyes because it was so cold and damp down there no matter what the weather was like up above he always wore a motheaten gray cardigan woolly gloves with the fingers cut off and an old leeds united scarf he couldnt make much of a living out of the little shop annie thought though she doubted the overheads were very high even in the depths of winter a oneelement electric fire was the only source of heat norman wells glanced up from the paperback he was reading and nodded in annies direction he seemed surprised when she showed her warrant card and spoke to him ive seen you before havent i he said taking off his reading glasses which hung on a piece of string around his neck ive been here once or twice thought so i never forget a face art isnt it pardon your interest art oh yes annie showed him a photograph of luke remember him wells looked alarmed course i do hes the lad who disappeared isnt he one of your lot was around the other day asking about him i told him all i know im sure you did mr wells said annie but things have changed its a murder investigation now and we have to go over the ground afresh murder that lad im afraid so bloody hell i hadnt heard whod he wouldnt say boo to a goose did you know him well then well no i wouldnt say that but we talked what about books he knew a lot more than most kids his age his reading level was way beyond that of his contemporaries how do you know i never mind mr wells lets just say i used to be a teacher thats all i know about these things and that lad was bordering on genius i understand he bought two books from you on his last visit yes like i told the other copper crime and punishment and portrait of the artist as a young man they sound a bit advanced even for him dont you believe it wells protested if i hadnt thought him ready i wouldnt have sold him them hed already been through ts eliots the waste land most of camus and dubliners i didnt think he was quite ready for ulysses or pounds cantos but he could handle the portrait no problem annie who had heard of these books but had read only the eliot and a few of joyces short stories at school was impressed so the books she had seen in lukes room werent just for show he really did read and probably even understand them at fifteen shed been reading historical sagas and sword and sorcery series not literature with a capital l that was reserved for school and was tedious in the extreme thanks to mr bolton the english teacher who made the stuff sound about as exciting as a wet sunday in cleethorpes how often did luke call by she asked about once a month or whenever he was out of something to read he had the money why didnt he go to waterstones and buy them new dont ask me we got chatting the first time he dropped in when was that maybe eighteen months or so ago anyway as i say we got chatting and he came back he looked around at the stained ceilings flaking plaster and tottering piles of books and smiled at annie showing crooked teeth i suppose there must have been something he liked about the place must be the service annie said wells laughed i can tell you one thing he liked those old penguin modern classics the old ones with the gray spines not these modern palegreen things real paperbacks not your trade size and you cant buy those at waterstones same with the old pan covers something moved in the back of the shop and a pile of books fell over annie thought she glimpsed a tabby cat slinking away into the deeper shadows wells sighed familiars gone and done it again familiar my cat no bookshops complete without a cat after witchs familiar see i suppose so did luke ever come in here with anyone else no annie took her copy of the artists impression out and set it on the table in front of him what about her wells leaned forward put his glasses on again and examined the sketch it looks like her he said i told you i never forget a face but you told me luke never came in with anyone else annie said feeling a tingle of excitement rise up her spine wells looked at her who said she was with him no she came in with another bloke same sort of clothing and bodypiercing who are they i dont know they must have been a bit short of money though why do you say that because they came in with an armful of brandnew books to sell stolen i thought plain as day stolen books i dont have any truck with that sort of thing so i sent them packing chapter before he cut into luke armitages flesh dr glendenning made a thorough examination of the bodys exterior banks watched as the doctor examined and measured the head wound lukes skin was white and showed some wrinkling from exposure to the water and there was a slight discoloration around the neck back of the skull splintered into the cerebellum the doctor said enough to kill him at a guess glendenning bent over and squinted at the wound and it would have bled quite a bit if thats any use could be said banks bloods a lot harder to clean up than most people think what about the weapon looks like some sort of roundedged object the doctor said smoothsided like what well its not got a very large circumference so id rule out something like a baseball bat i cant see any traces wood splinters or anything so it could have been metal or ceramic hard anyway a poker perhaps possible that would fit the dimensions its the angle that puzzles me what about it see for yourself banks bent over the wound which dr glendennings assistant had shaved and cleaned there was no blood a few days in the water would see to that he could see the indentation clearly enough about the right size for a poker but the wound was oblique almost horizontal youd expect someone swinging a poker to swing downward from behind or at least at a fortyfivedegree angle so wed get a more vertical pattern dr glendenning said but this was inflicted from sideways on not from in front or behind by someone a little shorter than the victim if the angles to be believed that means whoever did it was probably standing beside him unusual angle as i said he lit a cigarette strictly forbidden in the hospital but usually overlooked in glendennings case everyone knew that when you were dealing with the smells of a postmortem a ciggie now and then was a great distraction and glendenning was more careful these days he rarely dropped ash in open incisions maybe the victim was already bent double from a previous blow banks suggested to the stomach say or on his knees head bent forward praying it wouldnt be the first time banks said remembering that more than one executed villain had died on his knees praying for his life but luke armitage wasnt a villain as far as banks knew which side did the blow come from banks asked right side you can tell by the pattern of indentation so that would indicate a lefthanded attacker likely so but im not happy with this banks what do you mean well in the first place its hardly a surefire way to kill somebody head blows are tricky you cant count on them especially just one banks knew that well enough on his last case a man had taken seven or eight blows from a sidehandled baton and still survived a couple of days in a coma but alive so our killers an amateur who got lucky could be said glendenning well know more when i get a look at the brain tissue but could this blow have been the cause of death cant say for certain it could have killed him but he might have been dead already youll have to wait for the full toxicology report to know whether that might have been the case not drowned i dont think so but lets wait until we get to the lungs banks watched patiently if rather queasily as dr glendennings assistant made the customary yshaped incision and peeled back the skin and muscle from the chest wall with a scalpel the smell of human muscle rather like raw lamb banks had always thought emanated from the body next the assistant pulled the chest flap up over lukes face and took a bonecutter to the rib cage finally peeling off the chest plate and exposing the inner organs when he had removed these en bloc he placed them on the dissecting table and reached for his electric saw bank knew what was coming next that unforgettable sound and burnedbone smell of the skull so he turned his attention to dr glendenning who was dissecting the organs paying particular attention to the lungs no water he announced or minimal meaning luke was dead when he went in the water ill send the tissues for diatomic analysis but i dont expect theyll find much the electric saw stopped and seconds later banks heard something rather like a combination grating and sucking sound and he knew it was the top of the skull coming off the assistant then cut the spinal cord and the tentorium and lifted the brain out as he carried it to the jar of formalin in which it would hang suspended for a couple of weeks making it firmer and easier to handle dr glendenning had a quick look aha he said i thought so look banks do you see that damage there to the frontal lobes banks saw it and he knew what it meant contre coup exactly which might explain the unusual angle if a blow is delivered while the victims head is stationary then the damage is limited to the point of impact bones splintered into the brain but if the victims head is in motion then the result is a contre coup injury additional damage opposite the point of impact contre coup injuries are almost always the result of a fall luke fell or he was pushed said glendenning but as far as i can tell there are no other injuries no broken bones and as i said if there was bruising if someone hit him say knocked him over then unless there are any small bones in the cheek broken we wont be able to tell well be checking of course can you give me any idea about time of death its important aye well ive looked over dr burnss measurements at the scene very meticulous hell go far rigors been and gone which indicates over two days at the temperatures noted what about the wrinkling and whitening cutis anserina three to five hours water preserves delays putrefaction so it makes our job a little harder theres no lividity and im afraid itll be almost impossible to tell whether there was any other bruising the water takes care of that he paused and frowned but theres the discoloration around the neck what about it that indicates the beginnings of putrefaction in bodies found in water it always starts at the root of the neck after how long thats just it dr glendenning said looking at banks you understand i cant be more specific i cant give you less than a twelvehour margin of error but not until at least three or four days not at the temperatures dr burns recorded banks made a mental calculation bloody hell he said even at the outside that means luke had to have been killed just after he went missing sometime that very night by my calculations taking everything into account between about eight pm and eight am and dr glendennings calculations perhaps because of his insufferable habit of being unwilling to commit himself to a specific time were usually not far from the truth in which case banks thought luke had died before annie had even paid her first visit to swainsdale hall let alone before she had followed martin armitage to the site of the drop before she went off duty though such a thing was somewhat of an illusion in the thick of a major murder investigation annie had made a few inquiries around the bookshops asking after the couple who had tried to sell norman wells books he believed were stolen but she drew a blank before meeting banks for a drink at the queens arms she had also checked recent shoplifting reports but turned up nothing there either the artists impression would be in the evening paper so she would see what happened after that there was something else she had intended to do but it was like that name you cant quite remember the one on the tip of your tongue if she put it out of her mind it would come to her eventually banks was already waiting for her at a corner table and she saw him before he saw her he looked tired annie thought and distracted smoking and staring into the distance she tapped him on the shoulder and asked him if he wanted a refill he came back from a long way and shook his head she bought herself a pint of theakstons bitter and walked over to join him so what was that mysterious message about your wanting to see me she asked nothing mysterious about it at all banks said brightening up a little i just wanted to deliver a message myself in person im all ears it looks as if youre off the hook as far as luke armitages death is concerned annie felt her eyes open wide i am how dr glendenning pegs time of death at least three or four days ago before yes before the kidnap call even came in annie raised her eyes to the ceiling and clapped her hands yes banks smiled at her thought youd be pleased how he didnt drown did he banks sipped some beer no he said pending tox results it looks as if cause of death was a blow to the cerebellum quite possibly the result of a fall a struggle of some sort then exactly what i thought perhaps with the kidnapper very early on or whoever he was with and that person decided to try and collect anyway yes but thats pure speculation so luke died somewhere else and was dumped in the tarn yes probably wherever he was being held if he was being held anyway thered have been a fair bit of blood the doc says so theres every chance of our still finding evidence at the original scene if we can find the scene exactly so we are making progress slowly what about the girl nothing yet annie told him about her meeting with norman wells she noticed banks was watching her as she spoke she could almost see his mind moving making the connections taking a shortcut here and filing this or that piece of information away for later whoever they are he said when shed finished if wells is right and they had been shoplifting then that tells us theyre short of money which gives them a motive for demanding a ransom if they were somehow responsible for lukes death more speculation yes banks admitted lets assume they got into a fight over something or other and luke ended up dead maybe not intentionally but dead is dead they panicked thought of a suitable spot and drove out and dumped him into hallam tarn later that night under cover of darkness theyd need a motor remember which might be a bit of a problem if they were broke maybe they borrowed one we can check cartheft reports for the night in question no matter how much they covered up the body there might still be traces of lukes blood good idea anyway they know who lukes parents are think they might be able to make a few bob out of them which would explain the low demand yes theyre not pros theyve no idea how much to ask and ten grand is a bloody fortune to them but they were watching martin armitage make the drop and they saw me more than likely sorry annie they might not be pros but theyre not stupid they knew the money was tainted then theyd already dumped lukes body remember so they must have known it was just a matter of time before someone found it they could expect the footpath restrictions to work in their favor for a while but someone was bound to venture over hallam tarn eventually annie paused to digest what banks had said she had made a mistake had scared the kidnappers off but luke had already been dead by then so his death wasnt down to her what else could she have done anyway stayed away from the shepherds shelter perhaps red ron was right about that she had guessed that the briefcase contained money did she need to know exactly how much so she had behaved impulsively and not for the first time but it was all salvageable the case her career everything it could all be redeemed have you ever thought she said that they might have planned on kidnapping luke right from the start maybe that was why they befriended him in the first place and why they had to kill him because he knew who they were yes said banks but too many things about this seem hurried spontaneous illthoughtout no annie i think they just took advantage of an existing situation so why kill luke then no idea well have to ask them if we find them oh well find them all right when the girl sees her picture in the paper she might go to ground change her appearance well find them the only thing is banks said letting the words trail off as he reached for another cigarette yes that we need to keep an open mind as regards other lines of inquiry such as im not sure yet there might be something even closer to home i want to talk to a couple of teachers who knew luke fairly well someone should talk to the battys again too then theres all the people we know he came into contact with the day he disappeared put a list together and get dcs jackman and templeton to help with it weve still got a long way to go shit said annie getting to her feet she had remembered the task that had been eluding her all evening what just something i should have checked out before she looked at her watch and waved goodbye maybe its not too late see you later michelle sat back in her seat and watched the fields drift by under a gray sky rain streaking the dirty window every time she took a train she felt as if she were on holiday this evening the train was full sometimes she forgot just how close peterborough was to london only eighty miles or so about a fiftyminute train ride and how many people made the journey every day that was after all what the new town expansion had been about basildon bracknell hemel hempstead hatfield stevenage harlow crawley welwyn garden city milton keynes all in a belt around london even closer than peterborough catchment areas for an overflowing capital where it was fast becoming too expensive for many to live she hadnt been around back then of course but she knew that the population of peterborough had risen from about in to in unable to concentrate on the profession of violence which she had to remember to post back to banks she thought back to her lunch with exdetective inspector robert lancaster he had quite a few years on ben shaw but they were both very much cut from the same cloth oh no doubt about it shaw was ruder more sarcastic a far more unpleasant personality but underneath they were the same kind of copper not necessarily bent michelle took lancasters word on that but not above turning a blind eye if it was to their advantage and not above fraternizing with villains as lancaster had also pointed out he had grown up shoulder to shoulder with criminals like the krays and smaller fry like billy marshall and when it came to future career choices it was often very much a matter of there but for the grace of god go i it was interesting what he had said about graham marshall she thought interesting that he should even remember the boy at all she had never considered that it might have been grahams own criminal activities that got him killed and even now she found it hard to swallow not that fourteenyearolds were immune to criminal activity far from it especially these days but if graham marshall had been involved in something that was likely to get him killed wouldnt somebody have known and come forward surely jet harris or reg proctor would have picked up the scent the real problem though was how she could gather any more information about graham she could go through the statements again read the investigating detectives notebooks and check all the actions allocated but if none of them focused on graham himself as a possible line of inquiry then she would get no further the train slowed down for no apparent reason it was an intercity not a local train so michelle went to the buffet car and bought herself a coffee the paper cup was far too hot even when she used three or four serviettes to hold it if she took the top off it would spill when the train started moving again so she tore a small hole in the plastic top and decided to wait a little while till it cooled michelle looked at her watch after eight oclock getting dark outside she had spent a couple of hours shopping on oxford street after parting with lancaster and she felt a little guilty that she had spent over a hundred pounds on a dress perhaps she was turning into a shopaholic like the drinking the spending had to stop shed never get a chance to wear the damn thing anyway as it was a party dress elegant strapless and stylish and she never went to any parties what could she have been thinking of when the train started up again half an hour later with no explanation for the delay michelle realized that if graham had been involved in anything untoward there was one person who might know something even if he didnt know he did banks and thinking of him made her once again regret the way she had left him at starbucks the other day true she had resented his intrusion into what she regarded as her private life a life she kept very guarded indeed but she had perhaps overreacted a tad after all he had only asked her if she was married a perfectly innocent question in its way and one you might ask a stranger over a coffee it didnt have to mean anything but it was such a raw nerve point with her such a nogo area that she had behaved rudely and now she regretted it well she wasnt married that was certainly the truth melissa had died because she and ted got their wires crossed she was on surveillance and thought he was picking up their daughter after school he had an afternoon meeting and thought she was going to do it possibly no marriage could survive that amount of trauma the guilt blame grief and anger and theirs hadnt almost six months to the day after melissas funeral they had agreed to separate and michelle had begun her years of wandering from county to county trying to put the past behind her succeeding to a large extent but still haunted still in some ways maimed by what had happened she hadnt had either the time or the inclination for men and that was another thing about banks that bothered her he was the only man beyond her immediate colleagues on the job with whom she had spent any time in years and she liked him found him attractive michelle knew that she had been nicknamed the ice queen at more than one station over the past five years but it had only amused her because it couldnt be farther from the truth she was she knew deep down a warm and sensual person as she had been with ted though that was a part of her nature she had neglected for a long time perhaps even suppressed out of punishment being more preoccupied with selfblame she didnt know if banks was married or not though she had noticed that he didnt wear a ring and he had asked her if she was married in addition to being an intrusion that had seemed like a comeon line at the time too and maybe it was the problem was that part of her wanted him against all her common sense and all the barriers she had built inside and the result flustered and confused her almost beyond bearing banks might be one of the few people who could help her reconstruct graham marshalls past but could she bear to face banks again in the flesh she would have no choice she realized as the train pulled up and she reached for her briefcase graham marshalls memorial service would be taking place in a matter of days and she had promised to call and let him know about it it was almost dark when banks turned into the laneway that ran in front of his small cottage and he was tired annie had left by the time he got back to headquarters after finishing his beer so he stuck around for an hour or so picking away at the pile of paperwork then decided to call it a day whatever it was she was after shed tell him after the weekend memories of lukes postmortem hovered unpleasantly close to the surface of his consciousness the way past cases also haunted him over the past few months he had dreamed more than once of emily riddle and of the partially buried bodies he had seen in a cellar in leeds toes poking through the dirt was he going to have to add luke armitage to his list of nightmare images now was there never any end to it someone had parked a car an ancient clappedout fiesta by the looks of it in front of the cottage unable to get past the obstacle banks parked behind it and took out his house keys there was no one inside the car so it wasnt a pair of lovers seeking seclusion maybe someone had dumped it there he thought with a flash of irritation the dirt lane was little more than a culdesac it dwindled to a riverside footpath when it reached the woods about twenty feet beyond bankss cottage and there was no way for a car to get through not everyone knew that of course and sometimes cars turned down it by mistake he ought to consider putting up a sign he thought though he had always thought it obvious enough that the track was a private drive then he noticed that the living room light was on and the curtains closed he knew he hadnt left the light on that morning it could be burglars he thought moving carefully though if it was they were very incompetent ones not only parking in a culdesac but not even bothering to turn their car around for a quick getaway still hed known far stupider criminals like the wouldbe bank robber who had filled out the withdrawal slip with his real name before writing on the back giv me yor munny ive got a nife and handing it to the teller he didnt get far the car was definitely a fiesta with rusted wheel arches it would be lucky to pass its next mot without major and expensive work banks thought as he gave it the onceover and memorized the number plate this was no burglar he tried to remember to whom he had given a key not annie at least not anymore certainly not sandra and just as he opened the door it came to him there was his son brian stretched out on the sofa with tim buckley playing low on stereo i never asked to be your mountain when he heard banks come in he uncoiled his long length sat up and rubbed his eyes oh hi dad its you hello son who else were you expecting nobody i was just half asleep i suppose dreaming dont you believe in telephones sorry its been a bit hectic lately were doing some gigs around teeside starting tomorrow night so i thought id you know just drop in and say hello i had a long drive all the way from south london its good to see you banks gestured with his thumb im surprised you made it in one piece is that pile of junk out there the car you borrowed two hundred quid off me for yeah why i hope you didnt pay any more than that for it thats all banks put his car keys down on the low table took off his jacket and hung it on a hook behind the door i didnt know you were a tim buckley fan he said sitting down in the armchair youd be surprised actually im not really havent heard him much hell of a voice though you can hear it in his sons jeffs he did a great version of this song at a memorial concert for his dad most of the time he refused to acknowledge tim though how do you know all this read a book about them dream brother its pretty good ill lend it to you if i can find it thanks mention of the tim and jeff buckley relationship reminded banks of luke armitage and the tape he still had in his pocket maybe hed get brians opinion for the moment though a stiff drink was in order a laphroaig can i get you anything to drink he asked brian drop of single malt perhaps brian made a face cant stand the stuff if youve got any lager though i think i can manage that banks poured himself the whiskey and found a carlsberg in the back of the fridge glass he called from the kitchen cans fine brian called back if anything brian seemed even taller than the last time banks had seen him at least five or six inches taller than his own five foot nine he had inherited bankss constitutional thinness by the looks of him and wore the usual uniform of torn jeans and a plain tshirt hed had his hair cut not just cut but massacred even shorter than bankss own close crop whats with the haircut banks asked him kept getting in my eyes so what are you up to these days dad still solving crime and keeping the world safe for democracy less of your lip banks lit a cigarette brian gave him a disgusted look im trying to stop banks said its only my fifth all day brian said nothing merely raised his eyebrows anyway banks went on yes im working neil byrds son luke right i heard it on the news while i was driving up poor sod right luke armitage youre the musician in the family what do you think of neil byrd he was pretty cool said brian but maybe just a bit too folksy for me too much of a romantic i guess like dylan he was a lot better when he went electric why im just trying to understand lukes relationship with him thats all he didnt have one neil byrd committed suicide when luke was only three he was a dreamer an idealist the world could never match up to his expectations if that were a reason for suicide brian thered be nobody left alive but it had to have a powerful effect on the boy luke had a bunch of posters in his room dead rock stars seemed obsessed with them not his dad though like who jim morrison kurt cobain ian curtis nick drake you know the usual suspects covers quite a range said brian ill bet you thought your generation had cornered the market in dying young didnt you jimi janis jim he nodded toward the stereo present company i know some of these were more recent well nick drake was another one of your lot and do you know how old i was when ian curtis was with joy division i cant have been more than six or seven but you have listened to joy division ive listened yeah too depressing for me kurt cobain and jeff buckley are a lot closer to home but wheres all this going i honestly dont know said banks im just trying to get some sort of grip on lukes life his state of mind he was into some very weird stuff for a fifteenyearold and there was nothing in his room connected with his father well hed feel pissed off wouldnt he wouldnt you only stands to reason your old man does a bunk when youre just a baby and then offs himself before you can get to know him at all hardly makes you feel wanted does it want to listen to some of his songs who neil byrd no luke sure banks paused the tim buckley cd put the tape in and they both sat in silence sipping their drinks and listening hes good said brian when the tape had finished very good i wish id been that good at his age still raw but with a bit of hard work and a lot of practice do you think he had a future in music then its possible on the other hand you see plenty of bands with no talent get to the top and some really terrific musicians struggle just to make a living so who can say hes got what it takes in its raw form though in my humble opinion was he with a band not that i know of hed be a steal for some upandcoming group hes got talent for a start and they could milk the neil byrd connection for all it was worth did you notice the voice the similarities like tim and jeff yes said banks i did he started the tim buckley cd again it was song to the siren which always sent shivers up his spine hows the cd going he asked havent bloody started it yet have we our managers still haggling over the contracts hence that crappy pile of junk you saw outside i was expecting a jag or a red sports car soon dad soon by the way weve changed our name why the manager thought jimson weed was a bit too sixties hes right yeah well were the blue lamps now the police no thats another band the blue lamps i was thinking of dixon of dock green come again the blue lamp it was a film fifties its where george dixon made his debut before it became a tv series a blue lamp used to be the sign of a police station still is in some places im not sure you want to be going around associating yourself with that the stuff you know anyway our manager thinks its okay more modern you know white stripes blue lamps but ill tell him what you said our sounds hardened up a bit too got a bit more grungy and less slick i get to play some real down and dirty guitar solos you must come and hear us again weve come a long way since that last gig you were at id love to but i thought you sounded just fine then thanks i saw your grandparents the other day yeah how are they same as ever you should visit them more often oh you know how it is no i dont know they dont like me dad not since i screwed up my degree and joined the band whenever i see them its always tracys doing this and tracys doing that they dont care how well i do you know thats not true said banks who suspected it probably was after all werent they the same way with him it was all roy roy roy no matter what banks achieved hed had a hard enough time reconciling himself to his sons chosen career just the same way his mother and father had with him the only difference was that he had come to terms with brians choice whereas his own parents hadnt even come to terms with his career let alone their grandsons anyway im sure theyd love to see you yeah okay ill try to go and see them when ive got time hows your mother fine i suppose seen her lately not for a few weeks hows she doing with the you know it must be due soon yeah i guess so look dad is there anything to eat i havent had any dinner yet and im starving banks thought hed eaten a prawn sandwich earlier in the queens arms and wasnt particularly hungry he knew there was nothing substantial in the fridge or the freezer he looked at his watch theres a chinese takeaway down in helmthorpe they should still be open if you like cool said brian finishing off his lager what are we waiting for banks sighed and reached for his jacket again so much for quality time michelle could have walked to rivergate it wasnt that far but it also wasnt a particularly pleasant walk and the rain was still pouring down so she decided to treat herself to a taxi from the station the first inkling she got that something was wrong in the flat was when she heard the creaking door of her mystery screensaver and saw the lights going on and off in the creepylooking mansion as the full moon slowly crossed the starlit sky she knew she had turned her computer off after shed checked her email that morning she always did she was compulsive about it also someone had pulled some of the books out of one of the boxes that she hadnt got around to unpacking they werent damaged or anything just piled up on the floor beside the box michelle jogged the mouse and the computer returned to its regular display only it was open at michelles file of notes about the marshall case and she knew she hadnt opened that since the previous night there was nothing secret about her speculations nothing she had thought would even interest anyone else so she hadnt bothered with password protection in the future she would know better with the hairs prickling at the back of her neck michelle stood still and strained her ears for any odd sounds in the flat nothing except the clock ticking and the humming of the refrigerator she took her old sidehandled baton from her uniform days out of the closet by the door gripping that made her feel a little more courageous as she went to explore the rest of the flat the kitchen light was on and a couple of items that she knew she had put back in the fridge that morning milk butter eggs lay on the countertop the butter had melted into a shapeless lump and it oozed over her fingers when she picked it up her bathroom cabinet stood open and the various pills and potions she kept there were not in their usual order her bottle of aspirin sat on the edge of the sink top off and cotton wool missing even as the chills went up her spine michelle wondered what the hell all this was about if someone had searched the place though she couldnt imagine why anyone would want to then why not just leave it in a mess clearly whoever had done this had done it to scare her and they were succeeding she went into the bedroom cautiously gripping the sidehandled baton more tightly expecting the worst nobody jumped out of the wardrobe at her but what she saw there made her drop her baton and put her hands to her mouth there was no mess perhaps some of her drawers werent completely closed the way she had left them but there was no mess it was much much worse spread out neatly at the center of the bed lay melissas dress when michelle reached out to pick it up she found it had been cut cleanly into two halves michelle staggered back against the wall half the dress clutched to her chest hardly able to believe what was happening as she did so her eye caught the writing on the dressingtable mirror forget graham marshall bitch remember melissa you could join her michelle cried out covered her face with the dress and slid down the wall to the floor chapter norman wells sat in the interview room with his folded arms resting on the top of his paunch and his lips pressed tight together if he was scared he wasnt showing it but then he didnt know how much the police already knew about him banks and annie sat opposite him files spread out in front of them banks felt wellrested after a day off he had stayed up late saturday night eating chinese food and talking with brian but on sunday after brian left he had done nothing but read the papers go for a walk from helmthorpe to rawley force and back by himself stopping for a pub lunch and fiddling with the sunday times crossword in the evening he had thought of ringing michelle hart in peterborough but decided against it they hadnt parted on the best of terms so let her contact him first if she wanted to after a small laphroaig and a cigarette outside enjoying the mild evening air around sunset he had listened to ian bostridges english song book cd gone to bed before half past ten and slept as soundly as he could remember in a long time norman said banks you dont mind if i call you norman do you its my name detective inspector cabbot here has been doing a bit of digging around in your background and it turns out youve been a naughty boy havent you wells said nothing annie pushed a file toward banks and he opened it you used to be a schoolteacher am i right you know i did or you wouldnt have dragged me in here away from my business banks raised his eyebrows its my understanding that you came here of your own free will when asked to help us with our inquiries am i wrong do you think im an idiot i dont follow and theres no need to play the thickie with me you know what i mean if i hadnt come willingly youd have found some way to bring me here whether i wanted to come or not so just get on with it it might not seem much to you but i have a business to run customers who rely on me well try to see that you get back to your shop as soon as possible norman but first id like you to answer a few questions for me you taught at a private school in cheltenham right yes how long ago i left seven years ago why did you leave i grew tired of teaching banks glanced at annie who frowned leaned over and pointed at some lines on the typed sheet of paper in front of banks norman banks went on i think i ought to inform you that detective inspector cabbot spoke to your old headmaster mr fulwell earlier this morning he was reticent to discuss school business at first but when she informed him that we were conducting a possible murder investigation he was a little more forthcoming we know all about you norman the moment of truth wells seemed to deflate and shrink in his chair his plump lower lip pushed up and all but obscured the upper his chin disappeared into his neck and his arms seemed to wrap more tightly around his lower chest what do you want from me he whispered the truth i had a nervous breakdown what caused it the pressures of the job youve no idea what teachings like i dont imagine i have banks admitted thinking that the last thing hed want to do was stand up in front of thirty or forty scruffy hormonally challenged teenagers and try to get them interested in shakespeare or the war of jenkinss ear anyone with that skill deserved his admiration and a medal too for that matter what particular pressures led you to decide to leave it was nothing specific just a general sort of breakdown stop beating about the bush norman annie cut in does the name steven farrow mean anything to you wells paled nothing happened i never touched him false accusations according to the headmaster norman you were infatuated with this thirteenyearold boy so much so that you neglected your duties became an embarrassment to the school and on one occasion enough wells slammed his fist down on the metal table youre just like everyone else you poison the truth with your lies you cant stare beauty in the eye so you have to destroy it poison it for everyone else steven farrow norman annie repeated thirteen years old it was pure a pure love wells rubbed his teary eyes with his forearm but you wouldnt understand that would you to people like you anything other than a man and a woman is dirty abnormal perverted try us norman said banks give us a chance you loved him steven was beautiful an angel all i wanted was to be close to him to be with him what could be wrong with that but you touched him norman said annie he told i never touched him he was lying he turned on me he wanted money can you believe it my little angel wanted money i would have done anything for him made any sacrifice but something so vulgar as money i blame them of course not steven they poisoned him against me they made him turn on me wells wiped his eyes again who did norman the others the other boys what happened banks asked i refused of course steven went to the headmaster and i was asked to leave no questions asked no scandal all for the good of the school you see but word got around on the scrap heap at thirtyeight one foolish mistake he shook his head that boy broke my heart surely you couldnt expect them to keep you on banks said in fact youre bloody lucky they didnt bring in the police and you know how we feel about pedophiles i am not a child molester i would have been content just just to be with him have you ever been in love banks said nothing he sensed annie glance at him wells leaned forward and rested his forearms on the table you cant choose the object of your desire you know you cant it may be a cliché to say that love is blind but like many clichés its not without a grain of truth i didnt choose to love steven i simply couldnt help myself banks had heard this argument before from pedophiles that they werent responsible for their desires that they didnt choose to love little boys and he had at least a modicum of sympathy for their predicament after all it wasnt only pedophiles who fell in love with the wrong people but he didnt feel enough sympathy to condone their actions im sure you are aware he said that its illegal for a thirtyeightyearold man to initiate a sexual relationship with a thirteenyearold boy and that its inappropriate for a teacher to be involved in any way with a pupil even if that pupil did happen to be over the age of consent which steven wasnt there was no sexual relationship steven lied they made him do it i never touched him thats as may be said banks you might not have been able to help your feelings but you could have controlled your actions i think you know right from wrong its all so hypocritical wells said what do you mean who says there can be no real love between youth and age the greeks didnt think so society said banks the law and its not the love we legislate against the laws there to protect the innocent and the vulnerable from those predators who should know better ha it shows how little you know who do you think was the vulnerable one here the innocent one steven farrow do you think just because a boy is of a certain tender age that he is incapable of manipulating his elders incapable of blackmail thats very naive of you if you dont mind my saying so luke armitage annie cut in wells leaned back and licked his lips he was sweating profusely banks noticed and starting to smell sour and rank i wondered when wed be getting around to him thats why youre here norman did you think it was about steven farrow id no idea what it would be about i havent done anything wrong the farrow affairs all water under the bridge hushed up no charges no serious damage done except to me you were among the last people to see luke armitage on the day he disappeared norman annie went on when we found out about your past isnt it only natural that we should want to talk to you about him i know nothing about what happened to him but you were friends with him werent you acquaintances he was a customer we talked about books sometimes thats all he was an attractive boy wasnt he norman like steven farrow did he remind you of steven wells sighed the boy left my shop i never saw him again are you certain banks asked are you sure he didnt come back or you didnt meet him somewhere else your house perhaps i never saw him again why would he come to my house i dont know said banks you tell me he didnt never never did he come back to the shop did something happen there something bad did you kill him and then move him after dark maybe it was a terrible accident i cant believe you meant to kill him not if you loved him i didnt love him society has seen to it that im quite incapable of loving anyone ever again no matter what you think of me i am not a fool i do know wrong from right chief inspector whether i agree with the definition or not i am capable of selfcontrol i am an emotional eunuch i know that society regards my urges as evil and sinful and i have no desire to spend the rest of my days in jail believe me the prison of my own making is bad enough i suppose the money was an afterthought was it banks went on but why not why not make a little money out of what youd done i mean you could do with it couldnt you look at the dump you spend your days in a crappy usedbook business in a dank cold dungeon cant be making much money can it an extra ten thousand quid would have set you up nicely not too greedy just enough wells had tears in his eyes again and he was shaking his head slowly from side to side its all ive got he said his voice catching in his throat his whole body starting to shake now my books my cat theyre all ive got cant you see that man he pushed his florid bulbous face toward banks and banged his fist to his heart theres nothing else left here for me have you no humanity but its still not very much is it banks pressed on wells looked him in the eye and regained some of his composure who are you to say that who are you to pronounce judgment on a mans life do you think i dont know im ugly do you think i dont notice the way people look at me do you think i dont know im the object of laughter and derision do you think i have no feelings every day i sit down there in my dank cold dungeon as you so cruelly refer to it like some sort of pariah some deformed monster in his lair some some quasimodo and i contemplate my sins my desires my dreams of love and beauty and purity deemed ugly and evil by a hypocritical world all i have is my books and the unconditional love of one of gods creatures how dare you judge me no matter what you feel said banks society has to protect its children and for that we need laws they may seem arbitrary to you sometimes they seem arbitrary to me i mean fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen fourteen where do you draw the line who knows norman maybe one day well be as enlightened as youd like us to be and lower the age of consent to thirteen but until then we have to have those lines or all becomes chaos he was thinking of graham marshall as well as luke armitage as he spoke society hadnt done a very good job of protecting either of them i have done nothing wrong said wells crossing his arms again the problem was as banks and annie had already discussed that the closedcircuit television cameras corroborated wellss story luke armitage had entered normans used books at two minutes to five and left alone at five twentyfour what time did you close that day banks asked half past five as usual and what did you do i went home number fiftyseven arden terrace yes thats off market street isnt it close yes do you live alone yes do you own a car a secondhand renault good enough to get you out to hallam tarn and back wells hung his head in his hands ive told you i did nothing i havent been near hallam tarn in months certainly not since the footandmouth outbreak banks could smell his sweat even more strongly now sharp and acrid like an animal secretion what did you do after you went home had my tea leftover chicken casserole if youre interested watched television read for a while then went to sleep what time id say i was in bed by half past ten alone wells just glared at banks you didnt go out again that evening where would i go pub pictures i dont drink and i dont socialize i prefer my own company and i happen to believe that there hasnt been a decent picture made in the last forty years did luke armitage visit your house at any time that evening no has luke armitage ever visited your house no hes never even stepped inside your front door not just for a moment i talk to him in the shop sometimes thats all he doesnt even know where i live did you ever give him a lift anywhere no how could i do that i walk to and from the shop every day its not far and its good exercise besides you know what parkings like around the market square so luke has never been in your car never in that case said banks im sure you wont mind if our forensic experts have a close look at your house and your car wed also like to take a dna sample just for comparison wells stuck his chin out what if i do mind well keep you here until we get a search warrant remember norman i wouldnt like to say judges are swayed by such things but luke armitage came from a wealthy and wellrespected family while youre a disgraced schoolteacher eking out a living in a dingy usedbook shop and that shop was the last place we know luke visited before he disappeared wells hung his head fine he said go ahead do what you will i dont care anymore after a sleepless night on saturday michelle had spent sunday getting over the shock of what had happened in her flat and trying to rein in her emotional response in favor of more analytical thought she hadnt got very far that someone had gained entry and arranged things in order to frighten her was obvious enough why was another matter entirely that the interloper knew about melissa surprised her though she supposed people could find out anything about her if they really wanted to but given that he knew it would have been evident when he searched her bedside drawers that the little dress was melissas and that its desecration would cause her a great deal of anguish in other words it had been a cold calculated assault the flats were supposed to be secure but michelle had been a copper long enough to know that a talented burglar could get around almost anything though it went against every grain of michelles nature not to report the breakin to the police in the end she decided against it mostly this was because graham marshalls name had been written in her own red lipstick on the dressingtable mirror the intrusion was meant to frighten her off the case and the only people who knew she was working on it apart from the marshalls themselves were other police officers or people connected with them like dr cooper true michelles name had been in the papers once or twice when the bones had first been found so technically everyone in the entire country could know she was on the case but she felt the answers lay a lot closer to home the question was was she going to be frightened off the case the answer was no at least there hadnt been much cleaning up to do michelle had however dumped the entire contents of her bathroom cabinet and would have to contact her doctor for new prescriptions she had also dumped the contents of the fridge which hadnt been a big job at all more important she had found a locksmith in the yellow pages and arranged to have a chain and an extra deadbolt lock put on her door as a result of her weekend experience michelle felt drained and edgy on monday morning and found herself looking at everyone in divisional headquarters differently as if they knew something she didnt as if they were pointing at her and talking about her it was a frightening feeling and every time she caught someones eye she looked away creeping paranoia she told herself and tried to shake it off first she had a brief meeting with dc collins who told her he was getting nowhere checking the old perv reports most of the people the police had interviewed at the time were either dead or in jail and those who werent had nothing new to add she phoned dr cooper who still hadnt located her knife expert hilary wendell yet then she went down to the archives to check out the old notebooks and action allocations these days since the police and criminal evidence act there were very strict rules regarding police notebooks you couldnt leave blank pages for example each page was numbered and if you missed one by mistake you had to draw a line through it and write omitted in error entries had to be preceded by date and time underlined and at the end of each day the officer had to draw a continuous line below the final entry most of this was to prevent officers from verballing suspects attributing to them words they hadnt used confessions they hadnt made and to avoid any sort of revisions after the fact notes were made on the spot often quickly and accuracy was important because the notebooks might need to be used in court an officers notebooks could be invaluable when trying to reconstruct the pattern of an investigation as could the action allocations records made of all the instructions issued to investigating officers by the senior investigating officer for example if dc higginbottom was asked to go and interview joe smiths neighbor that order or action would be recorded in the actions allocation book and his record of the interview would be in his notebook by looking at the actions you could determine which areas of inquiry had been pursued and which had not and by reading the notebooks you could unearth impressions that might not have made it into final statements and formal reports completed notebooks were first handed to a detective inspector who would look them over and if everything was acceptable send them to the records clerk for filing that meant they piled up over the years whoever said we were heading for a paperless world michelle thought as she walked along the rows of shelving stacked to the ceiling with boxes obviously wasnt a copper mrs metcalfe showed her where the notebooks were filed and michelle went first by instinct to ben shaws but no matter how many times she flipped through the boxes checked and rechecked the dates in the end she had to admit that if there had been notebooks covering the period of major activity in the graham marshall case on the day of his disappearance august over the next month or two then they had vanished michelle found it difficult to decipher shaws handwriting in the notebooks she did find but she could just about make out that his last entry was on august when he had been questioning a witness to a post office robbery and the next one was a new notebook started on the sixth of october of the same year michelle asked for mrs metcalfes help but after half an hour even the poor records clerk had to admit defeat i cant imagine where theyve got to love she said except they might have got misfiled by my predecessor or lost in one of the moves could someone have taken them michelle asked i dont see who or why i mean its only people like you who come down here other police exactly what michelle had been thinking she could have taken out anything she wanted during her visits and mrs metcalfe would have been none the wiser which meant that anyone else could too someone had gained entry to her flat and tried to scare her off the case and now she found that nearly two months worth a crucial two months worth of notebooks had somehow disappeared coincidence michelle didnt think so half an hour later when they had run into the same problem with the action allocation book for the graham marshall case michelle knew in her bones that the actions and the notebooks were gone forever destroyed most likely but why and by whom the discovery didnt help her paranoia one bit she was beginning to feel way out of her depth what the hell should she do now after the interview banks felt the urge to get out of the station away from the acrid stink of norman wellss sweat so he decided to head out lyndgarth way and talk to luke armitages music teacher alastair ford while annie continued to supervise the search for lukes mystery woman in bankss experience music teachers were an odd lot indeed partly no doubt because of the frustration of trying to instill the beauties of beethoven and bach into minds addled with radiohead and mercury rev not that banks had anything against pop music in his day the class had kept pestering their music teacher mr watson to play the beatles he relented once but looked glum the whole time his feet didnt tap and his heart wasnt in it when he played dvoraks new world symphony or tchaikovskys simphonie pathétique however it was another matter he closed his eyes swayed and conducted hummed along as the main themes swelled all the time the kids in the class were laughing at him and reading comics under their desks but he was oblivious in a world of his own one day mr watson failed to turn up for class rumor had it that hed suffered a nervous breakdown and was resting in a sanatorium he never returned to teaching as far as banks knew yesterdays rain had rinsed the landscape clean and brought out the bright greens of the lower daleside dotted with purple clover yellow buttercups and celandines the limestone scar of fremlington edge glowed in the sunlight and below it the village of lyndgarth with its small church and lopsided village green like a handkerchief flapping in the wind seemed asleep banks consulted his map found the minor road he was looking for and turned right fords cottage was about as isolated as bankss own and when he parked behind the dark blue honda he understood why it wasnt the new world symphony but the beautiful recordare for soprano and mezzosoprano from verdis requiem blasting out of the open windows at full volume if banks hadnt been playing the stoness aftermath cd in the car he would have heard it a mile away it took a bit of hammering at the door but eventually the music quietened down and it was answered by the man banks recognized from the aeolian string quartet concert alastair ford had five oclock shadow a long hooked nose and a bright gleam in his eyes if he had any his hair would probably have been sticking out in all directions but he was quite bald what was it about luke armitage banks wondered this was the second person hed met that day who had spent time with the boy and looked as mad as a hatter maybe luke attracted weirdos maybe it was because he was more than a little weird himself however banks determined to keep an open mind whether alastair fords eccentricity had a dangerous edge remained to be seen im as fond of verdi as the next man said banks showing his warrant card but dont you think its a bit too loud oh dont tell me old farmer jones has complained about the music again he says it curdles his cows milk philistine im not here about the noise mr ford might i come in and have a word now im curious said ford leading the way inside his house was clean but looked livedin with little piles of sheet music here and there a violin resting on a low table and the massive stereo system dominating the living room a policeman who knows his verdi im no expert banks said but ive recently bought a new recording so ive listened to it a few times lately ah yes renée fleming and the kirov very nice but i must admit im still rather attached to the von otter and gardiner anyway i cant imagine youve come here to discuss old joe green with me what can i do for you ford was birdlike in many ways especially in his sudden jerky movements but when he sat down in the overstuffed armchair he fell still fingers linked in his lap he wasnt relaxed though banks could sense the mans tension and unease and he wondered what its cause was maybe he just didnt like being questioned by the police its about luke armitage said banks i understand you knew him ah poor luke a remarkably talented boy such a great loss when did you last see him around the end of term are you sure you havent seen him since ive barely left the cottage since then except to drive into lyndgarth for groceries alone with my music after a term of teaching those philistines what bliss i gather luke armitage wasnt a philistine though far from it you were giving him violin lessons am i right yes here or at school at school tuesday evenings we have a reasonably wellequipped music room there mind you we ought to be grateful for anything these days theyll spend a fortune on sports equipment but when it comes to music did luke ever talk to you about anything that was on his mind he didnt talk a lot mostly he concentrated on his playing he had remarkable powers of concentration unlike so many of todays youth he wasnt much of a one for small talk we did chat about music argued once or twice about pop music which i gathered he was rather fond of never about anything else like what anything that might have been bothering him worrying him anyone he might have been afraid of that sort of thing im afraid not luke was a very private person and im not the prying kind truth be told im not very good at helping people with their emotional problems he ran his hand over his smooth head and smiled thats why i prefer to live alone not married was many moons ago what happened search me what usually happens banks thought of sandra what usually happens so you just taught him the violin thats all mainly yes i mean he was in my class too at school but i wouldnt say i knew him or that we were friends or anything like that i respected his talent even if he did dabble in pop music but thats as far as it went did he ever mention his parents not to me what about his biological father neil byrd never heard of him banks looked around the room its a very isolated cottage you have here mr ford is it yes i suppose it is isolation suits you it must do mustnt it fords foot started tapping on the floor his knee jerking and not to the rhythm of the now barely audible requiem do you ever have company rarely i play in a string quartet and sometimes the other members come out here to rehearse other than that im rather given to solitary pursuits look i no girlfriends i told you im not good at relationships boyfriends ford raised an eyebrow im not good at relationships yet you manage the teacherstudent relationship i have a talent for teaching do you enjoy it in a way sometimes banks got up and walked over to the window there was a fine view of the dale looking back toward eastvale in the distance banks thought he could just make out the castle on its hill did luke armitage ever come here he asked turning to face ford no youre certain very few people come here i would remember look if you want to know about luke ask lauren lauren anderson yes she knew him far better than i did shes a well you know shes the sort of person people talk to about their problems and stuff emotions yes do you know if luke was close to anyone else you could try our head teachers daughter banks had a quick flash of that sudden flurry of blond hair and long leg he had noticed after his conversation with gavin barlow rose barlow thats the one little minx were she and luke friends thick as thieves when was this earlier this year february or march where did you see them together at school nowhere else i dont go anywhere else except here all i can say is i saw them talking sometimes in the corridors and playground and they seemed close banks made a mental note to follow up on rose barlow do you have a mobile phone he asked good lord what an odd question do you no i see no use for one personally i barely use the telephone i do have where were you last monday here were you in eastvale at all last week ive already told you ive hardly left the cottage what have you been doing what do you mean here in the cottage alone all this time ford got to his feet and the birdlike motions started up again playing music listening reading dabbling in a little composition look really its none of your business you know even if you are a policeman the last time i noticed we were still living in a free country it was just a simple question mr ford no need to get upset fords voice took on a piercing edge im not getting upset but youre prying i hate people prying i cant tell you anything go talk to lauren leave me alone banks stared at him for a moment ford wouldnt meet his gaze if i find out youve been lying to me mr ford ill be back do you understand im not lying i havent done anything leave me alone before leaving banks showed him the artists impression of the girl josie batty had seen with luke ford hardly glanced at the sketch and said he didnt recognize her he was weird without a doubt banks thought as he started his car but you couldnt arrest people just for being weird the volume went way up again and banks could hear verdis lacrimosa chasing him all the way to lyndgarth thank you for seeing to the release love mrs marshall said well be holding the funeral service at saint peters the day after tomorrow joans coming back up for it of course i must say the vicars been very good considering none of us were what youd call regular churchgoers youll be there yes of course said michelle theres just one thing whats that love michelle told her about the rib they needed for evidence mrs marshall frowned and thought for a moment i dont think we need worry about a little thing like a missing rib need we especially if it might help you thank you said michelle you look tired love is everything all right yes fine michelle managed to dredge up a weak smile is there any more news no im afraid not only more questions i cant understand what else i have to tell you but please go ahead michelle leaned back in her chair this was going to be difficult she knew to find out about any mischief graham might have been up to without suggesting that he got up to mischief which his mother would never accept was almost to do the impossible still she could but try was graham ever away from home for any periods of time what do you mean did we send him away no but you know what kids are like sometimes they just like to take off and not tell you where theyve been they worry you sick but they dont seem to realize it at the time oh i know what you mean im not saying our graham was any different from the other kids that way he missed his tea from time to time and once or twice he missed his nineoclock curfew and manys the occasion we didnt see hide nor hair of him from dawn till dusk not during term time mind you just weekends and school holidays he could be a bit unreliable did you have any idea where hed been when he turned up late playing with his pals sometimes hed have his guitar with him too they were practicing see the group where did they do that david grenfells house other than group practice did he ever stay out late on other occasions once in a while he was just a normal boy how much pocket money did you give him five shillings a week it was all we could afford but he had his paper round and that made him a bit extra and you bought all his clothes sometimes hed save up if there was something he really wanted like a beatles jumper you know like the one hes wearing in the photo there so he didnt go short of anything no not sos youd notice why what are you trying to get at im just trying to get a picture of his activities mrs marshall itll help me try to work out what might have happened to him who might have stopped and picked him up you think it was somebody he knew i didnt say that but its possible mrs marshall fiddled with her necklace the idea clearly upset her whether it was the idea of an acquaintance being responsible or whether she had suspected such a thing deep down was impossible to say but we didnt know anybody like that she said like what a pervert she whispered we dont know that it was a pervert i dont understand thats what the police said who else could it be jet harris told you that yes did anyone ever suggest at any time that graham might have been abducted by someone he knew heavens no why would anyone do that why indeed said michelle and you know nothing about any unsavory company graham might have been keeping perhaps on these occasions when he stayed out late or was gone all day no he was with his friends i dont understand what youre trying to say its all right said michelle im not sure that i understand it myself i suppose all i really want to ask is whether graham had any friends you disliked or spent time with anyone you didnt approve of oh no they were all just regular lads we knew their mums and dads they were just like us no older boys no one you thought was a bad influence no and graham never seemed to have more money than you expected him to have mrs marshalls expression sharpened and michelle knew shed gone too far she also knew that she had touched a raw nerve are you suggesting our graham was a thief of course not michelle backtracked i just wondered if he maybe did other odd jobs he didnt tell you about other than the paper round perhaps when he should have been at school mrs marshall still eyed her suspiciously bill marshall seemed to be taking everything in his beady eyes moving from one to the other as they spoke but they were the only things moving in his face if only he could talk michelle thought and then she realized that would be no use he wouldnt tell her anything i suppose its just a mark of my frustration with the case michelle admitted after all it was so long ago jet harris always said it was them moors murderers the ones who were tried the year after he said wed all probably have nightmares for the rest of our lives if we ever knew how many young lives theyd taken and where the bodies were buried he told you that did he said michelle how very convenient she was fast coming to the conclusion or reaffirming what she had suspected earlier that detective superintendent harris had run the case with blinkers on and mrs marshall like so many mothers hadnt a clue what her son was up to most of the time she wondered if his father knew bill marshalls lopsided face gave away nothing but michelle fancied she could see wariness in his eyes and something else she couldnt say with any certainty that it was guilt but it looked like that to her michelle took a deep breath and plunged in i understand your husband used to work for the kray twins back in london there was a short silence then mrs marshall said bill didnt work for them as such he used to spar with them down the gym we knew them of course we did we grew up in the same neighborhood everybody knew reggie and ronnie always polite to me they were no matter what anybody says about them and ive heard some stories as would make your hair curl but they were basically good lads people dont like it when others get a bit above their station you know michelle could feel her jaw dropping there was nothing more to be gained here she realized and if she was going to solve this case she was going to do so without the familys help and without ben shaws and perhaps in peril of her life remember melissa you could join her promising again that she would be at the funeral michelle excused herself and hurried off that evening at home banks glanced through the evening paper over a madras curry hed bought earlier at marks and spencers slipped bill evanss paris concert into the cd player poured himself a couple of fingers of laphroaig and flopped down on the sofa with his photoplay diary he thought it was oscar wilde who had said i never travel without my diary one should always have something sensational to read on the train but he could have been wrong it was easy to attribute just about any witty saying to oscar wilde or groucho marx curious though he stirred himself and checked the oxford dictionary of quotations and found that he was right this time bankss diary was far from sensational as he flipped the pages once again glancing at the pretty actresses he hardly remembered carol lynley jill st john yvette mimieux he was struck by how many records he had bought and films he had seen until just a couple of weeks from grahams disappearance banks saw that his diary did in fact have its moments and as he read the trivial or cryptic entries he was able to fill in the rest with his memory and imagination for the first two weeks of august the banks family had been on their annual holidays there was nothing unusual in that they went every year at the same time his fathers annual factory shutdown fortnight what was unusual that year was that they went to blackpool much further afield than their usual trip to great yarmouth or skegness and that they took graham marshall with them at fourteen banks was of an age when he found wandering around a seaside resort with his parents embarrassing and riding the donkey on the beach or playing with a bucket and spade no longer held any appeal as grahams dad had just started on a large building project his work being far more seasonal than arthur bankss and it didnt look as if the marshalls would get a holiday that year financial arrangements were made and graham was allowed to accompany them visit blackpool see the famous tower hear reginald dixon at the mighty organ see the glorious golden mile go to a starstudded variety show on one of the three piers have hours of family fun at the pleasure beach it might as well have been the moon at some ridiculously early hour in the morning because that was when they always set off on holiday they would have piled their cases into the back of arthur bankss morris traveller a popular sort of estate car with a woodframe rear and headed north on their long journey no doubt arriving tired and cranky but in good time for tea at mrs barracloughs boarding house bed breakfast and evening meal at six oclock on the dot and woe betide you if you were late mrs barraclough was a large forbidding presence whom banks remembered even now as dressed in a pinny standing with her thick legs apart and her arms folded under her massive bosom banks saw that he had recorded the weather every day at the top of his entry and as holidays went they had done quite well nine days of at least partial sunshine out of fourteen and only two and a half complete washouts on the rainy days banks and graham had hung about the amusement arcades on the golden mile he noted or on one of the piers and played the onearmed bandits and pinball machines one rainy sunday afternoon they spent watching the old war films that always seemed to be showing on rainy sunday afternoons patriotic films with titles such as the day will dawn in which we serve and went the day well on overcast days they would wander the prom eating fish and chips from newspapers or boiled shrimp from paper bags and go hunting through the towns few secondhand bookshops banks looking for sexton blake novelettes he had bought one called the mind killers or ian fleming novels while graham went after famous monsters magazines and isaac asimov stories one night they all went to the tower circus and banks noted in his diary that he found charlie cairolis act very funny they also took in a variety show on the north pier with morecambe and wise providing the comedy and the hollies the music but most evenings after tea they spent watching television in the guests lounge the tv was an old model even for then with a small screen banks remembered and you turned it on by opening a sprung flap on the top under which were the volume and contrast controls banks hadnt recorded it in his diary but no doubt there would have been some adult wanting to watch sunday night at the london palladium instead of perry mason which was only to be expected of adults luckily roy was sleeping on a camp bed in his parents room so banks and graham would just go up to their room and read listen to radio luxembourg on their transistors or pore over the dirty magazines graham seemed to get hold of in abundance of course they didnt spend every minute of every day together graham had been moody at times unusually quiet and looking back banks suspected he had been preoccupied with some problem or other at the time though he hadnt given it a second thought had simply gone his own way on occasion on his third day wandering the streets alone looking for somewhere to sit down and have a cigarette banks discovered a coffee bar down a flight of stairs off the beaten track he hadnt thought of this in years but the stark diary entry brought it back in all its richness and detail he could even hear the hissing of the espresso machine and smell the darkroasted coffee the place had a tropical ambience with rough stucco walls potted palms and soft calypso music playing in the background but it was the girl behind the counter who drew him back there time after time she was far too old for him even if he did look older when he smoked and could pass for sixteen and get into x films probably over twenty she would have an older boyfriend with a car and lots of money a pretty girl like her but banks fell for her the way he had fallen for the factory girl mandy linda was her name that linda was beautiful went without saying she had long dark hair sparkling blue eyes an easy smile and lips he yearned to kiss what he could see of the rest of her body when she came out from behind the counter was also the stuff that fantasies were made on like ursula andress walking out of the sea in dr no she was nice to him too she talked to him smiled at him and one day she even gave him a second cup of espresso for nothing he loved to watch her working the machines behind the counter nibbling her lower lip as she frothed the milk once or twice she caught him looking and smiled he could feel himself blush to the roots of his being and he knew that she knew he was in love with her this was one secret and one place he didnt share with graham as the holiday progressed banks and graham did all the usual things some with the rest of the family and some by themselves when it was warm enough they spent time lounging with bankss mother and father on the beach in their swimming trunks among crowds of rough northerners with knotted hankies on their heads they even went in the sea once or twice but it was cold so they didnt stay long mostly they just lay there plugged into their radios hoping to hear the animals singing weve gotta get out of this place or the byrds doing mr tambourine man and surreptitiously eyeing the girls in their bathing suits in fact reading over his diary not only of the holiday but of the entire year banks was amazed at how much of his time was taken up with girls with thoughts and dreams of sex his hormones were running his life that year no doubt about it the highlight of the week though was the two girls and that was where bankss diary approached the sensational one fine evening banks and graham headed down to the pleasure beach opposite the south pier they took one of the open trams sitting on the upper deck and thrilling at the lights with the wind in their hair the pleasure beach was a bustle of color and sound from the rattling of the rides to the shrieks and screams of the passengers as they were walking around trying to decide which ride to go on first they noticed two girls about their own age who kept looking at them whispering to each other and giggling the way girls did they werent mods but wore blouses and skirts of the more conservative length some parents still insisted on eventually banks and graham approached them and graham being the silent moody type banks offered them cigarettes and started chatting them up he couldnt remember what he said just something to make the girls laugh and think these boys were cool the way it turned out this time he linked up with the one he fancied most though to be honest they were both all right not like the usual pairing the goodlooking one with the ugly friend tina was short with rather large breasts a dark complexion and long wavy brown hair her friend sharon was a slender blonde the only flaw banks noticed was a couple of spots under her makeup and the bubble gum she was chewing but there was nothing she could do about the spots he knew he had a couple of embarrassing ones himself and she soon took out the gum and threw it away they went on the ghost train first and the girls got scared when phosphorescent skeletons jumped out and hung in front of the slowmoving cars but what made them scream and lean closer into the chests of their companions were the cobwebs that occasionally brushed across their faces in the dark after the ghost train they were holding hands and graham suggested they ride on the big dipper a huge roller coaster next tina was scared but the others assured her it would be okay graham paid that was something banks remembered as he read through his diary he lit a cigarette sipped some laphroaig and thought about it for a moment as bill evans played on graham often paid he always seemed to have plenty of money always enough even back in peterborough for ten gold leaf and a doublebill at the gaumont maybe even some kiaora and a choc ice from the woman who came around with the tray during the intermission banks never wondered or asked where he got it from at the time he just assumed that graham got plenty of pocket money from his dad in addition to his paperround money looking back now though it seemed odd that a workingclass kid a bricklayers son should always have so much ready cash to spend if the ghost train had set things up nicely banks thought going back to the memory the big dipper had the girls throwing their arms around banks and graham and burying their faces in their shoulders banks even stole a quick kiss from sharon as they rose up toward one of the steepest descents and she clung to him all the way down hair streaming shrieking blue murder flushed and exhilarated they walked out of the pleasure beach onto the prom the illuminations didnt start until later in the year but there were still bracelets and necklaces of lights all over the front like christmas decorations banks had written in a rare poetic moment and the trams themselves were lit with bulbs so you could see their outlines coming from miles away after only token resistance the girls agreed to a walk on the beach and the four of them inevitably settled under the south pier a wellestablished courting spot banks remembered as he read his vague and brief descriptions how he lay with sharon and kissed her gently at first then the two of them working their lips harder trying a little tongue feeling her body stir under him he let his imagination go to work on the scanty details he had recorded in his bed back at mrs barracloughs that night g and me went with tina and sharon somehow he had worked his hand under her blouse and felt her firm little breast she didnt complain when after a while of that he wriggled under her bra and felt the warm soft flesh itself squeezing the nipple between his thumb and forefinger she took a sharp breath and went back to kissing him with her tongue he got some of her hair in his mouth he could smell bubble gum on her breath mingled with the seaweed and brine of the beach trams rolled by above them and waves crashed on the shore sometime later getting brave he slid his hand down her thigh and put it up inside her skirt she would only let him touch her over the cloth of her knickers freezing or firmly pulling his hand away when he tried to go farther but that was the farthest he had ever been before so it was all right with him graham said later that tina let him go all the way with her but banks didnt believe him and that was as sensational as it got they went out with sharon and tina twice more once to the pictures to see help and once to the amusement arcades graham as usual supplying most of the cash and their evenings ended the same way no matter how much banks tried and hinted sharon wouldnt relinquish her treasure she always stopped him at the threshold it was a tease balanced only later with the delicious ritual of selfadministered relief when it was time to leave they exchanged names and addresses and said theyd write but banks never heard from sharon again as far as he knew graham hadnt heard from tina either before he disappeared now looking back banks hoped she really had let him go all the way with her remembering their holiday had made him also remember other things and some of them started to ring alarm bells in his policemans mind quiet at first then getting louder and louder but soon it wasnt an inner alarm bell it was the telephone that was ringing banks picked it up dci banks a womans voice familiar strained yes its di hart michelle i havent forgotten your name yet banks said what can i do for you any news are you busy just after you left me in starbucks a missing persons case turned into a murder so yes i am look im sorry about that i mean this is so difficult just tell me michelle paused for so long that banks was beginning to think she would just hang up she seemed to be good at putting an abrupt end to conversations but she didnt after an eternity she said today i discovered that ben shaws notebooks and the graham marshall actions allocations are missing missing i looked all over the files i couldnt find them i got the records clerk to help too but even she couldnt find them theres a gap in the notebooks from the fifteenth of august to the sixth of october banks whistled between his teeth and the actions just for that case gone i dont know i mean ive never theres something else too something that happened over the weekend but i dont want to talk about it over the phone she gave a nervous laugh i suppose im asking you for advice i dont know what to do you should tell someone im telling you i mean someone in your station thats the problem she said i just dont know who i can trust down here thats why i thought of you i know you have a personal interest in the case and it would be helpful for me to have another professional around one i know i can trust banks thought it over for a moment michelle was right he did have an interest in the case and the way it sounded she was out on a limb by herself down there im not sure what i can do to help he said but ill see if i can get away as he spoke the words an image of himself charging down to peterborough on a white steed wearing armor and carrying a lance mocked him any news on the funeral service day after tomorrow ill get away as soon as i can he said maybe tomorrow in the meantime dont say or do anything just carry on as normal okay okay and alan yes thanks i mean it im in a jam she paused then added and im scared ill be there after banks hung up he refilled his glass put the second bill evans set on and settled down to think over the repercussions of what he had realized earlier that evening reading his diary and of what he had just heard from michelle chapter lauren anderson lived in a small semi not too far from where banks used to live with sandra before their separation he hadnt passed the end of his old street in a long time and it brought back memories he would rather forget he felt cheated somehow the memories should have been good he and sandra had had good times together had been in love for many years but everything seemed tainted by her betrayal and now by her forthcoming marriage to sean and the baby of course the baby hurt a lot he spoke nothing of his thoughts to annie who sat beside him she didnt even know he used to live there as he had only met her after he moved to the gratly cottage besides she had made it clear that she wasnt interested in his old life with sandra and the kids that was one of the main things that had come between them and broken up their brief and edgy romance it was as fine a summers day as they had seen in a while they were in bankss car this time the way he preferred it with the windows open listening to marianne faithfull singing summer nights on a greatest hits cd that was back when her voice was rich and smooth before the booze drugs and cigarettes had taken their toll the same way it happened with billie holiday it was also a hit around the time graham disappeared and captured the mood of that sexpreoccupied adolescent summer i cant believe you still listen to this stuff said annie why not i dont know its just so old so is beethoven clever clogs you know what i mean i used to fancy her like crazy annie shot him a sidelong glance marianne faithfull yes why not she used to come on ready steady go and top of the pops every time she had a new record out and shed sit on a high stool with her guitar looking just like a schoolgirl but shed be wearing a lowcut dress legs crossed and that sweet voice would come out and youd just want to go on banks stopped at a traffic light and smiled at annie im sure you get the picture he said she just looked so innocent so virginal but if the stories are true she put herself about quite a bit didnt she far from virginal id say maybe that was part of it too banks agreed you just knew she did it there were stories gene pitney mick jagger the parties and all that saint and sinner all in one package said annie how perfect for you christ annie i was only a kid quite a randy one too it seems well what did you think about at fourteen i dont know boys maybe but not in a sexual way having fun romance clothes makeup maybe thats why i always fancied older women said banks annie nudged him hard in the ribs ouch what did you do that for you know park here men she said as banks parked and they got out of the car when youre young you want older women and when youre old you want younger women these days said banks i take whatever i can get charming annie pressed the doorbell and a few seconds later saw the shape coming toward them through the frosted glass lauren anderson was dressed in jeans and a thin vneck sweater and she wore no makeup younger than banks had expected she was willowy with full lips a pale oval face and heavylidded paleblue eyes all framed by long auburn hair spilling down over her shoulders as she stood in the doorway she wrapped her arms around herself as if she were cold police banks said holding out his warrant card may we come in of course lauren stood aside in here banks asked pointing toward what looked like the living room if you like ill make some tea shall i lovely said annie following her into the kitchen banks could hear them talking as he had a quick look around the living room he was impressed by the two walls of bookshelves groaning under the weight of classics he had meant to read but never got around to all the victorians along with the major russians and french a few recent novels ian mcewan graham swift as byatt quite a lot of poetry too from heaneys beowulf translation to the latest issue of poetry review lying on the low coffee table there were plays too tennessee williams edward albee tom stoppard the elizabethans and jacobeans there was also a section devoted to art and one to classical mythology not to mention the rows of literary criticism from aristotles poetics to david lodge on the vagaries of poststructuralism most of the music in the cd rack was classical favoring bach mozart and handel banks found a comfortable chair and sat down in a short while annie and lauren came in with the tea noting an ashtray on the table and getting a distinct whiff of stale smoke in the air banks asked if he might light up lauren said sure and accepted one of his silk cut annie turned up her nose the way only an exsmoker can do its a nice place banks said thank you do you live here alone i do now i used to share it with one of the other teachers but she got her own flat a few months ago im not sure but i think i like it better by myself i dont blame you said banks look the reason were here is that we heard you used to give luke armitage extra tutoring in english and we wondered if you could tell us anything about him im not sure i can tell you anything about him but yes i used to tutor luke lauren sat on the small sofa with her legs tucked under her cup held in both hands she blew on the tea he was so far ahead of the rest of his class he must have been bored silly at school he was far ahead of me most of the time she raised her hand and flicked some troublesome locks of hair out of her face that good well his enthusiasm made up for what he lacked in formal training i gather he was a talented writer too very again he needed discipline but he was young raw hed have gone far if if she held her cup in one hand and rubbed her sleeve across her eyes im sorry she said i just cant get over it luke dead such a waste annie passed her a tissue from the box on one of the bookshelves thank you she said then blew her nose she shifted on the sofa and banks noticed her feet were bare and her toenails painted red i know its hard to accept said banks but im sure you can understand why we need to know as much about him as possible yes of course though as i said i dont see how i can tell you much alastair ford said youre the kind who listens to peoples problems she snorted alastair he was probably trying to say im a prying bitch alastair runs a mile if anyone comes within vague hailing distance of whatever warped emotions he might possess banks had got the same impression himself though he wouldnt have put it in quite those words on early impressions lauren anderson was turning out to be perhaps the most normal friend luke had had but the competition ford and wells wasnt very stiff did luke ever talk about himself not much said lauren he could be very closed could luke sometimes sometimes he might let his guard drop a little yes and what did he talk about then oh the usual school his parents what did he say about them he hated school not only were most things boring for him but he didnt like the discipline the formality banks thought of the boys who had tormented luke in the market square what about bullying yes that too but it wasnt serious i mean luke was never beaten up or anything what was it then mostly teasing namecalling a bit of jostling oh im not saying he wasnt hurt by it he was very sensitive but he could handle it in a way what do you mean it didnt really bother him i mean he knew the boys who were doing it were morons that they couldnt help themselves and he knew they were doing it because he was different superior no i dont think luke ever believed himself to be superior to anyone else he just knew he was different what did he have to say about his parents lauren paused for a moment before answering it was very private she said annie leaned forward ms anderson she said lukes dead yes yes i know and we need to know everything but you surely cant think his parents had anything to do with his death what did he say about them lauren paused then went on not much it was clear he wasnt very happy at home he said he loved his mother but he gave the impression that he didnt get along with his stepfather banks could well imagine it martin armitage was a physical dominating presence used to getting his own way and his interests seemed worlds away from those of his stepson did you get the impression that his stepfather abused him in any way he asked good lord no said lauren nobody ever beat him or abused him in any way it was just they were so different theyd nothing in common i mean luke couldnt care less about football for a start what was he going to do about his problems nothing what could he do he was only fifteen maybe hed have left home in a year or so but well never know now will we for the time being he had to put up with it kids put up with a lot worse said banks indeed they do the family was welloff and luke never lacked for material comforts im sure that both his mother and his stepfather loved him very much he was a sensitive creative boy with a boorish stepfather and an emptyheaded mother banks wouldnt have said robin armitage was emptyheaded but perhaps lauren was making the sort of assumption people often make about models what about neil byrd banks went on did luke ever talk about him hardly ever he got very emotional when the subject came up angry even luke had a lot of unresolved issues you just knew to back away can you explain laurens brow furrowed i think he was angry because he never knew his father angry because neil byrd abandoned him when he was just a baby and then went and committed suicide can you imagine how that would make you feel you dont even mean enough to your father for him to stay alive and watch you grow up was there anything in particular that might have been bothering him recently anything he might have mentioned to you no the last time i saw him at the end of term he was excited about the summer holidays i assigned him some reading a portrait of the artist as a young man and crime and punishment her eyes widened those were two of the books how do you know that it doesnt matter said banks how did you go about tutoring him usually id assign him some reading maybe a novel or some poetry and then wed meet here and discuss it often wed move out from there and discuss painting history greek and roman mythology he was very advanced when it came to understanding literature and he had an insatiable appetite for it advanced enough for rimbaud baudelaire verlaine rimbaud was a mere boy himself and young teens are often attracted to baudelaire le poëte se fait voyant par un long immense et raisonné dérèglement de tous les sens banks quoted in an accent he hoped wasnt too incomprehensible does that mean anything to you why of course its rimbauds description of the method he used to make himself a seer a total disordering of all the senses it was written on lukes bedroom wall did it involve taking drugs not that i know of not in lukes case anyway it was about opening oneself to experience of all kinds to be quite honest i didnt approve of lukes fascination with rimbaud in so many cases like that its a fascination with the romantic ideal of the tortured boypoet not with the work itself not wanting to get lost in the realms of literary criticism banks moved on you felt very close to luke am i right in a way i suppose if you really could be close to him he was slippery chameleonlike often moody quiet and withdrawn but i liked him and i believed in his talent if thats what you mean if luke had come to you for help would you have given it that depends on the circumstances if he was running away from home for example id do all i could to discourage him that sounds like the official line its the one id follow you wouldnt harbor him of course not because we dont know where he went the day he disappeared not after about fivethirty anyway but he was last seen walking north on market street that would eventually have brought him to your neighborhood wouldnt it yes but i mean why would he come here maybe he trusted you needed your help with something i cant imagine what when were the two of you next due to meet not until next term im going home next week for the rest of the holidays my fathers not been well lately and my mothers finding it hard to cope im sorry to hear that wheres home south wales tenby a sleepy little place but its by the sea lots of cliffs to walk on and think are you sure luke never came to see you the monday before last of course im sure he had no reason to you were only his tutor right lauren stood up and anger flashed in her eyes what do you mean what are you trying to insinuate banks held his hand up whoa wait a minute i was only thinking that he might have considered you as a friend and mentor someone he could go to if he was in trouble well he didnt look as it happens i wasnt even home the monday before last where were you visiting my brother vernon and where does vernon live harrogate what time did you leave about five shortly after and what time did you get back i didnt as a matter of fact i had a bit too much to drink too much to risk driving at any rate so i slept on vernons sofa i didnt come back here until about lunchtime on tuesday banks glanced at annie who put her notebook aside and pulled the artists impression out of her briefcase have you ever seen this girl ms anderson she asked think carefully lauren studied the drawing and shook her head no ive seen the look but the face isnt familiar not someone from school if she is i dont recognize her we think she might have been lukes girlfriend banks said and were trying to find her lauren shot banks a glance girlfriend but luke didnt have a girlfriend how do you know you said he didnt tell you everything she fingered the collar of her vneck but but id have known i cant see how said banks what about rose barlow what about her ive heard she and luke were pretty friendly who told you that were they i believe they went out once or twice earlier this year rose barlow isnt anywhere near lukes league shes strictly a plodder so it didnt last not to my knowledge though as you pointed out i wouldnt necessarily be the one to know banks and annie stood up to leave lauren walked to the door with them thanks for your time banks said and if you do remember anything else youll let us know wont you yes of course anything i can do lauren said i do hope you catch whoever did this luke had such a promising future ahead of him dont worry said banks with more confidence than he felt we will ever since she had rung banks michelle had thought of confronting shaw with what she had discovered it would have been easy enough for any authorized person to remove the notebooks and actions from their file boxes michelle could have done it herself so who would think to question an officer of shaws rank certainly not mrs metcalfe but still she resisted the direct approach the thing was she had to be certain once something like that was out in the open there was no taking it back she had been down in the archives again first thing that morning on another fruitless search which had at least convinced her that the objects she was looking for were missing and they should have been there what she needed to do now was think think about what it all meant she couldnt do that in the station with shaw wandering around the place so she decided to drive over to the hazels estate and walk grahams route again she parked in front of the row of shops opposite the estate and stood for a moment enjoying the feel of the sun on her hair she looked at the newsagents shop now run by mrs walker that was where it had all begun on a whim michelle entered the shop and found the sturdy grayhaired old lady arranging newspapers on the counter yes love the woman said with a smile what can i do for you are you mrs walker indeed i am i dont know if you can do anything said michelle presenting her warrant card but you might have heard we found some bones not long ago and the lad who used to work here yes thats right i read about it terrible business it is but i dont see how i can help you it was before my time when did you come here my husband and i bought the shop in the autumn of did you buy it from mr bradford the previous owner as far as i know we did the estate agent handled all the details along with my husband of course bless his soul mr walker is deceased a good ten years now im sorry no need to be he went just like that never felt a thing brain aneurysm we had a good life together and im well provided for she looked around the shop i cant say its exactly a gold mine but its a living hard work too people say i should retire sell up but what would i do with my time did you know graham marshall at all no we moved here from spalding so we didnt know anyone at first wed been looking for a nice little newsagents shop and this one came on the market at the right price good timing too what with the new town development starting in shortly after we got here but you did meet mr bradford oh yes he was very helpful during the transition showed us the ropes and everything what was he like i cant say i knew him well my husband had most dealings with him but he seemed all right pleasant enough a bit abrupt maybe a bit stiff and military in his bearing i remember he was something important during the war a member of some special unit or other in burma but he was helpful did you hear from him after you took over no did he ever mention graham oh yes thats why he left partly at any rate he said his heart hadnt been in the business since the boy disappeared so he wanted to move away and try to forget do you know where he moved to the north or so he said carlisle thats certainly far enough away yes i dont suppose you had a forwarding address did you didnt you know mr bradford died killed in a burglary not weeks after he moved tragic it was in all the local papers at the time indeed said michelle curious no i didnt know it probably wasnt relevant to her inquiry but it was suspicious one of the last people to see graham alive had himself been killed michelle thanked mrs walker and went back outside she crossed the road and started walking along hazel crescent the same route graham would have taken all those years ago it was an early morning in august she remembered the sun was just up but an overcast sky made it still fairly dark everybody was sleeping off saturday night and the churchgoers were not even up yet lights would have been on in one or two windows perhaps the insomniacs and chronic early risers but nobody had seen anything she reached wilmer road at the far end of the estate even now years later and in midmorning there wasnt much traffic and most of it was for the diy center which hadnt existed back in michelle was almost certain that graham knew his attacker and that he got in the car willingly taking his canvas bag of papers with him if someone had tried to force him into a car he would have dropped the papers and struggled and the abductor was unlikely to stick around and pick them up but how could graham be persuaded to go somewhere without finishing his paper round a family emergency perhaps michelle didnt think so his family only lived a few yards away back on the estate he could have walked there in less than a minute there was no doubt that fourteenyearold kids could act irresponsibly so maybe he did just that and skived off somewhere for some reason as michelle stood in the street watching the people come and go from the diy center she thought again about the missing notebooks and actions and was struck by a notion so obvious she could have kicked herself for not seeing it earlier that the missing notebooks were detective superintendent shaws disturbed her for a different reason now she realized what she should have seen the moment she discovered they were missing shaw was a mere dc a junior on the case so what on earth could he have had to hide he had no power he wasnt in charge and he certainly hadnt assigned the actions he had simply been along taking notes of detective inspector reg proctors interviews that was all michelle had focused on shaw mostly because she disliked him and resented the way he had been treating her but when it came right down to it the person in charge of the case the one who might possibly have had the most to hide in the event of a future investigation was not shaw but that legend of the local constabulary detective superintendent john harris thinking about jet harris and what he might possibly have had to hide michelle walked back to where she had left her car parked in front of the shops perhaps she was a little distracted by her thoughts and perhaps she didnt pay as much attention as she usually did to crossing the road but on the other hand perhaps the beige van with the tinted windows really did start up as she approached and perhaps the driver really did put his foot on the accelerator when she stepped into the road either way she saw it coming fast and just had time to jump out of the way the side of the van brushed against her hip as she stumbled and fell face forward onto the warm tarmac putting out her arms to break her fall another car honked and swerved around her and a woman across the street came over to help her to her feet by the time michelle realized what was happening the van was out of sight one thing she did remember though the number plate was so covered in mud it was impossible to read honestly the woman said helping michelle to the other side some drivers i dont know what the place is coming to i really dont are you all right love yes said michelle dusting herself off yes im fine thanks very much just a bit shaken up and she was still trembling when she got in her own car she gripped the steering wheel tightly to steady herself took several deep breaths and waited until her heart rate slowed to normal before she set off back to the station can you manage by yourself for a day or so banks asked annie over a lunchtime pint in the queens arms like most of the pubs in the area since the outbreak of footandmouth it was halfempty and even the jukebox and video machines were mercifully silent one of the local farmers who had already had too much to drink stood at the bar fulminating against the governments mishandling of the outbreak to the bar owner cyril who gave a polite grunt of agreement every now and then everybody was suffering not only the farmers but the pub owners bed and breakfast owners local tradesmen the butcher baker and candlestick maker uncle tom cobbleigh and all and unlike the farmers they didnt get any compensation from the government only a week or so ago the owner of a walkinggear shop in helmthorpe had committed suicide because his business had gone down the tubes annie put her glass down course i can she said whats up its graham marshalls funeral tomorrow therell likely be some old friends around id like to go down this evening no problem have you asked the boss detective superintendent gristhorpe has given me permission to be absent from school for two days i just wanted to clear it with you before taking off ive got plenty to keep me occupied talking about school you told me you werent satisfied with your alastair ford interview yesterday banks lit a cigarette no he said no im not not at all so is he a suspect i dont know maybe his coming hot on the heels of norman wells was just a bit too much for me his house is very isolated which makes it a good place to keep someone prisoner or kill someone and dump the body in the middle of the night without any neighbors noticing but then you could probably get away with murder in the town center too given most peoples powers of observation and unwillingness to get involved except for the cctv and a damn lot of good thats done us anyway ford is a solitary he jealously protects his privacy probably feels superior to people who are content to make small talk and share their opinions he may be homosexual there was something distinctly odd about the way he responded to my question about boyfriends but even that doesnt make him a suspect we dont know the motive for lukes murder and according to dr glendenning there was no evidence of sexual assault although a few days in the water might have taken care of any traces of that you know annie the more i think about it the more the kidnapping seems as if it was just a smoke screen but oddly enough it might turn out to be the most important thing annie frowned what do you mean i mean why if somebody just wanted luke dead whatever the reason then why come up with this elaborate and iffy kidnapping scheme and increase the risk of getting caught money well yes but you told me yourself whoever it was set his sights remarkably low it wasnt a professional job that did bother me its what made me think he knew about the armitages finances i mean they could certainly manage ten grand to get luke back but hardly more at least not at such short notice but luke was already dead yes perhaps he tried to escape perhaps or maybe we need to look a lot closer to home the parents its possible isnt it banks said maybe weve been looking at this all wrong maybe martin armitage killed luke and set up the elaborate hoax of a kidnapping just to put us off the scent martin why not he was gone for two hours the evening luke disappeared according to his statement just driving around or so he says maybe he found luke and they had an argument and luke ended up dead an accident even excessive roughness that wouldnt be unusual for martin armitage according to lauren anderson and everything youve told me luke had a difficult relationship with his stepfather armitage is the antithesis of neil byrd in many ways byrd was sensitive creative artistic and he also had many of the problems that seem to come with that territory drugs drink an addictive personality need for oblivion experimentation selfabsorption mood swings depression it cant have been easy being neil byrd as his songs tell us so many times but he was aiming at some kind of exalted spiritual state some sort of transcendence and he believed he caught glimpses of it from time to time they gave him enough faith to keep going for a while at least i often thought some of the songs were also a cry for help and lukes songs echo that in a weird way and martin armitage physical rational powerful cleanliving football was his life it got him out of the slums and made him a national figure it also made him rich i dare say hes had his share of ale but i doubt he tried anything more experimental i dont think he has the capability to understand or tolerate the artistic temperament his stepson seems to have inherited probably the kind who associates artistic interests with homosexuality im sure he tried to be a loving father treated the lad as his own but luke had neil byrds genes and robin now theres an interesting one banks said you tell me youve seen more of her than i have she clearly had a wild youth sex drugs rock and roll early fame and fortune often seem to send people over the top but however she did it she came through and with a son id say shes tougher than she looks and no doubt she loved luke but had no more idea how to deal with his problems than her husband had i think boys like luke invent secret worlds to exclude adults and protect themselves even from their contemporaries he probably spent most of his time in his room reading writing or recording his songs that black room do you think he had ambitions to follow in his fathers footsteps musically perhaps but i think his attitude toward his father was very complex and ambiguous a mix of admiration and anger at abandonment none of this seems to transform into a motive though does it said banks he stubbed out his cigarette what about josie and calvin batty as suspects in general josie is the only person weve talked to so far who says she saw luke with the tattooed girl norman wells recognized the description yes annie pointed out but not in connection with luke im not saying we stop looking for her just that we dont pin all our hopes on her we still have to keep an open mind on this one agreed by the way winsome ran a check on all cars reported stolen in the eastvale area the night luke disappeared there are two possibilities one abandoned near hawes in wensleydale and the other in richmond then wed better have stefans team check them both for any signs of blood annie made a note okay the server brought their lunches over a salad sandwich for annie and lasagne and chips for banks he didnt usually like pub lasagne it was too soupy but cyrils wife glenys made a good one talking about cars banks said after pausing for a few mouthfuls how are forensics coming on with norman wellss stefan called in a couple of hours ago nothing yet do you really expect anything maybe not but its got to be done do you think we should have detained him banks took a sip of beer before answering weve nothing to hold him on he said and he does have his business to run besides i dont think mr wells is going anywhere what about lauren anderson methinks the lady did protest too much what do you mean i dont know just that her reaction to a simple question seemed extreme she did sound awfully close to luke emotionally i mean but she does have an alibi ask winsome to check with the brother vernon just to be certain but i cant imagine shed risk lying about that and it was a mans voice on the ransom call im not suggesting she did it she certainly seemed genuine in her regard for him just that she might know more than shes letting on about what luke was up to youre right said banks we shouldnt rule her out maybe you could get winsome and young kevin to run background checks on everyone we know who was connected with luke and that includes the battys alastair ford lauren anderson and the mystery girl if we ever find her what about rose barlow i dont know banks said we should have a word with her though it seems that whatever went on between her and luke ended months ago what about forensic checks on fords house and the anderson womans banks shook his head we cant afford to be sending expensive forensic teams to everyones house with wells we had good reason his history for a start besides we know luke has been in lauren andersons house but if theres blood we still cant justify the expense at this point and alastair ford check into his background first well keep that one up our sleeves in case we need it youll stay in touch ill leave my mobile on all the time im not deserting you annie banks still couldnt help feeling a little guilty and it wasnt because he was leaving the case to annie but because he would be seeing michelle again and the idea appealed to him annie touched his sleeve i know youre not dont think im so insensitive as not to know how hard it is for you them finding graham marshalls bones and all she grinned you go and pay your respects and have a pissup with your old mates youll have a lot to catch up on when did you last see them not since i went to london when i was eighteen we just sort of lost touch i know what you mean it happens i dont know anyone i went to school with anymore banks considered telling annie about michelles phone call but decided against it why complicate matters annie had enough on her plate besides he wasnt sure there was much he could do about michelles concerns if there had been some sort of coverup then it would have to be investigated by an outside force not some maverick from north yorkshire yet a part of him wanted to get involved wanted to get to the bottom of grahams death as well as lukes they were linked in his mind in some odd way not technically of course but two very different boys from very different times had ended up dead before their time and both had died violently banks wanted to know why what it was about these two children that had attracted such cruel fates chapter early in the afternoon annie showed the artists impression of the mystery girl around the swainsdale centre and the bus station again at the end of an hour she was beginning to wonder whether the girl existed or whether she was just a figment of josie battys puritan imagination she walked along york road enjoying the sunshine glancing in the shop windows as she walked a stylish red leather jacket caught her eye in one of the more exclusive clothes shops but she knew it would be way out of her price range even so she went in and inquired it was the market square was clogged with wandering tourists and cars trying to find a parking space a large group of japanese along with their tour guide and translator stood gazing up at the front of the norman church where several sculpted figures of saints were carved in a row high over the doors some of the tourists were catching the moment on videotape though annie didnt remember the stone saints ever doing the cancan or anything that even remotely involved movement one of the cars she noticed partly because it screeched straight into a handicapped parking space and almost hit a young woman was martin armitages bmw what the hell was he doing here and what the hell was he doing in a handicapped parking spot maybe she should arrange for him to get towed but when she saw him jump out of the car slam the door and head for the shops built into the side of the church she knew what was going on annie pushed her way through the tourist crowd by the church and got there just in time to see armitage disappearing down the stairs into normans used books shit she dashed down right behind him but he already had wells by the throat and judging by the blood pouring from the little mans nose had punched him at least once wells was whimpering and trying to wriggle free the bookshop was as dank as ever but the days heat had permeated enough to make the air humid annie felt clammy the moment she entered familiar the cat was screeching and hissing somewhere in the dark recesses of the cavern mr armitage annie called out as she grabbed his arm martin stop it this wont get you anywhere armitage shook her off as if she were a troublesome insect this pervert killed my son he said if you lot cant do it ill get a bloody confession even if i have to shake it out of him as if to prove his point he started to shake wells again and slap him back and forth across the face blood and saliva dribbled from wellss slack jaw annie tried to wedge herself between them knocking over a teetering pile of books as she did so a cloud of dust rose up and the cat screeched even louder armitage was strong he pushed annie and she staggered back into a table it broke and more books slid to the floor she almost joined them there gathering all her strength annie made one more attempt launching herself toward the struggling men in the cramped space but armitage saw her coming and swung his fist beyond wellss head connecting directly with annies mouth the blow stunned her and she fell back again in pain this time and put her hand to her mouth it came away covered in blood armitage was still shaking wells and annie feared the bookseller was going to choke to death if he didnt have a heart attack first armitage was paying her no mind now and she managed to edge behind him to the door and dash up the steps the police station was only yards away across market street and nobody asked her any questions when she rushed in the front door blood streaming from her mouth two burly pcs followed her back to the shop and it took both of them to subdue armitage wrecking most of the place in the process there were old books all over the floor broken tables and clouds of dust in the air by the time they got the handcuffs on him and marched him outside up the stairs wells was bleeding clutching his chest and looking distinctly unwell annie got his arm around her shoulder and helped him stumble up into the fresh air hearing the fracas the japanese tourists turned away from the church facade and pointed their camcorders at the five of them well annie thought digging for a handkerchief deep in her purse at least were bloody moving it had been a while since banks had spent much time in his office and the dalesman calendar was still open at julys photo of skidby windmill on the edge of the yorkshire wolds he had the radio tuned in to radio three and was listening to an orchestral concert of music by holst haydn and vaughan williams as he whittled away at the pile of paperwork on his desk he had just settled into the lento moderato of vaughan williamss pastoral symphony and yet another memo on cost effectiveness when his phone rang alan its stefan good news i hope depends on how you look at it your man norman wells is clean as far as we can tell we were pretty thorough and im sure if thered been any traces of luke armitage in his car or house wed have found something you didnt nada okay well i suppose that shows us where not to concentrate our attention anything positive the blood on the drystone wall i remember there was enough for dna analysis its definitely human and it doesnt match the victims banks whistled so theres a good chance it could belong to whoever dropped luke over the wall a pretty good chance yes but dont get your hopes up too high it could belong to anyone but youll be able to match it with any samples we can get of course okay thanks stefan my pleasure banks wondered whom he should ask to provide dna samples norman wells of course even though the forensic search of his house had turned up nothing incriminating alastair ford perhaps just because he lived in a remote cottage and was connected to luke through the violin lessons and because he was weird lauren anderson because she gave luke english tutoring after school hours and seemed to be close to him who else josie and calvin batty perhaps and the parents martin and robin theyd no doubt kick up a holy fuss and run crying to the chief constable but that couldnt be helped dna could be processed in two or three days now but it was a very expensive proposition banks would just have to see how much he could get away with then there was the mystery girl of course they would definitely need a sample from her if they ever found her if she existed no sooner had the moderato pesante begun than his phone rang again this time it was the duty constable someone to see him in connection with luke armitage a young woman send her up said banks wondering if this could be the mystery woman she must know that she was wanted by now and if she did then her failure to show up was suspicious in itself a minute or so later a uniformed constable tapped on bankss office door and ushered in the girl banks recognized rose barlow immediately she strutted into his office all bluejeaned leg blond hair and attitude her visit would save him or annie the trouble of seeking her out im rose she said rose barlow you dont remember me do you i know who you are said banks what can i do for you rose carried on snooping around the office taking books off the shelf and riffling through the pages putting them back adjusting the calendar so it was square with the filing cabinet she wore a short sleeveless top so that banks presumed the rose tattoo on her upper left arm and the collection of jewelry dangling from her navel showed to best advantage its more a matter of what i can do for you she said sitting down and giving him what he was sure she thought of as an enigmatic look it came across as vacant she must be a handful for her father he thought it seemed so often the case that the daughters of authority figures vicars head teachers chief constables were the first to rebel and he could only think himself lucky that tracy a mere chief inspectors daughter seemed to have a good head on her shoulders she must have got it from her mother banks thought then veered away from thoughts of sandra showing now no doubt glowing with the joys of coming motherhood well good luck to her and sean theyd need it and what can you do for me banks asked deciding to let her get to her reason for coming before asking questions of his own she turned her nose up at the radio whats that vaughan williams its boring sorry you dont like it what can you do for me do you know who killed luke i thought you could do something for me spoilsport why wont you tell me banks sighed rose miss barlow if wed found lukes killer youd have read about it in the papers by now now tell me what you came to say im busy rose didnt like that and banks realized that letting his impatience show was a mistake she probably got that sort of response from her father all the time the way tracy and brian had often heard the same thing from banks rose craved attention because she didnt feel she got enough banks wondered if his children felt the same way did tracy try so hard and do so well academically because she wanted attention did brian stand up on stage in front of an audience night after night and bare his soul because he craved it too and had luke armitage craved the same thing perhaps in his childrens cases though the response to the need was a pretty healthy creative one banks wasnt sure to what lengths rose barlow might go to get the attention she felt she deserved im sorry he went on but im sure you understand that were in a hurry to find out who killed luke and if you know anything that might help us rose leaned forward her eyes wide why do you think hes going to kill someone else do you think its a serial killer weve no reason to think anything of the sort then relax why dont you banks felt his back teeth grinding as he tried to smile anyway rose went on i was going to tell you have you talked to miss anderson yet lauren anderson yes a mischievous glint lit roses eyes and did she tell you about her and luke she told us she gave him extra instruction in english because he was ahead of the rest of the class rose laughed extra instruction thats a good one and did she tell you where she gave this instruction at her house rose leaned back and folded her arms exactly so oh come on surely you cant be that naive do i have to spell it out for you im not sure what youre getting at said banks who was perfectly sure but wanted her to get there by herself they were having it off werent they you know that for a fact stands to reason why shes nothing but a slut that miss anderson and a cradlesnatcher what makes you say that well she didnt give anybody else private instruction in her home did she i dont know said banks well she didnt tell me rose banks said wishing he could have a cigarette what did you think of luke you knew him didnt you we were in the same class yes did you like him rose twirled some strands of hair he was all right i suppose pretty cool huh cool more like sad if you ask me why he never talked to anybody except high and mighty miss anderson of course its like he was better than the rest of us maybe he was shy just because he had a famous father well i think his fathers music sucks and he cant have been much of a father if he went and killed himself could he he was nothing but a drug addict nice line in compassion rose banks thought but he didnt bother voicing his opinion so you didnt like luke i told you he was all right just a bit weird but he was pretty goodlooking wasnt he rose made a face ugh i wouldnt have gone out with him if he was the last boy on earth i dont think youre telling me the truth rose are you what do you mean you know very well what i mean you and luke earlier this year who told you that never you mind how far did it go go thats a laugh it didnt go anywhere but you wanted it to didnt you rose twisted in her chair he thought he was better than the rest of us so why did you spend time talking to him i dont know just i mean he was different the other boys they only want one thing and luke didnt i never got to find out did i we just talked what about music and stuff you never actually went out together no i mean we went to mcdonalds a couple of times after school but thats all rose do you have any evidence at all to support your accusation that luke and lauren anderson were having an affair if you mean was i watching at her window then no but its obvious isnt it why else would she spend her spare time with someone like him but you spent time with him yeah well that was different didnt you try to be nice to him to befriend him when you talked to him in the hallways and the playground and when you went to mcdonalds with him rose looked away and continued twirling her hair around her fingers of course i did and what happened nothing he just sort of like he got bored with me or something like i didnt read all those stupid books he was always carrying around and i didnt listen to the same lousy music i wasnt good enough for him he was a snob above the rest of us and because of this you assumed he was having sexual relations with a teacher thats a bit of a far stretch isnt it you didnt see them together did you see them kissing touching holding hands of course not they were too careful to do anything like that in public werent they what then the way they looked at each other the way she always left him alone in class the way they talked the way he made her laugh you were just jealous werent you rose thats why youre saying all this because you couldnt get along with luke but miss anderson could i was not jealous certainly not of that ugly old bitch for a moment banks wondered if there was anything in what rose barlow was telling him other than sour grapes it may have been innocent a true teacherpupil relationship but banks had enough experience to know that anything involving two people of the opposite sex or the same sex for that matter in close proximity could turn into something sexual no matter what the difference in their ages he had also read about such things in the newspapers he would keep an open mind and have another talk with lauren anderson when he got back from peterborough push her a little harder and see if any cracks showed what do you think of miss anderson he asked rose shes all right i suppose you just called her an ugly old bitch well i didnt mean i was angry i mean shes okay as a teacher all right do you get on well with her in class okay so if i ask any of the other pupils in the class theyd tell me that you and miss anderson get along just fine rose reddened she picks on me sometimes she put me in detention once what for not reading some stupid shakespeare play so i was reading a magazine under the desk so what i cant be bothered with all that boring english stuff so you had a few runins with her yes but thats not why im here thats not why im telling you what i know im sure its not rose but you have to admit it does give you a bit of a motive to cause trouble for miss anderson especially if you also tried to get luke to be your boyfriend rose jumped to her feet why are you being so horrible to me i come here to help you and give you important information and you treat me like a criminal im going to tell my father about you banks couldnt help smiling it wouldnt be the first time ive been reported to the head teacher he said before rose could respond two things happened in quick succession first there came an urgent tap at his door and annie cabbot walked in a handkerchief to her mouth covered with what looked like blood but before annie could speak kevin templeton poked his head around the door behind her his gaze resting on rose for a few seconds too long for her comfort and said to banks sorry to interrupt you sir but we think weve got a positive id on you know who banks knew who he meant the mystery girl so she did exist better than that templeton went on weve got an address michelle discovered from dc collins that shaw had gone home after lunch complaining of a stomach upset collinss tone was such as to suggest it might be more a matter of the number of whiskeys shaw had downed at lunch he had been taking quite a lot of time off lately at least that left the coast clear for michelle she didnt want to see shaw especially after what had happened in her flat on saturday sometimes when she let her guard down it was him she saw in her imagination going through her bedside drawers cutting melissas dress in half it wasnt such a stretch to imagine him driving the beige van that bore down on her as she crossed the road earlier either he had been out of the station at the time and the whiskeys dutch courage it was time to stop idle speculation and follow up on what she had discovered from mrs walker michelle picked up the telephone and an hour or so later after a lot of false trails and time wasted on hold she managed to reach one of the retired carlisle police officers who had looked into donald bradfords death exdetective sergeant raymond scholes now living out his retirement on the cumbrian coast i dont know what i can tell you after all this time scholes said donald bradford was just unlucky what happened surprised a burglar someone broke into his house and before bradford could do anything he got beaten so badly he died of his injuries michelle felt a chill the same thing might have happened to her on saturday if shed been home earlier ever catch the burglar she asked no he must have taken bradford by surprise though why do you say that because he was a pretty tough customer himself i wouldnt have fancied tackling him way it looks is the burglar must have heard him coming and hid behind the door then bashed the back of bradfords head in with a cosh of some kind you never found a weapon no no clues no prints nothing usable no witnesses none that we could find what was taken wallet a few knickknacks by the looks of it place was a bit of a mess did it appear as if someone had been looking for something i never really thought about that as i say though it was a mess turned upside down why the sudden interest michelle told him a little bit about graham marshall yes ive read about that terrible business i hadnt realized there was a connection was bradford married no he lived alone michelle could sense him pause as if he was going to add something what she asked oh its nothing bit of a laugh really tell me anyway well afterward you know we had to have a look around the house and we found well at the time it seemed quite risqué though by todays standards out with it man michelle found herself thinking what are you talking about what was it she asked pornographic magazines a bundle of them and some blue films i wont go into detail but they covered quite the range of perversions michelle found herself gripping the receiver tighter including pedophilia well there were some pretty younglooking models involved i can tell you that male and female not kiddieporn though if thats what youre thinking michelle supposed there was a distinction to be made in some ways once you had pubic hair breasts and all the rest you didnt qualify as kiddieporn but you still might only be fourteen years old gray area what happened to all this stuff destroyed but not before you and your lads had a good look at it ill bet michelle thought we didnt let anything slip at the time he went on because it didnt seem well the bloke had just been killed after all there seemed no point in blackening his name with that sort of thing understandable said michelle who claimed the body nobody mr bradford had no immediate family the local authorities took care of everything thank you mr scholes she said youve been a great help think nothing of it michelle hung up and nibbled the end of her pencil as she thought about what shed heard she hadnt come to any conclusions yet but she had a lot to discuss with banks when he arrived pc flaherty who had tracked down the mystery girls address had been asking around eastvale college thinking that a girl who looked like she did must be a student as it turned out she wasnt but her boyfriend was and one of the people he spoke to remembered seeing her at a college dance the boyfriends name was ryan milne and the girl was known as elizabeth palmer they lived together in a flat above a hat shop on south market street the direction in which luke armitage had been walking when he was last seen annie insisted that she felt well enough to make the call she was damned she told banks if she was going to be excluded after all the footwork shed done just because some overtestosteroned lout had punched her in the mouth it was her pride that hurt more than anything after shed cleaned up the wound it didnt look too bad anyway some women she went on to say paid a fortune for collagen shots to make themselves look like she did banks decided he would make the call with her before setting off for peterborough he phoned and arranged to meet michelle in a city center pub at nine oclock just to be on the safe side martin armitage was cooling off in the custody suite and norman wells was in eastvale general infirmary no doubt there would be recriminations from armitages pal the chief constable but for the moment he could stay where he was they could also charge him with assaulting a police officer after they had visited the mystery girl within twenty minutes of getting the address banks and annie climbed the linocovered stairs and knocked on the door the building seemed so silent that banks couldnt imagine anyone being at home but only seconds later a young woman opened the door the young woman dci banks and di cabbot banks said flashing his card wed like a word youd better come in then she stood aside one reason why it had taken so long to locate her was obvious to banks she didnt look anywhere near as weird as the description josie batty had drawn of her which was hardly surprising when you imagined that most young people probably looked weird to josie batty the pixyish facial features were right enough the heartshaped face large eyes and small mouth but that was about all she was far prettier than josie batty had indicated to the police artist and she had a pale flawless complexion she also had the sort of breasts adolescent boys and many grown men dream about and her smooth cleavage was shown to advantage by the lacedup leather waistcoat she wore the small tattoo on her upper arm was a simple double helix and there was no sign of bodypiercing anywhere except the silver spiderweb earrings dangling from her ears her short black hair was dyed and gelled but there was nothing weird about that the flat was clean and tidy not a filthy crack house full of sprawled drugaddled kids it was an old room with a fireplace complete with poker and tongs which must only have been for show as a gas fire filled the hearth sunlight shone through the halfopen window and the sounds and smells of south market street drifted up car exhaust and horns warm tar freshbaked bread takeaway curry and pigeons on the rooftops banks and annie walked around the small room checking it out while the girl arranged beanbag cushions for them elizabeth is it asked banks i prefer liz okay ryan not here hes got classes when will he be back not till after teatime what do you do liz im a musician make a living at it you know what its like banks did having a son in the business but brians success was unusual and even that hadnt brought in heaps of money not even enough for a new car he moved on you know why were here dont you liz nodded about luke you could have come forward and saved us a lot of trouble liz sat down but i dont know anything let us be the judge of that said banks pausing in his examination of her cd collection he had noticed a cassette labeled songs from a black room mixed in with a lot of other tapes how was i to know you were looking for me dont you read the papers or watch television annie asked not much theyre boring lifes too short mostly i practice listen to music or read what instrument banks asked keyboards some woodwinds flute clarinet did you study music professionally no just lessons at school how old are you liz twentyone and ryan the same hes in his last year at college he a musician too yes do you live together yes annie sat down on one of the beanbags but banks went to stand by the window leaning the backs of his thighs against the sill the room was small and hot and seemed too crowded with three people in it what was your relationship with luke armitage annie asked hes he was in our band along with me and ryan we dont have a drummer yet how long have you been together she chewed on her lip and thought for a moment weve only been practicing together since earlier this year after we met luke but ryan and me had been talking about doing something like this for ages how did you meet luke at a concert at the college what concert just a couple of local bands back in march how did luke get into a college concert banks asked he was only fifteen liz smiled not to look at or to talk to luke was far more mature than his years you didnt know him who was he with no one he was by himself checking out the band and you just started talking to him ryan did first and then well we found out he was interested in music too looking to get a band together he had some songs banks pointed toward the tape those songs from a black room no those are more recent how recent past month or so did you know he was only fifteen we didnt find out until later how he told us he told you just like that no not just like that he had to explain why he couldnt just do what he wanted you know he was living with his parents and going to school he said he was sixteen at first but then told us later hed lied because he was worried wed think he was too young to be in the band and did you no way not someone with his talent we might have had a few problems down the line if things had got that far playing licensed premises you know stuff like that but we figured wed just deal with all that when we got there what about who his real father was did you know that liz looked away he didnt tell us that until later either he didnt seem to want anything to do with neil byrd and his legacy how did you find out banks asked i mean did luke just come right out and tell you who his father was no no he didnt like to talk about him it was something on the radio while he was over here a review of that new compilation he got upset about it and then it just sort of slipped out it made a lot of sense what do you mean annie asked that voice his talent there was something about it all that rang a bell what happened after you knew what do you mean did it make a difference not really oh come on liz said banks you had neil byrds son in your band you cant expect us to believe that you werent aware that would make a big difference commercially okay said liz sure we were all aware of that but the point is that we werent anywhere commercially at that time were still not we havent even played in public yet for crying out loud and now without luke i dont know banks moved away from the window and sat on a hardbacked chair against the wall annie shifted on her beanbag as if trying to get comfortable it was the first time hed seen her look ill at ease in any sort of seat then he realized she might have hurt herself falling over in the bookshop she should be at the hospital getting checked out especially the way onthejob injury insurance worked these days but there was no telling her he didnt blame her hed be doing the same himself who did the singing banks asked mostly me and luke what kind of music do you play what does it matter lets just say im interested humor me its hard to describe liz answered try she looked at him as if trying to size up his musical knowledge well its all about the songs really were not trendy and we dont go in for long solos and stuff its more have you heard of david gray yes beth orton yes if liz was surprised by bankss familiarity with contemporary music she didnt show it well were not like them but thats sort of what were interested in having something to say and maybe a bit jazzy and bluesy i play quite a bit of flute as well as organ did you know that luke was taking violin lessons yes that would have been wonderful we were looking to expand bring in more musicians but we were being very careful about it she looked banks in the eye we were serious about making a real go of this you know she said but without selling out or being commercial were absolutely gutted by whats happened not just as a band i mean but personally too i understand and i appreciate that said banks did you have any other sort of relationship with luke other than musical what do you mean did you sleep with him with luke why not he was a goodlooking kid but thats all he was a kid you said he was wise beyond his years i know that but im not a bloody cradlesnatcher besides im perfectly happy with ryan thank you very much lizs face was red so you were never lukes girlfriend no way i told you i was with ryan when we met it was all about the music so theres no chance that ryan caught the two of you in bed together and ended up killing luke then deciding he might as well cash in on it i dont know how you can even suggest something as horrible as that liz seemed close to tears and banks was starting to feel like a shit she seemed a good kid but seemed wasnt good enough he remembered rose barlows visit as well as her angry exit liz was younger than lauren anderson and a far more likely candidate for lukes bedfellow in bankss opinion he didnt know how strong lizs relationship with ryan was or how open it happens banks said youd be surprised maybe it was an accident you just couldnt see any other way out i told you nothing like that happened luke was in the band thats all did luke ever confide in you at all annie asked easing off the pressure a little you know tell you what was on his mind what was worrying him liz paused regaining her composure she seemed to be looking at annies swollen red lips but she didnt ask about them he complained about school a lot she said finally ever say anything about his stepfather the rugby player exfootballer whatever no not much i dont think luke liked him very much why do you say that nothing in particular just the way he talked did you ever meet lukes parents no i dont think he even told them about us about the band how do you know just my impression it was probably true banks realized according to annie and to his own observations the armitages didnt seem to have a clue what luke was up to half the time did he seem worried about anything like what anything at all annie went on did he mention if any threats had been made against him for example or if he thought someone was following him anything unusual out of the ordinary no nothing like that like i said he didnt like school and couldnt wait to leave home id say thats pretty normal wouldnt you banks smiled hed been the same at that age later too and he had also left home at the first opportunity when did you last see luke annie asked about a week before he disappeared band practice annie looked around the small room and struggled to her feet where do you practice church basement down the street the vicars pretty broadminded a young bloke and he lets us use their space if we dont make too much noise and you havent seen luke since no has he ever been here banks asked in this flat sure plenty of times liz stood up as if she sensed they were leaving did he ever leave anything here like what any of his stuff you know notebooks poems stories clothes that sort of thing were looking for anything that might help us understand what happened to him he never left any clothes here liz said coldly but he sometimes left tapes of songs for us if thats what you mean and some lyrics maybe but could you collect them all together for us i suppose so i mean i dont know whats here or where everything is do you mean right now cant you come back later now would be best said banks well help you look if you like no i mean no its all right ill find them is there something here you dont want us to see liz no nothing theres only a few tapes and some poems notes for songs i dont see how they can help you look will i get these tapes and things back why would you get them back annie asked they were lukes property werent they technically i suppose but he brought them for us the band to share theyll still most likely go to the family banks told her lukes family but they dont care they cant cant what liz i was going to say they cant appreciate his talent theyll just throw them away how could you let something like that happen cant be helped its the law liz shifted from foot to foot arms folded as if she needed to go to the toilet look couldnt you go away and come back just for a while give me just a bit of time to get everything together we cant do that liz im sorry so youll just take everything and give it to lukes parents just like that you wont even give me time to make copies this is a murder investigation annie reminded her but still liz sat down close to tears again it doesnt seem fair it seems such a waste i dont know his parents dont care we were so close so close to what to making something of ourselves banks felt sorry for her he suspected that she wanted to hang on to lukes tapes and writings for selfish reasons so that the band could one day ride on lukes and his fathers coattails to success if they couldnt do it with lukes voice and talent at least they could try to do it with some of his material that luke had been murdered would also no doubt help boost the public interest banks didnt think particularly ill of liz for this hed probably have wanted the same if he were in her situation and felt passionate about a career in music he didnt think it lessened her genuine feelings for luke but there was something else that bothered him the way she had reacted when he had offered to help look around he glanced at annie it was one of those rare moments when each knew what the other was thinking mind if we have a little look around annie asked what why ive told you ill give you everything you want she got up and went over to the tapes picking out three these for a start the writings are in why are you so jumpy liz im not jumpy yes you are i think we should have a look around the place you cant do that you need a search warrant banks sighed again are you certain you want that he asked because we can get one go do it then get one banks looked at annie di cabbot will you please go liz looked from one to the other puzzled not just her both of you go it doesnt work like that said banks one of us has to stay here to make sure you dont interfere with anything wed hardly be doing our jobs if we disappeared and let drug dealers flush their stuff down the toilet would we im not a drug dealer im sure youre not but theres something you dont want us to find ill stay here while di cabbot gets the warrant then shell come back with four or five constables and well tear the place apart liz turned so pale banks worried she might faint he could tell she was sensitive and he didnt like bullying her but he didnt like what had happened to luke either whats it to be liz will you give us consent to look around now or do we do it the hard way liz looked up at him big eyes brimming with tears i dont have much choice do i theres always a choice youd find it anyway i told ryan he was stupid to keep it find what liz its in the cupboard by the door under the sleeping bag banks and annie opened the cupboard by the door and moved aside the sleeping bag underneath it was a battered leather shoulder bag exactly the kind that luke armitage had been carrying when the bullies taunted him in the market square i think you and ryan have got quite a bit of explaining to do dont you said banks chapter the bridge fair came every march as a young boy banks would go with his parents he remembered sitting on his fathers knee in the dodgem car clinging on for dear life remembered the feel of the rough nap and the rawwool smell of his dads jacket the sparks flashing off the high poles he remembered strolling around holding his mothers hand eating candy floss or toffee apples while she nibbled at brandy snap and his father ate a hot dog smothered in fried onions he would hear his father curse as he tried to throw biased darts at playing cards and his mother laugh as she tried to toss pingpong balls into goldfish bowls but when banks was fourteen he wouldnt be seen dead at the fair with his parents he went with his mates and saturday night was the big night why was it he thought as he drove past the small roadside fair that had sparked his memory that they always seemed to be playing old rock and roll music at fairgrounds even in the sixties whenever he thought of nights at the fair with paul graham steve and dave it was always freddy cannons palisades park that played in his mind or eddie cochrans summertime blues as the waltzers spun and the bright lights blazed in the dark not the beatles or the rolling stones his favorite ride was the caterpillar but you had to go on that one with a girl as the train went faster and faster in undulating circles the canvas cover like a shops awning would slowly unfurl until it covered up the whole ride hence the name caterpillar and you were in the dark riding fast with your girl on his own he liked the waltzers and the speedway best but all rides were better shared with girls when you were fourteen for banks and his friends the fair began before it opened he remembered passing the stretch of common ground with graham one wet afternoon it must have been because that was the only year graham was around for the spring fair and watching the brightly colored lorries roll in watching the suspicious and unsmiling fairworkers unload sections of track and cars and begin the magical process of fitting the whole thing together for the next two days banks would come back to check the progress watch the men put the last section of the carousel into place set up the booths the stalls and the shies and sure enough everything was ready on opening night you had to go after dark there was no point if the brightcolored lights didnt flash and spin and if the music wasnt loud if the smell of fried onions and spun sugar didnt waft through the night air to mingle with the discernible whiff of violence for the fairs were where you went to pick a fight or settle your scores and you could always see trouble brewing a mile off first the looks the whispers the casual bumps then someone running others in pursuit a scuffle and muffled cries the fairworkers always somehow outside or beyond it all stepping between the spokes as the waltzers got faster and faster collecting money impressing the girls with their daredevil nonchalance and the girls well the girls were all on parade at the fair all bubble gum miniskirts and eye shadow if you didnt get shagged on saturday night you didnt get shagged at all as the old rugby song went well banks didnt get shagged but he sometimes got kissed that night it was sylvia nixon a pretty little blonde from the girls school down the street theyd been eyeing each other shyly all night standing up on the boards right beside the rides watching the riders scream and yell and cling on tight she was with her quiet friend june that was the problem which graham bless his soul helped solve soon they were off on the caterpillar and banks felt that delicious anticipation as the cover started to close over them but something odd happened later banks was persuading the girls to come with them to the park the next day if the weather was fine there were plenty of sheltered wellhidden areas where you could lie in the grass or stand up against a tree and snog he was almost there just overcoming the last perfunctory shreds of resistance when graham said sorry i cant go tomorrow when banks asked him why he just smiled vaguely and answered with his characteristic evasiveness ive got something else to do thats all the girls werent too thrilled with that and banks never got to go out with sylvia nixon again a fight broke out somewhere near the dodgems banks remembered and a couple of older men broke it up but his chief memory apart from kissing sylvia on the caterpillar and grahams weak reason for missing the next days rendezvous was that graham paid again he had benson amp hedges too ten of them kingsize in the golden packet as banks turned off the a to peterborough he racked his brains trying to remember if he had ever asked graham where he got his money but he didnt think he had maybe he didnt want to know kids are selfish and as long as theyre having a good time they dont feel the need to question where its coming from or at whose expense it might be but there werent many places a kid grahams age could get his hands on so much ready cash the paper round wouldnt cover it but an occasional dip in the till might or perhaps he stole it from his mothers purse the trouble was that it didnt seem to matter so much just as long as graham had the money that he was generous went without saying but what had he done to get it and where and whom had he got it from now banks also found himself wondering what it was that graham had to do that sunday that was so much more important than snogging with sylvia nixons friend june in the park and he remembered other occasions too right up until the day of his disappearance when graham simply wasnt there no reason no excuse no explanation annies face was starting to ache when she went to interview liz palmer shed taken a couple of paracetamol earlier but the effect was wearing off she took another two and probed a loose tooth with her tongue wonderful the last thing she needed was a trip to the dentists that bastard armitage his highpriced lawyer had been down the station like a shot and as soon as the custody officer had drawn up the papers charging armitage with criminal assault hed been bound over to appear in front of the magistrate the following day and sent off home annie would have liked to see him cooling his heels in the custody suite at least overnight but no such luck hed probably walk on the charges too people like him usually did because the luke armitage murder was a highprofile case gristhorpe and dc winsome jackman were interviewing ryan milne at the same time next door so far since they had picked him up at the college milne had been about as forthcoming as liz annie took dc kevin templeton with her into interview room made sure liz was clear about her rights and started the tape recorders as yet annie explained no charges had been brought and nobody was under arrest she simply wanted an explanation as to how luke armitages shoulder bag had got into lizs hall cupboard the bag and its contents were already with forensics you told me you last saw luke at band practice in the church basement about a week before he disappeared right annie began liz nodded she slumped in her chair and worked at a fingernail looking a lot younger than her twentyone years did he have the shoulder bag with him he always had it with him then what was it doing in your cupboard ive no idea how long has it been there mustve been since band practice he came to the flat first yes annie glanced at kevin templeton and sighed problem is liz she went on that the market square cctv cameras caught luke before he disappeared a week ago last monday and he had the bag with him then it mustve been a new one no annie said it was the same one she couldnt be certain of that of course perhaps luke had left his bag at lizs and bought a new one but she thought it unlikely luke would have left all his things there too after all it wasnt the bag itself that counted but the possessions it contained his notebook his laptop computer portable cd player tapes and cds liz frowned well i dont see how me neither unless youre not telling us the truth why would i lie oh come off it kevin templeton butted in lukes dead id say thats a pretty good reason to lie wouldnt you liz jerked forward i didnt kill him you cant think i killed him i dont know what were supposed to think said annie spreading her hands but im sure you can see our problem luke and his bag go missing then luke turns up dead and we find his bag in your cupboard bit of a coincidence dont you think ive told you i dont know when he put it there where were you that afternoon what afternoon the monday luke disappeared i dont know home i suppose are you sure he didnt call at the flat then perhaps forget his bag when he went off somewhere else annie knew she was giving liz an out but it seemed the only way to get her talking i didnt see him did he have a key no so you couldnt have gone out for a minute and he let himself in i dont see how so much for that line of questioning liz youre not making our job any easier ill ask you again how did lukes bag find its way into your hall cupboard i told you i dont know and i dont believe you well thats your problem no liz its your problem and its going to be a very big one if you dont tell us the truth soon maybe it was ryan kevin templeton suggested liz looked confused ryan what do you mean well templeton went on let me tell you what i think happened annie gave him the nod i think luke went to your flat after hed been in the market square no i told you he didnt come that day let me finish but its not true youre making it up be quiet annie said listen to what dc templeton has to say liz flopped back in her chair whatever luke came to your place after hed been in the market square it was late afternoon ryan was out and the two of you thought you had time for a roll on the bed he was a goodlooking kid fit looked older than his age no that didnt happen it wasnt like that but ryan came home and caught you at it the two of them got in a scuffle and one way or another luke ended up dead im sure ryan didnt mean to kill him but you had a body on your hands what could you do you waited until dark and then you loaded lukes body into the car and took it to hallam tarn where ryan hoisted him up the wall and dropped him over he should have sunk the way dead bodies do at least for a while until they start to decompose and the gases build up and carry them to the surface but he didnt his tshirt snagged on an old tree root bad luck ryan wasnt to know that and nobody should have been in a position to find luke because the whole area was quarantined due to footandmouth restrictions but a man from the ministry had to take water samples bad luck again ryan wasnt to know that either templeton smiled showing his white teeth and folded his arms how am i doing so far liz its all lies nothing like that happened youre just making it up to get us in trouble ive heard about the police doing things like this before youre already in trouble annie said were trying to help you out find an explanation for what happened maybe it did happen the way dc templeton suggested maybe it was an accident if it was we can help but you have to tell us the truth look i dont know how that bag got there liz said we hadnt seen luke since the last band practice youre not making it easy for us annie said i cant help it what do you want me to do make something up just to satisfy you i want the truth ive told you the truth youve told us nothing liz look said templeton we can check you know our forensics people are very good what do you mean i mean theyll go through your flat with the proverbial finetooth comb and if theres any evidence of wrongdoing even a drop of lukes blood theyll find it hes right annie said theres the poker for a start i noticed it when we were talking to you you dont see them very often these days if theres any trace of lukes blood or hair on it well find it and if there are any traces on the carpet between the floorboards down the sink well find them liz crossed her arms and bit her lip annie could tell shed touched a nerve what was it the mention of blood did liz know theyd find traces of lukes blood in the flat what is it liz she asked something to tell me liz shook her head ryans being interviewed just next door templeton said ill bet hes telling them it was all your fault that you killed luke and he had to get rid of the body for you ryan wouldnt do that even if it were true annie asked but its not true we didnt kill anyone how many times do i have to tell you until we believe you annie said and until you come up with a satisfactory explanation of how lukes bag got into your cupboard i dont know what about the ransom demands what about them whose idea was that was it ryans did he see it as an easy opportunity to make some money now that luke was dead anyway or did he do it to confuse us i dont know what youre talking about annie stood up and templeton followed suit right annie said switching off the tapes im fed up of this have her taken to the custody suite kev and arrange for the taking of intimate samples maybe well be lucky and get a dna match with the blood on the wall and get a search warrant well have forensics in her flat within an hour then well talk to the super and find out what ryan had to say for himself right mam said templeton and dont bloody call me mam annie added under her breath liz stood up you cant do this you cant keep me here just watch us said annie banks tapped on his parents front door and walked in it was early evening and he had plenty of time to spare before his nine oclock meeting with michelle his parents had finished washing the dishes and were settling down to watch coronation street just as they had all those years ago the night the police came to call about graham the night joey flew away its all right dont get up banks said to his mother im not stopping long i have to go out i just came by to drop off my overnight bag first youll have a cup of tea though wont you dear his mother insisted maybe he wants something stronger his father suggested no thanks dad said banks tea will be fine up to you said arthur banks the suns well over the yardarm ill have that bottle of ale while youre up love ida banks disappeared into the kitchen leaving banks and his father to their uneasy silence any progress banks senior finally asked on what your old pal graham marshall not much said banks that why youre here again no banks lied its not my case its the funeral tomorrow arthur banks nodded bankss mother popped her head around the kitchen door i knew i had something to tell you alan ive got a head like a sieve these days i was talking to elsie grenfell yesterday and she said her davids coming down for the service tomorrow and that major lads supposed to be here as well wont it be exciting seeing all your old pals again yes said banks smiling to himself some things like the coronation street ritual and thank the lord there was still ten minutes to go before the program started never changed paul major had always been that major lad to ida banks even though she knew full well that his name was paul it was meant to indicate that she didnt quite approve of him banks couldnt imagine why of all of them paul major had been the most goodygoody the one most likely to become a chartered accountant or a banker what about steve banks asked steve hill i havent heard anything about him for years ida banks said then disappeared back into the kitchen it wasnt surprising the hills had moved off the estate many years ago when steves dad got transferred to northumberland banks had lost track of them and didnt know where they lived now he wondered if steve had even heard about the finding of grahams bones i dont suppose it came to anything what we were talking about in the coach last time you were here arthur banks said about the krays and mr marshall probably not but it was useful background arthur banks coughed had over half the metropolitan police in their pockets the krays did in their time so ive heard mrs banks came through with the tea and her husbands beer on a rosepatterned tray our roy phoned this afternoon she said beaming he said to say hello how is he banks asked thriving he said hes jetting off to america for some business meetings so he just wanted us to know hed be away for a few days in case we were worried or anything oh good said banks who much to his mothers chagrin he imagined never jetted anywhere unless greece counted just like brother roy to let his mother know what a highpowered life he was leading he wondered what kind of shady dealings roy was up to in america none of his business there was a program on telly the other night about that police corruption scandal a few years back bankss father said interesting some of the things your lot get up to banks sighed the defining event of arthur bankss life was not the second world war which he had missed fighting in by about a year but the miners strike of when maggie thatcher broke the unions and brought the workers to their knees every night he had been glued to the news and filled with the justified outrage of the workingman over the years banks knew his father had never been able to dispel the image of policemen in riot gear waving rolls of overtime fivers to taunt the starving miners banks had been working undercover in london then mostly on drugs cases but he knew that in his fathers mind he was one of them the enemy would it never end he said nothing so where are you going tonight love ida banks asked are you seeing that policewoman again she made it sound like a date banks felt a brief wave of guilt for thinking of it that way himself then he said its police business to do with graham yes i thought you said that wasnt your case his father chipped in its not but i might be able to help a bit helping police with their inquiries arthur banks chuckled it turned into a coughing fit until he spat into a handkerchief fortunately before anyone could say another word the coronation street theme music started up and all conversation ceased it wasnt often that detective superintendent gristhorpe visited the queens arms but after they had finished the interviews and put ryan milne and liz palmer under lock and key for the night he suggested to annie that they discuss the results over a bite to eat hungry and thirsty annie thought it a good idea gristhorpe like a true gentleman insisted on going to the bar to get their drinks though annie would have been happy to go herself instead she sat down and made herself comfortable gristhorpe still intimidated her a little though she didnt know why but she felt easier with him in an environment like the queens arms than in his booklined office so she was doubly glad he had suggested the pub she definitely had a loose tooth though so she would have to be careful how she ate gristhorpe returned with a pint of bitter for her and a half of shandy for himself they glanced over the menu chalked on the blackboard and annie went for a vegetarian lasagne which ought to be easy on her tooth while gristhorpe settled on fish and chips the old man was looking healthier than he had in quite a while annie thought the first few times she had seen him after his accident he had seemed pale gaunt and drawn but now he had a bit more flesh on his bones and a warm glow to his pockmarked face she supposed that accidents and illness took a lot more out of you the older you got and that recovery took longer but how old was he he couldnt have been all that much over sixty hows your mouth feeling he asked the pain seems to have gone for now sir thanks for asking you should have gone to the hospital it was nothing just a glancing blow even so these things can have complications hows wells last i heard still in the infirmary armitage gave him a real goingover he always was a hothead that one even as a football player now what about the palmer girl anything interesting there annie recounted what little she had got from liz palmer then gristhorpe sipped some shandy and told her about ryan milnes interview he said he knew nothing about the bag just like his girlfriend he told me he was out that day and didnt see luke at all did you believe him sir no winsome went at him a bit shes very good in interviews that lass a real tigress but neither of us could shake him so what are they hiding dunno maybe a night in the cells will soften them up a bit do you think they did it sir did it killed luke and dumped the body gristhorpe pursed his lips then said i dont know annie milnes got an old banger so they had the means of transport like you i suggested some sort of romantic angle something going on between luke and liz but milne didnt bite and to be quite honest i didnt notice any signs id hit the nail on the head so you dont think there was any romantic angle luke was only fifteen and liz palmer is what twentyone as i remember the last thing a twentyoneyearold woman would want is a fifteenyearold boyfriend now maybe if she were fortyone annie smiled a toyboy ive heard it called that but i still think fifteens too young i dont know said annie the head teachers daughter told dci banks she thought luke was having it off with his english teacher and shes pushing thirty lauren anderson thats the one stranger things have happened what does alan think that little miss barlow had reasons of her own for causing trouble for miss anderson annie sipped some beer nectar but i wouldnt say its out of the question that luke was having relations with someone older than himself everything ive heard about him indicates he seemed much older than his age both physically and mentally how about emotionally that i dont know well thats the one that counts gristhorpe mused thats what causes people to get out of their depth they can understand something intellectually accomplish something physically but the emotional aspect can hit them like a sledgehammer if theyre not mature enough teenagers are particularly vulnerable annie agreed shed had enough experience with troubled teens in her job to know it was true and luke armitage had been a complex personality a mass of conflicting desires and unresolved problems add to that his creativity his sensitivity and luke was probably as volatile to handle as nitroglycerine does the anderson woman have a jealous boyfriend gristhorpe asked not according to winsome she did a bit of digging only bit of dirt on ms anderson is that her brother vernons got a record gristhorpe raised his bushy eyebrows oh nothing really nasty just dodgy checks ive written a few of those in my time according to my bank manager what about the other teacher alastair ford kevin templeton says there are rumors hes gay but only rumors as far as anyone knows he has no sex life at all any evidence that luke armitage was gay too none but theres no evidence he was straight either ford has a temper though like armitage and hes been seeing a psychiatrist for several years now definitely the unstable kind not to be ruled out then no and norman wells looking less likely isnt he when their food arrived both were hungry enough to stop talking for a while and eat then gristhorpe slowed down any ideas of your own about how lukes bag ended up where it did annie he asked annie finished her mouthful of lasagne then said i think luke went there after his runin with the three bullies in the market square what happened after that i dont know but either he died there or something happened that made him run off without his bag which i dont think hed do under any normal circumstances so something happened there yes certainly what about his mobile one of those tiny models you can just flip open and shut probably couldnt find it among all the stuff if he kept it in his bag so he carried it in his pocket anyway it hasnt been found yet has it been used not since the ransom call hasnt even been switched on i checked again with the company anything valuable in the bag stefans going through it from what i saw though i dont think so i mean the laptop was worth a bob or two but i dont think theft was the motive here that is yes annie well there was nothing valuable to you or me nothing of any real material value but i got the impression that liz at least is ambitious and theres a chance they could ride a lot farther and a lot faster on luke armitages coattails or rather neil byrds coattails i think i must be a bit of an old fogey said gristhorpe scratching the side of his hooked nose but i cant say ive ever heard of neil byrd i know who he was to luke and what happened to him of course but thats about as far as it goes alan dci banks knows a lot more about it than i do sir but byrd was quite famous in his time the record company is still bringing out cds of previously unreleased stuff greatest hits and live concerts so theres still a thriving neil byrd industry out there a dozen years after his death luke inherited some of his fathers talent and if liz and ryan wanted to milk the connection im sure there are plenty of song ideas and fragments on the laptop and in his notebooks but he was only a kid annie surely he cant have had that much to say its not what you say sir its how you say it teenage angst mostly from what ive heard but its the name thats the point and not to be too ghoulish about it the circumstances dead son of famous rock suicide with a promotion like that the songs wouldnt need to be that good itd get lizs band known get them a name and thats more than half the battle in the music business but legally all lukes stuff belongs to his family now wouldnt they sue if these people got as far as making a record of lukes songs maybe but itd be too late then wouldnt it and you know what they say no publicitys bad publicity a lawsuit would only further lizs and ryans career its just a thought sir gristhorpe finished his last chip and pushed his plate aside taking a sip of shandy so what youre saying is that whether the two of them killed luke or not they somehow found themselves with a gold mine of material and they thought they might as well hang on to it until they could use it as i said sir its only an idea if theyd been a bit more cautious theyd have got rid of the bag and wed be none the wiser but they never thought wed search their flat why would they they didnt even know that anyone had seen luke with liz what about the vicar at that church where they practiced annie rolled her eyes winsome talked to him said hes so otherworldly he hadnt a clue who luke armitage was or that hed disappeared would liz and ryan have killed luke for his stuff he asked i dont think so sir thats the problem whichever way you look at it theyd be far better off with luke alive he would have been the real draw without him well theyre simply doing the best they can so they had nothing to gain by killing him no not unless he was intending to walk out on them for example and take all his works with him one of them could have lost it with him then or as i suggested earlier unless there was some sort of romantic relationship and ryan found out a crime passionnel i suppose so wouldnt be the first time we cant discount anything yet lets just give them a bit of time hope forensics turn up something and have at them again in the morning good idea sir annie finished her pint annie before you go sir i dont mean to pry but you and alan just colleagues sir and friends gristhorpe seemed pleased with her answer aye he said good good get some sleep lass ill see you bright and early in the morning the pub was closer to the riverside than the city center though even that wasnt very far banks parked by the rivergate centre and walked the rest of the way it was a pleasant evening not a leaf stirring in the warm air the sunset painted the sky bright orange and crimson banks could see venus low on the horizon and the constellations were slowly taking shape overhead he wished he could recognize them all but he could only make out hercules that made him think of those dreadful historical spectacles he used to love in the early sixties with cheap special effects steve reeves and a scantily clad sylva koscina michelle was five minutes late and banks had already settled at a small corner table with a pint of bitter the lounge was small and smoky but most of the people stood at the bar and the video machines were mercifully silent piped music played softly some sort of modern pop stuff banks didnt recognize michelle was wearing tight black trousers and a green blouse tucked in at the waist she carried a tan suede jacket slung over her shoulder banks had never seen her dressed so casually before hadnt seen her looking as good either shed had her hair done he noticed nothing drastic just tidied up a bit the fringe trimmed highlights renewed and she wore a little makeup just enough to accentuate her green eyes and high cheekbones she seemed selfconscious about her appearance because she wouldnt meet his eyes at first only when he had offered a drink and she asked for a dry white wine did she favor him with a look and a shy smile thanks for coming michelle said when banks placed the drink in front of her and sat down my pleasure said banks id have come tomorrow for the service anyway so another evening doesnt make much difference i know youre busy im covered besides we had a lucky break just before i set off banks told her about finding luke armitages bag at liz palmers flat poor kid said michelle he wasnt much older than graham marshall was he a year or so why would anyone want to kill a boy that age what could he possibly have done i dont know i suppose thats why we assume its a pedophile when the victims so young we can easily imagine older people being killed for other motives for greed or to cover up something but its hard with kids anyway it looked like a kidnapping but i have my doubts what about you any more news michelle gave him the gist of her conversation with retired di robert lancaster in london especially his remarks about graham seeming streetwise beyond his years so your excopper thought graham had a future in crime did he banks said interesting that why have you remembered something nothing really just that graham never seemed short of money and id no idea where he got it from theres something else michelle said she seemed hesitant banks thought unwilling to meet his eyes yes someone was in my flat on saturday while i was down in london anything taken not as far as i can tell just a few things out of place but whoever it was had also been having a good look at my computer files banks got the impression that she wasnt telling him everything but he didnt pursue it if there was something she was omitting it was probably for a good reason such as personal embarrassment shed hardly want to tell him if someone had been going through her undies would she anything there not much personal notes speculations about the case some of it did you report the breakin of course not under the circumstances how did he get in finessed the lock somehow michelle smiled dont worry ive had it changed the locksmith assures me the place is as impregnable as a fortress now anything else maybe what does that mean yesterday as i was crossing the road near the hazels estate i was almost hit by a small van almost yes no damage i couldnt be certain but i thought it was deliberate any idea who the number plate was obscured a guess well i hesitate to say it but after the missing notebooks and actions my mind cant help but wander toward shaw thing is i cant bring myself to believe it that he would do something like that banks didnt have much of a problem believing it hed known bent coppers before and known them well enough to realize that they were capable of anything when cornered many coppers were also as skilled at picking locks as burglars were but why did shaw feel cornered and what was it hed done banks remembered the quiet young man with the freckles ginger hair and stickingout ears rather than the bloated rednosed bully shaw had become shaw was teamed up with di proctor right reg proctor yes he took early retirement in and then died of liver cancer in he was only fortyseven any rumors hints of scandal michelle sipped some wine and shook her head not that i could uncover seems to have had an exemplary career banks asked michelles permission and lit a cigarette shaw and proctor were the detectives who came to our house he said they were obviously interviewing friends of grahams and people on the estate there would no doubt have been other teams assigned to other tasks but for some reason someone wanted rid of shaws notes shaw himself he was only a dc at the time said michelle right what could he have to hide there must have been something in his notebooks that incriminated someone else maybe harris or proctor the notebooks could have been missing since harris retired in michelle said they could also have been taken before proctors death in i suppose but why nobodys had reason to look at them for years graham had been missing since why mess with the paperwork unless there was some compelling reason and what could that be except that his bodys been found and the case is open again true enough said michelle the actions would show us how the investigation was managed banks mused most of them probably came from jet harris himself theyd show the direction the investigation took or didnt take the shape of it we keep getting back to this blinkered approach michelle said ds shaw even hinted they all knew brady and hindley did it thats a load of bollocks said banks the timings right but thats all thats right you might just as well say reggie and ronnie did it maybe they did banks laughed it makes more sense than brady and hindley they operated miles away no theres something else going on something we cant figure out because there are still too many missing pieces another ill go michelle walked to the bar and banks sat wondering what the hell it was all about so far all they had was an investigation that had concentrated on only one possibility the passing pedophile now they had bill marshalls relationship with the krays and with carlo fiorino and le phonographe and the fact that banks remembered graham often had money enough to pay for their entertainment and now the missing records there were links graham bill marshall carlo fiorino but where did it go after that and how did jet harris fit in it was possible that hed been on the take paid by fiorino to head off trouble jet harris bent copper that would go down well at headquarters but how did it relate to graham and his murder michelle came back with the drinks and told him about donald bradfords death and the pornography that had been found in his flat there might be no connection she said i mean bradford could have been the victim of a random breakin and plenty of people have collections of pornography true banks said but its a bit of a coincidence isnt it it is indeed what if bradford was using the newsagents shop as an outlet for distributing porn banks suggested and graham delivered it why not he always seemed to be able to get his hands on it thats another thing i remember a bit of danish submission with your sunday times sir or how about some swedish sodomy with your news of the world madam gives a whole new meaning to the term sunday supplement doesnt it michelle laughed maybe he just found out about it is that worth killing someone for who knows people have killed for less but all were assuming is that bradford was a minor porn dealer he had to get it from a wholesaler didnt he maybe bradford was working for someone with even more at stake someone like carlo fiorino suggested banks and harris was on fiorinos payroll its possible but still speculation and it doesnt get us a lot further with the missing notebooks unless proctor and shaw inadvertently hit on the truth during their interviews and it was recorded in shaws notebooks i dont know how wed find out though its not as if we can talk to harris or proctor maybe not said banks but we might be able to do the next best thing were they married harris was not proctor is his wife still alive as far as i know maybe shell be able to tell us something think you can find her piece of cake said michelle and lets delve a little deeper into donald bradfords domain including the circumstances of his death okay but what about ds shaw avoid him as best you can that shouldnt be too difficult these days michelle said hes off sick half the time the booze thats what id put my money on are you going to the funeral tomorrow yes good banks finished his drink another michelle looked at her watch no really id better go okay i suppose i should go too banks smiled im sure my mumll be waiting up for me michelle laughed it was a nice sound soft warm musical banks realized he hadnt heard her laugh before can i give you a lift he asked oh no thank you said michelle standing up im just around the corner ill walk with you then you dont need to its quite safe i insist especially after what youve just told me michelle said nothing they walked out into the mild darkness crossed the road and neared the riverside flats close to where banks had parked his car michelle had been right it really was within spitting distance this is right across the river from where they used to have the fair when i was a kid he said funny but i was just thinking about it as i was driving down before my time said michelle yes banks walked her up to her door well she said fumbling for her key giving him a brief smile over her shoulder good night then ill just wait and make sure everythings okay you mean until youre sure there are no bogeymen waiting for me something like that michelle opened her door put on the lights and did a quick check while banks stood in the doorway and glanced around the living room it seemed a bit barren no real character as if michelle hadnt put her stamp on it yet all clear she said emerging from the bedroom good night then said banks trying to hide his disappointment that she didnt even invite him in for a coffee and take care see you tomorrow yes she gave him a smile tomorrow then she closed the door gently behind him and the sound of the bolt slipping home seemed far louder than it probably was it was all very well for gristhorpe to tell annie to get a good nights sleep but she couldnt she had taken more paracetamol and gone to bed early but the pain had returned to her mouth with a vengeance every tooth ached and now two of them felt loose the blow from armitage had shaken her more than she had cared to admit to either banks or gristhorpe because it had made her feel the same way she had felt when she was raped nearly three years ago a powerless victim she had sworn afterward that she would never allow herself to feel that way again but down in the cramped dank space of norman wellss book cellar she had felt it the deep gutwrenching fear of the female powerless against male strength and sheer brute force annie got up went downstairs and poured herself a glass of milk with shaking hands sitting at the kitchen table in the dark as she sipped it she remembered the very first time banks had been to her house they had sat in the kitchen and eaten dinner together while the light faded all the while annie had been wondering what she would do if he made a move she had impulsively invited him into her home after all offering to cook dinner instead of going to a restaurant or a pub as he had suggested had she known right then when she did that what was going to happen she didnt think so as the evening wore on their mood had got more and more mellow thanks partly to liberal quantities of chianti when she had gone outside into the backyard with banks who wanted a cigarette and when he had put his arm around her she had felt herself tremble like a teenager as she had blurted out all the reasons about why they shouldnt do what they were about to do well they had done it and now she had ended the affair sometimes she regretted that and wondered why she had done it partly it was because of her career of course working in the same station as the dci youre screwing was bad policy but maybe that was just an excuse besides it didnt have to be that way she could have worked in another station somewhere where the opportunities were just as good if not better than at western area headquarters it was true that banks still seemed tied to his past to his marriage but she could have handled that it was also something that would have waned in time everyone had emotional baggage including annie herself no she thought the reasons for what she did were within herself not the job not bankss past intimacy had felt like a threat to her and the closer she had got to banks the more she had felt suffocated and tried to pull away would it be like that with every man she met was it to do with the rape possibly she thought or at least partly she wasnt sure she would ever completely get over that what happened that night had certainly damaged her deeply she didnt think she was beyond repair just that she had a long way to go she still had occasional nightmares and though she had never told banks this sex had sometimes been an effort for her had even hurt at times sometimes the simple act of penetration however consensual and gentle had brought back the surge of panic and the feeling of sheer powerlessness she had first experienced that night sex certainly had its dark side annie knew it could be demonic close to violence pushing you into dangerous and vaguely imagined desires and dark areas beyond taboo it was no wonder then she thought that the idea of sex was so often mentioned in the same breath as violence or that sex and death were so intimately linked in the words and works of so many writers and artists annie finished her milk and tried to laugh off her morbid thoughts still they seemed to be the only kind she had at night alone and unable to sleep she put the kettle on for tea and went into the living room to browse through her small video collection in the end she settled on doctor zhivago which had always been one of her favorite films and when the tea was ready she lounged on the sofa in the dark with her steaming mug legs tucked under her and gave herself up to the haunting theme music and the epic story of love in a time of revolution banks walked down the stairs and tried to shake off his sense of disappointment it was just as well he told himself the last thing he needed right now was to make a fool of himself over yet another woman and michelle had her own demons whatever they were everyone did it seemed you couldnt get to a certain age without attracting a lot of clutter but why did it always have to get in the way why couldnt you just shrug it off and get on with life why was misery so easy to embrace and joy so bloody elusive just around the corner from the flats he stopped to light a cigarette before he got his lighter out of his pocket he felt something thud into him from behind he staggered forward and turned to face whoever had hit him he got only a quick glimpse of a pug nose and piggy eyes before a blow to the face upset both his vision and his balance another blow knocked him to the ground next he felt a sharp pain in his ribs and a kick to his stomach made him retch then he heard a dog barking and a mans voice shouting beyond the walls of pain felt rather than saw his attacker hesitate and heard him whisper go back where you came from or therell be more of that before he ran off into the night banks got to his knees and felt sick head hanging on his chest christ he was getting too old for this kind of thing he tried to stand but his legs still felt too wobbly then a hand grasped his elbow and he managed to get to his feet are you all right mister banks swayed and took a couple of deep breaths that felt a little better his head was still spinning but his vision had cleared a young man stood beside him jack russell terrier on a leash only i was just taking pugwash here for a walk and i saw two blokes setting on you two are you certain yes they ran off toward the city center thank you said banks that was very brave of you you saved my bacon is there anything else i can do call you a taxi or something banks paused to get his thoughts in some sort of order then he looked toward the flats no he said no thanks ive a friend lives just over there ill be fine if youre certain yes and thanks again not many people bother to get involved these days the young man shrugged no problem come on pugwash and they wandered off the man casting a couple of backward glances as he went still a bit wobbly banks made his way back to michelles flat and pressed the intercom a few moments later her voice crackled into the night air yes who is it its me alan said banks what is it ive had a little accident i wonder if but before he could finish michelle buzzed him in and he made his way up to her door she was already standing there looking concerned and she came forward to help him toward the sofa not that it was necessary but he thought it was a nice gesture what happened she asked someone jumped me thank god for dog walkers or id probably be in the river by now funny isnt it i thought i was going to end up in the nene all those years ago and i almost ended up there tonight youre rambling michelle said sit down banks still felt a bit dizzy and nauseated when he sat down just give me a few minutes he said ill be fine michelle handed him a glass drink she said he drank cognac a good one too as the fiery liquor spread through his limbs he started to feel even better his mind came into sharper focus and he was able to assess the damage not much really his ribs felt tender but he didnt feel as if anything was broken he looked up and saw michelle standing over him how do you feel now much better thank you banks sipped some more cognac look he said id better call a taxi i dont feel very much like driving in this condition especially not after this he held up the glass michelle tipped in more from the courvoisier vsop bottle and poured herself a generous measure too okay she said but you must let me see to your nose first nose banks realized his nose and upper lip felt numb he put his hand up and it came away bloody i dont think its broken michelle said leading him toward the bathroom but id better clean you up and put something on it before you go theres a small cut on your lip too whoever hit you must have been wearing a ring or something the bathroom was small almost too small for two people to stand without touching banks stood with the backs of his legs against the toilet bowl as michelle used a damp facecloth to wipe away the blood then looked in the cabinet and came up with some tcp liquid antiseptic she put a small swab of cotton wool over the top of the bottle and tipped it up then carefully applied it to his lip it stung and the acrid smell made him gasp michelle took the cotton wool away its all right he said she dropped one bloodstained swab into the waste bin and prepared another banks watched her face close to his the look of concentration as she applied the cotton wool tip of her tongue nipped between her teeth she caught his eye blushed and looked away what nothing he said she was so close he could feel the warmth of her body smell the cognac on her breath go on she said you were going to say something its just like chinatown banks said what do you mean the film chinatown havent you seen it what happens jack nicholson gets his nose cut by roman polanski and faye dunaway well she does what youre doing now puts tcp on it well i dont think it was tcp i dont think they have that in america but the ideas the same anyway its a very sexy scene sexy michelle paused banks could see her flushed skin feel the heat from her cheeks the bathroom seemed to be getting smaller yes said banks she dabbed at him again her hand was trembling i dont see how putting tcp on a cut could be sexy she said i mean what happens she was so close to him now that he could feel her breast touching ever so lightly against his arm he could have leaned the top half of his body farther back bent at the knees but he stood his ground first they kiss he said but wouldnt it hurt it was just his nose that got cut remember of course how silly of me michelle what what is it banks took her trembling hand by the wrist and moved it away from his mouth then he put his other hand under her chin and cupped it gently so she was looking at him her brilliant green eyes questioning but holding his gaze not looking away now he could feel his heart thudding in his chest and his knees wobbling as he pulled her closer to him and felt her yield chapter you were late back last night bankss mother said without turning from the kitchen sink teas fresh banks poured himself a cup of tea and added a splash of milk he had expected this sort of reaction his mother had probably lain awake until two in the morning listening for him the way she did when he was a teenager he and michelle had decided that for many reasons it was not a good idea for him to stay with her overnight but even so michelle had laughed at the idea of his having to go home to his mother ida banks turned alan what have you done to your face its nothing said banks but its all bruised and your lips cut what have you been up to banks turned away i told you its nothing were you fighting was it some criminal you were arresting is that why you were so late you could have rung she gave him a look that spoke volumes about what she thought of his chosen career something like that banks said i had a bit of business to take care of look im sorry i didnt ring but it was so late i didnt want to wake you his mother gave him the reproving look she was so good at son she said you ought to know by now that i cant get to sleep until youre home safe and sound well you cant have slept much these past thirty years or so banks said and immediately regretted it when he saw the other look she was so good at the suffering martyr lower lip trembling he went over and gave her a hug sorry mum he said but im all right really i am his mother sniffed and nodded well she said i suppose youll be hungry bacon and eggs banks knew from experience that feeding him would help his mother get over her bad night he wasnt all that hungry but he couldnt deal with the protests he knew hed get if all he asked for was cereal he was also in a hurry michelle had suggested he come down to headquarters to search through the mug shots for his attacker he wasnt certain he could identify the man though the piggy eyes and pug nose were distinctive enough still mother comes first bacon and eggs it had to be if its no trouble he said his mother walked over to the fridge its no trouble wheres dad he asked as his mother turned on the cooker down at the allotment i didnt know he still went there its more of a social thing he doesnt do much digging or anything these days mostly he sits and passes the time of day with his mates and he has a cigarette or two he thinks i dont know but i can smell it on him when he comes home well dont be too hard on him mum im not but its not only his health is it what am i supposed to do if he goes and drops dead hes not going to drop dead doctor says hes not supposed to smoke and you should stop too while youre still young young it was a long time since banks had been called young or felt young for that matter except perhaps last night with michelle once she had made her decision dropped her defenses a little she was a different person banks marveled it had clearly been a long time since she had been with anyone so their lovemaking was slow and tentative at first but none the worse for that and once she threw aside her inhibitions she proved to be a warm and generous lover michelle had also been gentle because of bankss cut lip and bruised ribs he cursed his bad luck that he had to be injured in combat the first night he got to sleep with her he also thought it was ironic that such physical injuries were so rare in his line of work yet both he and annie had been hurt within hours of each other some malevolent force working against them no doubt banks remembered michelles sleepy latenight kiss at the door as he left her warm body pressed against him he sipped some tea is the paper around he asked his mother your dad took it with him ill just nip over the road then his father took the daily mail anyway and banks preferred the independent or the guardian your bacon and eggs will be ready dont worry ill be back before theyre done bankss mother sighed and he headed out it was warm but cloudy outside and looking like rain again that close sticky muggy weather he hated as he entered the newsagents shop he remembered the way it used to be laid out the counter in a different place racks arranged differently different magazines and covers back then too film show fabulous jackie honey titbits annabelle banks remembered his conversation with michelle in the pub about donald bradford and his collection of porn and wondered if he really had acted as a distributor while banks couldnt imagine graham slipping a magazine of french fellatio between the pages of the people and putting it through number s letter box he could imagine bradford keeping his stock under the counter or hidden in the back and maybe graham had stumbled upon it he could remember quite clearly the first time he had ever seen a pornographic magazine not just the ones with naked women in them like playboy swank and mayfair but true porn magazines that showed people doing things it was in their den inside the tree and interestingly enough the magazines were grahams at least he brought them had banks never wondered at the time where graham got them from he didnt know and if graham had mentioned it banks didnt remember it was a warm day and there were only three of them there but he wasnt sure whether the third was dave paul or steve the branches and leaves came right down to the ground hard shiny green leaves with thorns on them banks remembered now and he could feel himself slipping through the concealed entrance where the foliage wasnt too dense the thorns pricking his skin once you got inside the space seemed bigger than it could possibly be just the way the inside of dr whos tardis was bigger than the outside they had plenty of space to sit around and smoke and enough light got through for them to look at dirty magazines the smell of the place came back too so real he could smell it as he stood waiting to cross the road pine needles or something similar and there was a soft beige carpet of them on the ground that day graham had the two magazines stuffed down the front of his shirt and he brought them out with a flourish he probably said feast your eyes on this lads but banks couldnt remember the actual words and he didnt have time to settle down and try to reconstruct the memory in full it wasnt important anyway what was important was that for the next hour or so the three teenagers looked in awe on some of the most amazing exciting unbelievable images they had ever seen in their lives people doing things they had never even dreamed could or should be done by todays standards banks realized it was pretty mild but for a fourteenyearold provincial kid in the summer of to see color photos of a woman sucking a mans penis or a man sticking his penis up a womans arse was shocking in the extreme there were no animals banks remembered and certainly no children mostly he remembered images of impossibly largebreasted women some of them with semen spurting all over their breasts and faces and wellendowed men usually on top of them or being ridden by them graham wouldnt lend the magazines out banks remembered so the only time they had to look at them was then and there inside the tree the titles and text or what he remembered of them were in a foreign language he knew it wasnt german or french because he took those languages at school while this didnt become a regular occurrence banks did remember a couple of other occasions that summer when graham brought magazines to the tree different ones each time and then of course graham disappeared and banks didnt see that kind of porn again until he became a policeman so was it a clue or not as michelle had said last night it hardly seemed something worth murdering over even back then but if it was a part of something bigger the kray empire for example and if graham had got involved in it way beyond his depth beyond borrowing a few magazines then there might be a link to his murder it was worth looking into at any rate if banks could figure out where to start tapping the newspaper against his thigh banks crossed the busy road and hurried back home before his bacon and eggs turned cold the last thing he needed was to upset his mother again this morning despite her late night michelle was at her desk long before detective superintendent shaw was likely to see the light of day if he bothered coming in at all maybe he would take another sick day at any rate the last thing she wanted was him breathing over her shoulder while banks was in an interview room looking through the mug shots there were people around the office so she and banks hadnt had a chance to do much more than say a quick hello before they got down to business she had given him a choice of the computer version or the plain oldfashioned photo albums and he had chosen the albums she had felt a little shy when he walked in and could still hardly believe that she had gone ahead and slept with him like that even though she knew she had wanted to it wasnt as if she had been saving herself or anything or that she was afraid or had lost interest in sex only that she had been far too preoccupied by the aftermath of melissas death and the end of her marriage to ted you dont get over something like that overnight still she was surprised at her newfound boldness and blushed even now as she thought about the way it had made her feel she didnt know what bankss personal situation was except that he was going through a divorce he hadnt talked about his wife or his children if he had any michelle found herself curious she hadnt told him about melissa and ted either and she didnt know if she would not for a while anyway it was just too painful the only real drawback was that he was on the job but where else was she likely to meet someone people who form relationships often meet at their places of work besides north yorkshire was a fair distance from cambridgeshire and after theyd got the graham marshall case sorted she doubted they would ever have to work together again but would they even see each other that was the question it was a long way to travel or perhaps it was foolish of her even to imagine a relationship or to want one maybe it had just been a onenight stand and banks already had a lover up in eastvale putting aside her thoughts and her memories of the previous night michelle got down to work she had a couple of things to do before graham marshalls funeral service that afternoon including tracking down jet harriss wife and ringing dr cooper but before she could pick up the telephone dr cooper rang her dr cooper i was going to ring you this morning said michelle any news sorry it took me so long to get the information you wanted but i told you dr hilary wendells a tough man to track down youve got something hilary has he wont commit himself to this absolutely so hed be very unwilling to testify if it ever came to a court case it probably wont said michelle but the information might be useful to me well from careful measurement of the nick on the underside of the rib hes made a few projections and hes pretty certain its a military knife of some kind his moneys on a fairbairnsykes whats that british commando knife introduced in seveninch doubleedged blade stiletto point a commando knife yes is that of any use it might be said michelle thanks a lot youre welcome and please thank dr wendell from me will do a commando knife in the war had only been over for twenty years and plenty of men in their early forties would have fought in it and had access to such a knife what worried michelle most of all though was that the only person she knew had served as a royal naval commando was jet harris she remembered it from the brief biography she had read when she first came to thorpe wood he had also been awarded a distinguished conduct medal the thought of it sent shivers up her spine jet harris himself as killer misdirecting the investigation at every turn away from bradford perhaps because of fiorino as banks had suggested and away from himself this was one theory she certainly couldnt go to shaw with or to anyone else in the division either harris was a local hero and shed need a hell of a lot of hard evidence if she expected anyone to entertain even the remotest suspicion that jet harris was a murderer after hed been in about an hour banks poked his head out of the interview room door no doubt looking to see if shaw was around then carried one of the books over to michelle i think thats him he said michelle looked at the photo the man was in his late twenties with mediumlength brown hair badly cut a stocky build piggy eyes and a pug nose his name was des wayman and according to his record he had been in and out of the courts ever since his days as a juvenile car thief progressing from that to public disorder offenses and gbh his most recent incarceration a lenient nine months was for receiving stolen goods and he had been out just over a year and a half what next banks asked ill go and have a word with him want me to come along no i think it would work better if i could question him without you there after all it might come to an identity parade if any charges are brought i want to make sure this is done right fair enough said banks but he looks like a tough customer he rubbed his jaw feels like one too michelle tapped her pen against her lips and looked across the office where dc collins sat talking on the phone shirtsleeves rolled up scribbling on the pad in front of him she hadnt let him in on her suspicions about shaw yet could she trust him he was almost as new as she was for a start and that went in his favor she had never seen him hanging around with shaw or with any of the other old brigade either another plus in the end she decided she had to trust someone and collins was it ill take dc collins she said then lowered her voice look theres a couple of things i need to talk to you about but not here after the funeral this afternoon okay said michelle jotting des waymans address down in her notebook i should know a bit more about mr waymans activities by then oh and guess where he lives where the hazels annie pored over luke armitages notebooks and computer files in her office that morning at least she felt a bit better despite a poor nights sleep eventually the painkillers had kicked in and she woke up at half past seven in the morning not even having got around to putting in the second doctor zhivago tape this morning though her jaw was still throbbing a bit it didnt hurt anywhere near as much as it had the one thing that intrigued her about lukes jottings was the increasing eroticism mixed in with the vague classical references to persephone psyche and ophelia then she remembered that ophelia wasnt a character from classical mythology but hamlets girlfriend driven mad by his violent rejection of her she remembered studying the play at school and finding it rather too long and dense for her taste at the time she had seen several film versions since then including one with mel gibson as hamlet and another with marianne faithfull as ophelia and she remembered from somewhere the image of ophelia floating down a river surrounded by flowers did luke feel guilty about rejecting someone then had he been killed out of revenge by a woman scorned and if so who liz palmer lauren anderson rose barlow of course the repeated references to sweet white breasts pale cheeks and soft white thighs in lukes fragments of songs and poems could have been mere adolescent fantasy luke certainly had a romantic imagination and if banks was to be believed adolescent boys thought of nothing but sex but they could also point to the fact that luke had been involved in a sexual relationship liz palmer looked like a likely candidate despite her denials annie also shouldnt forget that according to the head teachers daughter rose barlow there might have been something going on between luke and lauren anderson rose was unreliable but it might be worth talking to lauren again if she got nowhere with liz and ryan rose had been involved with luke in however slight a way and she had no doubt felt jilted when he spent more time with liz or lauren or was there someone else annie was overlooking some connection she was missing she felt that she was but no matter how she tried the missing link still eluded her her phone rang just as she was turning off lukes computer annie its stefan nowak dont get your hopes up too high but i might have a bit of good news for you do tell i could do with some good news round about now the lab hasnt finished trying to match your dna samples with the blood on the drystone wall yet so i cant tell you about that but my team did find blood at the flat liz palmers flat yes how much only a small amount where not where youd expect smeared under the bathroom sink as if someone gripped it while leaning over could be yes but there are no prints or anything just a small smear of blood is it enough for analysis oh yes were working on it now all the lab has been able to tell me so far is that it matches luke armitages blood type and that it doesnt match the samples we took from liz palmer or ryan milne but thats fantastic stefan dont you see it puts luke armitage bleeding in liz palmers flat maybe but it wont tell you when for the moment ill take what i can get at least that gives me some leverage in the next interview theres more what ive just been talking to dr glendenning and he tells me the tox screen on luke shows an unusually large amount of diazepam diazepam thats valium isnt it thats one name for it there are many but the point is that it was mostly undigested so he died very soon after taking it and his system didnt have time to digest it yes but its not the cause of death no way would it have been enough to kill him probably not anything else in the flat yes drugs some marijuana lsd ecstasy dealing no not enough just for personal use id say and no diazepam thanks stefan thanks a lot annie hung up and pondered what she had just heard luke had bled in liz and ryans flat and he had undigested diazepam in his system where did he get it she didnt remember anything about medication in the information theyd gathered on him she wasnt even sure that doctors prescribed diazepam to someone that young she should at least check with robin even though stefans team hadnt found any in the flat the first thing to do annie thought getting to her feet and reaching for her jacket was to find out if either liz or ryan had prescriptions for diazepam according to his file des wayman lived in a twobedroom council house on hazel way just off the crescent at the wilmer road end of the estate it was midmorning when michelle and dc collins parked outside and walked down the path the sky was covered in gray cloud and the air was so saturated with moisture it felt like warm drizzle michelles clothes were sticking to her and dc collins had taken off his suit jacket and unloosened his tie even so there were damp patches under his arms she was glad collins was with her he played second row for the police rugby team and his solid presence was enough to put anyone off trying anything as far as michelle could make out nobody had followed them and she hadnt seen any beige vans in the area michelle knocked at the scratched red door of number the man who opened it seemed surprised to see her it was des wayman no doubt about it the pug nose gave him away and the piggy eyes he was wearing grubby jeans with his shirt hanging out who are you i thought it was a mate of mine he said with a leer im off out but seeing as youre here how about coming with us for a drink michelle showed her warrant card and dc collins followed suit the mans expression became wary mr wayman michelle said and what if it is wed like a word sir mind if we come in like i said im just on my way out cant we talk down the pub he licked his lips and nodded toward the pub at the bottom of the street the lord nelson then he looked at collins and you can leave your chaperon behind itd be better here sir michelle insisted when wayman made no move she walked past him into the house he stood and looked at her for a moment then followed her into his living room dc collins right behind him the place was a tip to put it mildly empty beer cans littered the floor along with overflowing ashtrays the heavy curtains were closed allowing just enough light to illuminate the mess the medley of smells was hard to define accumulated dust stale beer and smoke with overtones of used socks and sweat but there was more something vaguely sexual that turned michelles stomach she flung the curtains open and opened the window the latter took a bit of doing as it hadnt been open in a long time and had jammed dc collins lent a hand and the two of them finally got it open the still humid air outside didnt help much and the room looked even worse in full light what are you doing wayman protested i value my privacy i dont want the whole fucking estate looking through my window we value our health mr wayman michelle said its already at risk just by being here but a little fresh air might help sarky bitch said wayman sitting down on a worn and stained sofa get to the point then love he picked up a can of beer from the table and ripped the tab foam spilled over the top and he licked it off before it fell to the floor michelle looked around and saw no surface she felt comfortable sitting on so she stood by the window first off dont call me love she said and second youre in a bit of trouble des whats new you lot are always trying to set me up this isnt a setup said michelle aware of dc collins paying careful attention to her she hadnt explained much to him in the car all she had said was not to take notes he hadnt a clue what this was all about or how it linked to the graham marshall case its cut and dried wayman folded his arms so tell me what im supposed to have done last night at approximately ten fiftyfive you and another man assaulted a man outside a riverside flat i did no such thing said wayman des michelle said leaning forward he saw you he picked you out of the villains album that seemed to stop him for a moment he frowned and she could almost see the wheels spinning cogs turning in his addled brain looking for a way out an explanation he must be mistaken he said his word against mine michelle laughed is that the best you can do his word against mine where were you matter of fact i was having a bevy or two in the pig and whistle anyone see you lots of people it was very busy thats not far away from where the attack took place said michelle what time did you leave dunno after closing time sure you didnt sneak out a few minutes early and then go back for last orders and waste good drinking time why would i do that thats what im trying to find out not me miss show me your hands des wayman stretched his hands out palms up turn them over wayman did as she asked whered you get that skinned knuckle i dont know said wayman must have brushed it against the wall or something and that ring youve got michelle went on sharp ill bet sharp enough to cut someone i bet therell still be traces of blood on the metal she said enough to identify as your victims wayman lit a cigarette and fell silent even with the window open the air soon became thick with smoke right said michelle im sick of pissing about dc collins lets take mr wayman down the station and organize an identity parade that should settle things once and for all collins moved forward just a minute said wayman im not going to no station ive got an appointment people are expecting me in your local i know but if you want to enjoy a nice pint this lunchtime or any lunchtime for the next little while youd better tell us what we want to know but ive already told you i didnt do anything and ive told you you were identified stop lying des do yourself a favor think about that nice thirstquenching pint sitting there on the bar at the lord nelson just waiting for you michelle paused to let the image sink in she could do with a pint herself even though she rarely drank beer the air was fast becoming unbreathable and she didnt know if she could stand it much longer she had one last card to play before she would have to take wayman in trouble is des she said the man you attacked the man who recognized you yeah what about him hes a copper hes one of us come off it youre trying it on trying to set me up no its true what was it you said earlier his word against yours whose word do you think the judge is going to believe des nobody told me told you what shut up ive got to think youve not got long assaulting a police officer thats a serious charge youll go down for a lot longer than nine months on that one wayman dropped his cigarette stub in the empty beer can tossed it on the floor and opened another one his fleshy lips were wet with foam and beer he reached for another cigarette please dont light another one of those des michelle said what do you mean surely its not got so bad a bloke cant even smoke in his own house these days when were gone you can smoke yourself silly said michelle thats if we leave without you up to you theres no smoking in the holding cells anymore wayman laughed you know he said puffing out his chest im practically one of you lot myself i dont know where you get off coming and pinning this assault on me when its police business to start with michelle felt a little shiver up her spine what are you talking about you know damn well what im talking about wayman touched the side of his pug nose i told you i was on police business undercover sometimes a little tap on the head and a few words of warning work wonders its the way they used to do things in the old days so i hear and dont tell me you dont know what im talking about your boss certainly does boss yes the big ugly bloke numero uno detective bloody superintendent ben shaw shaw michelle had been more than halfsuspecting that shaw was behind the attacks on her and banks but found herself stunned to have it confirmed wayman tilted the can and took a long swig then he wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and grinned dont look so surprised love superintendent shaw told you to do this wait a minute are you telling me youre an undercover police officer following detective superintendent shaws orders wayman shrugged perhaps sensing hed gone too far well maybe im not exactly what youd call an undercover officer but ive done your boss a little favor from time to time you know like giving him the nod where the stuff from the currys warehouse job was stashed that sort of thing so youre shaws snitch ive been happy to help out now and then hell see me all right so do us a favor and bugger off then just maybe i wont tell your boss youve been round upsetting me do you own a beige van michelle asked what i dont own a van at all dark blue corsa if you must know ever done time for burglary youve read my form did you notice anything about burglary michelle hadnt so wayman most likely wasnt responsible for the damage to her flat and the attempt on her life somehow she sensed he didnt have the subtlety to do what had been done with the dress even if his employer had told him about melissa he clearly wasnt the only villain on shaws payroll michelle sensed dc collins paying rapt attention beside her she glanced at him and he raised his eyebrows look she said wishing she could sit down her shoes were killing her but it wasnt worth catching something youre in a lot of trouble des gbh is bad enough in itself but against a copper well you dont need me to tell you for the first time wayman looked worried but i didnt know he was a copper did i do you think id have done something like that if id known who he was you must think im crazy but you did it didnt you wheres this going up to you des what do you mean michelle spread her hands i mean its up to you where it goes from here it could go to the station to the lawyers to court eventually or it could end here wayman swallowed end how i mean i dont do i have to spell it out you promise only if you tell me what i want to know it goes no further michelle looked at dc collins who looked lost no she said this bloke you and your friend assaulted last night what did shaw tell you about him that he was a smalltime villain from up north looking to get himself established on our patch and what did detective superintendent shaw ask you to do nip it in the bud can you be more specific shaw didnt want to know i mean hed just asked me to handle the situation do something about it he didnt tell me how and he didnt want to know but it usually meant violence most people understand a thump on the nose thats your understanding of the situation if you like so thats what you did yes how did you find out he was in town ive been keeping an eye out i recognized his car from when he was down here last week and how did you know where he was that evening i got a call on my mobile in the pig and whistle from who who do you think go on he said our mutual friend was drinking in a pub down the street and if an opportunity presented itself well i was to have a quiet word like but how did he never mind michelle realized that shaw must have been using his whole network of informers to keep an eye on the comings and goings in the graham marshall investigation but why to hide the truth that the great local hero jet harris was a murderer so what did you do we waited outside and followed the two of you back to the riverside flats we were a bit worried because we thought he might be going in to get his end away like no disrespect and we might not get back to the pig and whistle till theyd stopped serving so it was all sweetness and joy when he came straight down those stairs and into the street we didnt muck about and the beating was your idea like i said it gets the point across anyway we wouldnt have hurt him too much we didnt even get a chance to finish some interfering bastard walking his dog started making a lot of noise not that we couldnt have dealt with him too but the bloody dog was waking the whole street up and thats everything michelle asked scouts honor when were you ever a scout boys brigade as a matter of fact whats going to happen now remember what you promised michelle looked at dc collins whats going to happen now she said is that were going to go away and youre going to the lord nelson to drink yourself into a stupor and if you ever cross my path again ill make sure they put you somewhere thatll make the middle east look like an alcoholics paradise that clear yes mam but wayman was smiling the prospect of a drink in the present michelle thought by far outdid any fears for the future he wouldnt change do you think you can tell me what all that was about asked dc collins when they got outside michelle took a deep breath and smiled yes she said of course nat im sorry for keeping you in the dark so long but i think youll understand when you hear what i have to say and ill tell you over a pie and a pint my treat she looked around but not in the lord nelson chapter glad you could come alan said mrs marshall sticking out her blackgloved hand my my youve been in the wars banks touched his lip its nothing he said i hope youll come back to the house for drinks and sandwiches they were standing outside the chapel in the light drizzle after grahams funeral it had been tasteful enough as such things went banks thought though there was something odd about a funeral service for someone who has been dead over thirty years they had the usual readings including the twentythird psalm and grahams sister gave a short eulogy throughout which she verged on tears of course banks said shaking mrs marshalls hand then he saw michelle walking down the path under her umbrella excuse me a moment he hurried along after michelle during the service he had caught her eye once or twice and she had looked away he wanted to know what was wrong she had said earlier that she wanted to talk to him was it about last night was she having regrets did she want to tell him shed made a mistake and didnt want to see him again michelle he put his hand gently on her shoulder michelle turned to face him when she looked him in the eye she smiled and lifted the umbrella so it covered his head too shall we walk awhile fine said banks everything okay of course it is why do you ask so there was nothing wrong banks could have kicked himself hed got so used to feeling that his every move every meeting was so fragile partly because they had been like walking on eggs with annie that he was turning normal behavior into perceived slights they were police officers in public in a bloody chapel for crying out loud what did he expect her to do make doe eyes at him walk over to his pew and sit on his knee and whisper sweet nothings in his ear this morning in the station i wanted to tell you that i enjoyed last night but i could hardly say that in the cop shop could i she reached over and touched his sore lip i enjoyed it too are you coming back to the house no i dont think so i dont like that sort of thing me neither id better go though of course they walked down one of the narrow gravel paths between graves carved headstones dark with rain yews overhung the path and rain dripped from their leaves onto the umbrella tapping harder than the drizzle you said you wanted to talk to me yes michelle told him about dr wendells tentative identification of the fairbairnsykes commando knife and harriss wartime record banks whistled between his teeth and you say jet harris was a commando yes bloody hell thats a real can of worms banks shook his head its hard to believe that jet harris might have killed graham he said it just doesnt make any sense i mean what possible motive could he have had i dont know only what we speculated about yesterday that he was somehow connected with fiorino and the porn racket and graham fell foul of them even so its hard to imagine someone in harriss position doing a job like that himself and we dont really have any hard evidence its all just circumstantial anyway hes not the only candidate i remembered mrs walker you know the woman in the newsagents said something about donald bradford being in a special unit in burma i checked turns out it was a commando unit bradford too that complicates things well at least we know that bradford had some sort of involvement with pornography we dont even have any evidence that harris was bent yet said michelle only shaws behavior which brings me to our interview with des wayman what did he have to say for himself michelle told him about waymans assertion that shaw was behind last nights attack hed deny he ever said it if we challenged him and im sure shaw will deny it too but we know its true said banks that gives us an edge it was a stupid move on shaws part it means hes worried getting desperate what about the burglary at your flat the van that tried to run you down michelle shook her head wayman knows nothing about that shaw must have got someone else maybe someone a bit brighter my impression is that wayman is okay for the strongarm stuff but couldnt think his way out of a paper bag like bill marshall yes you think we should have a chat with shaw soon itd be nice to know a bit more about harris first ill call you later okay michelle turned and carried on walking down the path where are you going now banks asked she slowed turned and smiled at him youre a very nosy fellow she said and you know what happens to nosy fellows dont you then she walked on leaving banks to gape after her he could swear he saw her shoulders shaking with laughter okay liz are you going to tell us the truth now annie asked once the interview room was set up and the tapes turned on we didnt do anything wrong ryan and me liz said i have to remind you that youre entitled to a lawyer if you cant afford one well get a duty solicitor for you liz shook her head i dont need a lawyer thats like admitting i did it as you like you know we found drugs in your flat dont you there wasnt much it was only you know for ryan and me its still a crime are you going to arrest us for that depends on what you have to tell me i just want you to know that youre in trouble already you can make it better by telling me the truth or you can make it worse by continuing with your lies whats it to be liz im tired the sooner were done with this the sooner you can go home whats it to be liz nibbled at her trembling lower lip maybe it would help said annie if i told you we found traces of lukes blood under your bathroom sink liz looked at her wideeyed but we didnt kill luke honest we didnt tell me what happened convince me liz started crying annie passed her some tissues and waited till she calmed down did luke call at your flat the day he disappeared she asked after a long silence liz said yes good breathed annie now were getting somewhere but we didnt do him any harm okay well get to that what time did he arrive time i dont know early in the evening maybe sixish so he must have come straight from the market square i suppose so i dont know where hed been he was a bit upset i remember because he said some of the kids from the school had pushed him around in the square so maybe he had come straight from there what happened in the flat liz looked down at her chewed fingernails liz what was ryan there yes all the time even when luke arrived yes so that put paid to annies theory that ryan had interrupted something between liz and luke what did the three of you do liz paused then took a deep breath first we had something to eat she said it mustve been around teatime then what we just talked went through a few songs i thought you did your rehearsals in the church basement we do but ryans got an acoustic guitar we just played around with a couple of arrangements thats all and then again liz fell silent and her eyes filled with tears she rubbed the back of her hand across her face and said ryan rolled a joint luke hed like he was a virgin you know when it came to drugs i mean wed offered to share before but he always said no not that night no that night he said yes the first time it was like he you know wanted to lose his virginity i dont know why i suppose he just felt it was time what happened nothing much at first i think he was disappointed a lot of people are the first time so what did you do we smoked some more and it seemed to work it was pretty strong stuff opiated hash he got all giggly at first then he went sort of introspective so what went wrong it was when ryan put that neil byrd cd on you know that new compilation the summer that never was he did what annie could imagine what effect something like that might have on luke if he was under the influence of strong cannabis maybe it wasnt a seriously dangerous drug but it could cause paranoia in people and it intensified and exaggerated emotions annie knew shed smoked it more than once in her teenage years reining in her temper she asked how did luke react to the music he freaked he just freaked ryan was thinking it would be a neat idea to do a neil byrd song you know with luke singing i mean itd get a lot of attention didnt you realize how confused luke was about his real father didnt you know he never listened to neil byrds music yes but we thought this was a good time to try it liz protested we thought his mind was you know open to new things mellow from the dope that it was more likely hed see how beautiful his fathers work was when he was disoriented ultrasensitive annie shook her head in disbelief youre a lot more stupid than i thought you were stupid or so selfish and blinkered it amounts to much the same thing but thats not fair we didnt mean any harm fine said annie lets just say you were guilty of poor judgment and move on what happened next nothing at first it seemed as if luke was just listening to the song ryan was playing the chords along with it trying a little harmony all of a sudden luke just went crazy he knocked the guitar out of ryans hand and went over to the cd player and took the cd out and started trying to break it in two what did you do ryan struggled with him but luke was like possessed what about the blood in the end ryan just punched him that was where the blood came from luke ran into the bathroom i was just behind him to see if he was all right there wasnt much blood it was only like a nosebleed luke looked in the mirror and started going crazy again and banging the mirror with his fists i tried to calm him down but he pushed past me and left and that was it yes neither of you went after him no we figured he just wanted to be by himself a disturbed fifteenyearold having a bad drug experience oh come on liz surely you cant be that stupid well we were stoned too im not saying we were like the most rational we could be it just seemed i dont know she lowered her head and sobbed though she believed lizs story annie found it hard to dredge up any sympathy legally however any charges that could be brought against them were minor if reckless negligence could be proved then they could at a stretch be convicted of manslaughter but even though they had given luke drugs annie reminded herself she still didnt know how he had died or why do you know where he went after he left your flat annie asked no said liz between sobs we never saw him again im sorry im so sorry did you or ryan give luke any valium to calm him down perhaps liz frowned and looked at annie through her tears no we didnt do stuff like that so you never had any valium in the house no and theres nothing more you can tell me ive told you everything she looked up at annie with red eyes can i go home now im tired annie stood up and called for a uniformed officer yes she said but dont wander too far well be wanting to talk to you again when liz had been escorted away annie closed the interview room door behind her and sat down again and held her throbbing head in her hands another drink alan bankss beer glass was halffull and he had just arranged to go out drinking that evening with dave grenfell and paul major so he declined mrs marshalls offer and ate another pottedmeat sandwich instead besides the beer was a neighbors home brew and it tasted like it you know im glad we did this mrs marshall went on the service i know it probably seems silly to some people after all this time but it means a lot to me it doesnt seem silly said banks looking around the room most of the guests were family and neighbors some of whom banks recognized daves and pauls parents were there along with bankss own pachelbels canon played in the background graham would have hated it banks thought or probably not if hed lived his tastes would no doubt have changed as bankss had even so what he really wanted to listen to was ticket to ride or summer nights or mr tambourine man i think it meant a lot to all of us he said thank you mrs marshall said tearfully are you sure you wont have some more no thank you mrs marshall wandered off banks noticed bill marshall in his armchair by the fireplace a blanket over his knees despite the muggy day the windows were all open but it was still too stuffy in the house banks saw paul talking to a couple he didnt recognize probably old neighbors and dave was chatting with grahams sister joan his own parents were talking to mrs and mrs grenfell feeling the call of nature banks set his glass down on the sideboard and went upstairs when he had finished in the toilet he noticed that the door to grahams old room was open and he was surprised to see that the spacerocket wallpaper he remembered from years back was still on the walls drawn by the odd sight he wandered into the small bedroom of course everything else had changed the bed was gone along with the small glassfronted bookcase banks remembered mostly full of science fiction the only familiar object stood in a case leaning against the wall grahams guitar so they had kept it all these years certain that no one would mind banks sat down on a hardbacked chair and took the guitar out of its case graham had been so proud of it he remembered of course he had wanted an electric one a rickenbacker like the one john lennon played but he had been chuffed to death with the secondhand acoustic his parents had bought him for christmas banks remembered the fingering even after so long and strummed a c chord way out of tune he grimaced tuning it would be too much of a job for the moment he wondered if mrs marshall wanted to keep it as a memento or if she would consider selling it if she would hed be glad to buy it from her he strummed an outoftune g seventh then moved to put the guitar back in its case as he did so he thought he heard something slip around inside it gently he shook the guitar and there it was again something scraping inside curious banks loosened the strings so that he could slip his hand inside with a bit of juggling and shaking he managed to grab hold of what felt like a piece of stiff rolledup paper carefully he pulled it out noticing the dried sellotape graham had used to stick it to the inside of the guitar that made it something he had tried to hide and when banks unrolled it he saw why it was a photograph graham sprawled on a sheepskin rug in front of a large ornate fireplace arms behind him hands propping him up legs stretched out in front he was smiling at the camera in a flirtatious and knowing manner and he was absolutely stark naked michelle was lucky to find a parking spot about a hundred yards from the former mrs harriss pretentious pile of mock tudor on long road cambridge opposite the grounds of long road sixth form college it was still drizzling outside so she took the umbrella from the back of her car it hadnt been too hard to track down jet harriss exwife the biographical pamphlet told michelle that her maiden name was edith dalton and that she had been married to harris for twentythree years from to and that she was ten years his junior a few discreet inquiries around the office yielded the information that a retired civilian employee margery jenkins visited her occasionally and she was happy to give michelle the address she also told her that the former mrs harris had remarried and was now called mrs gifford michelle hoped that the nature of her inquiries didnt get back to shaw before she got the information she needed whatever that was she wasnt even sure what mrs gifford could or would tell her a slim elegantly dressed grayhaired woman answered the door and michelle introduced herself with a puzzled but interested expression mrs gifford led michelle to her large living room there was no clutter just a white threepiece suite various antique cabinets stuffed with crystal and a large sideboard against the wall mrs gifford offered nothing in the way of refreshments but sat legs crossed and lit a cigarette from a gold lighter she had a calculating look about her michelle noticed around the eyes in the eyes themselves in the strict set of her jaw and sharp angles of her cheeks she was also very wellpreserved for her seventyplus years and had a deep tan the sort she couldnt have got in england so far this summer the algarve she said as if she had noticed michelle looking got back last week my husband and i have a nice little villa there he was a doctor a plastic surgeon but hes retired now of course anyway what can i do for you its been a long time since the coppers came to call so edith dalton had landed on her feet after twentythree years of marriage to jet harris just information said michelle youve heard about the graham marshall case yes poor lad mrs gifford tapped her cigarette against the side of a glass ashtray what about him your husband was in charge of that investigation i remember did he ever talk about it tell you any of his theories john never talked about his work to me but something like that a local boy surely you must have been curious naturally but he made a point of not discussing his cases at home so he didnt have any theories not that he shared with me do you remember ben shaw ben of course he worked closely with john she smiled regan and carter they used to think of themselves the sweeney quite the lads how is ben i havent seen him for years what did you think of him her eyes narrowed as a man or as a copper both either mrs gifford flicked some ash not much if truth be told ben shaw rode on johns coattails but he wasnt half the man or a quarter the copper his notebooks covering the graham marshall case are missing mrs gifford raised a finely penciled eyebrow well things do have a habit of disappearing over time it just seems a bit of a coincidence coincidences do happen i was just wondering if you knew anything about shaw thats all like what are you asking me if ben shaw is bent is he i dont know john certainly never said anything about it and he would have known oh yes she nodded john would have known not much got by him so you never heard any rumors no i understand your husband was a commando during the war yes a real war hero john was do you know if he owned a fairbairnsykes commando knife not that i saw he didnt have any mementos he gave everything up when he was demobbed he never talked about those days much he just wanted to forget look where is all this leading michelle didnt know how to come straight out with it and ask her if her exhusband was bent but she got the impression that mrs gifford was a hard one to deceive you lived with mr harris for twentythree years she said why leave after so long mrs gifford raised her eyebrows what an odd question and a rather rude one if i may say so im sorry but mrs gifford waved her cigarette in the air yes yes youve got your job to do i know it doesnt matter now anyway i waited until the children left home its amazing how much one will put up with for the sake of the children and for appearances put up with marriage to john wasnt a bed of roses but there must have been some compensations mrs gifford frowned compensations the high life mrs gifford laughed the high life my dear we lived in that poky little semi in peterborough almost all our married life id hardly call that the high life i dont know how to say this diplomatically michelle went on then bugger diplomacy ive always been one to face things headon come on out with it but there seem to be some anomalies in the original investigation into the graham marshall disappearance things seem to have been steered in one direction away from other possibilities and and my john was the one doing the steering well he was the senior investigating officer and you want to know if he was being paid off it looks that way do you remember carlo fiorino ive heard the name a long time ago wasnt he shot in some drug war yes but before that he pretty much ran crime in the area mrs gifford laughed im sorry dear she said but the image of some sort of mafia don running crime in sleepy old peterborough is well to say the least its ridiculous he wasnt mafia wasnt even italian he was the son of a pow and a local girl even so it still sounds absurd where there are people theres crime mrs gifford and peterborough was growing fast the new town expansion theres nothing anyone likes better than a quickly expanding market people want to gamble they want sex they want to feel safe if someone supplies them with all these needs theres quite a tidy profit to be made and the jobs made all the easier if you have a senior policeman in your pocket she didnt mean it to come out so bluntly but she wanted to get mrs gifford to take her seriously so youre saying john was on the take im asking you if you noticed anything that might indicate he was receiving extra money yes well if he was i never saw any of it i can tell you that much so where did it all go wine women and song mrs gifford laughed again and stubbed out her cigarette my dear she said john was strictly an ale and whiskey man he also had a tin ear and you can forget the women ive not told anyone except my present husband this but ill tell you now john harris was queer as a threepound note another round my shout said banks ill come with you dave grenfell got up and accompanied banks to the bar for old times sake they were in the wheatsheaf where the three of them had drunk their very first pints of beer at the age of sixteen the place had been tarted up over the years and now it seemed a lot more upmarket than the shabby victorian backstreet boozer it had been all those years ago probably got the lunchtime crowd from the new business park over the road banks guessed though now early in the evening it was practically deserted over the first pint they had caught up with one another to the extent that banks knew dave as his father had said still worked as a mechanic in a garage in dorchester and was still married to ellie whereas paul was cheerfully unemployed and gay as the day is long coming hot on the heels of his hearing mrs giffords revelations about jet harris over the phone from michelle this last discovery shocked banks only because he had never spotted any signs of it back when they were kids not that he would have recognized them paul had seemed to leer over the porn just as much as the others laugh at the jokes about poofs and banks was sure he remembered him having a steady girlfriend at one point still back in people denied pretended tried to pass for straight even after legalization there was so much stigma attached to it especially on the more macho workingclass estates where they had all lived and in the police force banks wondered how hard it had been for paul to come to terms with himself and come out clearly jet harris had never been able to do so and banks was willing to bet a pound to a penny that someone had known about it and that someone had used the knowledge to advantage jet harris hadnt been bent hed been blackmailed as dave prattled on about how gobsmacked he was to find out paul had turned into an arsebandit bankss thoughts returned to the photo he had found in grahams guitar he hadnt told mr or mrs marshall hadnt told anyone except michelle over his mobile phone when he took the photo up to his room before meeting the others in the wheatsheaf what did it mean and why was it there graham must have put it there banks assumed and he did so because he wanted to hide it but why did he have it in his possession why had he posed for it who took it and where was it taken the fireplace looked distinctive enough adam banks guessed and you didnt find those just anywhere banks could begin to formulate a few answers to his questions but he didnt have enough pieces yet to make a complete pattern two things he and michelle had agreed on for certain during their phone conversation the photo was in some way connected with grahams murder and donald bradford and jet harris were involved in whatever nasty business had been going on maybe carlo fiorino and bill marshall too but there were still a few pieces missing they carried the drinks back to the table where paul sat glancing around the room remember the old jukebox he said banks nodded the wheatsheaf used to have a great jukebox for a provincial pub outside the city center he remembered and they spent almost as much money on that as they did on beer the sixties of familiar if sentimental memory was in full bloom then when they were sixteen procol harums a whiter shade of pale the flowerpot men singing lets go to san francisco the beatles magical mystery tour what do you listen to now alan dave asked banks bit of everything i suppose banks said jazz classical some of the old rock stuff you nothing much i sort of lost interest in music in the seventies when we had the kids never really got it back remember steve though the kind of stuff he used to make us listen to on sunday afternoons dylan and all that banks laughed he was ahead of his time was steve where the hell is he anyway surely he must have heard someone must have been in touch with him hadnt you heard paul said banks and dave both stared at him what shit i thought you must know im sorry steves dead banks felt a shiver up his spine the big chill it was one thing to get to an age when the generation ahead started dying off but another thing entirely to face the mortality of your own generation what happened he asked lung cancer about three years ago i only know cos his mum and dad kept in touch with mine like christmas cards that sort of thing i hadnt actually seen him for years apparently he had a couple of kids too poor sod said dave after a brief silence they raised their glasses and drank a toast to the memory of steve early dylan fan then they toasted graham again two down three to go banks looked closely at each of his old friends and saw that dave had lost most of his hair and paul was gray and had put on a lot of weight he started to feel gloomy and even the memory of michelle naked beside him failed to dispel the gloom his lip burned and his left side ached from where his assailant had kicked him he felt like getting pissed but he knew when he felt that way that it never worked no matter how much he drank he never reached the state of oblivion he aimed for even so he didnt have to watch what he drank he wasnt driving anywhere that night he had thought he might try to get in touch with michelle later depending on how the evening went but they hadnt made any firm arrangements both needed time to absorb what had happened between them banks sensed that was okay he didnt feel that she was backing off or anything no more than he was besides she had a lot to do things were moving fast banks looked at his cigarette smoldering in the ashtray and thought of steve lung cancer shit he reached forward and stubbed it out even though it was only half smoked maybe it would be his last that thought made him feel a bit better yet even that feeling was fast followed by a wave of sheer panic at how unbearable his life would be without cigarettes the coffee in the morning a pint of beer in the queens arms that late evening laphroaig out by the beck impossible well he told himself lets just take it a day at a time bankss mobile rang startling him out of his gloomy reverie sorry he said id better take it might be important he walked out into the street and sheltered from the rain under a shop awning it was getting dark and there wasnt much traffic about the road surface glistened in the lights of the occasional car and puddles reflected the blue neon sign of a video rental shop across the street alan its annie said the voice at the other end annie whats happening annie told banks about the liz palmer interview and he could sense anger and sadness in her account you think shes telling the truth pretty certain said annie the big man interviewed ryan milne at the same time and the details check out they havent been allowed to get together and concoct a story since theyve been in custody okay said banks so where does that leave us with a distraught and disoriented luke armitage wandering off into the night alone annie said the thoughtless bastards so where did he go we dont know its back to the drawing board theres just one thing yes the undigested diazepam that dr glendenning found in lukes system what about it well he didnt get it at liz and ryans flat neither of them has a prescription and we didnt find any in our search they could have got it illegally along with the cannabis and lsd then got rid of it they could have said annie but why lie about it that i cant answer whats your theory well if luke was freaking out the way it seems he was then someone might have thought it was a good idea to give him some valium to calm him down or to keep him quiet possibly what next we need to find out where he went im going to talk to lukes parents again tomorrow they might be able to help now that we know a bit more about his movements ill be talking to lauren anderson too and perhaps gavin barlow why maybe there was still something going on between luke and rose and maybe her father didnt approve enough to kill him enough to make it physical we still cant say for certain that anyone murdered luke anyway id like to know where they both were the night luke disappeared maybe it was rose he went to see fair enough said banks and dont forget that martin armitage was out and about that night too dont worry i wont whats happened with him by the way he appeared before the magistrates this afternoon hes out on bail till the preliminary hearing what about norman wells hell mend when will you be back tomorrow or the day after getting anywhere i think so and what are you up to tonight school reunion said banks walking back into the pub an approaching car seemed to be going way too fast and banks felt a momentary rush of panic he ducked into a shop doorway the car sped by him too close to the curb and splashed water from the gutter over his trouser bottoms he cursed what is it annie asked banks told her and she laughed have a good time at your school reunion she said ill tell you all about it when i see you he ended the call and returned to his seat dave and paul had been making uneasy small talk in his absence and dave seemed glad to see him come back so youre a copper said paul shaking his head when banks sat down again i still cant get over it if id had to guess id have said youd end up a teacher or a newspaper reporter or something like that but a copper banks smiled funny how things turn out very queer indeed muttered dave his voice sounded as if the beer was having an early effect paul gave him a sharp glance then tapped bankss arm hey he said youd have had to arrest me back then wouldnt you for being queer banks sensed the tension escalating and moved on to the subject hed been wanting to talk about from the start graham do either of you remember anything odd happening around the time graham disappeared he asked youre not working on the case are you asked dave eager to be given a change of subject no said banks but im interested in what happened i mean i am a copper and graham was a mate naturally im curious did you ever tell them about that bloke by the river paul asked it didnt lead anywhere banks said explaining besides i think its a lot closer to home what do you mean paul asked banks didnt want to tell them about the photograph apart from michelle he didnt want anyone to know about that if he could help it maybe he was protecting grahams memory but the idea of people seeing him like that was abhorrent to banks he also didnt want to tell them about jet harris shaw and the missing notebooks do you remember donald bradford he asked the bloke who ran the newsagents dirty don said paul sure i remember him why did you call him dirty don i dont know paul shrugged maybe he sold dirty magazines its just something my dad called him dont you remember banks didnt but he found it interesting that pauls dad had known about bradfords interest in porn had his own father known had anyone told proctor and shaw all those years ago when they came to conduct the interviews was that why the notebooks and action allocations had to disappear so that suspicion wouldnt point toward bradford next to the family donald bradford should have come under the most scrutiny but he had been virtually ignored did graham ever tell you where he got those magazines he used to show us inside the tree what magazines dave asked dont you remember paul said i do women with bloody great bazookas he shuddered gave me the willies even then i seem to remember you enjoyed them as much as the rest of us said banks do you really not remember dave maybe im blanking it out for some reason but i dont banks turned to paul did he ever tell you where he got them not that i remember why do you think it was bradford its a possibility a newsagents shop would be a pretty good outlet for things like that and graham always seemed to have money to spare he once told me he stole it from his mothers purse said dave i remember that did you believe him banks asked saw no reason not to it shocked me though that hed be so callous about it id never have dared steal from my mothers purse shed have killed me he put his hand to his mouth oops sorry about that didnt mean it to come out that way its all right said banks i very much doubt that grahams mother killed him for stealing from her purse on the other hand grahams father banks thought was another matter entirely i think there was more to it than that what paul asked i dont know i just think graham had something going with donald bradford most likely something involving porn and i think that led to his death you think bradford killed him its a possibility maybe he was helping distribute the stuff or maybe he found out about it and was blackmailing bradford i dont know all i know is that theres a connection graham blackmailing said dave now hold on a minute alan this is our mate graham were talking about the one whose funeral we just went to remember stealing a few bob from his mums purse is one thing but blackmail i dont think things were exactly as we thought they were back then said banks come again said dave he means none of you knew i was queer for a start said paul banks looked at him but we didnt did we youre right and i dont think we knew a hell of a lot about graham either mate or not he looked at dave for fucks sake dave you dont even remember the dirty magazines maybe ive got a psychological block do you at least remember the tree banks asked our den of course i do i remember lots of things just not looking at those magazines but you did said paul i remember you once saying pictures like that must have been taken at randy mandys dont you remember that randy mandys banks asked what the hells that dont tell me you dont remember either said paul exasperated obviously i dont said banks what does it mean randy mandys it was rupert mandevilles place that big house up market deeping way remember banks felt a vague recollection at the edge of his consciousness i think i remember it was just our joke thats all paul went on we thought they had all sorts of sex orgies there like that place where profumo used to go a couple of years earlier remember that christine keeler and mandy ricedavies banks remembered christine keeler and mandy ricedavies the newspapers had been full of risqué photographs and salacious confessions around the time of the profumo scandal but that was in not i remember now said dave rupert mandevilles house bloody great country mansion more like we used to think it was some sort of den of iniquity back then somewhere all sorts of naughty things went on whenever we came across something dirty we always said it must have come from randy mandys you must remember alan god knows where we got the idea from but there was this high wall and a big swimming pool in the garden and we used to imagine all the girls we fancied swimming naked there vaguely said banks who wondered if there was any truth in this it was worth checking into anyway hed talk to michelle see if she knew anything this mandeville still around wasnt he an mp or something said dave i think so paul said i remember reading about him in the papers a few years ago i think hes in the house of lords now lord randy mandy said dave and they laughed for old times sake conversation meandered on for another hour or so and at least one round of double scotches dave seemed to stick at a certain level of drunkenness one he had achieved early on and now it was paul who began to show the effects of alcohol the most and his manner became more exaggeratedly effeminate as time went on banks could sense dave getting impatient and embarrassed by the looks they were receiving from some of the other customers he was finding it harder and harder to imagine that they had all had so much in common once but then it had been a lot easier and more innocent you supported the same football team even if they werent very good you liked pop music and lusted after emma peel and marianne faithfull and that was enough it helped if you werent a swot at school and if you lived on the same estate perhaps the bonds of adolescence werent any more shallow than those of adulthood banks mused but it had sure as hell been easier to make friends back then now as he looked from one to the other paul growing more redfaced and camp dave lips tight barely able to keep his homophobia in check banks decided it was time to leave they had lived apart for over thirty years and would continue to do so without any sense of loss when banks said he had to go dave took his cue and paul said he wasnt going to sit there by himself the rain had stopped and the night smelled fresh banks wanted a cigarette but resisted as they walked the short distance back to the estate none of them said much sensing perhaps that tonight marked the end of something finally banks got to his parents door their first stop and said good night they all made vague lies about keeping in touch and then walked back to their own separate lives michelle was eating warmedup chicken casserole sipping a glass of sauvignon blanc and watching a television documentary on ocean life when her telephone rang late that evening she was irritated by the interruption but thinking it might be banks she answered it hope i didnt disturb you banks said no not at all michelle lied putting her halfeaten food aside and turning down the volume with the remote control its good to hear from you and it was look its a bit late and ive had a few drinks he said so id probably better not drop by tonight you men you take a girl to bed once and then its back to your mates and your beer i didnt say id had too much to drink banks replied in fact i think ill phone for a taxi right now michelle laughed its all right im only teasing believe me i could do with an early night besides youll only get in trouble with your mother did you find out anything from your old pals a bit banks told her about bradfords dirty don epithet and the rumors they used to hear about the mandeville house ive heard of that place recently michelle said i dont know if shaw mentioned it or if i read about it in some old file but ill check up on it tomorrow whod have thought it a house of sin in peterborough well i suppose strictly speaking its outside the city limits said banks but going by the photo i found in grahams guitar and the information you got from jet harriss exwife i think wed better look into anything even remotely linked with illicit sex around the time of grahams murder dont you thats it michelle said the connection what connection the mandeville house it was something to do with illicit sex at least it was illicit back then homosexuality there was a complaint about goingson at the mandeville house i read about it in the old logs no further action taken tomorrow might turn into a busy day then said banks all the more reason to get an early night can you stick around to help or do you have to head back up north one more day wont do any harm good why dont you come to dinner tomorrow your place yes if i can tempt you away from your mates in the boozer that is you dont have to offer dinner to do that believe it or not im quite a good cook if i put my mind to it i dont doubt it for a moment just one question yes i thought you told me you hadnt seen chinatown michelle laughed i remember saying no such thing good night and she hung up still laughing she noticed the photo of ted and melissa from the corner of her eye and felt a little surge of guilt but it soon passed and she felt that unfamiliar lightness again a buoyancy of spirit she was tired but before calling it a night she went into the kitchen pulled out a box of books and flipped through them before putting them on her shelves poetry for the most part she loved poetry including philip larkin then she hefted out a boxful of her best china and kitchenware looking around at the mostly empty cabinets she tried to choose the best place for each item chapter all the way to swainsdale hall annie worried about what she was going to say to the armitages their son had lived a good part of his life unknown to them mixed with people they didnt know and wouldnt approve of especially martin but dont all kids annie had grown up in an artists commune near st ives and some of the people she had mixed with would have made martin armitages hair stand on end even so she hadnt told her father about the wild group she took up with one summer whose idea of fun was a saturdayafternoon shoplifting expedition in town the view over swainsdale looked gloomy that morning in the low cloud and impending rain dull gradations of gray and green even the patches of yellow rapeseed on the far hillsides looked jaundiced as annie rang the doorbell she felt a surge of anxiety at the thought of seeing martin armitage again it was foolish she knew he wasnt going to assault her not in front of his wife but she still had an aching jaw two loose teeth and an upcoming dentists appointment by which to remember their last meeting josie opened the door and the dog sniffed annies crotch as she walked in josie collared it and took it away only robin armitage sat on the large living room sofa in jeans and a navyblue top flipping through a copy of vogue annie breathed a sigh of relief maybe martin was out shed have to talk to him but a little procrastination wouldnt do any harm robin wore no makeup and seemed to have grown older since lukes death she looked as if a strong gust of wind would blow her away she stood up when annie entered gave her a thin smile and bade her sit down she asked josie to bring in some coffee is your husband not home annie asked hes in his study ill ask josie to send for him when she brings the coffee are you making any progress some said annie thats why i wanted to talk to you both again ask you a few questions are you all right your mouth still looks bruised annie put her hand up to her jaw im fine im really sorry for what happened i know martin is absolutely guiltstricken she managed a weak smile itll take him all his courage to come down and face you again no hard feelings annie said which wasnt exactly the truth but there was no point taking it out on robin josie came in with the coffee and digestive biscuits on a tray and robin asked her to call mr armitage down when he walked into the living room a couple of minutes later annie felt a wave of panic it passed but it left her heart pounding and her mouth dry this was ridiculous she told herself but her body couldnt help but respond that way to whatever aura of violence martin armitage emanated it just seemed closer to the surface in him than in most people naturally he was contrite and embarrassed please accept my apologies he said i dont know what came over me ive never laid a finger on a woman before robin patted his knee its all right said annie eager to move on of course if there are any medical expenses dont worry about it hows mr wells annie had talked with the hospital and discovered that while norman wellss physical injuries were healing well the psychological damage went a lot deeper he seemed they said to be suffering from depression he couldnt sleep but he didnt want to get out of bed had no interest in food and seemed unconcerned about his future hardly surprising annie thought given what the poor sod had been through over the past week or so and now the newspapers had got hold of the story thered be no more bookshop for wells once everyone knew what he had been accused of nobody would go down there or if they did it would only be to cause damage norman wells would become a pariah hell be fine annie said actually i have a few more questions for the both of you i cant imagine what more we can tell you said robin but please go ahead first of all do either you or your husband have a prescription for valium or any other form of diazepam robin frowned martin doesnt but i do nerves have you noticed any missing lately no would you of course robin reached for her handbag on the sofa beside her and took out a small plastic container here they are she said look almost full why do you ask annie looked then dunked her digestive biscuit in her coffee though she had to eat it carefully avoiding the loose teeth it tasted good and it gave her a moment to phrase her response to avoid using images that might upset robin its just that the pathologist found traces in lukes system she said it sounded better than stomach contents we were wondering where he got it from luke valium certainly not from us and i assume he didnt have a prescription of his own martin and robin looked at each other frowning of course not said robin someone else must have given him it is that what killed him martin armitage asked no said annie its just another complication id like to get out of the way thats all im sorry we cant help you said robin annie struggled to phrase her next question too talking to these two was like walking on eggs but it had to be done mrs armitage robin you know luke was confused about his biological father dont you neil well yes i suppose but i mean luke never knew him surely you knew he must have wondered what happened why his father didnt want him it wasnt like that neil just couldnt cope he was a child himself in so many ways and a drug addict neil wasnt an addict he used drugs but they were just a sort of tool for him a means to an end annie didnt bother arguing that that was what they were for most people it would be easier if she took neil byrds exalted artistic status in her stride especially when talking to robin but you knew luke couldnt listen to his music didnt you i never asked him to i dont listen to it myself anymore well he couldnt annie said any reference to neil byrd or his music upset him did he ever talk to either of you about any friends of his called liz and ryan not to me no said robin martin martin armitage shook his head he was in a band with them didnt you know no said robin he didnt tell us why would he keep it from you robin paused and looked at her husband who shifted in his seat and spoke probably because wed already had arguments about that sort of thing what sort of thing i thought luke was devoting far too much of his time to poetry and music and that he ought to get more involved in team sports get more exercise he was starting to look pastyfaced from spending all his time indoors how did he react to this martin looked at robin then back at annie not well we had a bit of an argument about it he insisted he was the best judge of how to spend his time why didnt you tell me any of this earlier because it didnt seem relevant it still doesnt martin sat forward and stared at her with that intense disconcerting look of his someone kidnapped luke and murdered him and all you can do is ask questions about neil byrd and my relationship with luke i think im the best judge of what questions i should be asking mr armitage said annie aware of her heart pounding again surely they could all hear it did you agree with your husband she asked robin sort of but i didnt want to stand in the way of lukes creative development if id known about the band i would have been concerned i wouldnt have wanted him getting into that kind of life believe me ive seen it at first hand ive been there so you wouldnt have been thrilled either if youd known that luke was playing in a group no was drug use a concern we warned him about drugs of course and he swore he didnt take them he didnt annie said at least not until the day he disappeared robins eyes widened what are you saying you know how he died no no we dont know that yet all we know is that he was with two friends that he took some drugs and they played him his fathers music luke got upset and left we still dont know where he went after that robin put her coffee cup down in the saucer some of the coffee spilled she didnt notice i cant believe it she said who are these people martin butted in and what will you do if i tell you mr armitage annie said go and beat them up armitages chin jutted out as he spoke its no less than they deserve if what you say is true giving my son drugs mr armitage annie said what did you do when you went out for two hours the night luke disappeared i told you i just drove around looking for him drove where eastvale any particular areas or streets i dont remember i just drove around why is it important annies chest felt tight but she forged ahead did you find him of course i didnt what are you talking about if id found him hed be here safe and sound right now wouldnt he ive seen a demonstration of your temper mr armitage there it was out i also know from talking to several people that you and your stepson didnt get along very well what are you suggesting armitages tone chilled annie but it was too late to stop now that if anything happened that evening some sort of accident then its better to tell me now than have me find out by some other means accident let me get this straight are you asking me if i found luke picked him up in my car then lost my temper and killed him im asking you if you did see him that night yes and if anything happened between you that i should know about armitage shook his head you really are a piece of work di cabbot first you act rashly and probably cause my sons death then you accuse me of killing him for your information i did exactly what i told you i drove around eastvale looking for luke it was probably pointless i know but i had to do something i needed to act i couldnt just sit around and wait i didnt find him all right fine said annie and i resent your accusation i havent accused you of anything martin armitage stood up it shows how little progress youve made scraping the bottom of the barrel like this will that be all im going back to my study now annie felt relieved when armitage had left the room that was cruel said robin martin loved luke like his own son did his best for the boy even if they didnt always agree luke was no angel you know he could be difficult im sure he could said annie all teenagers can and im sorry i had to ask those questions police work can be uncomfortable at times but the solution often lies close to home and wed be derelict in our duty if we didnt pursue such lines of inquiry did you know that luke had a girlfriend certainly not he never said anything to you i dont even believe he had a girlfriend everyone says he was mature for his age and he was a goodlooking boy too why shouldnt he he just never it might have been someone he didnt feel he could bring home to meet his parents maybe even liz palmer the girl in the group you think thats why he was killed because of this girl we dont know its just one possibility weve been looking at what about lauren anderson miss anderson but she was his english teacher you cant think i dont know its not as if these things dont happen rose barlow rose the head teachers daughter well she came round to the house once but it was all perfectly innocent rose barlow came to your house why didnt you tell me but it was ages ago february march around that time yes how do you know because somebody else noticed luke and rose were spending time together then thought maybe they were going out together i dont think so said robin it was something to do with a school project did she visit often only the once and she never came back no did luke ever talk about her except to say that hed ended up doing most of the project himself no look i dont understand all this all your questions dont you think he just wandered off and someone kidnapped him no said annie i dont think thats what happened at all then what annie stood up to leave give me a little more time she said im getting there michelle had made three important discoveries before lunch that day and it seemed a nice goal to set oneself who was it she tried to remember who had made it a point to believe six impossible things before breakfast was it alice in through the looking glass well the things michelle had discovered were far from impossible first she had gone back to the log book for the summer of and found the reference to the mandeville house on the first of august that year an anonymous informant had telephoned the station with allegations of underage sex and homosexuality the possibility of drugtaking was also mentioned a young dc called geoff talbot had gone out to make inquiries and had arrested two men he said he found naked together in a bedroom there after that nothing more appeared on the case except a note that all charges were dropped and an official apology issued to mr rupert mandeville who she discovered from an internet search had served as a conservative member of parliament from to and was granted a life peerage in it took michelle a bit longer to track geoff talbot down as he had left the police force in to work as a consultant with a television company eventually through a patient personnel officer she managed to find his address in barnet a north london suburb she had rung him and he had agreed to talk to her after that michelle had enlisted dc collinss aid and discovered through local land registry records that donald bradfords shop had been owned by a company linked to carlo fiorino the late but unlamented local crime kingpin the company had also owned le phonographe discotheque and several other newsagents shops in the peterborough area ownership of bradfords shop went to the walkers when he sold but many of the other shops remained under fiorinos control well through the new town expansion into the seventies what it all meant michelle wasnt too sure but it looked very much as if carlo fiorino had set up the perfect retail distribution chain for his wholesale porn business and who knew what else besides drugs perhaps and maybe even some of those advertising cards in the newsagents windows werent quite so innocent after all all this she told to banks as she drove through a steady drizzle down the a to barnet as they talked she kept a keen eye on her rearview mirror a gray passat seemed to stay on their tail a bit too long and too close for comfort but it finally turned off at welwyn garden city bradford must have got graham involved somehow through the magazines said banks but it didnt stop there he must have come to the attention of fiorino and mandeville too it helps to explain where all that extra money came from look i know he was your friend alan but you have to admit that it looks as if he was up to some unsavory stuff as if he got greedy i admit it said banks the photo must have been grahams insurance evidence he could use it to blackmail bradford into paying him more money only he didnt know what hed got himself into word got back to fiorino and he signed grahams death warrant and who carried it out bradford most likely he didnt have an alibi or harris i mean we cant rule him out completely despite what his exwife told you he could have kept the commando knife and if he was being threatened with exposure as a homosexual he might have been driven to kill remember it wouldnt only have meant his career back then but jail and you know how long coppers survive behind bars jet harris searched graham marshalls house personally just after the boy disappeared said michelle harris did that searched the house how do you know mrs marshall mentioned it the first time i went to talk to her i didnt think anything of it at the time but now a superintendent conducting a routine search he must have been after the photo then why didnt he find it he obviously didnt look hard enough did he said banks adolescents are naturally very secretive sometimes by necessity they have an uncanny knack for hiding things and at the time if that photo had been securely sellotaped to the inside of grahams guitar nobody could know it was there without taking the guitar apart it was only because the adhesive had dried out and the sellotape had stiffened over the years that the photo broke free and i found it i suppose so michelle said but does that make harris a murderer i dont know its not proof but he was in it deep i also rang ray scholes this morning michelle said remember the detective who investigated donald bradfords murder i remember it turns out there was a fairbairnsykes knife among bradfords possessions what happened to it forget it its long gone sold to a dealer who knows how many times its changed hands since then pity but at least we know it was in his possession when he died you said the photo was evidence michelle said but what of how well there might have been fingerprints on it but i think it was more dangerous because people would have known where it was taken i doubt there are that many adam fireplaces around and probably none quite as distinctive as that one the rug too youre thinking of the mandeville house sounds a likely place to me im certain it was all connected fiorinos porn business his escort agency the mandeville parties grahams murder i think this is where we turn off michelle kept going the junctions coming up banks said here move over or youll miss it now michelle waited and made a lastminute lane change horns blared as she sped across two lanes of traffic to the offramp jesus christ said banks you could have got us killed michelle flashed him a quick grin oh dont be such a pussycat i knew what i was doing this way we can be certain no ones following us where now when his heart rate slowed banks picked up the street guide and directed michelle to the pleasant suburban semi where exdc geoff talbot enjoyed his retirement talbot answered the door and asked them in michelle introduced herself and banks miserable day isnt it talbot said one wonders if summer will ever arrive too true said banks coffee tea a cup of tea would be nice michelle said banks agreed michelle and banks followed talbot into the kitchen which turned out to be a bright highceilinged room with a central island surrounded by tall stools we can talk here if its all right with you talbot said my wife keeps pestering me for a conservatory but i dont see the need on a nice day we can always sit outside michelle looked out of the window and saw the wellmanicured lawn and neat flower beds someone in the family was obviously a keen gardener a copper beech provided some shade it would indeed have been nice to sit outside but not in the rain you didnt give me much of an idea what you wanted to talk about over the telephone talbot said looking over his shoulder as he dropped a couple of tea bags into the pot thats because its still a bit vague michelle said hows your memory she and banks had agreed that as it was her case and he had no official capacity she would do most of the questioning not so bad for an old man talbot didnt look that old michelle thought he was carrying a few pounds too many and his hair was almost white but other than that his face was remarkably unlined and his movements smooth and fluid remember when you served on the cambridge constabulary she asked of course midsixties thatd be peterborough it was called the midanglia constabulary back then why do you remember a case involving rupert mandeville do i how could i forget thats the reason i left cambridgeshire if it comes right down to it its the reason i left the force not long after too could you tell us what happened the kettle boiled and talbot filled the pot with boiling water then carried it on a tray along with three cups and saucers to the island nothing happened he said that was the problem i was told to lay off by whom the super detective superintendent harris jet harris thats the one oh it was all aboveboard not enough evidence my word against theirs anonymous informant that sort of thing you couldnt fault his arguments then what talbot paused it just didnt feel right thats all i cant put it any other way than that thered been rumors for some time about things going on at the mandeville house procurement underage boys that sort of thing it was the start of what they called the permissive society after all ever heard of carlo fiorino we have said michelle talbot poured the tea rumor has it he was the supplier anyway the problem was rupert mandeville was too wellconnected and some of the people who attended his parties were in the government or in other highlevel positions real profumo stuff of course i was the naive young copper fresh from probation proud to be in cid thinking he could take on the world not a care had i for rank or sway we were all equal in the eyes of god as far as i was concerned though i wasnt a religious man well i soon learned the error of my ways had my eyes opened for me when the super found out id been out there and caused a fuss he had me in his office and told me in no uncertain terms that mandeville was offlimits did he say why michelle asked he didnt need to its not difficult to add up an operation like that and one like fiorinos would need police protection banks said and harris was it or part of it exactly said talbot oh he was clever though he never admitted it in so many words and he got me transferred out of the county before my feet even touched the ground cumbria i ask you well i ran into one or two nice little gentlemans agreements between local villains and constabulary up there too so i called it a day i mean im no saint but it just seemed to me that no matter where i went i found corruption i couldnt fight it not from my position so i resigned from the force best move i ever made and you told no one of your suspicions about harris michelle asked what was the point whod believe me jet harris was practically a god around the place even then besides there were implied threats of what might happen to me if i didnt do as he said and some of them were quite physical im not a coward but im no fool either i cut my losses was anyone else involved might have been said talbot the chief constable himself might have been a regular at mandevilles parties for all i know but no one you knew of no i didnt even know about harris like i said it just felt wrong i just guessed from his attitude his wording it was only him and me in his office even by the time i got outside i was thinking id been reading too much into it what happened that day from the start yes it was a warm sunday morning end of july or beginning of august it was the first of august michelle said right anyway i was by myself not much on i remember when the phone call came and the switchboard patched it through to the office do you remember anything about the voice talbot frowned its so long ago i dont man woman it was a womans voice i remember that much did she sound upset yes thats why i headed out there so impulsively she said thered been a party going on since the previous night and she was convinced that some of the girls and boys were underage and people were taking drugs she sounded frightened she hung up very abruptly too so you went yes i logged the details and drove out there like a knight in shining armor if id had half the sense i have now id at least have taken the time to organize a small raiding party but i didnt god knows what i thought i was going to do when i got there did you meet the woman whod phoned not that i know of i mean if she was there she never came forward and admitted she was the one who phoned but then she wouldnt would she who opened the door a young man he just opened it glanced at my identification and wandered off he didnt seem interested at all i thought he was on drugs but i must admit i didnt know much about them at the time im not even sure we had a drugs squad back then what did you find inside it was more like the aftermath of a party really some people were sleeping on sofas a couple on the floor how many hard to say maybe twenty or so what kind of people a mix young and old businessmen mods one or two of the girls looked like swinging london types miniskirts and what have you there was a funny smell too i remember at the time i didnt know what it was but i smelled it again later marijuana what did you do to be honest i felt a bit out of my depth he laughed like mr jones in that bob dylan song i didnt really know what was happening i wasnt even sure if any of it was illegal i mean the girls and the men didnt look underage to me but what did i know i talked to a few people took names a couple of the girls id seen before at le phonographe i think they also worked for fiorinos escort agency you used your notebook yes what happened to it same as usual i suppose you also found two men together yes i looked in some of the rooms and in one bedroom i saw two men in bed together naked were they doing anything not when i opened the door they were just very close together id never seen anything like that before i mean i knew about homosexuality i wasnt that naive but id never actually seen it did either of them look underage no one i pegged at early twenties the other older maybe forty but it didnt matter how old you were back then so what did you do i er i arrested them did they resist no they just laughed put their clothes on and went back to the station with me what happened then jet harris was waiting for me he was furious he was at the station waiting for you on a sunday morning yes i suppose someone from mandevilles house must have phoned him probably dragged him out of church banks said what did he do michelle asked he had a private talk with the two men let them go and had his little chat with me that was the end of it no further action just out of interest michelle asked how old was rupert mandeville at the time quite young in his thirties his parents had been killed in a plane crash not too long before i remember and hed inherited a fortune even after tax i suppose he was just doing what many young people would have done if theyd gained their freedom and had unlimited funds ever hear of donald bradford michelle asked the name doesnt ring a bell bill marshall he was one of fiorinos muscle men i ran into him a couple of times in le phonographe tough character thick as the proverbial pig shit thank you mr talbot youre welcome look i cant see as ive been any help but banks placed the photograph of graham marshall in front of him do you recognize that boy talbot paled my god isnt that the boy who his photograph was in the papers only a few weeks ago did you see him at the mandeville house no i but thats the room mandevilles living room i remember the sheepskin rug and the fireplace does that mean what i think it means that the boys death is somehow connected with mandeville and harris somehow said michelle were just not quite sure how yet talbot tapped the photo if wed had something like that back then wed have had some evidence he said possibly said banks if it ever saw the light of day they stood up and talbot showed them to the door you know he said i felt at the time that there was more going on than met the eye ive always wondered what would have happened if id pushed it a bit harder not let go too easily youd have probably ended up under a field with graham marshall said banks bye mr talbot and thank you gavin barlow was in his study when annie called and he invited her to sit with him there while they talked it was a light airy room with plenty of space and the bookcases didnt feel as overwhelming as the ones in gristhorpes office barlow pushed his laptop aside on his desk and smiled it might be summer holidays for most he said but some of us still have work to do i wont take up much of your time annie said its about your daughter rose im afraid shes out perhaps you can answer my questions then ill try but look if rose is in any sort of trouble what i dont know maybe i should call my solicitor or something why would you want to do that just tell me what youve come to say your daughter came to the station and made some pretty serious allegations about lauren anderson and luke armitage she did what and now it turns out that she was seeing luke earlier this year she even visited him at swainsdale hall on at least one occasion do you know anything about that of course it was a school project the students were asked to partner up on to promote working together tasksharing rose worked with luke her choice or his i dont know i should imagine the teacher assigned them lauren anderson no actually it was a science project it would have been mr sawyer do you know if luke and rose had any sort of romantic involvement not as far as i know look ms cabbot im not so naive as to think that teenagers their age dont form liaisons ive been a head teacher too long to think otherwise ive even come across my share of teenage pregnancies but i also know my own daughter and believe me i would have known if shed been seeing luke armitage they were seen talking together in and around the school did she ever talk to you about luke she might have mentioned him once or twice yes it was only natural i mean they were in the same class he was a little odd and something of a minor celebrity at least his parents are was she obsessed with him dont be ridiculous would you have approved if they had been going out together barlow pursed his lips i cant say that i would no why not shes my daughter for crying out loud you dont think id have wanted her going out with that that what mr barlow i was going to say that boy oh were you yes but ill admit that as a father i thought luke armitage just a little too weird for my daughter how far would you have gone to stop them going out together now hold on a minute i wont have you where were you and rose the night luke disappeared thats a week ago last monday in case you dont remember here both of you as far as i know my wife will remember why would rose want to make trouble for ms anderson i dont know how well does your daughter do at english its not her best subject or her favorite was she jealous of what of the attention luke got from lauren anderson why dont you ask lauren i will but im asking you first and im telling you i dont know they stared at each other and annie tried to weigh up whether he was telling the truth or not she decided he was holding something back what is it mr barlow she asked if its nothing to do with lukes death it will go no further than these walls i promise barlow sighed and stared out of the window the clouds had split in places and shafts of light lanced the distant hills the laptop hummed on his desk mr barlow he turned back to face her and his facade of benevolent authority had disappeared in its place was the look of a man with a burden he stared at her a long time before speaking it was nothing he said finally his voice little more than a whisper really nothing then tell me ms anderson lauren if youve seen her you must have noticed shes an attractive woman quite the preraphaelite beauty barlow said im only as human as the next man but everyone expects me to be above reproach youre a head teacher said annie youre supposed to be responsible what happened did you have an affair did rose find out oh good lord no nothing like that i might have flirted a bit as one does but lauren wasnt interested in me she made that quite clear annie frowned then i dont understand a thin smile twisted his lips dont you sometimes things can seem other than they are and any attempt to explain them away only makes you seem more guilty can you elaborate on that lauren came to see me in my office shortly after christmas a family problem her father had been diagnosed with alzheimers and she was upset needed some time off i put an arm around her just to comfort her you understand and rose chose that moment to come barging in with some family matter its one of the disadvantages of being the head of the school your daughter attends rose was usually pretty good about observing the boundaries but on this occasion well she misread the situation and went running off i see said annie did she tell your wife no no thank god i managed to talk to her im not sure she quite believed in my innocence but she agreed not to say anything and thats the root of her animosity toward lauren anderson i should imagine so maybe she had a crush on luke armitage too at one time but believe me id have known if there was more to it than that are you sure theres nothing else not that i can think of you were attracted to lauren though werent you what did you call her a preraphaelite beauty yes as i said im only human and she is a very attractive woman you cant arrest a man for his thoughts at least not yet the damn thing is id done nothing wrong but because i wanted it i felt as guilty as if i had anyway he gave a bitter laugh funny isnt it yes said annie very funny but her thoughts were elsewhere barlow might not have given her the answers she was hoping for but he had certainly given her plenty to think about well if it isnt our two lovebirds said ben shaw opening the door to banks and michelle what the fuck do you two want a few words said banks and why should i want a few words with you des wayman said michelle shaw squinted at her then shut the door slid off the chain and opened it walking away from them leaving banks to shut the door behind them and follow the house was far neater than banks had expected he had pegged shaw as an alcoholic living alone and that usually meant chaos at least shaw probably hired a cleaning lady and his personal habits seemed tidy enough the only booze in sight was a halfempty bottle of bells on the living room table a full glass beside it shaw sat down and took a slug without offering his guests anything well banks thought why should he griegs peer gynt suite was playing on the radio another surprise for banks he wouldnt have guessed shaw to be a man of classical tastes or maybe it didnt matter what was on as long as there was sound so what porkies has mr wayman been telling today stop pissing around said banks you told wayman and a mate to work me over and get me out of the picture it backfired if he told you that hes lying he told me sir said michelle and with all due respect i think he was telling the truth all due respect you dont know the meaning of the term shaw lit a cigarette and banks felt a wave of pure need surge inside him he was already feeling lightheaded and edgy from not smoking but this this was ten times worse than hed imagined he took a grip waymans nothing but criminal scum shaw went on and youd take his word over mine thats neither here nor there banks went on di hart has done a bit of digging into your regan and carter days with jet harris and we were just wondering how much the two of you took in from carlo fiorino you bastard shaw lurched forward to grab bankss lapel but he was already a bit unsteady with drink and banks pushed him back down into his chair he paled and a grimace of pain passed over his face what is it asked banks fuck you shaw coughed and reached for more whiskey john harris was worth ten of you youre not worth the piss stains on his underwear come off it shaw the two of you were as bent as the day is long he might have had a good excuse for it but you you couldnt remove every scrap of evidence from the archives all your arrests were for burglary assault fraud and the occasional domestic murder doesnt that tell you something what smartarse that all the time carlo fiorino was running prostitution escort agencies illegal gambling protection porn and drugs with absolute impunity sure you had him or one of his henchmen brought in once or twice for questioning just for the sake of appearances but guess what either the evidence disappeared or witnesses changed their statements shaw said nothing just sipped more whiskey fiorino fed you his opposition banks went on he had eyes and ears out on the street he knew what jobs were going down smallfry or competition either way it made you look good and deflected attention from his own operations which included supplying rupert mandeville with as many bodies as he wanted for his parties male and female shaw slammed the tumbler down on the table so hard the whiskey slopped over the side all right he said you want the truth ill tell you im not stupid i worked with john for too many years not to have my suspicions but know what i never took a fucking penny in my life and maybe i blinkered myself maybe i even protected him but we did our jobs we brought down the bad guys i loved the man he taught me everything he even saved my life once he had charisma did john he was the kind of bloke everybody noticed when he walked in the room hes a fucking hero around these parts or hadnt you noticed and thats why youve been doing everything in your power to scupper di harts investigation into graham marshalls murder to protect your old pals memory to protect jet harriss reputation to do that you get someone to break into her flat try to run her down have me beaten up what the fuck are you talking about you know what im talking about he looked at michelle then back at banks a puzzled expression on his face i certainly never had anyone intimidate di hart in any way i wasnt worried about her it was you i was worried about whys that youre the loose cannon it was you i needed to keep an eye on it was different for you personal you knew the victim i could tell the first time i saw you that you werent going to let go he shook his head and looked at michelle again no he said if anyone had a go at you di hart it wasnt down to me banks and michelle exchanged glances then banks moved on are you asking us to believe that you worked with harris all those years and you hadnt a clue what he was up to im saying i had my suspicions but i buried them for the sake of the force for johns sake listen squash a bug like fiorino and another one takes his place you can no more stop prostitution porn and drugs than you can stop sex and drinking theyre always going to be there policing was different then sometimes you had to rub shoulders with some pretty nasty bedfellows to do the job and what about graham marshall shaw looked surprised what about him did you know what really happened to him have you been covering that up all these years too i dont know what the fuck youre talking about shaws voice was little more than a whisper now well let me tell you a story said banks we cant prove it but this is what di hart and i believe happened donald bradford most likely killed graham he owned the kind of knife that was used and graham trusted him all bradford had to do was drive down wilmer road around the time graham would be heading for the other side and tell him something else had come up to get in the car thats why he took his bag of newspapers with him he thought he would be going back to finish his round later what possible motive could bradford have thats where it gets complicated and thats where your boss comes in donald bradford distributed pornographic magazines and blue films for carlo fiorino fiorino had quite a network of newsagents working for him im surprised you didnt know about it you being a vigilant copper and all sod you banks shaw scowled and topped up his glass somehow or other banks went on graham marshall became involved in this operation maybe he found some of bradfords stock by accident showed interest i dont know but graham was a streetsmart kid he grew up around the krays and their world and his father was a smalltime muscle man and he had an eye for the main chance maybe he worked for bradford to earn extra money which he always seemed to have or maybe he blackmailed him for it either way he was involved you said yourself you cant prove any of this graham came to the attention of one of fiorinos most influential customers rupert mandeville banks went on i know he posed for some nude photos because i found one at his house whether it went any further than that i dont know but we can tie him to the mandeville house and we know what went on there underage sex drugs you name it mandeville couldnt afford to come under scrutiny he was an important person with political goals to pursue graham probably asked for more money or hed tell the police mandeville panicked especially as this came hot on the heels of geoff talbots visit he got fiorino to fix it and jet harris scuppered the murder investigation you knew that knew there was something wrong so youve been trying to erase the traces to protect harriss reputation how am i doing youre arguing against your own logic banks what would it matter if he told the police if we were all as corrupt as you make out why go so far as to kill the kid if bradford thought we could control the outcome anyway banks looked at michelle before continuing that puzzled me for a while too he said i can only conclude that he knew which police officer not to tell how do you mean graham had definitely been to the mandeville house what if he saw someone there someone who shouldnt have been there like a certain detective superintendent thats absurd john wasnt like that wasnt like what mandevilles parties catered to all tastes according to his wife john harris was homosexual we dont know if mandeville or fiorino found out and blackmailed him or if they set him up maybe thats how he took his payoffs from fiorini and mandeville in young boys or drugs it doesnt matter point is i think graham saw him there or knew he was connected in some way and made this clear to bradford too that hed go elsewhere with his story shaw turned pale john homosexual i dont believe that one of my old school friends has turned out to be gay said banks and i didnt know that either john harris had two damn good reasons for keeping it a secret it was illegal until and he was a copper even today you know how tough it is for coppers to come out were all such bloody macho tough guys that gays terrify the crap out of us bollocks this is all pure speculation not about john harris michelle said its what his exwife told me shes a lying bitch then with all due respect why would she lie she hated john sounds like she had good reason to banks said but back to graham he threatened to tell i dont know why it could have been greed but it could also have been because mandeville wanted him to do more than pose for photos id like to think that was where graham drew the line but well probably never know it also explains why he was preoccupied when we were on holiday in blackpool just before he disappeared he must have been worrying about what to do anyway graham knew hed better go farther afield than the local nick and he had the photo as evidence a photo that could incriminate rupert mandeville he compromised the whole operation mandevilles and fiorinos that was why he had to die so what happened the order went down to donald bradford to get rid of him bradford had to be at the shop by eight oclock as usual that morning that gave him an hour and a half to abduct graham kill him and dispose of the body it takes a while to dig a hole that deep so my guess is that he planned it in advance picked the spot and dug the hole either that or he had help and another of fiorinos henchmen buried the body either way with harris on the payroll bradford could at least be certain that no one was looking too closely at his lack of an alibi are you saying that john harris ordered the boys death because i dont know i dont think so id say it was fiorino or mandeville but harris had to know about it in order to misdirect the investigation and that makes him just as guilty in my book shaw closed his eyes and shook his head not john no maybe he didnt always play by the rules maybe he did turn a blind eye to one or two things but not murder not a dead kid you have to accept it banks went on its the only thing that makes sense of later events what later events the botched investigation and the missing notebooks and actions i dont know who got rid of them you harris or reg proctor but one of you did it wasnt me all ive done was discourage di hart here from digging too deeply into the past and set wayman on me you wont get me to admit to that it doesnt matter anyway said banks so harris took them himself when he left that makes sense it wasnt his finest hour and he wouldnt want the evidence hanging around for anyone to see if grahams body ever did turn up insurance cast your mind back you were there in the summer of you and reg proctor covered the estate what did you find out nobody knew anything ill bet thats not true said banks ill bet there were one or two references to dirty don in your notebooks one of my old mates remembered referring to him that way and ill bet there was a rumor or two about porn rumors maybe said shaw looking away but thats all they were how do you know shaw scowled at him exactly said banks you only know because harris told you so remember you were just a young dc back then you didnt question your superior officers if anything showed up in your interviews that pointed you in the right direction bradford fiorino mandeville then harris ignored it dismissed it as mere rumor a dead end you just skimmed the surface exactly as he wanted it thats why the action allocations are missing too harris was in charge of the investigation hed have issued the actions and wed have found out what direction they all pointed in the passing pedophile theory later made more credible by bradys and hindleys arrest and whats more important what they pointed away from the truth its still all theory said shaw yes banks admitted but you know its true weve got the photo of graham taken at mandevilles house bradfords connection with the porn business and the possible murder weapon and the missing notebooks go ahead see if it adds up any other way shaw sighed i just cant believe john would do something like that i know he gave fiorino a lot of leeway but i thought at the time that he got his reward in information fair exchange thats all i was trying to protect a bit of tit for tat all those years i knew him and i still cant fucking believe it maybe you didnt really know him at all said banks no more than i knew graham marshall shaw looked over at banks his eyes were pink and redrimmed then he looked at michelle what do you think about all this i think its true sir michelle said its the only explanation that makes sense you didnt want me to look too closely at the past because you were worried id find out something that might tarnish harriss reputation you suspected he was bent you knew he gave fiorino a wide berth in exchange for information and something about the graham marshall case bothered you you didnt want it stirring up again because you didnt know what would come to the surface what next shaw asked therell have to be a report im not going to bury this ill report my findings and any conclusions that can be drawn to the acc after that its up to him there might be media interest and johns memory michelle shrugged i dont know if it all comes out if people believe it then his reputation will take a bit of a knock the lads family itll be hard for them too but is it any better than not knowing and me maybe its time to retire banks said you must be long past due shaw snorted then coughed he lit another cigarette and reached for his drink maybe youre right his gaze went from banks to michelle and back i should have known it would mean big trouble the minute those bones were found there wasnt much you know in those notebooks it was just like what you said a hint here a lead there but there was enough said banks and lets face it you know as well as i do that in that sort of an investigation you first look close and hard at the immediate family and circle if anybody had done that theyd have found one or two points of interest some lines of inquiry that just werent followed you dig deepest close to home nobody bothered that in itself seems odd enough because john steered the investigation yes it must have been a much smaller division back then wasnt it hed have had close to absolute power over it shaw hung his head again oh nobody questioned jet harriss judgment that was for certain he looked up ive got cancer he said glancing toward michelle thats why ive been taking so much time off stomach he grimaced theres not much they can do anyway maybe retirement isnt such a bad idea he laughed enjoy my last few months gardening or stamp collecting or something peaceful like that banks didnt know what to say michelle said im sorry shaw looked at her and scowled youve no reason to be it wont make a scrap of difference to you whether i live or die come to think of it your life will be a lot easier without me even so shaw looked at banks again i wish youd never come back down here banks he said why couldnt you stay up in yorkshire and shag a few sheep you wouldnt understand oh wouldnt i dont you be too sure im as corrupt as you think i am now if youre not going to charge me or beat me up why dont the two of you just bugger off and leave me alone banks and michelle looked at each other there was nothing else to say to shaw so they left back in the car banks turned to michelle and said do you believe him about not being responsible for the burglary and the van yes i think so he seemed genuinely horrified by the idea what reason has he to lie about it now its a serious crime thats reason enough but i think youre right i dont think he was behind it he was just doing his best to protect harriss reputation then are you thinking who im thinking banks nodded rupert mandeville shall we pay him a visit you want me along michelle looked at banks and said yes i feel were getting near the end graham marshall was your friend you deserve to be there id just like to stop off at the station and check a few things out first he wont tell us anything you know michelle smiled well see about that it certainly wont do any harm to yank his chain a bit chapter it didnt take annie long to drive to harrogate and find the small terraced house off the leeds road vernon anderson answered the door and looking puzzled invited her into his spartan living room she admired the framed vermeer print over the fireplace and settled down in one of the two armchairs i see you have an eye for a good painting annie said art appreciation must run in the family said vernon though i confess im not as much of a reader as our lauren is id rather see a good film any day on the low table under the window a couple of lottery tickets rested on a newspaper open at the racing page some of the horses with red rings around their names any luck today annie asked you know what its like vernon said with an impish grin you win a little then you lose a little he sat on the sofa and crossed his legs vernon anderson didnt look much like his sister annie noted he had dark hair short tight curls receding a little at the temples and he was thickset with a muscular upper body and rather short legs with his long lashes dimples and easy charm though she imagined he would be quite successful with the opposite sex not that any of those things did much for her if there was any resemblance it was in the eyes vernons were the same pale blue as laurens he wore jeans and a tshirt advertising guinness and sandals over white socks whats all this about im looking into the kidnapping and murder of luke armitage annie said your sister was his teacher yes i know shes very upset about it did you ever meet luke me no id heard of him of course of his father anyway martin armitage thats right ive won a few bob on teams he played for over the years vernon grinned but you never met luke no did your sister tell you much about him she talked about school sometimes vernon said she might have mentioned him in what context as one of her pupils but not how exceptional he was and that she gave him private tutoring no vernons eyes narrowed where are we going here lauren said she was visiting you the day luke disappeared thatd be a week ago last monday is that true yes look ive already been through all this with the other detective the one who came by a few days ago i know said annie that was one of the locals helping us out its not always possible to get away im sorry to bother you with it but do you think you could bear to go through it again with me vernon folded his arms i suppose so if you think its necessary if you dont mind its just as i told the chap the other day we had rather too much to drink and lauren stayed over he patted the sofa its comfortable enough safer than trying to drive admirable said annie people always seemed to make nervous comments about drinking and driving when police officers were around as if that were the only crime they had time to pursue all they were interested in where were you drinking where which pub oh i see we didnt go to a pub she came here for dinner and we had wine what kind just an australian chardonnay on sale at sainsburys did your sister visit you often fairly often though i cant see what thats got to do with anything our fathers ill and mothers not coping too well we had a lot to talk about yes i know about the alzheimers im sorry to hear it vernons jaw dropped you know lauren told you its surprising the information you pick up sometimes in this job anyway i just wanted to make sure id got all the times right for the record you know youd be amazed if you knew how much of our job is just paperwork vernon smiled well as i remember she arrived at about six oclock and that was it we ate at around half past seven what did you cook venison in white wine from nigella lawson it didnt sound very appetizing to a vegetarian such as annie but to each his own she thought and no doubt there was a fair bit of wine to wash it down with a couple of bottles thats why lauren ended up staying that and the grand marnier liqueurs too you were really pushing the boat out im afraid we both got a bit upset over father lauren had paid a brief visit home at halfterm and he hadnt recognized her i know alcohol doesnt help solve problems but one does tend to reach for it in times of trouble of course said annie so you went to bed around what time me im not sure its a bit of a blur probably around midnight and your sister i dont know how late she stayed up but she did stay all night of course how do you know i remember going to the toilet once you have to go through the living room she was asleep on the sofa then what time was that i dont know i didnt look at my watch dark though but she could have been gone for a few hours and returned couldnt she id have heard her are you certain if youd had that much to drink you probably slept quite heavily dont forget we both had too much to drink did she receive any phone calls during the evening no what time did she leave about eleven oclock the following morning it must have been a bit of a rough morning for you at work after all that drink or did you take the day off im presently unemployed if its any of your business and i can handle the drink im not an alcoholic you know of course not annie paused for a moment did you ever get any hints that laurens relationship with luke might have been a bit more than the normal teacherpupil one i certainly did not she never talked about him in an affectionate way ive had quite enough of this vernon said its one thing checking up on times but quite another to suggest that my sister had some sort of affair with this boy he stood up look ive told you what you want to know now why dont you just go and leave me alone whats wrong mr anderson nothings wrong you seem a bit agitated thats all well wouldnt you feel agitated if someone came into your house and started flinging accusations around what accusations im simply trying to make certain that your sister didnt see luke armitage the night he was killed cant you see how important this is vernon if she did see him he might have told her something she might have had some idea of where he was going who he was seeing im sorry i still cant help lauren was here all night annie sighed all right then just one more thing before i leave you in peace what i understand you have a criminal record vernon reddened i wondered when that would come out look it was a long time ago i forged my bosss signature on a check im not proud of it it was a stupid thing to do okay but i was desperate i paid the price well thats all right then isnt it said annie who was thinking it was amazing what people would do when they were desperate thanks for your time mr anderson vernon said nothing just slammed the door behind her annie had noticed a bookies on the main road just around the corner from vernons street she glanced at her watch time for a quick call before it closed in her experience bookies shops were always full of smoke so she took a deep breath and went inside if this was the face of evil then it was remarkably bland banks thought as he and michelle were ushered into rupert mandevilles presence by a young man who looked more like a clerk than a butler in fact mandeville reminded banks of the old prime minister edward heath who came to lead the party in opposition in casually dressed in white cricket trousers a cream shirt open at the collar and a mauve vneck pullover he had the same slightly startled slightly befuddled look about him as heath the same silver hair and pinkish skin why was it banks wondered that every politician he had ever seen had skin like pink vinyl were they born that way the sheepskin rug was gone replaced by a carpet with a complex middle eastern design but the fireplace was the same one as in grahams photograph being in the room where the picture had been taken all those years ago made banks shiver what else had happened here had graham been involved in sex acts too with mandeville he realized that he would probably never know reconstructing the past after so long was as faulty and unreliable a process as memory itself at least they now had some idea how mandeville knew about the progress of michelles investigation even if they couldnt prove anything according to a local reporter michelle had rung from the station mandeville had spies everywhere it was how he had managed to survive so long in such a ruthless world as politics it was also rumored that he had close contacts within the police force though no names were mentioned that must have been how he knew so much about the investigation into grahams death and the threat that it was beginning to pose for him mandeville was courtesy personified pulling out a chair for michelle and offering refreshments which they refused its been many years since i had a visit from the police he said how can i help you would geoff talbots visit have been the one youre thinking about michelle asked it was still her case banks knew and he was only present because she had invited him therefore she got to ask the questions i cant say i remember the young mans name you ought at least to remember the month and year august so long ago how time flies and the reason for the visit it was a mistake an apology was offered and accepted by detective superintendent harris again i must confess i dont remember the persons name take my word for it very well look i sense a little hostility in your tone can you please either tell me why youre here or leave were here to ask you some questions relating to the graham marshall investigation oh yes that poor boy whose skeleton was uncovered some days ago tragic but i dont see how that has anything to do with me were just tying up a few loose ends thats all and im a loose end how fascinating his glaucous eyes gleamed with mockery banks took the photo from his briefcase and slid it across the table to mandeville who looked at it without expression interesting he said but again do you recognize the boy michelle asked im afraid i dont do you recognize the fireplace mandeville glanced toward his own adam fireplace and smiled at her id be a liar if i said i dont he said though i hardly imagine its the only one of its kind in existence i think its unique enough for our purposes michelle said photographs can be faked you know michelle tapped the photo are you saying this is a forgery of course unless someone has been using my house for illicit purposes in my absence lets get back to when this photo was taken in this room michelle said you were quite famous for your parties werent you mandeville shrugged i was young wealthy what else was i to do but share it around a bit maybe i was foolish too parties that catered to every taste including drugs prostitutes and underage sex partners male and female dont be absurd this boy was fourteen when that photo was taken and he was a friend of mine said banks catching mandevilles eye and holding his gaze then im sorry for your loss said mandeville but i still dont see what it has to do with me you had him killed said michelle i did what id be careful if i were you young lady going around making accusations like that or what youll have your chauffeur break into my flat again or try to run me over mandeville raised his eyebrows i was actually going to warn you about the possibility of slander i did a bit of homework before i came out here michelle said checked into the background of your employees derek janson your chauffeur served a prison sentence for burglary fifteen years ago he came to be regarded as somewhat of an expert at picking locks im sure he knows how to drive a van too i know about dereks background mandeville said its very difficult for exconvicts to get employment surely you cant fault me for doing my little bit for dereks rehabilitation i happen to trust him completely im sure you do when the investigation into graham marshalls disappearance was reopened after we found his remains and discovered that he had been murdered you did everything in your power to put me off why would i want to do that because he was using the photo to blackmail you and you asked carlo fiorino to take care of him you paid fiorino well for his various services so he obliged this is absurd you have no evidence for any of this weve got the photograph banks said as i said before photographs can be faked they can be authenticated too banks said mandeville stared at them assessing the damage finally he stood up put his hands on the table palms down and leaned forward well he said thats quite a story the two of you have concocted its a pity that none of it will stand up in court or anywhere else for that matter maybe youre right michelle said but you still have to admit that it doesnt look good some muds bound to stick im not without influence you know is that a threat i dont stoop to threats no you get someone else to do that for you what do you intend to do now whatever i can to make sure you pay for what you did for a start well have a nice chat with mr janson mandeville walked over and leaned against the fireplace smiling derek wont tell you anything you never know were not without influence either especially with excons then theres geoff talbots notebook jet harris didnt bother to remove that from the archives no reason to there was no investigation i dont know what youre talking about names said banks talbot made a note of the names of the people he talked to when he came up here im sure if we dig around a bit well find one or two people who remember the old days partygoers perhaps or club patrons mandevilles face darkened and he went back to sit at the table im warning you he said if you attempt to spread these vicious lies about me ill have your jobs but michelle was already out of the room striding toward the front door banks took the opportunity of a few seconds alone with mandeville to lean in close smile and lower his voice and if di hart so much as trips on a banana skin ill be right back here to rip out your spine and shove it down your throat your lordship he couldnt swear to it but judging by the change in mandevilles expression he thought he had got his point across it was already the evening of a long day and the shadows were lengthening when lauren anderson led annie into the booklined living room classical music was playing a violin concerto of some sort but annie didnt recognize it banks would have done she thought lauren was barefoot wearing iceblue jeans and a white sleeveless top her shoulders were pale and freckled like her face her mane of auburn hair was fastened behind her head by a leather barrette what do you want she asked have you caught them i think so but first sit down and listen to what i have to say you can correct me if im wrong about anything i dont know what you mean you will in a minute sit down lauren annie crossed her legs and leaned back in the armchair she had worked out how to approach lauren on the drive back from harrogate then made a couple of phone calls and picked up dc winsome jackman whom she had instructed to stay outside in the car for the time being she didnt expect any trouble and it would be easier for her to talk to lauren alone we know where luke was shortly before he was killed she began did he ever mention a girl called liz palmer to you no why are you sure she meant a lot to luke lauren shook her head no that cant be true i dont believe you why not lauren why cant it be true luke he didnt he wasnt like that he was devoted to art oh come off it lauren he was just a randy adolescent like any other this liz was a bit older than him and she no stop it i wont listen to this whats the problem lauren i wont have you tarnishing lukes memory tarnishing whats so wrong about a fifteenyearold boy losing his virginity to an older woman its a timehonored tradition even if it is technically having sex with a minor who cares about a few petty rules and regulations especially if its the boy whos underage and not the woman at least we know now luke got to enjoy the pleasures of sex before he died i dont know why lauren said looking into annies eyes but youre lying to me there is no liz yes there is i can introduce you no what is it lauren jealous luke meant a lot to me you know he did he was so talented it was more than that though wasnt it what do you mean you were lovers werent you lauren hesitated for a moment then said what if we were are you going to arrest me for that no im going to arrest you for murder lauren jerked upright you cant be serious im serious all right you see liz and her boyfriend live about five minutes walk away from here and luke was distraught when he left their flat i asked myself where would he go maybe it took me too long to come up with the right answer the only possible answer but that was because of the clever smokescreen you put up the kidnapping we thought we were looking for a man or someone closer to home but luke couldnt have gone home because the last bus had gone and we checked all the taxis we suspected his music teacher alastair ford too but luke couldnt have gone to his house because its so remote and he had no means of getting there that leaves you lauren luke didnt have a wide circle of friends and acquaintances also he was very upset youre the one he talked to about his emotional problems how long had you been lovers lauren lauren sighed near the end of term it just happened it was so so natural i wasnt trying to seduce him or anything like that annie could see tears clouding her eyes we were looking at some pictures preraphaelites he remarked on my resemblance to one of the models elizabeth siddal dante gabriel rosettis first wife you do look a lot like her lauren or a lot like the paintings of her a typical preraphaelite beauty as someone said you know i should have made the connection sooner annie said my fathers an artist and i do a bit of painting myself ive picked up a thing or two over the years but how could you have known we found lukes shoulder bag at the other flat too i read over his recent writings and found a lot of classical references i didnt understand one thing i did understand is that they were of a sexual nature very intimate and they stressed a kind of preraphaelite look there were also references to ophelia but i dont think it was shakespeare luke had in mind it was john everett millais he painted ophelia and used elizabeth siddal as a model she caught pneumonia lying in a tepid bath every day posing as ophelia floating down the river very romantic but what i dont understand is why why did you do it lauren why did you kill him was he going to leave you you dont understand anything i didnt kill him youve got no proof ive got an alibi talk to vernon ive already talked to vernon said annie and id trust him about as far as i could throw him your brother lied for you lauren only natural but im willing to bet that hes the one who helped you get rid of the body you couldnt have done it all by yourself and hes the one who hatched the kidnapping scheme that had all the hallmarks of an afterthought it wasnt the reason for lukes disappearance and death your brother thought hed try and cash in on it and hes smalltime enough to ask for only ten thousand besides youd probably talked about luke and told him the family wasnt quite as wealthy as people assumed hes a gambler lauren and a loser he needs the money i talked to his bookie your brothers in debt up to his eyeballs did you even know what hed done after hed helped you lauren looked down into her lap her fingers were twined together grasping so tightly all the knuckles were white she shook her head i dont believe vernon would do anything like that but you must have suspected after you heard about the kidnap demand it confused me i didnt know what was going on maybe i had my suspicions i dont know i was too upset to think about it the thing is annie went on that our sceneofcrime officers found minute traces of blood on the wall where luke was shoved over into hallam tarn minute but enough to provide a dna profile i think that profile would match you or your brother im also certain that when our men come in here and go over your place theyll find traces of lukes blood now that might not be conclusive in itself as we know luke was punched in the nose before he came here but its all starting to add up lauren lauren looked at annie her eyes redrimmed and almost unbearably sad i didnt kill him she said in a small distant voice i would never have harmed luke i loved him what happened lauren lauren reached for her cigarettes and lit one then she eyed annie sadly and began her story do you think i might have a word alone with your husband banks asked mrs marshall at her house that evening bill i dont know what he can tell you she said you know he cant talk there might be one or two little things banks looked at the invalid who judging by the hard expression in his eyes certainly knew he was being talked about can he write yes said mrs marshall but he cant hold a pencil properly he can only grasp it in his fist and scribble a few letters thatll do said banks can you get me a pad and pencil if its no trouble mrs marshall brought banks a lined pad and a pencil from the sideboard drawer come on said michelle taking her arm and leading her toward the kitchen lets go make some tea ive got a few things to tell you banks and michelle had agreed on a sanitized version of events to tell mrs marshall if the media dug too deeply and the story hit the news then she might find out more than she wanted about her sons life and death but that was for the future now maybe it was enough for michelle to tell her that donald bradford killed graham because he found out something about bradfords illegal activities when they had gone into the kitchen and closed the door banks put the pad and pencil on bill marshalls knee and settled in front of him gazing into the expressionless eyes i think you know why i want to talk to you he said bill marshall made no sign that he understood you used to spar with reggie and ronnie kray in your younger days he said then when you came up here you fell in with carlo fiorino and did a few strongarm jobs for him am i right can you nod or write something down bill marshall did nothing okay so thats how you want to play it banks said fine im not saying you had anything to do with grahams death you didnt youd never have done anything like that but you knew who did it didnt you bill marshall just stared at banks see the trouble with people like you bill is they insist on working outside the law youve no use for coppers have you never have had i shouldnt think just like my own dad want to know what i think happened well ill tell you anyway i think donald bradford just wasnt cut out to be a killer of young boys i dont think he had much choice in the matter though fiorino pushed him into it after all graham was his responsibility and graham was in a position to do a lot of serious damage there was just too much at stake not just the empire as it existed then but the future the city was expanding becoming a new town soon it would double in population what an opportunity for a man like fiorino he supplied what people always seemed to want for a good price are you with me so far marshall just glared at banks a little drool slid down his stubbly chin fiorino had no use for the law either unless it was in his pay so he used other people to do his dirty work shortly after the killing bradford sold up and moved out fiorino didnt like that didnt like people escaping his control being out of his line of sight especially if they knew as much as bradford did and were fast becoming unstable and unreliable bradford was guiltridden by what he had done also i think he took some of fiorinos goods with him though thats just a minor matter what really counted was that bradford was out of sight and untrustworthy and he knew too much marshall still showed no reaction banks could hear muffled voices from the kitchen so what does he do when he has a problem with bradford well he could pay for a hit i suppose and thats one option but he knows you thats an easier one he knows that whatever you do youll do it yourself you wont go running to the police so he tells you that bradford killed your son though not on his orders he convinces you that bradford was a pervert he also gives you bradfords address easy all he had to do next was leave the rest up to you am i right so far bill banks could tell by the anger and hatred in bill marshalls eyes that he was right you went up to carlisle didnt you probably told everyone you were looking for work then you broke into donald bradfords flat and waited for him to come home you knew bradford was a tough customer so you attacked him from behind with a cosh i dont blame you bill the man murdered your son id want to do the same to anyone who harmed either of my children but you let your wife suffer all those years you knew graham was dead and you knew who killed him maybe you didnt know where the body was but ill bet you could have found out instead you went up there and murdered bradford and said nothing to your wife or your daughter all these years theyve lived not knowing what happened to graham thats unforgivable bill banks nodded toward the pad what do you have to say about that come on tell me something marshall held his gaze for a while then grasped the pencil moved his hand with difficulty and scrawled on the pad when he had done he handed it to banks there were three words in capital letters fuck off copper he came to me like you said lauren anderson began he was in a terrible state he was upset because well you know why i tried to calm him down and we went to we just lay down on the bed together and i held him id already realized i had to end it i just hadnt been able to find the courage but i knew that it couldnt go on someone would find out eventually and that would be it my career reputation everything a fifteenyearold boy and a twentynineyearold woman taboo i thought id got him calm enough so i started talking about it you know how we should probably cool things for a while did he tell you hed been smoking cannabis earlier cannabis no he never told me that but that must be why he seemed so disoriented and excitable id never seen him like that before he scared me how did he react when you told him you wanted to finish the affair annie asked remembering that it hadnt been too long ago when she had told banks the same thing he didnt want to accept it he said he couldnt bear to lose me lauren started crying he said hed kill himself what happened next she dabbed her eyes with a tissue he stormed off to the bathroom i gave him a couple of minutes then i heard all the things falling out of the cupboard into the sink glass breaking so i went after him was the bathroom door locked no he was after the valium you know we know he took some valium shortly before he died yes i have a prescription but i suppose you know that too annie nodded i checked he had the bottle open and he poured some tablets into his hand and swallowed them i went to him and struggled with him over the bottle we fought pulling and pushing each other and then he went down just like that he was in his socks and the floor tiles can be slippery his feet just went from under him and he hit his head on the side of the bath i did what i could i tried to revive him mouth to mouth i checked for a pulse and listened for his heartbeat and then i even tried holding a mirror to his mouth but it was no use he was dead so much blood what did you do then i didnt know what to do i panicked i knew if any of it came out id be finished i didnt know where to turn so i called vernon he said hed come right away and not to do anything until he got here the rest you know what happened to lukes mobile it fell out of his pocket in the car vernon took it that explained the call to armitages mobile vernon had looked up martin armitages number on lukes phone he wasnt to know that luke would be unlikely to call his stepfather for anything he could easily have driven to eastvale to make the call and avoid suspicion it wasnt far did you know about the ransom demand lauren shook her head no id never agree to anything like that and as i said i was too upset to think about it if anything i thought it must be some sort of cruel practical joke im so sorry for what happened she reached out and grasped annies wrist youve got to believe me id never have harmed luke i loved him maybe if i hadnt been so insensitive so selfish and not tried to end it when he was so upset or just held him the way he wanted it might not have happened ive relived that moment over and over again i cant sleep i dont know how im going to go back to work nothing seems to matter anymore annie stood up what are you going to do now im going to call in my partner from the car outside and were going to make sure you know your rights before we take you to the police station to make a formal statement well also be sending a message to the harrogate police to pick up your brother whats going to happen to me i dont know lauren annie said again she was feeling shitty about doing her job harden up she told herself maybe lauren anderson didnt deliberately kill luke but she was at least partly responsible for his death along with liz palmer and ryan milne all adults who should have known better than to tamper with the feelings of a confused and disturbed fifteenyearold all of whom were selfish and used luke for their own ends even if that end at least in laurens case was love a romantic imagination and adolescent lust could be a dangerous combination but maybe annie thought if she didnt feel pity for a woman in laurens position then she would lose some of her humanity one of the things working with banks had taught her was how to do the job without becoming callous and cynical the way she had been going before she met him lauren would probably get off quite lightly annie told herself if luke had died during a struggle the object of which was to stop him from taking an overdose of valium and if lauren had not known of her brothers botched ransom demand then she wouldnt get a very stiff sentence lauren would lose her job though and like norman wells she would become a pariah for some the seductress and corrupter of youth and the family would suffer robin and martin as it was all dragged into the open because this would be a highprofile trial no doubt about it neil byrds son a famous model and a sports star not a chance of escaping the media circus it was a damn shame they couldnt prosecute liz and ryan annie thought as she walked lauren head hung low out to the car they were at least as much to blame for what happened as lauren was if not more so but it wasnt her judgment to make jet harris bent i cant believe it said arthur banks in the coach and horses early that evening banks had dragged him out there to tell him the full story and they sat over their pints in the dreary halfempty pub banks felt a craving for nicotine rush through his cells like a desperate need for air but he pushed it aside one day at a time one craving at a time it passed people said the cravings got less and less powerful as time went on but others said you were never rid of the habit he knew people who had started again after theyd been off for ten years one day at a time arthur banks stared at his son in disbelief is this going to come out he asked probably said banks we dont actually hand our reports to the press but they have their ways depends on the media interest oh therell be media interest around here all right jet harris homo and bent copper he eyed banks warily you sure youre not going to hush it up then dad said banks we dont go in for coverups at least i dont and nor does di hart this investigation has cost her a lot shes only been at the division a couple of months and here she is debunking the legend imagine how popular thats going to make her around the place it had nearly cost michelle her life too banks thought she would be safe from now on he was certain and not because of his melodramatic threat now mandeville knew there were more people involved he could hardly scare or kill off everyone he would just have to take his chances that time had hidden his secrets why are you telling me arthur banks asked banks sipped some beer dad you and mum have never really given me a chance you know ever since i joined the force youve always pointed out the negative side of the job i just wanted you to know that some of us arent crooked that some of us take our work seriously even if it never comes out in public at least youll know the truth and youll know i told you arthur banks paused for a moment looking his son in the eye then he said and did you also find out what happened to your friend graham after all these years yes well di hart did most of the work i just filled in the blanks banks leaned forward but yes dad i found out its what i do i dont go around waving rolls of fivers at striking miners i dont beat up suspects in the cells i dont botch investigations into murdered black youths and i dont steal confiscated drugs and sell them back on the street mostly i push paper sometimes i catch murderers sometimes i fail but i always do my damnedest so who did it banks told him donald bradford youd have thought that wouldve been the first place theyd look thats what made us suspect some sort of misdirection and rupert mandeville thatll make a nice headline if we can pin anything on him remember it was a long time ago and hes hardly likely to confess even so your pal graham was up to no good wasnt he why do you say that i dont know he always seemed a bit shifty to me thats all like his father well graham wasnt exactly walking the straight and narrow but thats no excuse for killing him course not banks senior fell silent for a moment contemplating his son through narrowed eyes then he let slip a thin smile youve stopped smoking havent you i wasnt going to tell anyone theres not much you can slip past your own father dad have you been listening to me all ive been trying to demonstrate to you all these years banks went on is that ive been doing a decent honest days work just like you did and jet harris local legend was a bent copper yes and youre going to expose him something like that well said arthur banks rubbing his hands together thats all right then youll be having another pint i suppose on me this time banks looked at his watch better make it a half he said ive got a date was it the age of my innocence or was it the lost land of oz was it only a foolish illusion the summer that never was did i walk through the fields with the child in my arms and the golden wheat over my head did i feel my heart breaking under the weight was my sweet sleeping boy child a burden like lead i remember him crying the day he was born and his hand like a spider that wouldnt let go and he wouldnt let go and he wouldnt let go and the pain tore my heart out and filled me with woe can a dreamer take hold of reality and become a responsible man can a killer become a lover or is he forever damned you cant follow me where im going now and you cant go the places ive been dont listen to the demons ive listened to or look into the darkness ive seen theres a field and a boy and the tall golden wheat and eternity held in a day but its so hard to hold and its so hard to reach and forever rushing away was it the age of my innocence or was it the lost land of oz was it only a foolish illusion the summer that never was banks lay in bed late that night listening to neil byrds cd on his walkman after dinner with michelle and a phone call from annie the summer that never was was the first song on the cd though the liner notes said it was the last song byrd had recorded just weeks before his suicide as banks listened to the subtle interplay of words and music all set against acoustic guitar and standup bass with flute and a violin weaving in and out like van morrisons astral weeks he felt the despair and defeat of the singer he didnt understand the song didnt know what all the tortured phrases meant only that they were tortured here was a man at the end of his tether and he was thinking of his child or of his own childhood or both banks couldnt even begin to imagine what this had meant to luke armitage when his mind disoriented with strong cannabis he had heard it for the first time in liz and ryans flat annie was right how callous could the bastards be or stupid it no doubt never even entered their addled minds what damage they might be doing all they could think of was opening up lukes mind to his fathers music to further their careers and everyone knew that drugs opened the doors of perception banks remembered the rimbaud quote written in silver on lukes black wall le poëte se fait voyant par un long immense et raisonné dérèglement de tous les sens well had luke become a seer what had he seen was he trying to kill himself with the diazepam or was he just trying to stop the pain in bankss mind luke armitage and graham marshall became one they might have died in different ways for different reasons not to mention in different times but they were just two kids lost in a grownup world where needs and emotions were bigger than theirs stronger and more complex than they could comprehend graham had tried to play the big leagues at their own game and lost while luke had tried to find love and acceptance in all the wrong places he had lost too accident though his death was according to annie it was a tragic accident made up of many acts each one of which was like a door closing behind luke as he moved toward his fate banks put the cd player on the bedside table turned over and tried to go to sleep he didnt think it would be easy the song had left him with such a feeling of desolation and loneliness that he ached with need for someone to hold and found himself wishing he had stayed at michelles after their lovemaking he almost took out his mobile and rang her but it was past two in the morning way too late besides how would she react if he showed such neediness so early in their relationship shed probably run a mile like annie and quite rightly he could hear his father snoring in the next room at least there had been a reconciliation of sorts between the two of them though arthur banks would never actually admit anything his attitude had changed since their drink together that evening banks could tell that his father had been proud of him for his success in solving grahams murder though he insisted michelle had done most of the work and for not trying to cover up jet harriss role proud for perhaps the first time in his life how strange it was to be at home in his old bed as he drifted toward sleep he imagined his mother calling him for school in the morning hurry up alan or youll be late in his dream he fastened his tie as he dashed downstairs for a quick bowl of cornflakes and a glass of milk before picking up his satchel and meeting the others out in the street but when he walked out of the door dave and paul and steve and graham all stood there waiting for him with the bat the ball and the wickets the sun shone in a bright blue sky and the air was warm and fragrant there was no school they were on holiday they were going to play cricket on the rec its summer you fool graham said and they all laughed at him the summer that never was about the author peter robinsons awardwinning novels have been named a bestbookoftheyear by publishers weekly a notable book by the new york times and a pageturneroftheweek by
